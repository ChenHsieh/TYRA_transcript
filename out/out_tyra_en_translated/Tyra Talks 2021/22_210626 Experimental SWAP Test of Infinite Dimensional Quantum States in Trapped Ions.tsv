0	7000	Thank you all for coming to today's Taira Talk.
7000	13000	Today's speaker is Zeng Kewei, who graduated from the University of Taiwan's Department of Physics.
13000	21000	After that, he did a PhD in quantum computing experiments in Singapore's CQT.
21000	43000	He wanted to do quantum computing because he won the Nobel Prize for quantum computing.
43000	50000	I remember when I won the Nobel Prize in 2012, I was wondering what was going on in this field.
50000	53000	I remember that the story really started like this.
53000	57000	My high school teacher can testify for this, not me.
57000	62000	Today, he will mainly talk about the control beam splitter technology.
62000	69000	Today's topic is Experimental Swap Test in Infinite Dimensional Quantum State.
70000	72000	Let's start with Kewei.
72000	78000	Before we start, let's turn on the microphone and give a round of applause.
84000	87000	I'll leave the time to you, Kewei.
87000	89000	No problem.
89000	92000	Can everyone see this laser pen?
92000	93000	Yes.
93000	94000	Can you see this laser pen?
94000	95000	Yes.
95000	96000	This laser dot.
96000	99000	Thank you for listening to my talk today.
99000	100000	I'm Kewei.
100000	105000	What I'm going to talk about today is the Exponential Swap Test of Infinite Dimensional Quantum System.
105000	108000	This is an experiment in quantum computing.
108000	112000	Of course, I will talk about the theoretical background of quantum computing.
112000	115000	Then talk about quantum computing as a whole.
116000	122000	I will use the infinite dimensional system, which is not a common quantum element.
122000	126000	We use the quantum vibrational mode to do this.
126000	131000	I will first talk about the general quantum computer.
131000	135000	Then talk about the quantum computer using quantum vibration.
135000	140000	If you want to do quantum computing, you have to be able to use those gates and logic to do the calculation.
140000	145000	After talking about some of the standards of quantum computing, we will talk about the pros and cons of our lab.
145000	148000	Or our killer key is that we can make control gates.
148000	154000	After talking about the theoretical part, we will talk about what we do in our lab.
154000	157000	Let me talk about this slowly.
157000	161000	The first thing is to start with the scientific part.
161000	164000	What is quantum computing?
164000	174000	If we just look at the general situation, we can say that quantum computing is not just pointing to 0 or 1.
174000	177000	It is not just pointing to the North Pole or the South Pole.
177000	182000	It can point to any place between 0 and 1, including 0 plus 1 and 0 minus 1.
182000	187000	In addition to 0 plus 1 and 0 minus 1, it can also point to 0 plus i1 or 0 minus i1.
187000	192000	It is not just a number, it can become a negative number.
192000	198000	The first concept of quantum computing is that its quantum state is a negative number.
198000	202000	Because it is now a negative number, it can be between 0 and 1.
202000	205000	This is why we often hear this addition state.
205000	209000	It's amazing to hear the addition state.
209000	211000	You see that one quantum element can have two addition states.
211000	213000	100 quantum elements will have 200 and 100 qubits.
213000	215000	This is a big number.
215000	219000	Is it because it can be obtained by parallel computing?
219000	221000	Of course not.
221000	228000	The main reason is that when you actually measure, you randomly find an answer from these addition states.
228000	235000	If you can't find the correct answer and select it, the result of your measurement is a random result.
235000	241000	You can't just get the effect of quantum computing through addition states.
241000	244000	So parallel is not enough.
245000	253000	If you hear the complex number and the superposition, if you are doing quantum computing, you will feel that it sounds very similar to the electromagnetic wave.
253000	261000	Because if you use the addition state for the Maxwell equation, if you are in a rectangular or even just using a drum today,
261000	263000	This drum can also have superposition.
263000	267000	It can have different tones.
267000	272000	It can have different tones, and the tonal mathematical structure can also be expressed in complex numbers.
273000	275000	The answer is whether you have measured this part.
275000	276000	This is the first thing.
276000	280000	If you have an electromagnetic wave in addition state today, you will not be able to measure the electromagnetic wave.
280000	284000	The electromagnetic wave suddenly says that I only have 100 Hz left.
284000	286000	The part of 200 Hz is gone.
286000	288000	This is the first feature.
288000	293000	The second feature is that quantum is not just one quantum element.
293000	294000	It's so interesting.
294000	296000	The point is that it has to be entangled.
296000	300000	It must have this entanglement between this quantum state or its connectivity.
301000	303000	Of course, we are talking about Schrodinger.
303000	304000	Let me talk a little bit.
304000	305000	But let's start with entanglement.
305000	312000	Entanglement will make the quantum state have a very strong connection, but not a cause and effect relationship.
312000	322000	Although its connection is still in the quantum space, so in the time and space, in our universe, it can be in a very far place.
322000	323000	There is a very strong connection.
323000	325000	But it can't do superlight transmission.
325000	334000	So you won't see this kind of destruction.
334000	336000	It is a correlation, not a causality.
336000	338000	This is something that needs to be emphasized.
338000	345000	So quantum computing simply relies on the parallel superposition.
345000	349000	It has to have a strong connection between these states.
349000	353000	This strong connection, you would think that it may not be a problem in a small space.
353000	357000	If there is an electron pointing up, the other electron must point down.
357000	359000	On the contrary, if it points down, the other point up.
359000	360000	There seems to be nothing.
360000	362000	It's just a very strong connection.
362000	369000	But the problem is that if you let this connection run from the small world to the big world today, it feels like a very interesting situation.
369000	371000	Let's look at the picture on the right.
371000	380000	If the first case is that your element is above or below, it may trigger a whole complex system.
380000	383000	In the end, this cat will be in a state of death and fire.
383000	385000	It is often seen in Schrödinger's cat.
385000	388000	If you look at this up, it means that if you go up, the poison gas will not be opened.
388000	390000	So the cat is smiling.
390000	392000	If it is down, the poison gas bottle will be broken.
392000	394000	This is the case of crying.
394000	406000	So if you can use some physical mechanisms to slowly extend the interesting situation of small worlds through a bunch of chain reactions to the big world.
406000	408000	You will often see this Schrödinger cat.
408000	418000	The interesting thing about Schrödinger's cat is not just that the cat can be in a state of death and fire, but that you can make the small world of quantum mechanics look very magical.
418000	423000	These strong connections can be extended to the big world step by step.
423000	426000	Because the cat does not suddenly become a death and fire.
426000	434000	It must be through a certain kind of macro situation to slowly make it in a state of entanglement with small things.
434000	437000	That's how we see this Schrödinger cat.
437000	442000	Of course, we do not see a human or a cat in a state of death and fire in the real world.
442000	444000	This is an interesting situation.
444000	454000	That is to say, when a huge object interacts with the outside world, it produces decoherence.
454000	458000	In other words, maybe overall it is still a quantum type.
458000	475000	However, if you have a big system called a cat, the exchange of information between the cat and the outside world will not be able to describe the cat in a pure state.
475000	479000	It seems to have lost the outside information, which is called decoherence.
479000	488000	This decoherence can be said to be the place where we talk about entropy in many places.
488000	496000	You can say that the interaction between the system and the outside world produces decoherence from this decoherence.
496000	499000	In fact, it is the measurement mentioned in the front page.
499000	507000	It is a special process.
507000	512000	In fact, it is just an interaction between the system and the outside world.
512000	516000	The result of the interaction is that you only have the information of this system.
516000	518000	It is no longer a pure quantum state.
518000	524000	Because it is not a pure quantum state, it will produce entropy when you describe this quantum state.
524000	531000	Some people may know that a pure quantum state has no entropy.
531000	538000	If you take the whole universe as a wave function, it will not have entropy if it is completely evolved according to quantum mechanics.
538000	540000	It will not have decoherence.
540000	544000	But we can see decoherence and entropy locally.
544000	551000	This is a place where we can talk about it in a special way.
551000	557000	The last thing I want to say is that quantum mechanics is so interesting.
557000	560000	It has entanglement and superposition.
560000	565000	Through entanglement, we can solve all the problems faster than the index.
565000	567000	Of course, it is not like this.
567000	571000	We can only solve a few problems and only solve different situations.
571000	575000	The first category is whether we can find a problem.
575000	577000	But it hides some cycle patterns.
577000	583000	As long as it is a hidden periodic function, you can use show arithmetic or a similar family.
583000	586000	The key point is that you can do this kind of entanglement conversion.
586000	589000	You can extract its cycle information.
589000	595000	So if you have a hidden cycle information,
595000	602000	Show and a similar algorithm can solve this problem faster than the index.
602000	610000	Of course, this is very important, but it is also a good definition and a definition limit.
610000	612000	It does not solve any problem.
612000	614000	If you have a hidden periodic function,
614000	625000	Of course, this is also directly related to the encryption method of the national defense industry.
625000	629000	Because we often see this kind of elliptic encryption or RSA encryption.
629000	631000	Will be directly attacked by show.
631000	634000	It should be said that show was proposed in 1995 and 1996.
634000	638000	Show arithmetic is also the reason why the whole quantum computing or quantum computer will develop rapidly.
638000	640000	You can say that 1995 was the year of quantum computing.
640000	643000	Show can solve this periodic problem.
643000	645000	Is there anyone else who can find something interesting?
645000	646000	The answer is yes.
646000	650000	So Grover said that if we want to do it today,
650000	654000	For example, if we want to search for the name of a telephone book and its phone number,
654000	657000	It has nothing to do with any hidden internal relationship.
657000	665000	If you want to search for a search without any structure,
666000	672000	You can use Grover to make your search faster.
672000	676000	The number of times you need to search will be multiplied by the number of times you need to search.
676000	679000	The interesting thing behind it is that you can actually use quantum random walk.
679000	682000	You can use this kind of random walk that you often see in traditional computing.
682000	686000	Because in general, if you add some random to this CS algorithm,
686000	688000	You will make it perform better.
688000	692000	In fact, Grover's quantum random walk is a one-sided relationship.
692000	695000	But Grover can only be faster than the number of times.
695000	697000	It can't be faster than the number of times.
697000	705000	If you have no knowledge of the problem you want to search for,
705000	708000	Grover has been proven to be quantum optimized.
708000	710000	It can't do better.
710000	712000	If you want to search for some internal structure,
712000	716000	You can use some special algorithms to do better than Grover.
716000	723000	For example, if you want to find if there is a triangle in a pile of patterns,
723000	727000	We know that a triangle needs three sides and three corners.
727000	731000	Because the pattern you are looking for today may have some internal connections.
731000	733000	It can do better than Grover.
733000	736000	But if you don't know if you want to find this data,
736000	738000	Grover can do the best.
738000	745000	These two are the algorithms produced by Shor and Grover in 1995 and 1996.
745000	747000	Is there anything interesting in the past 1, 2, 10 years?
747000	748000	The answer is yes.
748000	752000	HHL algorithm, or matrix inversion,
752000	758000	It is a big breakthrough in 2009.
758000	763000	In the early days, we thought that HHL algorithm,
763000	766000	It can be faster than the classical number of times.
766000	768000	Because it is faster than the classical number of times.
768000	770000	If you can calculate the matrix inversion faster than the number of times,
770000	773000	It means you can calculate linear regression faster than the number of times.
773000	777000	It also means that you can calculate all kinds of interesting quantum mechanics,
777000	779000	Including PCA, SVM, etc.
779000	783000	So HHL is one of the core of quantum mechanics.
783000	787000	It was originally estimated to be faster than the number of times.
787000	789000	But unfortunately, in 2019,
789000	794000	Someone proved that the classical number of times can be faster than the classical number of times.
794000	797000	If some quantum tricks are used in the classical number of times,
797000	800000	The classical number of times is wider, but the quantum equivalent is not faster than the number of times.
800000	801000	It's only ten times faster.
801000	806000	So we now say that HHL is a bit of a quantum speedup.
806000	808000	Its quantum speedup is not so high.
808000	813000	Its acceleration from the level of Shor becomes the level of Grover.
813000	816000	It's still great, it's still fast, but it's not so fancy.
816000	820000	That is to say, the quantum algorithm can only solve three problems in general.
820000	826000	Find the cycle, find the data search, and find the inverse matrix.
826000	829000	It can't solve the problem of arbitrary,
829000	830000	There is no such thing.
830000	833000	But there are currently three major categories.
833000	838000	Then this is probably the part of the background we are talking about today.
838000	841000	That is to say, if quantum is something interesting,
841000	842000	It can have additional states.
842000	844000	But one additional state is not fun.
844000	846000	It must have a bunch of entanglement.
846000	848000	Then you can see those interesting things.
848000	850000	What is the specific algorithm of entanglement?
850000	854000	You will see quantum Fourier transform, quantum random walk, and HHL.
854000	857000	This is probably the part of the background introduction.
857000	859000	Okay, then we'll find this.
859000	863000	This thing sounds very scientific, very mathematical.
863000	865000	We have to find a real physical object.
865000	869000	You can run, for example, what is 0 plus 1 or 0 minus 1.
869000	870000	This kind of quantum element.
870000	871000	We have to find one.
871000	872000	In fact, we can operate it.
872000	875000	Really let it produce entanglement.
875000	876000	Let it produce entanglement.
876000	879000	These quantum logic operations for us.
879000	880000	So we have to find a physical object.
880000	883000	Because this world is that we are not living in the field of HHL.
883000	885000	We live in the world of matter.
885000	887000	So we have to find the material to do this thing.
887000	890000	So now there are two or a few more leading.
890000	892000	There are two more famous.
892000	893000	One is to do it with a quantum well.
893000	897000	Or do it with a super-mass chip.
897000	900000	The quantum well on the left is what I did in CQT.
900000	903000	This is the experiment.
903000	906000	We are using a more primitive way of doing this.
906000	908000	So when you hear the chip ion,
908000	911000	The first thing you want to say is that you want to use one by one.
911000	914000	You use one by one of the quantum in this vacuum.
914000	915000	How do you catch the quantum?
915000	917000	Why can I do this thing?
917000	920000	Because it's not like you can clip it with pliers or something.
920000	923000	You have to think about why you can catch a quantum.
923000	926000	So the first question is that we can catch it.
926000	928000	The answer is that we can't take a quantum.
928000	930000	Hanging in a space without moving.
930000	932000	Because this violates Gauss's law.
932000	935000	If you simply operate it through the power plant,
935000	938000	It must be in a certain space.
938000	939000	This is Gauss's law.
939000	943000	So you can't let it stop at a point.
943000	945000	But linear potentiometer,
945000	948000	After you let it have an AC current,
948000	952000	It can have an average confinement time.
952000	955000	It is called Ponder Multi Potential in the professional field.
955000	960000	But we can use very simple.
960000	963000	We should do this thing by watching this video.
963000	964000	This doesn't look very good.
964000	965000	Wait a minute.
965000	966000	Okay, now you can put it.
974000	976000	So what we can see at this time is that
976000	979000	You have a quantum in a vibrating plant.
979000	981000	You can catch the quantum in a certain place without moving.
981000	982000	So the first problem is solved.
982000	984000	We know how to produce quantum.
984000	986000	After we catch a quantum,
986000	988000	Remove one of its electrons.
988000	990000	And then we go through a vibrating battery plant.
990000	992000	You can catch it in space without moving.
992000	996000	So the first two quantum can be caught.
996000	997000	There is no problem.
997000	998000	What are the advantages of quantum?
998000	1000000	What are the benefits of saying that we caught it?
1001000	1005000	The first one is that the quantum lives in a very, very high vacuum.
1005000	1007000	It's probably 10 to the 12th square.
1007000	1008000	It's not a problem.
1008000	1010000	How vacuum is it?
1010000	1012000	It's more than what we see.
1012000	1016000	The degree of vacuum is more than the track between the earth and the moon.
1016000	1018000	Low-Earth vacuum is still vacuum.
1018000	1020000	So if you look at the international space station,
1020000	1023000	The degree of vacuum outside is not as good as the vacuum in our lab.
1023000	1024000	It's still vacuum.
1024000	1027000	So this vacuum is basically
1027000	1030000	If the system is stable enough,
1030000	1033000	The quantum is able to live for a few months.
1033000	1034000	It's not a problem.
1034000	1036000	We have a quantum.
1036000	1038000	We caught this quantum once.
1038000	1040000	It's been alive for about half a year.
1040000	1042000	From September last year to March this year.
1042000	1044000	Until one time, one accident, it's gone.
1044000	1047000	So it can live very long in this situation.
1047000	1048000	It won't interact with the background.
1048000	1051000	So it won't have a lot of strange noises.
1051000	1053000	Or it won't be affected by the outside environment.
1054000	1056000	Quantum computing needs these intangibles.
1056000	1057000	It's very fragile.
1057000	1062000	It's best to live in an environment where it doesn't interact with the outside world.
1062000	1064000	But we can manipulate it.
1064000	1065000	How to manipulate it, I'll talk about it later.
1065000	1068000	But it doesn't have any background interaction that we don't want.
1068000	1070000	The second is that when you catch a bunch of quantum,
1070000	1072000	Every quantum looks the same.
1072000	1074000	You won't find that my quantum,
1074000	1076000	For example, after my quantum, my quantum,
1076000	1078000	It's not the same as the other one.
1078000	1081000	Because quantum is essentially through nature.
1081000	1083000	Instead of through artificial production.
1083000	1085000	So we don't have to adjust the nature of each quantum.
1085000	1087000	Because if the nature of the quantum is different,
1087000	1090000	Then we have a big problem.
1090000	1092000	It's the same for every one you catch.
1093000	1098000	This also means that if we use this system to catch this quantum,
1098000	1099000	We can use this system.
1099000	1101000	If we use this system to catch and operate,
1101000	1104000	We can use this whole system to deal with another quantum.
1104000	1105000	It basically has no problem.
1105000	1109000	We don't need to adjust each one or measure it.
1109000	1110000	Basically not necessary.
1110000	1112000	Another feature of quantum is that,
1112000	1114000	Because it is through the battery factory,
1114000	1115000	Every one has electricity.
1115000	1117000	In the case that every one has electricity,
1117000	1121000	Every one can directly auto or connect in the same trap.
1121000	1123000	That is to say, if you catch 10 quantum today,
1123000	1126000	You can directly let the first quantum and the tenth quantum have an entanglement.
1126000	1130000	You don't have to say that I have to do this through 1, 2, 2, 3.
1130000	1133000	Because in theory, they are actually in this trap.
1133000	1135000	They can all see each other.
1135000	1139000	This thing can make the complexity of quantum computing much lower.
1139000	1141000	As long as you don't need a bunch of complicated quantum,
1141000	1144000	You can make your experiment more accurate.
1144000	1146000	Because we all know that quantum computing is not perfect now.
1146000	1149000	As long as you keep doing all kinds of quantum logic,
1149000	1151000	You just let your error rate rise.
1151000	1157000	Basically, the quantum computing of the quantum system is in this.
1157000	1160000	Because of these good qualities,
1160000	1165000	Its quantum logic is in single qubit rotation.
1165000	1168000	About 99.999 is not a difficult thing.
1168000	1171000	In the case of 2-qubit, which requires entanglement,
1171000	1176000	98 or 99 is not difficult to do in a normal lab.
1176000	1184000	It can be very easy to do very high quality in a small number of small systems.
1184000	1186000	This is the characteristic of the quantum system.
1186000	1188000	How do you do a lot of them?
1188000	1190000	This is not the scope of our discussion today.
1190000	1193000	We know that it is very good if it is small, there is no problem.
1194000	1198000	But there are hundreds of kinds of quantum.
1198000	1200000	We open the element cycle table and it looks like there are more than 100 kinds.
1200000	1202000	So why do we choose Eterbium?
1202000	1205000	What are the benefits of Eterbium?
1205000	1207000	The first one is that if we look at it now,
1207000	1209000	There is a hyperfine cube in the lower left corner.
1209000	1211000	The place where we define 0 and 1 is here.
1211000	1213000	What are the benefits of it?
1213000	1217000	This Eterbium 171,
1217000	1219000	Its nucleus is a spin half.
1219000	1223000	Its nucleus has a 1 in 2 spin.
1223000	1226000	So the result is that it will produce a hyperfine cube.
1226000	1230000	It is very natural, like a straight line or a straight line.
1230000	1233000	So it is a hyperfine cube.
1233000	1236000	The second is that if you kick off one electron,
1236000	1239000	What is the layer of the outer chain?
1239000	1244000	So there are not many cases where you kick off the first one and it is full.
1245000	1251000	So your first requirement is that if you want to have a hyperfine,
1251000	1254000	And then you want to kick off one electron,
1254000	1256000	The outer chain is full.
1256000	1259000	At the same time, you also hope that in the process of your experiment,
1259000	1262000	Your nucleus will not go to any strange place.
1262000	1264000	For example, if we put the nucleus here,
1264000	1266000	Through this experiment,
1266000	1269000	It may have a part of the probability to get here.
1269000	1271000	When it gets here, we'll figure out a way to kick it back.
1271000	1276000	That is, we can kick it back through 935 and 638.
1276000	1283000	You have to make sure that you can find your nucleus back to where it wants to be.
1283000	1286000	You can initialize it to where you want it to be.
1286000	1288000	This is quite important.
1288000	1290000	Because you don't want to say that it has all kinds of good qualities,
1290000	1293000	But after you do the experiment, you don't know what kind of strange state your nucleus has gone to.
1293000	1296000	Of course, another important point is that
1296000	1300000	You hope that the laser you do the experiment can be bought on the market,
1300000	1302000	Or at least it's not very exaggerated.
1302000	1305000	For example, our laser here is 369 nm.
1305000	1310000	If your laser is 500 to 1000 nm,
1310000	1312000	That's very, very good.
1312000	1314000	That is to say, the range of visible light is very good.
1314000	1317000	Although 369 nm is already very close to the blue light,
1317000	1319000	It's a little bit of an outline, but it can still be done.
1319000	1322000	Whether or not you can do the experiment with a sold laser,
1322000	1325000	It will also affect whether or not you can do a good amount of electricity.
1326000	1329000	So you can express it in various ways.
1329000	1332000	It meets a series of good qualities.
1332000	1336000	It is a spin-1 in 2.
1336000	1339000	After it kicks off an electricity,
1339000	1341000	The outer layer is full of electricity.
1341000	1349000	Its various complex connections can be easily
1349000	1352000	We can simplify it to just look at the connection at the bottom left.
1352000	1355000	As long as we have those auxiliary lasers,
1355000	1357000	It can be regarded as non-existent.
1357000	1362000	At the same time, it mainly operates 369 nm.
1362000	1365000	This frequency can be bought on the market.
1365000	1369000	So why do we choose to use Ethereum?
1369000	1372000	Ethereum does not have a very long history.
1372000	1374000	It was probably around the 2010s
1374000	1379000	It was established by Chris Monore, a professor at the University of Maryland.
1380000	1384000	It is to use Ethereum to use its 369 nm
1384000	1388000	Transition to do all kinds of quantum computing operations.
1388000	1391000	So why is Ethereum a good reason?
1391000	1394000	Let's talk about why the reason system is a good system.
1394000	1397000	Why is Ethereum a good reason?
1397000	1400000	After the two-step logic is completed,
1400000	1405000	But the reason system can only be a small system.
1405000	1407000	If we want to simulate a large
1407000	1410000	What should we do if we need a lot of Hewlett-Packard space?
1410000	1412000	So the first simple way is to say
1412000	1415000	Each of our particles has a spin-down and a spin-up
1415000	1417000	One 0 and one 1
1417000	1418000	Then we can make it
1418000	1420000	Let's just find a bunch of particles.
1420000	1422000	We have n particles
1422000	1425000	So in this case, our total Hewlett-Packard space is 2n square.
1425000	1426000	Sounds good
1426000	1429000	But can we find a faster way?
1429000	1430000	Maybe there is
1431000	1433000	Your particle is
1433000	1437000	In addition to the ability to pick up,
1437000	1438000	The particle will vibrate.
1438000	1439000	Because we just said
1439000	1443000	We are using this
1443000	1445000	This
1445000	1447000	We are adding an AC power plant
1447000	1450000	Let this particle be in vacuum
1450000	1451000	Affected by this power plant
1451000	1454000	Then after the back and forth vibration, the waiting price is restrained there.
1454000	1456000	This means that the particle will vibrate.
1456000	1459000	The vibration of this particle is also a quantum.
1459000	1461000	In theory, you can put a quantum
1461000	1462000	You can put two
1462000	1463000	You can put three
1463000	1465000	You can put n quantum
1465000	1468000	So you can put a lot of quantum in every quantum
1468000	1469000	Theoretically, it is infinite.
1469000	1470000	In practice, of course, it is limited.
1470000	1474000	So the reason why my paper is said to be this
1474000	1477000	The reason for this SWAP test in Infinite Dimension is because
1477000	1479000	We are using a quantum
1479000	1483000	We are not using 0 and 1 as a calculation standard
1483000	1485000	What does this mean?
1485000	1486000	Look here
1486000	1488000	The mainstream approach
1488000	1490000	We can say that this is more common
1490000	1491000	We have a lot of 0s and 1s
1491000	1492000	A lot of 0s and 1s
1492000	1494000	You are on the top of this side
1494000	1495000	Then this kind of vibration
1495000	1496000	It's like a bus
1496000	1499000	Responsible for the information from the left to the right
1499000	1502000	It's like it's a
1502000	1505000	After you finish the calculation, you will be forgotten
1505000	1506000	I want to hope that it is
1506000	1508000	Not as a
1508000	1510000	Support function
1510000	1512000	But what you have to think about is
1513000	1516000	Every quantum has only two dimensions
1516000	1517000	But it contains this
1517000	1518000	Continuous Variable
1518000	1519000	Or its Vibration Normal
1519000	1521000	Its vibration is an infinite dimension
1521000	1523000	Can you turn their characters upside down?
1523000	1524000	That is to say
1524000	1526000	Let you
1526000	1527000	This part of the infinite dimension
1527000	1530000	It becomes a storage and calculation character for quantum computing
1530000	1532000	Let this two-dimensional system
1532000	1534000	It becomes a quantum bus character
1534000	1535000	If you turn it upside down
1535000	1536000	Maybe we can use the same system
1536000	1537000	But this can be done
1537000	1540000	Can manipulate a lot of
1540000	1545000	It's a lot of quantum dimensions
1545000	1547000	So this is possible
1547000	1548000	Then there is another point
1548000	1549000	It's special to say
1549000	1550000	Why do I seem to switch
1550000	1551000	This infinite dimension
1551000	1553000	Interact with Continuous Variable
1553000	1554000	Your infinite dimension
1554000	1556000	This matter is seen through its vibration
1556000	1557000	That is to say, one vibration, two vibrations
1557000	1558000	It can go to the infinite dimension
1558000	1560000	The reason for the Continuous Variable
1560000	1561000	This vibration
1561000	1563000	If you look at it with quantum
1563000	1565000	It is in x and p space
1565000	1566000	It is in the phase space
1566000	1568000	Is a continuous situation
1568000	1570000	So this infinite dimension
1570000	1572000	With this continuous variable
1572000	1574000	This matter is exactly the same
1574000	1575000	It's not that I don't seem to get it
1575000	1577000	Just
1577000	1579000	People in quantum will prefer to say
1579000	1581000	It is x, it is infinite dimension
1581000	1583000	But if you are from the light system today
1583000	1584000	You are doing quantum light
1584000	1585000	You might be saying
1585000	1586000	This is a continuous variable
1586000	1588000	OK
1588000	1589000	So now we know
1589000	1590000	Can you open it?
1590000	1592000	No problem
1592000	1593000	I want to ask
1593000	1595000	That one of yours
1596000	1598000	Motion state is also
1598000	1600000	The direction of x is still
1600000	1602000	Is the direction of radio
1602000	1604000	This
1604000	1606000	We are all using the direction of radio
1606000	1607000	OK
1607000	1609000	We are not using X
1609000	1610000	OK
1610000	1611000	Thank you
1611000	1612000	The main reason is because
1612000	1614000	Our experiment is
1614000	1616000	Need a few vibrational modes
1616000	1618000	Interaction between
1618000	1620000	Then X
1620000	1622000	If we pull to the front page
1622000	1623000	This is to say
1623000	1624000	You each
1624000	1626000	There will be three vibrations
1626000	1627000	But his three
1627000	1629000	There are two directions
1629000	1631000	Is radio
1631000	1632000	Is
1632000	1633000	Is
1633000	1634000	You can say it is horizontal
1634000	1636000	Then one is horizontal
1636000	1637000	So you use this
1637000	1638000	Horizontal vibration
1638000	1639000	He has more
1639000	1640000	He has more
1640000	1641000	He can also choose
1641000	1642000	We won't choose
1642000	1643000	Like here
1643000	1644000	The two he drew here
1644000	1645000	Both are
1645000	1646000	X
1646000	1647000	But we don't use these two
1647000	1648000	These two are just memories
1648000	1649000	We use radio
1649000	1651000	Correct
1651000	1652000	OK
1652000	1653000	So
1653000	1654000	Is it because of radio
1654000	1655000	His ability to separate
1655000	1657000	Probably with his weight
1657000	1659000	Separate
1659000	1661000	The range is probably where
1661000	1662000	Is there
1662000	1663000	Probably all in
1663000	1664000	Kilohertz
1664000	1666000	Megahertz
1666000	1667000	Radio
1667000	1669000	Probably up to
1669000	1671000	0.5 or up to 5
1671000	1672000	It is possible
1672000	1673000	Then generally speaking
1673000	1674000	X will be smaller
1674000	1675000	Because
1675000	1676000	X it is not
1676000	1677000	X it is from that
1677000	1678000	Cap to confine
1678000	1679000	It is clamped by two electrons
1679000	1680000	Generally speaking
1680000	1681000	We
1681000	1682000	Uh
1682000	1683000	Our X
1683000	1684000	His
1684000	1685000	His
1685000	1686000	Frequency
1686000	1687000	His that
1687000	1689000	His frequency is smaller
1689000	1690000	Correct
1690000	1691000	Of course this is not
1691000	1692000	Why don't we choose him
1692000	1693000	The reason is right
1693000	1694000	Correct
1694000	1695000	Understand
1695000	1696000	So simply put
1696000	1697000	Say yes
1697000	1698000	OK
1698000	1699000	So simply put
1699000	1700000	Just pull it back
1700000	1701000	Just say good
1701000	1702000	We now know this
1702000	1703000	This computer
1703000	1704000	To do it with a microscope
1704000	1705000	Very good
1705000	1706000	But the speed of ether
1706000	1707000	Maybe there is no
1707000	1708000	This kind of vibration
1708000	1709000	Better
1709000	1710000	So we decided to use
1710000	1712000	Vibration of ether
1712000	1713000	To do experiments
1713000	1714000	After that
1714000	1715000	We want to say
1715000	1716000	Then we have to make sure
1716000	1717000	He can do quantum computers
1717000	1718000	Is the quantum computer
1718000	1719000	Is a series of requirements
1719000	1720000	First
1720000	1721000	You have to make sure you can
1721000	1722000	Your quantum information
1722000	1723000	The subset can be more and more
1723000	1724000	For example
1724000	1725000	If your spin has 2
1725000	1726000	You can find
1726000	1727000	For example, more
1727000	1728000	Two spins
1728000	1729000	You can find a very large
1729000	1730000	Kilohertz
1730000	1731000	You can find a very large
1731000	1732000	This quantum space
1732000	1733000	This thing
1733000	1734000	Can be done in spin
1734000	1735000	That in quantum information
1735000	1736000	In this
1736000	1737000	Of course I can do it too
1737000	1738000	So theoretically
1738000	1739000	We can catch
1739000	1740000	A vibration
1740000	1741000	You can catch two
1741000	1742000	Vibration of ether
1742000	1743000	You can catch
1743000	1744000	You can catch a vibration
1744000	1745000	This quantum
1745000	1746000	You can catch two
1746000	1747000	You can catch three
1747000	1748000	So he
1748000	1749000	Scalable
1749000	1750000	The first one is fine
1750000	1751000	The second
1751000	1752000	He can last a long time
1752000	1753000	Coherence time
1753000	1754000	He must not
1754000	1755000	He must not be easy
1755000	1756000	It's easy to interact with the outside world
1756000	1757000	This thing
1757000	1758000	In spin
1758000	1759000	Can last
1759000	1760000	Ten minutes
1760000	1761000	This is a pretty exaggerated world record
1761000	1762000	What about the vibration
1762000	1763000	It can only last about
1763000	1764000	Ten to twenty milliseconds
1764000	1765000	One millisecond
1765000	1766000	Is one thousandth of a second
1766000	1767000	But it's been a long time
1767000	1768000	Because our experiment
1768000	1769000	Faster than this
1770000	1771000	The rest is more standard
1771000	1772000	That's what we want
1772000	1773000	Can we go
1773000	1774000	Effectively go to this
1774000	1775000	Put it
1775000	1776000	Initialization in a certain place
1776000	1777000	I said we hope
1777000	1778000	When we start
1778000	1779000	We can know where he is
1779000	1780000	So we do
1780000	1781000	All kinds of operations
1781000	1782000	That's how it will be
1782000	1783000	To the place we want to go
1783000	1784000	Of course you
1784000	1785000	You can put it
1785000	1786000	To a certain place
1786000	1787000	Let him
1787000	1788000	After all kinds of operations
1788000	1789000	You have to be able to read it
1789000	1790000	How can you read it
1790000	1791000	The answer is also
1791000	1792000	Is
1792000	1793000	Initialization skills
1793000	1794000	And reading skills
1794000	1795000	Use spin
1795000	1796000	To read
1796000	1797000	This
1797000	1798000	With spin
1798000	1799000	With continuous
1799000	1800000	It's the same
1800000	1801000	This technology
1801000	1802000	In
1803000	1804000	This technology
1804000	1805000	In this
1805000	1806000	Whether you use this
1806000	1807000	It's the same
1807000	1809000	The real point is
1809000	1810000	Is that
1810000	1811000	Can you find the middle one
1811000	1812000	Can operate
1812000	1813000	Vibration
1813000	1814000	That kind of logic
1814000	1815000	How do you make logic
1815000	1816000	Or the most difficult place
1816000	1817000	OK
1817000	1818000	So let's go to the next place
1818000	1819000	I want to see
1819000	1820000	That is to say
1820000	1821000	In the case of QB
1821000	1822000	We see the logic
1822000	1823000	You may see it more often
1823000	1824000	That is to say
1824000	1825000	We have a single QB
1825000	1826000	We can turn it
1826000	1827000	At the beginning
1827000	1828000	QB is like a
1828000	1829000	North and south
1829000	1830000	This
1830000	1831000	If the North Pole is 0 and the South Pole is 1
1831000	1832000	You can see above
1832000	1833000	Turn around on the surface
1833000	1834000	The first one is
1834000	1835000	If you have only one
1835000	1836000	Just turn it
1836000	1837000	That
1837000	1838000	If you can do it
1838000	1839000	Any quantum state
1839000	1840000	You have to be able to do
1840000	1841000	Any quantum
1841000	1842000	This
1842000	1843000	This
1843000	1844000	This
1844000	1845000	If you need this result
1845000	1846000	You also need one
1846000	1847000	Can control two
1847000	1848000	quantum
1848000	1849000	What about our common practice
1849000	1850000	That is
1850000	1851000	This is the first one
1851000	1852000	Is this controlled
1852000	1853000	Then the second one
1853000	1854000	Is controlled
1854000	1855000	You can do
1855000	1856000	If the first one is 0
1856000	1857000	The first one is 0
1857000	1858000	If the second one is 0
1858000	1859000	It's still 0 0
1859000	1860000	That's his logic
1860000	1861000	It's a simple output
1861000	1862000	This situation
1862000	1863000	That
1863000	1864000	QB is the quantum
1864000	1865000	In the binary system
1865000	1866000	Can do this
1866000	1867000	What if we have a
1867000	1868000	What if we have an infinite system
1868000	1870000	So we have the situation on the right
1870000	1871000	Like this
1871000	1872000	Single QB
1872000	1873000	It corresponds to a series of
1873000	1874000	All kinds of different things
1874000	1875000	What is this
1875000	1876000	Displacement
1876000	1877000	Rotation
1877000	1878000	Squeeze in
1878000	1879000	Bean splitter
1879000	1880000	These
1880000	1881000	It corresponds to this single QB
1881000	1882000	This
1882000	1883000	You can say
1883000	1884000	Continuous
1884000	1885000	Continuous
1885000	1886000	These basic
1886000	1887000	This is the basic tool
1887000	1888000	But it needs a
1888000	1889000	Very important point
1889000	1890000	The most difficult thing is
1890000	1891000	If you want to do this
1891000	1892000	Non-linear
1892000	1893000	If you want to do that
1893000	1894000	Can let
1894000	1895000	Between the two
1895000	1896000	To produce
1896000	1897000	This is
1897000	1898000	This is
1898000	1899000	This is the trouble
1899000	1900000	So the next point
1900000	1901000	We have to say
1901000	1902000	Okay, then we
1902000	1903000	Which one do we choose
1903000	1904000	To do this
1904000	1905000	We have to choose
1905000	1906000	Control swap gate
1906000	1907000	What about the control swap gate
1907000	1908000	There are three quantum
1908000	1909000	The first one is spin
1909000	1910000	Is our
1910000	1911000	Quantum box
1911000	1912000	There is a quantum behind
1913000	1914000	There is a quantum behind
1914000	1915000	It's called A
1915000	1916000	There is a quantum called B
1916000	1917000	it is good
1917000	1918000	If you go through this
1918000	1919000	Control swap
1919000	1920000	It if this
1920000	1921000	It if this middle
1921000	1922000	This quantum
1922000	1923000	This spin
1923000	1924000	This box
1924000	1925000	It belongs to
1925000	1926000	Spin down
1926000	1927000	It won't
1927000	1928000	It won't do any action
1928000	1929000	But if it spins up
1929000	1930000	It can put two quantum
1930000	1931000	Exchange
1931000	1932000	It's very simple
1932000	1933000	If today
1933000	1934000	Your indicator
1934000	1935000	If it's down
1935000	1936000	No action
1936000	1937000	If the indicator is up
1937000	1938000	Exchange
1938000	1939000	It seems to be very specific, right?
1939000	1940000	Of course what to do
1941000	1942000	If you today
1942000	1944000	You have this very simple
1944000	1945000	this
1945000	1946000	Gate is that you can do this
1946000	1947000	Howdermann
1947000	1948000	this
1948000	1950000	If you spin the spin
1950000	1951000	Then you do it at the same time
1951000	1952000	This is a swap
1952000	1953000	gate
1953000	1954000	You can get
1954000	1955000	You can get these two
1955000	1956000	Unknown quantity
1956000	1958000	How similar it is
1958000	1959000	But attention
1959000	1960000	You don't need to know the quantity
1960000	1961000	It doesn't have to know
1961000	1962000	Quantity B
1962000	1963000	You go straight to measure
1963000	1964000	This quantum box
1964000	1965000	You can find these two
1965000	1966000	you
1966000	1967000	You get these two
1967000	1968000	Quantity
1968000	1969000	How similar it is
1969000	1970000	That's right
1970000	1971000	So this
1971000	1972000	So this
1972000	1973000	This
1973000	1974000	He can give us this
1974000	1975000	This circuit
1975000	1976000	It means
1976000	1977000	We can
1977000	1978000	We can now
1978000	1979000	Unknown two
1979000	1980000	The details
1980000	1981000	In the case of details
1981000	1982000	But you know
1982000	1983000	How similar these two
1983000	1984000	How similar it is
1984000	1985000	This is actually very good
1985000	1986000	Because that is to say
1986000	1987000	Sometimes we are just curious
1987000	1988000	Our results
1988000	1989000	For example, the two of them
1989000	1990000	Is it
1990000	1991000	Similar quantum
1991000	1992000	But we
1992000	1993000	For its details
1993000	1994000	Maybe not so much
1994000	1995000	But the previous situation was
1995000	1996000	You might want to know first
1996000	1997000	What does A look like
1997000	1998000	What does B look like
1998000	1999000	To know how similar A and B are
1999000	2000000	But you can now
2000000	2001000	It's very simple
2001000	2002000	Just know how similar it is
2002000	2003000	And you don't need to know
2003000	2004000	What are their details
2004000	2005000	OK
2005000	2006000	Ok
2006000	2007000	Then next
2007000	2008000	Then next
2008000	2009000	This
2009000	2010000	In theory, we need
2010000	2011000	This is very simple
2011000	2012000	This
2012000	2013000	We need this
2013000	2014000	Complex control swap gate
2014000	2015000	It involves
2015000	2016000	One
2016000	2017000	Spin and two
2017000	2018000	Motional mode
2018000	2019000	Two oscillators
2019000	2020000	That
2020000	2021000	In theory
2021000	2022000	That's what it was like in 2001
2022000	2023000	But in practice
2023000	2024000	It's not that simple
2024000	2026000	Because we have something in practice
2026000	2028000	It's called the control bin splitter gate
2028000	2029000	It's very similar to the control swap gate
2029000	2030000	But it's not the same
2030000	2032000	What's the difference
2032000	2033000	You'll find out
2033000	2034000	If you use the middle one now
2034000	2035000	This
2035000	2036000	If you use Hamiltonian for evolution
2036000	2038000	You put X and Y
2038000	2039000	It will turn into Y and X
2039000	2040000	That's right
2040000	2041000	But there's one more thing in front of it
2041000	2042000	Very annoying to us
2042000	2043000	This
2043000	2044000	This face
2044000	2045000	This
2045000	2046000	This
2046000	2047000	Uh
2047000	2049000	This face is here
2049000	2050000	Because we know
2050000	2051000	The quantum world
2051000	2052000	It's a negative number
2052000	2053000	So of course it can produce this
2053000	2054000	This kind of virtual
2054000	2055000	This face is here
2055000	2056000	We need to find a way
2056000	2058000	Get rid of this face
2058000	2060000	When it only becomes X and Y
2060000	2061000	It becomes Y and X
2061000	2062000	No need Y and X
2062000	2063000	Plus a very annoying face
2063000	2065000	How do you do this
2065000	2066000	The answer is that we need three gates
2066000	2068000	We need three modes
2068000	2070000	We put what we want
2070000	2071000	This measurement thing
2071000	2073000	Ready in mode B and mode C
2073000	2076000	And then we let mode B and mode A
2076000	2077000	Interact
2077000	2079000	Let mode A and mode C interact
2079000	2081000	Its final result will be mode B
2081000	2083000	Interact with mode C
2083000	2084000	But its face
2084000	2086000	This face will be miraculously eliminated
2086000	2088000	So you only need two
2088000	2089000	Control beam splitter
2089000	2091000	And then you have three modes
2091000	2092000	You can do it
2092000	2093000	Just now we said
2093000	2095000	We really want to see this
2095000	2096000	We can know
2096000	2098000	How similar are the two quantum states
2098000	2099000	But
2099000	2100000	Uh
2100000	2101000	But you don't need to know
2101000	2102000	The details of these two quantum states
2102000	2104000	Of course, a very important point
2104000	2106000	No matter how complicated these two quantum states are
2106000	2108000	The measurement process is the same
2108000	2110000	It's the same time
2110000	2111000	You're not going to say
2111000	2112000	My quantum state is bigger
2112000	2114000	So I'm going to need more steps
2114000	2115000	No need
2115000	2118000	The quantum state may require more steps
2118000	2120000	But whether the two quantum states are similar
2120000	2121000	This thing
2121000	2122000	It is a constant deep circuit
2122000	2125000	Its length is stable
2125000	2126000	OK
2126000	2127000	This thing is pretty important
2127000	2128000	Because it
2128000	2130000	This thing is far more than this
2130000	2132000	SPIN system
2132000	2133000	Uh, efficiency
2133000	2134000	Of course, its
2134000	2136000	Its fidelity will not be higher
2136000	2138000	Because this is a relatively new system
2138000	2139000	It will have all kinds of infidelity
2139000	2140000	You'll see later
2140000	2141000	Where is it imperfect
2141000	2143000	So
2143000	2144000	It's very simple
2144000	2146000	We only need two control bin splitters
2146000	2147000	With three modes
2147000	2149000	We can get this
2149000	2150000	We just
2150000	2152000	Hope to get this
2152000	2154000	The core of this
2154000	2155000	Control swap gate
2155000	2156000	OK
2156000	2159000	Can I ask a question?
2159000	2160000	Good question
2160000	2162000	Because I don't know much about this system
2162000	2164000	So can you tell me a little bit
2164000	2165000	Physically
2165000	2166000	How did you do it?
2166000	2168000	Control bin splitter gate
2168000	2170000	Uh
2170000	2171000	I'm going to the next page
2171000	2172000	Ok
2172000	2174000	Ok, I'm going to the next page
2174000	2175000	The next page is physics
2175000	2176000	We just said so much
2176000	2177000	It's like you said
2177000	2179000	What can you do with a Hamiltonian
2179000	2180000	What kind of result will it have
2180000	2181000	What is its physical situation
2181000	2182000	Very simple
2182000	2183000	We now
2183000	2184000	I just
2184000	2185000	Uh
2185000	2186000	Every
2186000	2187000	Every particle is in
2187000	2188000	It's in
2188000	2189000	Every particle is in
2189000	2191000	There will be a vibration in the z direction
2191000	2193000	There will be two vibrations in the x and y direction
2193000	2195000	Then we said we need three vibration states
2195000	2197000	So we can only use the x and y direction at this time
2197000	2199000	We caught two
2199000	2200000	After the particle
2200000	2202000	It's in the x and y direction
2202000	2203000	There are four vibrations in total
2203000	2204000	We used three of them
2204000	2206000	Called Moe ABC respectively
2206000	2208000	What about this Moe ABC
2209000	2211000	What if we go at the same time
2211000	2212000	Uh
2212000	2215000	If you apply this Moe AB and AC
2215000	2216000	That is to say
2216000	2218000	If we have this
2218000	2220000	If we laser this
2222000	2223000	Bichrome
2223000	2224000	That is to say
2224000	2225000	We applied this laser
2225000	2226000	It has
2226000	2227000	We applied the laser
2227000	2228000	It's not a single frequency
2228000	2229000	It's two frequencies
2229000	2230000	And if it's between the two frequencies
2230000	2231000	The interval is this
2231000	2232000	380kHz
2232000	2234000	Or 490kHz
2234000	2235000	It can
2235000	2236000	It can
2236000	2237000	It can successfully go
2237000	2238000	Drive
2238000	2239000	Just what we want
2239000	2240000	This one
2240000	2241000	Control beam speed
2241000	2242000	What is control beam speed
2242000	2243000	That is to say
2243000	2244000	I let
2245000	2246000	One more x
2246000	2247000	Then let b less than one
2247000	2248000	This concept
2248000	2249000	So
2249000	2250000	You just let your
2250000	2252000	This frequency driving is
2252000	2253000	Difference
2253000	2254000	It's
2254000	2255000	It's the difference between the two modes
2255000	2256000	It will automatically become
2256000	2257000	Like the one we just had
2257000	2258000	This control
2258000	2259000	This situation
2259000	2260000	So our physical system
2260000	2262000	Is that we catch two particles
2262000	2263000	Let him use it
2263000	2264000	There are four vibration
2264000	2265000	Choose three of them
2265000	2266000	And then
2266000	2267000	Let one of the particles
2267000	2268000	It's in a special state
2268000	2270000	It won't interact with our experiment
2270000	2272000	It simply contributes to the vibration
2272000	2273000	It won't
2273000	2274000	Contribute to its
2274000	2275000	This energy level
2275000	2276000	It's just
2276000	2277000	I can't see it going somewhere else
2277000	2279000	What about the last one that I can see
2280000	2281000	Let's go
2281000	2282000	Let's go
2282000	2283000	Use this
2283000	2285000	This post laser to drive it
2285000	2286000	Do this
2286000	2287000	Control beam speed
2287000	2288000	This thing
2288000	2289000	OK
2289000	2290000	Then
2290000	2291000	We have this mode
2291000	2292000	ABC
2292000	2293000	What about this mode ABC
2293000	2295000	We are not going to turn ABC now
2295000	2296000	We are going to turn
2296000	2298000	The difference between AB and AC
2298000	2299000	OK
2299000	2300000	So
2300000	2301000	If you do this
2301000	2302000	Then we can get
2302000	2303000	Control beam speed
2303000	2304000	Then we stack it up
2304000	2305000	Use that logic to put it
2305000	2306000	We use that
2306000	2307000	Just stack it up
2307000	2308000	We will get
2308000	2309000	We want this
2309000	2310000	The final result
2310000	2311000	This is our swap task
2311000	2312000	That
2312000	2313000	This experiment system
2313000	2314000	That is to say
2314000	2315000	The gate time we need in total is
2315000	2316000	1.2 milliseconds
2316000	2317000	Then we have this
2317000	2318000	It's 10 to 20
2318000	2319000	That is to say
2319000	2320000	Theoretically, we can operate
2320000	2321000	10 to 20
2321000	2322000	After the gate
2322000	2323000	It will only
2323000	2325000	There are all kinds of problems
2325000	2326000	But in fact
2326000	2327000	I can't do it for so long
2327000	2328000	The reason is because
2328000	2329000	Ah
2329000	2330000	Our state preparation
2330000	2331000	That is, when we are preparing
2331000	2332000	Those vibrations
2332000	2333000	There will be a lot of
2333000	2334000	Error
2334000	2335000	How to say
2335000	2336000	That is to say
2336000	2337000	We are now
2337000	2338000	We are now in this 0
2338000	2339000	0 and 0
2339000	2340000	Come to this
2340000	2341000	When this stacks up
2341000	2342000	This overlap
2342000	2344000	It is 80% of this
2344000	2345000	Overlap, that's right
2345000	2347000	But if you take 5 and 5 today
2347000	2348000	If you do the overlap
2348000	2350000	Its overlap rate is about 50%
2350000	2352000	The main reason
2352000	2353000	It says here that
2353000	2354000	There is a possibility that our
2354000	2355000	This state
2355000	2356000	This preparation
2356000	2357000	It's hard to do well
2357000	2358000	Of course, one reason is because
2358000	2359000	As your time goes up
2359000	2360000	Just follow your
2360000	2362000	When this phonon mode increases
2363000	2364000	His
2364000	2365000	Ah
2365000	2367000	The coherence time will be shorter
2367000	2368000	Then his heating rate
2368000	2369000	May be bigger
2369000	2370000	That is to say
2370000	2371000	As your mode
2371000	2372000	When going up
2372000	2373000	He has all kinds of imperfections
2373000	2375000	So even if your
2375000	2377000	Even if your coherence time is long enough
2377000	2379000	Coherence time is not now
2379000	2380000	The bottleneck of this experiment is right
2380000	2381000	OK
2381000	2383000	So that means we are now
2383000	2384000	Overlap 0 and 0
2384000	2385000	Great, he saw his 80%
2385000	2386000	Then 1 and 1 overlap
2386000	2387000	2 and 2 overlap
2387000	2388000	3 and 3 overlap
2388000	2389000	4 and 4, 5 and 5 overlap
2389000	2390000	No problem
2390000	2391000	But you want to say
2391000	2393000	Overlap 0 and 0 and 1 and 1
2393000	2394000	This thing
2394000	2395000	It doesn't seem to be very quantum
2395000	2396000	Can you overlap 0 plus 1
2396000	2397000	Or 0 minus 1
2397000	2398000	This thing
2398000	2399000	The answer is of course
2399000	2400000	So our practical approach is
2401000	2403000	We have a 0 plus 1
2403000	2404000	Then fix it
2404000	2406000	Then we prepare another state
2406000	2408000	He can run from 0 minus 1 to 0 plus 1
2408000	2409000	Along the
2409000	2410000	Along the
2410000	2411000	Along the
2411000	2412000	Along the
2412000	2413000	Along the
2413000	2415000	Just follow that 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1, 0 plus 1, 0 minus 1
2415000	2416000	Run around
2416000	2417000	But what about the situation
2417000	2419000	Let's find this overlap
2419000	2420000	It will become very overlap
2420000	2421000	Then it becomes very non-overlap
2421000	2422000	Then it becomes very overlap
2422000	2423000	Then it becomes non-overlap
2423000	2424000	So this thing is what we see
2424000	2425000	We can
2425000	2427000	We can not only fold
2427000	2428000	This
2428000	2429000	We can fold
2429000	2431000	So we can now put a
2431000	2432000	Fold it up
2434000	2435000	But you can't fold a simple one
2435000	2436000	He also wants to say
2436000	2437000	Then we can fold different things
2437000	2438000	Of course we can
2438000	2439000	We can not
2439000	2441000	We are now preparing a coherent state here
2441000	2442000	Then we will
2442000	2444000	We just sweep it like a radar
2444000	2445000	Sweep a circle
2445000	2446000	Sweep a circle
2446000	2447000	Sweep a circle
2447000	2448000	It means that you can imagine
2448000	2449000	This one
2449000	2450000	Like a
2450000	2451000	Like a plane
2451000	2452000	Or a submarine
2452000	2454000	Then we sweep it like a sonar
2454000	2455000	Sweep a circle
2455000	2456000	So this sonar picture
2456000	2457000	So this sonar picture
2457000	2458000	The result is
2458000	2459000	Its overlap
2459000	2460000	One circle one circle
2460000	2461000	We will see
2461000	2462000	Basically your coherent state
2462000	2463000	It's really here
2463000	2464000	Just this
2464000	2465000	There is no problem with this sonar
2465000	2466000	Yes
2466000	2467000	Then at the same time
2468000	2469000	If you put this circle in the middle
2469000	2470000	Is
2470000	2471000	The length is root number 3
2471000	2472000	Take out this circle
2472000	2473000	If you take out the slices
2473000	2474000	You will find
2474000	2475000	It overlaps
2475000	2476000	It's actually not bad
2476000	2477000	It overlaps here
2477000	2478000	In fact, there are still 80%
2478000	2479000	About 70-80%
2479000	2480000	So this is
2480000	2482000	We can really see this
2482000	2484000	Overlap two coherent states
2484000	2485000	This is two
2487000	2488000	Two coherent states
2488000	2489000	It's not bad
2489000	2490000	But I want to say
2490000	2491000	Can we do more
2491000	2492000	The answer is actually yes
2492000	2493000	That is, we are now preparing
2493000	2494000	Squeeze state
2494000	2495000	That is
2495000	2496000	This is also in the coherent state
2496000	2497000	A state that is common
2499000	2500000	We can put it
2500000	2501000	This
2501000	2502000	It
2502000	2503000	You can imagine
2503000	2504000	We
2504000	2506000	When we go up along R
2506000	2507000	It this
2507000	2508000	Its squeeze state
2508000	2509000	Will become narrower and narrower
2509000	2510000	It will be squeezed more and more
2510000	2512000	It will be squeezed more and more
2512000	2513000	Like a
2514000	2516000	It's getting more and more elliptical
2516000	2517000	So it's at the bottom
2517000	2518000	When this circle
2518000	2519000	It's very close to the circle
2519000	2520000	That two circles
2520000	2522000	If the center of the circle is overlapping
2522000	2523000	And then you turn it
2523000	2525000	It's basically a complete overlap
2525000	2526000	You see here
2526000	2527000	It's close to 1, that's right
2527000	2528000	But as you do it now
2528000	2530000	It's getting more and more elliptical
2530000	2531000	You let the two elliptical
2531000	2532000	When the core is overlapping
2532000	2534000	It finally becomes more and more like
2534000	2535000	It's just
2535000	2536000	It's just
2536000	2537000	When overlapping
2537000	2539000	It just turned to the right position
2539000	2540000	It overlaps
2540000	2541000	In the middle of this place
2541000	2542000	Other places
2542000	2543000	Other places you will see
2543000	2544000	It's basically black
2544000	2545000	So we can be sure
2545000	2547000	We can overlap this
2548000	2549000	0 plus 1, 0 minus 1
2549000	2550000	And overlap all kinds of Fox
2550000	2551000	We can overlap
2551000	2552000	Squeeze and overlap
2552000	2553000	This Cohedron
2554000	2555000	it is good
2555000	2556000	So this is physically
2556000	2558000	We solved this
2558000	2559000	We successfully obtained
2559000	2560000	Control
2560000	2561000	Binslip gate
2561000	2562000	Can get a control swap
2562000	2564000	Get these interesting things
2564000	2565000	That's us
2565000	2567000	This is my paper
2567000	2568000	The content is that
2568000	2570000	We can actually do this
2570000	2571000	That
2571000	2572000	Of course you want to say
2572000	2573000	That this thing sounds like
2573000	2575000	There seems to be no quantum calculation
2575000	2576000	Or what quantum calculation
2576000	2578000	It's just more physical
2578000	2579000	The practical way is to say
2579000	2580000	If you can overlap
2580000	2581000	If you have two quantum
2581000	2582000	You can
2582000	2583000	You can think of two quantum
2583000	2584000	It's two
2584000	2585000	Two quantities
2585000	2587000	Because we all know that quantum
2587000	2588000	It's 0
2588000	2589000	Quantum plus one
2589000	2590000	Quantum minus two
2590000	2591000	Quantum
2591000	2592000	This plus one third
2592000	2593000	A three-quantum or so
2593000	2594000	So
2594000	2595000	The next step is to say
2595000	2597000	Can you make it
2597000	2598000	It becomes like two quantities
2598000	2599000	To overlap
2599000	2600000	Overlap two quantities
2600000	2601000	This thing is
2601000	2602000	This one
2602000	2603000	We all know that linear times
2603000	2604000	Overlap two quantities
2604000	2605000	The whole computer science
2605000	2606000	Is also the beginning of machine learning
2606000	2607000	So we
2607000	2609000	So our next experiment is
2609000	2610000	We go through
2610000	2611000	This one
2611000	2612000	We go through
2612000	2613000	This control bin
2613000	2614000	With some other
2614000	2615000	More skills
2615000	2616000	We started to want to do some
2616000	2617000	Things about quantum mechanics
2617000	2618000	But today
2618000	2619000	I stopped at
2619000	2620000	Control swap gate
2620000	2621000	It is indeed possible
2621000	2623000	Overlap two unknown quantum states
2623000	2625000	And its complexity
2625000	2626000	The complexity of its own experiment
2626000	2627000	It won't follow
2627000	2628000	You have to prepare
2628000	2629000	It will rise
2629000	2630000	Yeah, that's about it
2630000	2631000	Yeah
2633000	2635000	OK, so that's about it
2635000	2637000	Uh
2637000	2639000	OK, that's it
2639000	2640000	Let's see what the problem is
2640000	2641000	Because I know I'm talking
2641000	2642000	More
2642000	2643000	It will be faster
2643000	2644000	Because I think
2644000	2646000	Uh
2646000	2647000	Just cover the whole
2647000	2648000	More general background part
2648000	2649000	And then cover
2649000	2650000	For example, the part that is more theoretical
2650000	2651000	And then at the end
2651000	2652000	It really belongs to us
2652000	2654000	This part of the experiment
2654000	2655000	So the overall content
2655000	2656000	May be more
2656000	2657000	So if you are interested in any part
2658000	2659000	You can ask me directly
2659000	2660000	Thank you all
2660000	2662000	Thank you, Kewei
2664000	2665000	OK
2665000	2667000	Does anyone have any questions?
2667000	2668000	We can just pull it back
2668000	2670000	Let's see what the problem is
2672000	2673000	That is
2673000	2675000	The front is actually not too special
2675000	2676000	Just some
2676000	2677000	Background part
2677000	2678000	Because I think
2678000	2679000	Maybe some people
2679000	2680000	Not doing quantum manipulation
2680000	2681000	Just take it all out
2681000	2682000	OK
2682000	2683000	Yeah
2683000	2685000	So this is very physical
2685000	2686000	There is basically nothing here
2687000	2688000	Part of the quantum information
2688000	2689000	Because that's another one
2689000	2690000	Right
2691000	2693000	I want to ask a question myself
2693000	2694000	Just
2694000	2695000	That one
2696000	2699000	I actually haven't studied this
2699000	2700000	Continuous
2700000	2701000	What is it called?
2701000	2702000	Continuous variable
2702000	2703000	Continuous variable
2703000	2704000	Yes yes
2704000	2705000	This thing with
2705000	2706000	Just the general
2706000	2708000	That kind of quantum gate
2708000	2710000	Is there anything different?
2710000	2711000	And they can
2711000	2712000	Do the same thing
2712000	2713000	Or
2713000	2715000	Can you explain a little
2715000	2716000	Just
2716000	2717000	Ok
2717000	2718000	That is to say
2718000	2719000	We know this
2719000	2720000	Dimensional
2720000	2721000	That is to say
2721000	2722000	If you enter this quantum computer
2722000	2723000	He can do
2723000	2724000	Just
2724000	2726000	Do you have a way to use
2726000	2728000	We all know that
2728000	2729000	Uh
2729000	2731000	Two-dimensional system can do anything
2731000	2732000	Quantum
2732000	2733000	Uh
2733000	2734000	In your two-dimensional system
2734000	2735000	You only need single qubit rotation
2735000	2736000	With ckn
2736000	2737000	You can do any quantum calculation
2737000	2738000	Is this thing
2738000	2740000	Continuous variable
2740000	2741000	That is to say
2741000	2742000	You are today
2742000	2743000	For example
2744000	2745000	Can he do this thing
2745000	2746000	Is
2746000	2747000	The fifth point here
2747000	2748000	This
2748000	2749000	This
2749000	2750000	This
2752000	2753000	He proved
2753000	2754000	You only need
2756000	2757000	You
2757000	2759000	You need these things above
2759000	2760000	With one
2761000	2762000	X and P
2762000	2763000	Separate
2763000	2764000	He
2764000	2765000	You need a bigger than X
2765000	2766000	Square or P square
2766000	2767000	This type
2767000	2768000	You can do
2768000	2769000	Any of this
2769000	2770000	You can simulate any of this
2770000	2771000	Uh
2771000	2772000	Hamiltonian
2772000	2773000	You can do any quantum calculation
2773000	2774000	That is to say
2774000	2776000	What is continuous variable
2776000	2777000	That is to say
2777000	2778000	Uh
2779000	2781000	You can think of continuous variable
2781000	2782000	Is
2782000	2783000	Light
2783000	2784000	In the phase space
2784000	2785000	X and P
2785000	2786000	That is
2786000	2788000	That's what I mentioned later
2788000	2789000	This
2791000	2792000	This is here
2792000	2793000	He is an X and P
2793000	2795000	Then why is he a continuous variable
2795000	2796000	Because you can put this quantum
2796000	2797000	Put it in this
2797000	2799000	Anywhere in the space
2800000	2801000	That is
2801000	2802000	Uh
2802000	2804000	You can put this thing in the space
2804000	2805000	Anywhere
2805000	2806000	He is a continuous variable
2806000	2807000	You can prepare this vibration today
2807000	2808000	To this side
2808000	2809000	This side
2809000	2810000	This side
2810000	2811000	This side
2811000	2812000	He is here
2812000	2813000	But you can also think of it
2813000	2814000	This space
2814000	2815000	He is
2815000	2816000	Uh
2816000	2817000	These vibrations
2817000	2818000	Or these coherent states
2818000	2819000	It can become
2819000	2820000	Zero phonon
2820000	2821000	One phonon
2821000	2822000	Two phonons
2822000	2823000	Three phonons
2823000	2824000	So these two symbols are equal
2824000	2825000	You can express it as
2825000	2827000	The distribution inside the phase space
2827000	2829000	You can also express it as
2829000	2830000	He is a variety of phonons
2830000	2831000	Superposition of phonons
2831000	2832000	These two are equal
2832000	2833000	Oh
2833000	2834000	Comparison value
2834000	2836000	In fact, it is the quantum optics
2836000	2838000	Put the photon into the phonon
2838000	2839000	That's right
2839000	2840000	Yes, that's right
2840000	2841000	It's two
2841000	2842000	The mathematical structure is exactly the same
2842000	2843000	Just quantum optics
2843000	2844000	People will love to say
2844000	2845000	X and P
2845000	2846000	But like this
2846000	2847000	But people who do quantum mechanics
2847000	2848000	Say we see one
2848000	2849000	One by one
2849000	2850000	That is
2850000	2851000	So we like to say
2851000	2852000	Infinite dimension
2852000	2853000	So
2853000	2854000	This page
2854000	2855000	I think the point is
2855000	2856000	Uh
2856000	2857000	Wait a minute
2857000	2858000	Here
2858000	2859000	So here
2859000	2860000	I will say
2860000	2861000	It is continuous
2861000	2862000	Variable quantum information
2862000	2863000	But you look at the picture
2863000	2864000	It's actually not continuous
2864000	2865000	It's obvious in the picture
2865000	2866000	It is
2866000	2867000	It's infinite dimension
2867000	2868000	That's right
2868000	2869000	So these two are equal
2869000	2870000	Just
2870000	2872000	Because the tool is different from the system
2872000	2874000	So the language used is not the same
2874000	2875000	Yes
2875000	2876000	So continuous variable
2876000	2877000	This word must have appeared earlier
2877000	2878000	Because quantum mechanics
2878000	2879000	Maybe there was in the 1980s
2879000	2880000	But infinite dimension
2880000	2881000	So we do quantum mechanics
2881000	2882000	Will use
2882000	2883000	Because it is
2883000	2884000	More fancy
2884000	2885000	Theoretically, the vibration of infinite dimension
2885000	2886000	Because
2886000	2887000	It's like your x and p in theory
2887000	2888000	Like a vacuum
2888000	2889000	Can be pulled to infinity
2889000	2890000	In practice, of course, it can't be pulled that far
2890000	2892000	But it is theoretically infinite
2894000	2895000	OK
2895000	2896000	understand
2896000	2897000	Yes
2900000	2901000	Then
2901000	2902000	Sorry
2902000	2903000	OK
2903000	2904000	I understand now
2904000	2905000	What I want to do
2905000	2906000	But I want to understand again
2906000	2907000	That
2908000	2909000	That
2909000	2910000	What is this
2910000	2911000	Con
2911000	2912000	What is this
2912000	2913000	Control beam
2913000	2914000	Control beam splitter
2914000	2915000	Yes
2915000	2916000	That is to say
2916000	2917000	When you just said
2917000	2918000	Our
2918000	2919000	OK
2919000	2920000	Our purpose is simple
2920000	2921000	That is to say
2921000	2922000	Our purpose is to get control beam splitter
2922000	2923000	But our physical system
2923000	2924000	Can you give us control beam splitter directly
2924000	2926000	It can't give us control beam splitter directly
2926000	2927000	It also gives us a very close
2927000	2928000	Control beam splitter
2928000	2929000	It can give us
2929000	2930000	That is to say
2930000	2931000	Oh
2931000	2932000	But one point is that
2932000	2933000	The picture we drew here is in z-basis
2933000	2934000	That is
2934000	2935000	G and E
2935000	2936000	But we can get it in practice
2936000	2937000	Is in x-basis
2937000	2938000	But this is a small detail in practice
2938000	2939000	We ignore it first
2939000	2940000	That is to say
2940000	2941000	Here is x-basis
2941000	2942000	But the point is
2942000	2944000	After you get this Hamiltonian today
2944000	2945000	You throw it down
2945000	2946000	The result of it running is
2946000	2948000	In addition to being able to swap
2948000	2949000	It will get a
2949000	2950000	In the process of swapping
2950000	2951000	Like
2951000	2952000	Why do you say that
2952000	2953000	You imagine
2953000	2954000	You see your light
2954000	2956000	After the reflection on the glass
2956000	2957000	It's beam splitter
2957000	2958000	After the reflection on the glass
2958000	2959000	It will get a fragrance
2960000	2961000	You put a light on the glass today
2961000	2962000	It will get a fragrance
2962000	2964000	So this thing is completely reasonable
2964000	2965000	That is to say
2965000	2966000	Because
2966000	2967000	This Hamiltonian
2968000	2969000	In fact, it is the Hamiltonian of beam splitter
2969000	2971000	It will naturally get the feature of beam splitter
2971000	2972000	That is to say
2972000	2973000	You hit this
2973000	2974000	You hit this
2974000	2975000	On the beam splitter
2975000	2976000	It will get a fragrance
2976000	2978000	We have to kill this fragrance
2978000	2979000	Otherwise
2979000	2980000	We can't get this
2980000	2981000	Swap gate
2981000	2982000	That's right
2982000	2983000	So we kill this fragrance
2983000	2984000	The approach is
2984000	2987000	Let's put things in B first
2987000	2989000	Then B and C do something first
2989000	2990000	Then put
2990000	2992000	B and A do an action first
2992000	2994000	Let A and C do an action
2994000	2995000	We can wait
2995000	2996000	Kill it
2996000	2997000	As for why this thing
2997000	2998000	It will be like this
2998000	2999000	Anyway
2999000	3000000	This thing is
3000000	3001000	In 2020
3001000	3003000	It's been a long time since someone discovered this thing in math
3006000	3007000	I want to ask
3007000	3009000	How is it done physically?
3009000	3010000	That is physically
3010000	3011000	Why
3013000	3014000	Beam splitter gate
3015000	3016000	You mean
3016000	3017000	Why this
3017000	3018000	Or why
3018000	3020000	You use two lasers
3021000	3022000	After hitting
3022000	3023000	Why is it
3026000	3027000	Will be a very similar
3027000	3029000	Very similar to swap gate
3030000	3032000	What I'm asking is the experiment
3032000	3033000	OK
3033000	3034000	Why in practice
3035000	3037000	In fact, the obvious reason is because
3039000	3041000	Can you go to the next page
3042000	3043000	OK
3043000	3044000	Is it in this page?
3044000	3045000	Yes
3046000	3047000	That is
3047000	3048000	It's pretty obvious
3048000	3049000	That is to say
3049000	3051000	If you know what is blue sideband and red sideband
3051000	3052000	Blue sideband
3052000	3053000	Hit it
3053000	3055000	It's sigma plus and A
3055000	3056000	You know this
3056000	3057000	That is
3057000	3058000	That is
3060000	3062000	Let me see if I can draw it here
3062000	3063000	I should be able to draw a picture
3063000	3064000	Let me see
3065000	3066000	OK
3066000	3067000	So
3067000	3068000	If we are in this today
3068000	3070000	This thing
3070000	3071000	We
3071000	3072000	If you just hit one
3072000	3073000	It will become sigma plus
3073000	3074000	And
3074000	3075000	A
3075000	3076000	OK
3076000	3077000	That is to say
3077000	3078000	So if we are now
3078000	3079000	OK
3079000	3080000	Then add cc
3080000	3081000	Anyway, I don't draw cc
3081000	3082000	That
3082000	3083000	You want to say
3083000	3085000	Can we reach a higher level
3085000	3087000	Is the second order sideband
3087000	3088000	That is
3088000	3089000	We know we can do sigma plus A
3089000	3090000	Sigma plus B
3090000	3091000	Sigma plus C
3091000	3092000	But if we do it today
3092000	3093000	Sigma plus
3095000	3096000	A
3097000	3098000	B plus
3101000	3102000	Then we add
3104000	3105000	Sigma
3105000	3106000	Minus
3106000	3107000	A
3108000	3109000	B
3109000	3110000	Plus
3111000	3112000	Then add cc
3112000	3114000	Just add that complex conjugate
3114000	3115000	Ignore it
3115000	3116000	That is
3116000	3117000	Then there is cc
3118000	3119000	In this case
3119000	3121000	When you combine these two items
3122000	3124000	Sigma plus plus sigma minus is sigma x
3124000	3126000	So it will automatically become
3126000	3127000	Sigma x
3127000	3128000	A plus B
3128000	3129000	That is
3129000	3131000	You drive two second-order sidebands
3131000	3132000	It will become
3132000	3134000	Control beam speaker
3136000	3137000	That is
3137000	3138000	That is to say
3138000	3139000	Because
3139000	3141000	We know that in terms of food
3141000	3142000	You are going through this
3142000	3143000	That is
3143000	3144000	You are you are
3144000	3145000	When you expand that
3145000	3146000	Lanadaiki parameter
3146000	3147000	Can allow all kinds of
3147000	3148000	All kinds of interactions
3149000	3150000	You don't just open carrier
3150000	3151000	Just
3151000	3152000	It's not just a sideband
3152000	3153000	You can go all the way up
3153000	3154000	Right
3154000	3155000	Which day is this thing
3155000	3156000	Paper
3156000	3157000	It is
3159000	3162000	This is it
3162000	3164000	I think this is still
3164000	3165000	Oh that's it
3171000	3172000	This one
3172000	3175000	This is the theoretical basis of the experiment
3177000	3180000	It should be said that it is the experimental
3180000	3181000	Toolbox
3181000	3183000	I think the theoretical basis is how to say
3183000	3185000	What is the theoretical basis of the experiment
3185000	3187000	The theoretical basis of the experiment is
3189000	3190000	You can say that the theoretical basis
3190000	3191000	The point is this
3191000	3192000	That is to say we
3192000	3193000	If we want to measure
3193000	3194000	If this is the case
3194000	3195000	That's 2001
3195000	3196000	Some people say
3196000	3197000	Hey
3197000	3198000	In theory, if you have this gate
3198000	3199000	We can do this
3199000	3200000	Then this is great
3200000	3201000	Correct
3201000	3202000	Then we can do this
3202000	3203000	Right
3203000	3204000	That
3204000	3206000	The reason why this thing is done
3208000	3209000	I
3209000	3210000	I think the reason why this thing is done
3210000	3212000	It can be said that the one just now is right
3213000	3214000	But
3214000	3215000	Oh
3215000	3216000	This one
3216000	3217000	This should be 2017
3217000	3218000	2016
3218000	3219000	Right
3219000	3220000	But the problem is coming
3221000	3222000	You get it through that one
3222000	3223000	It's called control
3223000	3224000	It's called control
3224000	3225000	It's called control
3225000	3226000	How to integrate
3226000	3227000	It's called control
3227000	3228000	It's called control
3228000	3229000	It's called control
3229000	3230000	It's called control
3230000	3231000	This one
3231000	3232000	2001
3232000	3233000	Or in 2002
3234000	3235000	2001
3235000	3236000	It is said that someone
3236000	3237000	In theory
3237000	3238000	Do this thing
3238000	3239000	But in practice
3239000	3240000	By 2016
3240000	3241000	17 years
3241000	3242000	Just come out
3242000	3243000	This is what it is
3244000	3245000	Right
3245000	3246000	Really
3246000	3247000	So
3249000	3250000	It is how to integrate
3250000	3250000	
3250000	3252000	This is reasonably early
3252000	3253000	Someone picked it up
3254000	3255000	Of course
3255000	3256000	I don't know where it is
3256000	3257000	I didn't find out until I found this
3257000	3258000	Otherwise
3258000	3259000	Then I thought
3259000	3260000	Because
3260000	3261000	Our time is
3261000	3262000	Paper of 2018
3262000	3263000	Is to do control
3263000	3264000	But then I thought
3264000	3265000	How to do the next step
3265000	3266000	I don't want to say
3266000	3267000	We should do cswap
3267000	3268000	But how to do
3268000	3269000	I don't know
3269000	3270000	Because I want to say
3270000	3271000	That waste time
3271000	3272000	Can't be eliminated
3272000	3273000	Then I thought
3273000	3274000	Someone said he already thought
3274000	3275000	How to eliminate
3275000	3276000	That is to do it on the experiment
3276000	3277000	Then write a model
3277000	3278000	It proves that it works
3278000	3279000	Then do it
3279000	3280000	Right
3281000	3282000	It is a
3282000	3283000	Quite a lot
3283000	3284000	Background process
3284000	3285000	That's right
3285000	3286000	So
3286000	3287000	It's just that you simply say
3287000	3288000	How to do control
3288000	3289000	Hit two lasers
3289000	3290000	The frequency difference between it
3290000	3291000	490 respectively
3291000	3292000	380 or 490 respectively
3292000	3293000	It will become a
3293000	3294000	Control
3294000	3295000	Control
3295000	3296000	But
3296000	3297000	why
3297000	3298000	Two
3298000	3299000	Control
3299000	3300000	Combine
3300000	3301000	Can become a cswap
3301000	3302000	This thing
3302000	3303000	It's not that obvious
3303000	3304000	Right
3304000	3305000	Need a little math
3305000	3306000	Right
3307000	3308000	Right
3308000	3309000	Then
3309000	3310000	Let's
3310000	3311000	Right
3311000	3312000	Right
3312000	3313000	The omega ab
3313000	3314000	Is
3314000	3315000	Above
3315000	3316000	Omega b
3316000	3317000	Omega c
3317000	3318000	Omega a
3318000	3319000	Right
3319000	3320000	Right
3320000	3321000	Then omega
3321000	3322000	ac
3322000	3323000	Omega c
3323000	3324000	Omega a
3324000	3325000	Right
3325000	3326000	That's right
3326000	3327000	I want to ask
3327000	3328000	Just like
3328000	3329000	We look at this
3329000	3330000	Mode
3330000	3331000	abc
3332000	3333000	Obviously
3333000	3334000	b and c
3334000	3335000	Feel like
3335000	3336000	Orthogonal
3336000	3337000	But
3337000	3338000	Your side
3338000	3339000	a and b
3339000	3340000	a and c
3340000	3342000	Is it orthogonal to each other?
3344000	3345000	These are all normal mode
3345000	3346000	All normal mode
3346000	3347000	He is
3347000	3348000	Orthogonal
3348000	3349000	One
3349000	3350000	Orthogonal
3350000	3351000	OK
3351000	3352000	Because normal mode
3352000	3353000	It's you
3353000	3354000	You solve it
3354000	3355000	Between them
3355000	3356000	There is no linear
3356000	3357000	Dependent relationship
3357000	3358000	Right
3358000	3359000	Understand
3359000	3360000	Then you said before
3360000	3361000	You choose
3361000	3362000	ab
3362000	3363000	With ac
3363000	3364000	The two
3364000	3366000	Interaction
3366000	3367000	Hey
3367000	3368000	What is it
3368000	3369000	Special reasons
3369000	3370000	Like
3370000	3371000	In
3371000	3372000	You are in the front page
3372000	3373000	The first slide
3373000	3374000	There
3374000	3375000	You can choose
3375000	3376000	a b a c
3376000	3377000	Right
3377000	3378000	You ask
3378000	3379000	OK
3379000	3380000	This is the reason for choosing
3380000	3381000	That is to say
3383000	3384000	Mode c is coherent
3384000	3385000	We look
3385000	3386000	Let's look at it from this page
3386000	3387000	That is to say
3387000	3388000	You will find mode a and mode b
3388000	3389000	Is a
3389000	3390000	It's all face
3390000	3391000	The two of them
3391000	3392000	Vibration direction is opposite
3392000	3393000	That is
3393000	3394000	You will find
3394000	3395000	Although they are both
3395000	3396000	One vibrates in the y-direction
3396000	3397000	One vibrates in the x-direction
3397000	3399000	They are both anti-vibration
3399000	3401000	Only mode c is the same vibration
3401000	3402000	What will happen
3402000	3403000	The problem is
3403000	3404000	The coherence time of mode c
3404000	3405000	Is the shortest
3405000	3406000	The shortest
3406000	3407000	Because you vibrate in the same direction
3407000	3408000	Easy to get noise
3408000	3409000	With all kinds of strange effects
3409000	3410000	So the coherence time of mode c
3410000	3411000	The shortest
3411000	3412000	So compare it
3412000	3413000	We have to
3413000	3414000	Let a and b interact first
3414000	3415000	Then let
3415000	3416000	Then let c come up at the end
3416000	3417000	This is what we found
3417000	3418000	This kind of performance is better
3418000	3419000	That is
3419000	3420000	A mode and b mode
3420000	3421000	Is a better mode
3421000	3422000	So we let it do
3422000	3423000	After the thing
3423000	3424000	Then let c come up at the end
3424000	3425000	Right
3425000	3426000	This is
3426000	3427000	Why
3427000	3428000	Because he
3428000	3429000	He
3429000	3430000	He
3430000	3431000	He
3431000	3432000	He
3432000	3433000	Because he
3433000	3434000	These modes
3434000	3435000	The
3435000	3437000	Coherence time
3437000	3438000	Is determined by what
3438000	3439000	Not the same
3439000	3440000	He
3440000	3441000	A big part
3441000	3442000	A big part
3442000	3443000	Is either out of phase
3443000	3444000	Or in-phase
3444000	3445000	Is
3445000	3446000	Tonight
3446000	3447000	The
3447000	3448500	Vibration
3448500	3450000	K2 rotation
3450000	3451000	Is a vertical vibration
3451000	3452000	K2 rotation
3452000	3453000	Is an inront vibration
3453000	3454000	Now this mode c
3454000	3455000	Is an index vibration
3455000	3456000	It's so vibrant
3456000	3457000	Is
3457000	3458000	When this particle
3458000	3459000	Moves to this side
3459000	3460000	This one would move there
3460000	3461000	But if we use mode b and mode a
3462000	3463000	So
3463000	3464000	Compared to
3464000	3465000	If you have a noise outside
3465000	3466000	When it comes
3466000	3467000	A and b basically
3467000	3468000	Will not be affected
3468000	3469000	But c will be affected
3469000	3470000	So c coherence time
3470000	3471000	The shortest
3475000	3476000	This is why we
3478000	3479000	Of course there is a d
3479000	3480000	But we later chose
3480000	3481000	Just choose to use a b c
3481000	3482000	Just ignore it
3482000	3483000	We use a b and a c
3483000	3484000	To do this action
3485000	3486000	So
3486000	3487000	So we
3488000	3489000	You say sorry first
3489000	3490000	We are in our time
3490000	3491000	That is to say
3491000	3492000	Our a
3493000	3494000	b this
3494000	3495000	Bitter
3495000	3496000	The particle is better than a c
3496000	3498000	Because a and b are all good modes
3498000	3499000	a c has a mode
3500000	3501000	So
3501000	3502000	It's better
3502000	3503000	That's right
3504000	3506000	Assuming another d
3506000	3507000	It's a bit like
3507000	3508000	Mode a
3508000	3510000	But it's the same vibration
3511000	3512000	Yes that's right
3512000	3513000	That's it
3513000	3514000	OK OK
3514000	3515000	Then that one
3515000	3517000	The coherence is also very bad
3517000	3518000	It's not good
3518000	3519000	The reason it's worse
3519000	3521000	It's the same as what you just explained
3521000	3522000	Yes
3522000	3523000	So it's the same
3523000	3524000	It's the same
3524000	3525000	Understand
3525000	3526000	It's the same
3526000	3528000	If it is in phase vibration
3528000	3529000	It's easier to pick up all kinds of noise
3529000	3531000	Then it's easy to pick up noise
3532000	3533000	Because
3533000	3534000	It's hard for us to find a source
3534000	3535000	Is
3535000	3536000	In such a small space
3536000	3538000	It actually kicked in two directions
3538000	3539000	So you assume
3539000	3540000	You suddenly have a burst coming today
3540000	3541000	Or you have one today
3541000	3542000	Your this
3542000	3543000	Your this
3543000	3544000	If source has a noise
3544000	3545000	When it comes
3545000	3546000	It
3546000	3547000	Maybe
3547000	3548000	Oh
3548000	3549000	Understand
3549000	3550000	It's just
3550000	3551000	It's just
3551000	3552000	It has a negative effect on mode c
3552000	3553000	But it doesn't affect a and b
3553000	3554000	Basically
3554000	3555000	Because a and b are opposite
3555000	3556000	It's impossible to be in this direction
3556000	3557000	Give you two opposite kicks
3557000	3558000	It's not possible
3558000	3559000	It's not possible
3559000	3560000	So
3560000	3561000	So
3562000	3563000	This noise source
3563000	3564000	It's with his special
3564000	3565000	Because he's in
3565000	3566000	His mode
3566000	3567000	This one
3567000	3568000	Is it related
3568000	3569000	Is
3569000	3570000	Because of his
3570000	3571000	On the space
3571000	3572000	Really in position
3573000	3574000	And really
3574000	3575000	Cause his
3575000	3576000	Is the source of this noise
3578000	3579000	You can think of it as
3579000	3580000	He is today
3580000	3581000	He is in
3581000	3582000	Uh
3583000	3584000	He's in
3584000	3585000	He's like a swing
3585000	3586000	Such a positive direction
3586000	3587000	And then if you have one today
3587000	3588000	If the wave of Sinusoid comes
3588000	3589000	It will be kicked
3589000	3591000	It will be accelerated or decelerated
3591000	3592000	But
3592000	3593000	If you compare today
3593000	3594000	You suddenly have a Sinusoid in your space
3594000	3595000	This one
3595000	3596000	EM wave
3596000	3597000	But it doesn't affect mode a and mode b
3597000	3598000	Because
3598000	3599000	He can't drive him
3599000	3600000	He can't
3600000	3601000	He can't
3601000	3602000	He can't increase his phonon
3603000	3604000	Yeah yeah yeah
3604000	3605000	Really
3605000	3606000	OK
3606000	3607000	Oh
3607000	3608000	His energy won't be like this
3608000	3609000	OK
3609000	3610000	Oh
3610000	3611000	So interesting
3611000	3612000	Oh
3612000	3613000	Yeah
3613000	3614000	This is
3614000	3615000	This is the details of the experiment
3615000	3616000	It's in this place
3616000	3617000	That's right
3617000	3618000	Why do we
3618000	3619000	Don't choose ABC
3619000	3620000	Because this is the best choice
3620000	3621000	Yeah
3622000	3623000	Yeah
3623000	3624000	I can ask a little bit
3624000	3625000	That's what you didn't mention
3625000	3627000	That's the readout part
3628000	3629000	Is there
3629000	3630000	OK
3630000	3631000	Our readout part is
3631000	3632000	Uh
3632000	3633000	Our
3633000	3634000	The real readout in the experiment
3634000	3635000	Is that we actually
3635000	3636000	It's just a spin
3636000	3637000	You see here
3637000	3638000	The readout is only on this side
3639000	3640000	We can do it
3640000	3641000	We
3641000	3642000	We can do it
3642000	3643000	This
3643000	3644000	Readout b and c
3644000	3645000	but
3645000	3646000	Our
3646000	3647000	The selling point of this experiment is that
3647000	3648000	We are constant dips
3648000	3649000	Then we don't need
3649000	3650000	Measure b and c
3651000	3652000	But in fact
3652000	3653000	If you really prepared a state
3653000	3654000	How do you measure it
3654000	3655000	You go
3655000	3656000	You just go straight to drive
3656000	3657000	This
3657000	3658000	Read the sideband
3658000	3659000	Then look at his fit
3659000	3660000	Just
3660000	3661000	You just go straight to drive
3661000	3662000	His sideband
3662000	3663000	Then look at him
3663000	3664000	0, 1, 2, 3
3665000	3666000	This thing can be done directly
3666000	3668000	But we don't want to do this either
3668000	3669000	We just want to go straight
3669000	3670000	Look at the spin
3670000	3672000	You can see how similar b and c are
3672000	3674000	This is the goal of our experiment
3675000	3676000	In fact
3676000	3677000	In fact, here
3677000	3678000	Say this
3678000	3679000	Measurement
3679000	3680000	That is to say
3681000	3682000	It's very standard
3683000	3684000	Uh
3684000	3685000	This is the same as the general
3685000	3686000	It's the same as the general
3686000	3687000	Just
3687000	3688000	Just use this
3688000	3689000	State detection
3689000	3690000	Then
3690000	3692000	You can use the sideband to see how much he has
3692000	3693000	Phonon in
3693000	3694000	In
3694000	3695000	In each number ratio
3695000	3696000	Right
3697000	3698000	Um
3698000	3699000	Understand
3703000	3704000	Oh, there's another one
3704000	3705000	I just mentioned this
3705000	3706000	So
3706000	3707000	I said this is 1.2 seconds, right?
3707000	3708000	But
3708000	3709000	If you find out
3709000	3710000	You'll find this
3711000	3713000	The first one here is how long his gay time is
3713000	3715000	His whole paten's gay time
3715000	3717000	The paten here is his
3717000	3719000	His paten is only half paten
3719000	3720000	But his face is different
3720000	3721000	Let's ignore the face now
3721000	3722000	Don't look
3722000	3723000	You'll find that he's longer here
3723000	3724000	It's shorter here
3724000	3726000	Because we know this
3727000	3728000	A and B are all good
3728000	3729000	So A and B
3730000	3731000	It takes a longer time
3731000	3732000	He's less likely to happen
3732000	3733000	There's a problem with A and C
3733000	3734000	So he
3734000	3735000	We only gave him half the time
3736000	3737000	That is
3737000	3738000	We know we have to
3738000	3739000	One control
3739000	3740000	Is running full paten
3740000	3741000	The other one is running half paten
3741000	3742000	Then we put
3742000	3744000	The better one is running full paten
3744000	3745000	So this part here
3745000	3747000	It takes 0.8 milliseconds
3747000	3748000	This is 0.4
3748000	3749000	So 0.8
3749000	3750000	Divided by 0.4
3750000	3751000	0.8 plus 0.4
3752000	3753000	So 0.8 is here
3753000	3755000	This is the number
3762000	3763000	That's right
3765000	3767000	Does anyone else have any questions?
3775000	3776000	I think
3777000	3778000	Like you
3778000	3779000	Sorry
3779000	3780000	Ted, please ask
3780000	3781000	Sorry
3781000	3783000	I have a lot of questions
3783000	3784000	This
3784000	3785000	This
3785000	3786000	You
3786000	3787000	I'm just going to ask this picture
3787000	3788000	You just stopped here
3788000	3789000	He
3789000	3790000	Stay here
3790000	3791000	His this
3792000	3793000	M12345
3793000	3794000	His this
3794000	3795000	You
3795000	3796000	You have a picture later
3796000	3797000	He is
3797000	3799000	Is he a coherent state?
3799000	3800000	In Fonin's
3800000	3801000	Spectrum
3801000	3803000	He's a coherent state
3803000	3804000	This
3804000	3805000	Here we are
3805000	3806000	Prepare
3806000	3807000	Fog
3807000	3808000	Fog
3808000	3809000	Then let it overlap
3809000	3810000	But because of our
3810000	3811000	Fog
3811000	3812000	I can't prepare well
3812000	3813000	In a very high Fonin
3813000	3814000	So
3814000	3815000	The difference in performance here
3815000	3816000	It's not our
3816000	3817000	Control
3817000	3818000	The difference in performance
3818000	3819000	It's because we can't
3819000	3820000	A very good one
3820000	3821000	Fog
3821000	3822000	Five
3822000	3823000	The state is right
3823000	3824000	OK
3824000	3825000	So he's not a state preparation
3825000	3826000	The problem
3826000	3827000	He is
3827000	3828000	He is
3828000	3829000	He is
3829000	3830000	The problem
3830000	3831000	I see
3831000	3832000	We did it later
3832000	3833000	We did all kinds of simulations
3833000	3834000	What does it include
3835000	3836000	We found
3836000	3837000	In
3839000	3840000	When n is equal to 5
3840000	3842000	If the state preparation is perfect
3842000	3843000	Plus all kinds of noise
3843000	3845000	With all kinds of problems
3845000	3846000	His Fog
3846000	3847000	It should be 90%
3847000	3848000	Even if n is equal to 5
3848000	3849000	But we see here
3849000	3850000	In fact, his Fog
3850000	3851000	It's about 50%
3851000	3852000	The middle
3852000	3853000	Most of the problems are in
3853000	3854000	State preparation
3854000	3855000	That's right
3855000	3856000	I see
3856000	3857000	Thank you
3860000	3861000	This is where you can do
3861000	3862000	Overlap
3862000	3863000	And then this is where you can do
3863000	3864000	This
3864000	3865000	Coherent state
3865000	3866000	That's right
3868000	3869000	I think the radar map is still
3869000	3870000	It looks pretty interesting
3870000	3871000	This radar map
3871000	3872000	It's actually a circle
3872000	3873000	That's what we
3873000	3874000	Every experiment is to draw a circle
3874000	3875000	And then draw it
3875000	3876000	The place of the circle
3876000	3877000	In
3877000	3878000	It's a beautiful radar map
3878000	3879000	And then he
3879000	3880000	That's it
3880000	3881000	Here
3881000	3882000	And then
3882000	3883000	You'll always see
3883000	3884000	There's a
3884000	3885000	It's not a beautiful place
3885000	3886000	This is what we found
3886000	3887000	That's right
3887000	3888000	You think you only drive
3889000	3890000	One direction
3890000	3891000	Coherent state
3891000	3892000	It's not
3892000	3893000	The experiment is not so perfect
3893000	3894000	He's going in the opposite direction
3894000	3895000	A little bit of stuff
3895000	3896000	That's right
3896000	3897000	So here's a little bit
3897000	3898000	It looks like that
3898000	3899000	The dirty stuff is here
3899000	3900000	That's
3900000	3901000	That's existence
3901000	3902000	That's right
3905000	3906000	And then here
3906000	3907000	We don't draw radar maps
3907000	3908000	Because this thing
3908000	3909000	Its
3909000	3910000	The form of expression
3910000	3911000	This is better
3914000	3915000	So
3915000	3917000	How did you generate that
3917000	3919000	That's Omega A and Omega B
3919000	3921000	Omega AB and Omega
3921000	3922000	AC
3923000	3924000	I remember you said
3924000	3925000	You use Pulse Laser
3926000	3927000	That's right
3927000	3928000	You
3928000	3929000	Pulse Laser, for example, is
3929000	3930000	After a frequency
3930000	3931000	How do we operate it
3931000	3933000	That is, we let it pass through AOM
3933000	3934000	After you pass through AOM
3934000	3935000	You can
3935000	3936000	You can operate the frequency of AOM
3936000	3937000	It will
3937000	3938000	It will shift to different places
3938000	3939000	That's right
3939000	3940000	That is, we use AOM to
3940000	3942000	To control the frequency of the laser
3943000	3944000	That is
3944000	3945000	The whole laser
3945000	3946000	It might be
3946000	3947000	For example, 369.58
3947000	3948000	Something like that
3948000	3949000	Assuming this number
3949000	3950000	Then you want it to become
3950000	3952000	369.58 plus 380kHz
3952000	3953000	Then you let your AOM
3953000	3954000	Have
3955000	3956000	You just let your AOM shift it
3956000	3957000	It will
3957000	3958000	It will shift away
3958000	3959000	OK
3962000	3964000	In fact, this
3966000	3967000	Of course it's a whole
3967000	3968000	A whole laser thing
3968000	3969000	But we're talking about it now
3969000	3970000	It's all
3970000	3971000	It's all good
3971000	3972000	It's okay
3972000	3973000	That's right
3976000	3977000	Let me confirm it again
3977000	3978000	This thing is
3978000	3979000	Your Pulse Laser
3979000	3980000	Your Pulse Laser
3980000	3981000	How long is it
3984000	3985000	Three hundred
3985000	3987000	Three hundred and sixty something
3987000	3988000	Three hundred
3988000	3989000	Three hundred
3989000	3990000	Or 370
3994000	3996000	It should be 375 times
3996000	3997000	This number
3997000	3998000	I'm going to check it out
3998000	3999000	Because
3999000	4000000	I remember more
4000000	4001000	It's 369
4001000	4002000	Because that is
4002000	4003000	Static connection will be needed
4004000	4005000	No, no
4005000	4006000	That is
4006000	4007000	We
4007000	4008000	What do you think
4008000	4009000	He asked
4009000	4010000	He may
4010000	4011000	Jason may be asking you
4011000	4012000	That Pulse Laser
4012000	4013000	Pulse Width
4013000	4014000	How much
4014000	4015000	Yes, yes, yes, Pulse Width
4015000	4016000	What is it
4017000	4018000	You mean
4018000	4019000	Oh, we're Pico Second
4019000	4020000	I forgot how many Pico Seconds
4021000	4022000	OK
4022000	4023000	You mean
4023000	4024000	You mean time is right
4024000	4025000	OK
4025000	4026000	Yes, yes, yes
4026000	4027000	We're pretty standard
4027000	4028000	But I forgot
4028000	4029000	I forgot how many Pico Seconds
4029000	4030000	I remember his time scale
4030000	4031000	It's right there
4032000	4033000	Uh-huh
4033000	4034000	Right
4035000	4036000	Uh-huh
4036000	4037000	Right
4039000	4040000	Uh-huh
4040000	4041000	I don't really understand this
4041000	4042000	You are a
4042000	4043000	You are a
4043000	4044000	Pico Second Laser
4044000	4045000	Pico Second Laser
4045000	4046000	Then its bandwidth
4046000	4047000	Then its bandwidth
4047000	4048000	There may be
4048000	4049000	About one nanometer
4049000	4050000	About one nanometer
4050000	4051000	But your
4051000	4052000	But your
4052000	4053000	OK
4053000	4054000	But your
4054000	4055000	But your
4055000	4056000	Atomic Transition
4056000	4057000	Isn't it all
4057000	4058000	Atomic Transition
4058000	4059000	We are
4059000	4060000	We are
4060000	4061000	We are
4061000	4062000	But we are
4062000	4063000	Because
4063000	4064000	This is the feature of Frequency Com
4064000	4065000	Frequency Com means
4065000	4066000	You have today
4067000	4068000	You have today
4068000	4069000	Uh, wait a minute
4069000	4070000	I'll take a pen
4070000	4071000	I'll take a pen
4074000	4075000	Frequency Com features
4075000	4076000	You're here today
4076000	4077000	And then you have a middle
4077000	4078000	And then you have a middle
4078000	4079000	But because you're running out of time
4079000	4080000	But because you're running out of time
4080000	4081000	A bunch of
4081000	4082000	A bunch of
4082000	4083000	Right
4084000	4085000	But
4085000	4086000	But
4086000	4087000	The advantage of this experiment is
4087000	4088000	The advantage of this experiment is
4088000	4089000	You don't have to care
4089000	4090000	Because you use another
4090000	4091000	Because you use another
4091000	4092000	You split this laser
4093000	4094000	So it's
4094000	4095000	Because it is
4095000	4096000	So you share it
4096000	4097000	Because it is
4097000	4098000	He's gon na grow up like this
4098000	4099000	Because it is
4099000	4100000	Frequency Com
4100000	4101000	Then two Frequency Com
4101000	4102000	Then two Frequency Com
4102000	4104000	For example, if I lost one
4104000	4105000	And this one is
4105000	4107000	Then this one is
4107000	4108000	Then this one
4108000	4109000	You can risk it
4109000	4110000	So
4110000	4111000	The point is that
4111000	4112000	Although it is a pile of
4112000	4113000	But the point is
4113000	4114000	But the point is
4114000	4115000	His
4115000	4116000	His relative
4116000	4117000	Whether it's fixed
4117000	4118000	It doesn't matter if both of them are on the left side
4118000	4119000	It doesn't matter if both of them are on the left side
4119000	4121000	It's the
4121000	4122000	His
4122000	4123000	His
4123000	4124000	The point is that
4124000	4125000	Your
4125000	4126000	Your
4126000	4127000	AOM
4127000	4128000	Shift it to the point
4128000	4129000	Is it because
4129000	4130000	Because it is
4130000	4131000	Equal spacing
4131000	4132000	That is to say, the middle of it is
4132000	4133000	Equal spacing
4133000	4134000	You just let the first one
4134000	4135000	For example, with
4135000	4136000	We actually let the first one
4136000	4137000	With the 166th
4137000	4138000	Will
4138000	4139000	Resonance
4139000	4140000	OK
4140000	4141000	That is
4141000	4142000	Yes, we actually do it
4142000	4143000	166 is right
4143000	4144000	But in fact, you think
4144000	4145000	The tenth one should be fine
4145000	4146000	But we choose the 166th
4146000	4147000	So
4147000	4148000	In fact, this one
4148000	4149000	Will be with a very far
4149000	4150000	Here
4151000	4152000	So this one
4152000	4153000	Will be with the first
4153000	4154000	For example, 165
4154000	4155000	Resonance
4155000	4156000	But
4156000	4157000	Because they are from the same laser
4157000	4158000	So
4158000	4159000	If this frequency
4159000	4160000	When the left shift
4160000	4161000	The one below will be left shift
4161000	4162000	It doesn't matter
4162000	4163000	As long as they are relative
4163000	4164000	Just lock it
4164000	4165000	They
4165000	4166000	It doesn't matter if it shifts
4166000	4167000	That's right
4167000	4168000	His
4168000	4169000	His
4169000	4170000	His absolute shift
4170000	4171000	It doesn't matter
4171000	4172000	So why do you hear me
4172000	4173000	I don't seem to remember
4173000	4174000	His absolute wavelength
4174000	4175000	His absolute wavelength is about the same
4175000	4176000	The result you came out today is
4176000	4177000	Your central frequency today
4177000	4178000	Is 369
4178000	4179000	Or 369.5
4179000	4180000	369.5
4180000	4181000	Anyway, what he came out of
4181000	4182000	Is stable
4182000	4183000	Then
4183000	4184000	Our focus is on whether I can
4184000	4185000	His ALM
4185000	4186000	His two
4186000	4187000	Relative is not stable
4187000	4188000	This is more important
4188000	4189000	Understand
4189000	4190000	OK
4199000	4200000	OK
4200000	4202000	If you don't have any questions for the time being
4202000	4204000	Thank you first
4205000	4207000	Then I will finish this video first
