00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira Talk on November 14th.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We are honored to have Yuli Xue as our speaker today.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
She is currently a post-doctoral researcher at the University of New South Wales.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Her doctoral program is at Purdue University, EECS.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Her research focuses on physics and the defects in semiconductors.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Her research focuses on simulation, but has a close relationship with experiments.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Today's topic is the relaxation process of donor spin-tubing in silica.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Before we get started, let's give Yuli a round of applause.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now we will hand over to Yuli.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Today I will be talking about how to use donor spin-tubing as a quantum computer.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And how the relaxation process plays an important role.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There are five parts to this talk.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The first part is about quantum computing.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There are many different types of quantum computing.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Some people use superconducting qubits, others use topological qubits.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Today I will focus on semiconductor qubits.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will be using donor spin-tubing as a quantum computer.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Next I will talk about spin relaxation.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What does it have to do with quantum computing?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How does it help to calculate spin relaxation time?

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Next I will talk about how to calculate spin relaxation time.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Lastly, I will talk about the results of the experiment.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The first part is about quantum computing.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are the differences between classical and quantum computers?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
For classical qubits, you can only choose either 0 or 1.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
For quantum qubits, you can choose either 0 or 1.

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This means that when you operate on quantum qubits, you can operate on 0 and 1 at the same time.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you only have a single qubit, it doesn't seem very powerful.

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
However, if you have two qubits, you can operate on four states.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Quantum computers can operate on these four states at the same time.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you have n qubits, you can operate on 2n qubits at the same time.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is very powerful.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you want to solve the riddle, you can try the first method.

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If it doesn't work, you can try the second method.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If it doesn't work, you can try the third method.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Quantum computers can try 100 methods at a time.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Quantum computers can solve complex problems in a short time.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Quantum computers can be used widely.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
For example, data security, database search, quantum chemistry, or machine learning.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Next, I will introduce the most basic unit of quantum computers.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Quantum computers are mainly composed of 0 and 1 like classical qubits.

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Quantum computers can operate on 0 and 1 at the same time.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We use the block sphere as a representation.

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Quantum computers can not only operate on two qubits, but also on a channel or other points.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This information is very important.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Quantum computers can use quantum operators such as linear or horizontal derivatives.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Quantum computers can also use quantum operators such as electron spin, downspin, offspin, nuclear spin, or upspin, downspin.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Quantum computers can also use quantum operators such as electron ground state and first excited state.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For example, if we take electron spin as an example,

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
1 is upspin, 0 is downspin.

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is our single qubit.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
First, we need to add magnetic field.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Electron spin is a magnet.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
When it is parallel to the magnetic field or in the opposite direction, its energy will be different.

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When the energy of the magnetic field is split, the two states are separated.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If we want to operate electron spin, we can add an AC magnetic field.

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If the frequency of the AC magnetic field and the energy of the AC magnetic field are matched,

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
a resonance will occur.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The resonance will go from 1 to 0, then to 1, then to 0, then to 1.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The definition of qubit operation is the time evolution of two coherent states.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
For example, we can measure the qubit after a certain period of time.

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We will find that the qubit is originally in state 1, but after a certain period of time, it becomes 0.

63
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In this way, we can realize the NOT gate in logic design.

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1.

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is our single qubit operation.

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If we have two qubits, the most famous gate is called CNOT gate.

67
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CNOT gate means that when we have control qubit, control bit and target bit,

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
when the control bit is 0, the input is 0 and 1, and the output is 0 and 1.

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When the control bit is 1, the input is 0 and 1, and the output is 0 and 1.

70
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is CNOT gate.

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How to use electron spin?

72
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There is an interaction between two electron spins called exchange interaction.

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If they work, it means that when the control spin is in the up spin and it is in the down spin,

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the effect of the second electron spin is different.

75
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How is it different?

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
For example, when you turn to this channel, the speed of the precessed channel will be different.

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
For example, after tau z, the spin turns half a circle.

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When you measure, the spin is still in the down spin.

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But in this case, because the control spin is different from the other direction,

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the spin turns faster.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because of the interaction, the spin turns faster.

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
For example, after tau z, the spin turns half a circle.

83
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
When you measure, the spin is in the up spin.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Originally, the spin is in the down spin, but now it is in the up spin.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
One spin is not changed, and the other spin is changed.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is how CNOT gate is realized.

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If we have a single qubit gate and CNOT gate,

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we can do quantum computation,

89
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
which is to realize a universal quantum computation.

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Next, we will introduce the donor spin qubit.

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For example, we need an electron spin to store 0 and 1.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But we need to localize the electron spin.

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
For example, there are so many electrons in silicon solid.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How do we know which one we want to control?

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The concept is that the silicon and the phosphorus are next to each other.

96
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
One has 14 electrons, and the other has 15 electrons.

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When you take out a silicon and replace it with phosphorus,

98
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
it will have one more electron.

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In this way, the electron will go around the sphere.

100
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The premise is that the electron will not run away at low temperature.

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If it is at high temperature, it will run away when the energy is high.

102
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is our main structure.

103
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The advantage is that the strain is very small.

104
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It does not squeeze to the side.

105
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because they are next to each other, the quality is very close.

106
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In 1998, Bruce Kane proposed this proposal.

107
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He said that he wanted to put phosphorus in a certain position,

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
confine an electron, and use it as a quantum computer.

109
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
First, we need to encode 0 and 1 in the electron's up-spin and down-spin,

110
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
or in the donor's up-spin and down-spin, or in the nuclear's up-spin and down-spin.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Next, we need a low temperature.

112
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This way, the electron will run around here.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How do we realize the single-qubit gate and the two-qubit gate?

114
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
For the single-qubit gate, we can use the magnetic field of the AC.

115
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We try to have resonance with it.

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The resonance frequency can be controlled by the gate above.

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
For example, if the gate is positive, the electron will be sucked up.

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
In this way, the resonance frequency will change.

119
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When the electron is sucked up, the distance between it and the nucleus is large,

120
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and the interaction between them is small.

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The interaction will affect the resonance frequency.

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In this way, for example,

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
if the two-qubit gate is coupled with a different bias,

124
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the two-qubit gate will have different resonance frequencies.

125
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If we only want to operate the left-hand qubit,

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,000
we can tune the magnetic field of the AC to match the resonance frequency.

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
At this time, only the left-hand qubit will rotate,

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and the right-hand qubit will not be affected.

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In this way, we can operate the left-hand qubit or the right-hand qubit.

130
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
As for the two-qubit gate,

131
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
as mentioned earlier, the two electrons will have an exchange interaction.

132
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If the J-gate in the middle does not turn on,

133
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the two qubits will not interact.

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Their interaction is very weak.

135
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
For example, if I add a qubit and suck two electrons in the middle,

136
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
their wave function overlap will be very large,

137
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and their interaction will be very strong.

138
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Then we can do the so-called C-knot gate.

139
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Can you tell me how much is the ionization energy of this electron?

140
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Or if you can use the photon frequency,

141
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and what is the energy of the splitting next to it?

142
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
First of all, the ionization energy is 45.6 mEV.

143
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So mEV is about gigahertz,

144
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
which is about this range.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
For the Zeeman splitting,

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
the Zeeman splitting of the electron is also about 0.1 to 1 mEV.

147
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If your magnetic field is between 1 Tesla to 10 Tesla,

148
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
your Zeeman splitting is also in the range of gigahertz.

149
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If it is a nuclear spin,

150
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
then the Zeeman splitting will be about 1000 times smaller.

151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't tell me that your temperature is 100 mC.

152
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Isn't that a bit too high?

153
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Your thermal radiation seems to be in this range.

154
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Too high.

155
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because if it is 1K,

156
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
it is about 100 gigahertz.

157
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So if it is 100 mC,

158
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
it is about 10 gigahertz.

159
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
A little higher than you.

160
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Isn't that too high?

161
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You mean the energy difference is too small, right?

162
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, I mean,

163
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
in the environment of 100 mC photon bath,

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
all your states can be randomized.

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Or you can analyze them directly.

166
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sorry.

167
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ted, your microphone is on.

169
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There seems to be some noise over there.

170
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Can you mute it directly?

171
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay, I will mute it directly.

172
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You can continue to discuss.

173
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You mean photon or phonon?

174
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Photon.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I just want to know

176
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
where is your operating energy scale now.

177
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So what is the temperature of your environment

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to become the so-called environment without interference?

179
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There should be no photon here.

180
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No, there are photons everywhere, right?

181
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It should be phonon.

182
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But it is phonon.

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It should be phonon.

184
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, even if you are in the cryostat,

185
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
there will be thermal radiation if there is temperature.

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Right?

187
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Otherwise, how do you define vacuum temperature?

189
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Thermal radiation.

190
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is what the theorists are talking about now.

191
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
In the end, there may be real problems in the experiment.

192
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We will see its performance later.

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay, let me see if I can finish later.

194
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Actually, I am quite curious about the different approaches.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
For example, what is the difference between the cryostat and the constraint?

196
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I am mainly curious about this.

197
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Sorry, I am not sure if I can answer your question.

198
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But we can discuss it later.

199
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay, we can discuss it later.

200
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you.

201
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I have a question here.

202
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hello.

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hi.

204
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I have a question.

205
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I think B and TESLA are quite big.

206
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why are they so different?

207
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why are they so different?

208
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

209
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The first B is for z-splitting.

210
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The first B is for z-splitting.

211
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It is connected to the resonance frequency.

212
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,140
It is connected to the resonance frequency.

213
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,900
It shows how much the AC magnetic field is.

214
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
However, its strength is different.

215
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Its strength is depend on the Robeot oscillation.

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,900
But, its strength is quite slow eventually.

217
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,000
You don't have to be fast to use Robeot oscillation.

218
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because

219
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So, your BAC will correspond to the size of the off-diagonal term.

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes.

221
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What is B?

222
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
B is the size of the Zeeman speeding.

223
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It is the inch gap.

224
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes.

225
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ok.

226
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I am curious.

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why don't you need to use Robeot oscillation?

228
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I am not sure how much T1 and T2 are in this system.

229
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Can you tell me the number?

230
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why don't you want the quantum gate to be faster?

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I am a little bit surprised.

232
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Ok.

233
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I am not sure how short the measurement time is.

234
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Theoretically, T1 and T2 should be faster.

235
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But, I am not sure what is the limitation in the experiment.

236
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So, maybe I am wrong.

237
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
T1 and T2 should be faster.

238
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
However, T1 is a few seconds.

239
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
T2 is a few seconds.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't have a good number.

241
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
However,

242
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:24,000
the applied AC magnetic field allows Robeot oscillation to reach 10 nanoseconds.

243
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So, it is pretty fast.

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Thank you.

245
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Ok.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I am sorry.

247
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can comment on this.

248
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
In the experiment,

249
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the time resolution is about 1 nanosecond.

250
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It is the shortest.

251
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It is the shortest.

252
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ok. Thank you.

253
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I am sorry.

254
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let me interrupt you.

255
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Please tell us your name and

256
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
briefly introduce yourself.

257
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Thank you.

258
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ok.

259
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So,

260
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I will continue.

261
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So,

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
we want to realize the proposal using STM technique.

263
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What is STM technique?

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You have a scanning tunneling microscope tip.

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You can remove the silicon in a certain position.

266
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Then, you can dope phosphorus in this position.

267
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This is actually a very difficult technique.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In the past, we doped silicon in a more random way.

269
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We did not particularly control where the phosphorus atom should be placed.

270
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This scanning tunneling microscope technique can control this.

271
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It controls this variable.

272
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So,

273
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Michelle Siemens Group

274
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
at UNSW

275
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
made a device that looks like this.

276
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The gate and donor are made using STM.

277
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So,

278
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
the gate is removed and the donor is placed.

279
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You can control the shape of the gate and the donor.

280
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Another difficult part is

281
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
to load and read the electrons on the donor.

282
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In 2010,

283
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Andrew Marlowe

284
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
used STM to control the Fermi level of the SCT.

285
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This allows the electrons to be tunneled to the SCT

286
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
or from the SCT tunnel to the donor.

287
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
When the Fermi level of the SCT is

288
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in the middle of the upspin and downspin,

289
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
only the upspin electrons can be tunneled to the SCT.

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The downspin electrons cannot be tunneled to the SCT.

291
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So, if you measure the current peak,

292
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the electrons are on the upspin.

293
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If you do not measure anything,

294
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
the electrons are on the downspin.

295
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then we can measure the electron spin.

296
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So,

297
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
in 1998,

298
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Ken proposed this proposal.

299
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
In 2010,

300
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Andrew Marlowe did the electron spin readout.

301
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
In 2015,

302
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
he did the single-qubit gate operation.

303
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
In 2019,

304
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
he did the two-qubit gate operation.

305
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Now,

306
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
we are going to build a large-scale quantum computer.

307
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Sorry, can I interrupt?

308
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm Ted.

309
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sure.

310
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You just talked about the readout.

311
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Can you tell us about the single-qubit gate in the middle?

312
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Which electron does it send to the AC field?

313
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It should be ESR.

314
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes, it is ESR.

315
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Well,

316
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
it is...

317
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Well,

318
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
it is...

319
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If it is ESR,

320
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
there is...

321
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I did not draw it here.

322
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There is a global...

323
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
There is a global...

324
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
There is a global...

325
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
There is a global...

326
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You can produce a globalized AC field

327
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and control it.

328
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But there is no...

329
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But there is no...

330
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It is a top-gate or back-gate.

331
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It is not a...

332
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It is not a...

333
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It is not a...

334
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It is not a...

335
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It is not a...

336
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What are the advantages of the donor spin qubit?

337
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
First, it has a long coherence time.

338
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
For example,

339
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
the natural silicon is silicon 28.

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The nuclear spin is 0.

341
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It means

342
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
only the donor's nuclear spin and the electron's nuclear spin are not 0.

343
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Most of the other spins have no interaction.

344
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
For example,

345
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
it has a long coherence time.

346
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It has a clear boundary.

347
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
For example,

348
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
if you have a phosphorus donor,

349
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
it looks the same.

350
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It is very helpful to scale up.

351
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Next,

352
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the semiconductor industry

353
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
has a very mature technology for silicon.

354
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It can be applied later.

355
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It can be applied later.

356
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The disadvantage is

357
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the STM technology

358
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The disadvantage is

359
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
the STM technology

360
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We need to control it very carefully.

361
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We need to control it very carefully.

362
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We don't know this.

363
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
We don't know this.

364
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It is not good.

365
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.

366
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.

367
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's introduce the donor spin qubit.

368
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Next,

369
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I have a question.

370
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I want to introduce myself.

371
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I am Zhang Yuanyong.

372
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I am a high-performance physicist.

373
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I am a high-performance physicist.

374
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,000
Before you works

375
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Before you works

376
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
before you repairs in the future,

377
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
before you repairs in the future,

378
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
How clean does vapor look?

379
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
How clean does vapor look?

380
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Can we buy it?

381
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Yes,

382
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
we just mentioned

383
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
we just mentioned

384
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the natural silicon is still

385
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
5% silicon-29

386
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The silicon-29 means

387
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
there is a nuclear spin.

388
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So,

389
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the trend is

390
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
to use purified silicon

391
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
to minimize the silicon-29

392
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to minimize the silicon-29

393
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So, the requirement is quite high.

394
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
So, the requirement is quite high.

395
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I have a follow-up question

396
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I have a follow-up question

397
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Is the purified silicon commercially available?

398
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Is the purified silicon commercially available?

399
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Or do we need to make it specially?

400
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think we need to make it

401
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
with a special factory

402
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
not a mass production

403
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
not a mass production

404
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm not sure

405
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
but it seems like this

406
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Ok, thank you

407
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Ok, thank you

408
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Ok, next I will introduce

409
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
what is spin relaxation

410
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
what is spin relaxation

411
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What is the importance of spin relaxation

412
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What is the importance of spin relaxation

413
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
or T1 time?

414
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
First, if you load an electron

415
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and you want to read out

416
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If you load in up spin

417
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
then it should be in up spin

418
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
if you read out

419
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If it relaxes in this process

420
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If it relaxes in this process

421
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
from up spin to down spin

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
you will have an error

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
a read out error

424
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
This error is quite fatal

425
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This error is quite fatal

426
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We need a lot of design

427
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We need a lot of design

428
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
If there is a fault tolerant quantum computer

429
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If there is a fault tolerant quantum computer

430
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
can handle this error

431
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
can handle this error

432
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,760
The current design is

433
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,000
The current design is

434
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
In the case of fidelity

435
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
99%

436
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So we hope

437
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
in the case of fidelity

438
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
99%

439
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
so we hope

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
that the longer the spin relaxation time

441
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
that the longer the spin relaxation time

442
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the longer the spin relaxation time

443
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So t 1

444
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000

445
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
