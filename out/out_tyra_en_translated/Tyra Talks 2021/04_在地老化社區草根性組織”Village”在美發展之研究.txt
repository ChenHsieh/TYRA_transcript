This is the topic of my doctoral thesis.
I'm discussing a type of community grass roots
that is growing rapidly in Taiwan.
I think this organization is initiated by the residents
and provides non-medical but vital care and services
to the local elderly residents.
I think many countries, including Taiwan,
are facing an aging problem.
So I think it's meaningful to discuss this phenomenon
and the causes behind it.
This organization is called Villages.
It's not an ordinary village.
The village is its name.
So my research goal is to discuss
the social and economic factors
behind this organization.
In the past 20 years,
there have been more and more organizations like this
in the United States.
So here's a definition.
It's a community organization.
Its goal is to help the local residents
to grow old together.
Villages provide non-medical services
to the local residents,
especially the elderly residents.
For example, they drive you to the doctor's office
or provide you with some growth courses
or social activities.
For example, they change light bulbs
or teach the elderly how to use computers.
All kinds of non-medical services.
This organization, called Villages,
is founded by the elderly in the community
and by the local residents.
This organization is run by the local volunteers
and the non-governmental organizations.
They also contribute to the organization.
Sometimes they apply for funds
from the government or non-governmental organizations.
Some of the donations are from private donors.
The first organization, called Villages,
was founded in Beacon Hill, Boston.
It was founded in 2002.
A lot of people heard about this organization
and thought it was a good idea.
So they decided to follow the Boston model
and set up an organization in their community.
This is just an example.
One of the Villages is in California.
Their website provides services
such as health information,
free education,
social activities,
and sports.
The number of Villages is increasing.
There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.
with low-income communities.
Not only in the U.S.,
but also in Australia, Canada, and South Africa.
Villages have influenced
their local communities.
It's not like McDonald's
where there are branches in the headquarters.
Each Village is an independent organization.
They are registered as a non-profit organization.
There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.
with low-income communities.
They follow the Boston model.
There are many different types of Villages.
Some Villages may belong to other organizations,
such as senior centers,
churches, and so on.
There are many different types of Villages.
They are different from one another.
The most typical example is a Village
that is registered as a non-profit organization.
There is another non-profit organization
called Hop & Spook Model.
It's located in Portland, Metropolitan.
It's like a headquarters with branches.
The headquarters is called NW Village.
It's a non-profit organization.
It's a non-profit organization.
It's a non-profit organization.
It's a non-profit organization.
The average cost per m僚 is higher.
The cost will be covered
by the headquarters.
The independent Villages will only take care of
service members and training staff.
The average cost per m僚
will be lower.
The cost per m僚
will be covered by the headquarters.
The independent Villages will only take care
of service members and training staff.
The average cost per m僚
will be covered by the headquarters.
The independent Villages will only take care of
service members and training staff.
It is subordinate to other organizations.
Some você
code of conduct
is the filiation
or program
whereas there may be a unit
that is installed independently.
The value of this model is
that it is driven by users
compared to other organizations
that provide care for the elderly.
It reflects the needs of the elderly
rather than those provided by the government
or other private organizations.
It is a service provided by the user
to provide community resources.
On the other hand,
the village model
is less dependent on the government.
As I mentioned,
the village model
is more flexible
compared to other organizations.
For example,
there is a village
with several group homes.
Some elderly need professional care
and some elderly need professional care.
It is similar to
single-family homes.
Each room is for one elderly.
One or two nurses
supervise the elderly
or take care of their daily needs.
The village model
has several group homes.
The elderly,
for example,
provide care for the elderly.
The village model
is more flexible compared to other organizations.
It reflects the needs of the elderly
and provides community resources.

In my opinion,
the village model
is more flexible compared to other organizations.
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.
Another special thing about the village model
is the coalition.
For example,
in a region,
like DC,
there will be a coalition.
The purpose of the coalition is to provide a platform
to share resources.
For example,
if a community wants to build a village,
they will go to the coalition to learn
and learn from the experience.
For example,
California has a village network.
Washington has a village network.
Bay Area has a village network.
The main function of the coalition
is to share resources.
For example,
Washington DC has a village network.
Washington DC has a village network.
Washington DC has a village network.
My research question is
why this type of organization
appeared in the US in the past 20 years?
Why didn't it appear earlier?
Why didn't it appear earlier?
Second,
which communities are more likely to have such an organization?
For example,
what is the background of the local community?
Third,
which communities are more likely to have such an organization?

What is the background of the local community?
These are my assumptions.
These are my assumptions.
First,
the aging of society
has led to the emergence of the village model.

Second,

is an important factor.
It's like a new venture.

Finally,
the dispersion of social networks

In this process,
it is very important

it is reported that the relevance of our series

has become an important factor.
The average income of a community

My assumption is that
it is a linear relationship.
If it is a very low-income community,
the organization needs to invest a lot of effort

If it is a very low-income community,
it is difficult to maintain the livelihood.
It is difficult to maintain the livelihood.
For a very high-income community,
the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.
so there is no right-wing organization to build a community.
For a very high-income community,
the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.
So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.
So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.
However, there are some differences in my interviews.
For example,
when a community has a village,
when a community has a village,
there will be new social connections.
These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.
These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.
This is a community phenomenon,

So, my method includes
studying and
looking around detailed.
For large city RoV criteria,
I generally look into individual people with disabilities,
and use ground theory to do some research.
and use ground theory to do some research.
I'll talk about this in detail later.
So, how do I find these villages?
My research is limited to the United States,
so it's relatively simple.
So, how do I find the villages in the United States?
A list of the cities under the Yoga Village Coalition
includes members and non-members
and listed on the listing.
There are two biggest Coalition in the region.
The UC and D.C.
have their lists referred to.
First,
they conduct a survey
to understand their basic situation,
such as their establishment time,
service scope, and so on.
Their address is their office address,
but not their service scope.
You don't know how big their service scope is.
Because of the pandemic,
they spend a lot of time on this.
I listed the total number of villages
and how many are still
under preparation.
There are four villages
that are still under preparation
due to the pandemic.
Unfortunately, the village is closed due to the pandemic.
As far as I know,
at least one village has reopened.
I collected 120 samples in this survey.
On the Global Coalition website,
they also listed
their areas of interest.
They identified their areas
as metropolitan, suburban,
or rural areas.
I used this to compare
and show the representation of my sample.
This is the information I collected
in this survey.
You can see that the two villages
are very similar.
As for the establishment time,
the total number of villages
is less than the total number of villages
on the previous table.
You can see that
the first village was established in 2002.
Why is there an earlier year?
Because that village belongs to a certain organization.
The time given is the establishment time
of that unit.
In 1952,
you can see that
the number of villages
is relatively lower than
the number of villages
on the previous table.
There is a big difference
in the scope of service.
The service area is about
5 zip code areas.
It's difficult to calculate
the number of villages on the previous table.
Some services are as large as
two counties,
and some are as small as a building.
I use spatial analysis
to calculate the number of villages
on the previous table.
The spatial analysis is done
by county and county subdivision
based on U.S. census data
and American Community Survey.
The U.S. census data
shows that there are
more than 30,000 county subdivisions
on the previous table.
The U.S. census data
shows that there are more than 60,000 county subdivisions
on the previous table.
The U.S. census data
shows that
most of the volunteers
are local residents.
Most of the volunteers
are retired,
but there are also
a lot of young people
who want to work with us
to provide more resources.
So,
this is the return part.
So,
I use the U.S. census data
to calculate the number of villages
on the previous table.

Thank you.
Thank you very much for your question.
First of all,
what is the progress of development in Taiwan?
What is the progress of development in Taiwan?
I think there are pros and cons.
The pros are that
we are still talking about
the elderly care in society.
We still think about the government
and what services should be provided.
This is also related to your second question.
This is also related to your second question.
There are several stages of the elderly.
There are several stages of the elderly.
The first stage is that
many elderly people are still healthy
and have the ability to move.
The next stage is that
they may have some physical and mental difficulties.
The next stage is that
they may not be able to move in bed.
In Taiwan,
we are mainly discussing
how to deal with the later stages.
The elderly feel they do not need to worry
about the later stages.
This is a huge mistake.
It's like a machine.
It's like a machine.
You have to keep running
so that it can move smoothly.
you have to keep running so that it can move smoothly.
For example,
some people retire and do nothing.
Some people move with their children
to other countries or cities.
They watch TV all day at home.
They do not have social activities.
They can't quickly
enter the post-mortem
or the stage of mental decline.
It's all about problems.
How to take care of them.
How to take care of them.
We don't put resources
on how to give them more
when they are still healthy.

I do interviews here.
I do interviews here.
I interviewed with senior people
who are in social activities.
Even when they are old,
even when they are old,
they will not stay in bed for a long time.
Even if they leave,
they will leave soon and feel no pain.
In Taiwan,
I think our social resources
should be more.
Or think more about
this.
As I said earlier,
Village is a very flexible
and flexible mode.
So in Taiwan,
I think we can connect with
Taiwan's own social network.
For example, in Taiwan,
the elderly care is mainly
based on the first one,
the community development association.
Mainly based on these two.
Then I was thinking if Village
can be combined with these two.
In fact, in Taiwan,
in terms of self-employment services,
everyone's love is quite high.
For example, in Taiwan,
relatively invested in
non-profit organizations,
relatively invested in religion.
Of course, religious organizations
can also be combined with this.
How to think about
such a part.
For example, on this table,
the United States is facing a problem.
In fact, these costs are quite high.
Even if you are a middle-income person,
even if you are a middle-income person,
even if you are a middle-income person,
once you get old,
the source of income is reduced.
And you don't know what kind of
serious illness you might have.
For them, it's a big burden.
So that's why
there's a reason for
establishing Village.
Like you just said,
for example,
there's another thing
that's not listed here.
It's nursing home.
It's a nursing home
that avoids that kind of situation.
Especially in nursing homes,
there are some
medical care.
There are some bad quality
and a lot of mess inside.
For example, assisted living
in Virginia and Maryland
has a retired community.
But the costs
are not too low.
So if you
just have a little
inconvenience with some actions,
for the most part,
if you want to
move to another place
like assisted living,
especially for
the elderly,
your social network
will be cut off.
And your social space
will be more limited.
So that's what
the elderly in the U.S.
are facing.
So they try to
stay where they
used to live.
For example,
how to do some adjustments
on the house.
You just said
that the costs are not low.
I know that
I checked on the Internet
that the range of nursing homes
is up to $100,000.
So you said that
the costs are not too low.
What's the range
in the U.S.?
I've only seen
more than 1,000 nursing homes
in Virginia.
Anyway,
if I want to report,
I can give you
the statistics.
Because each home
is different.
For example,
the location,
the unit,
the profit unit,
the situation will be miserable.
Thank you.
Thank you for your question.
Do you have any other questions?
I can stop the recording
first.
Then you can ask questions to
the audience.
