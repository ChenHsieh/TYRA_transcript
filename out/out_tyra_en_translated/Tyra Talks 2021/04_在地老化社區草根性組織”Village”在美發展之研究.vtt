00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Today's speaker is Qiu Yiting. Yiting graduated from Chenggong University with a master's degree in urban planning, and at the same time retired from political studies.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
His master's degree is in the National Institute of Development, Taiwan University, and he is now a PhD candidate for George Mason's Public Policy.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
Yiting's research is cross-field policy research, and his main interest is local and national development.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.000
His important experiences in recent years include the assistant of the Chinese and French branch of the Taiwan Economic Research Institute's Sino-US Trade War, and the course teacher of the NCAR Learning, a non-profit organization for the benefit of the French.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
This is the introduction of today's speaker. Let's not talk too much and let Yiting start today's speech. Thank you.

00:49.000 --> 01:03.000
Thank you very much for the introduction. I hope everyone can hear me. Thank you everyone for taking the time to listen to my speech.

01:04.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm sorry. Everyone can see the screen, right? This is the topic of my PhD paper.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Can you see the screen? I'm sorry. I forgot to share it. I'm sorry.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Can you see the screen now?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
It seems to be coming out.

01:40.000 --> 01:57.000
I see only gray.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Do I have to share it again?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, let's share it again.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
Thank you everyone for taking the time to listen to my speech.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm sorry. I forgot to share it again.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm sorry. I forgot to share it again.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Can you see the screen now?

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
It seems to be coming out.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I see only gray.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
It seems to be coming out.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Did you share it again?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Yes, I shared it again.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Do I have to share it again?

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes, share it again.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It seems to be coming out.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Can you see the screen now?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
It seems to be coming out.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
Can you see the screen now?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Can you see the screen now?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes, I can see the screen now.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Can you see the screen now?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Can you see the screen now?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It's okay.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Why do I see a black screen now?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I'm black now. What should I adjust?

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm black now. What should I adjust?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Look at your software.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Look at your software.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Look at your software.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Look at your software.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Sorry, I accidentally press your stop button.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Sorry, I accidentally press your stop button.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Sorry, I accidentally pressed your stop button.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Can you use it again?

05:08.000 --> 05:29.000
Please wait for me to use it again.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Do you see it?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Now it becomes your checklist of the Lord of the Rings.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Yes, I'll change it later.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Now it works.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Can everyone see it?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Yes.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Thank you. I'm very sorry.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Thank you very much for listening to today's lecture.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
This is the topic of my doctoral thesis.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
I'm discussing a type of community grass roots

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
that is growing rapidly in Taiwan.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
I think this organization is initiated by the residents

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
and provides non-medical but vital care and services

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
to the local elderly residents.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I think many countries, including Taiwan,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
are facing an aging problem.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So I think it's meaningful to discuss this phenomenon

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
and the causes behind it.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
This organization is called Villages.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
It's not an ordinary village.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
The village is its name.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
So my research goal is to discuss

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
the social and economic factors

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
behind this organization.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
In the past 20 years,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
there have been more and more organizations like this

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
in the United States.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
So here's a definition.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
It's a community organization.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Its goal is to help the local residents

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
to grow old together.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Villages provide non-medical services

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
to the local residents,

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
especially the elderly residents.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
For example, they drive you to the doctor's office

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
or provide you with some growth courses

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
or social activities.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
For example, they change light bulbs

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
or teach the elderly how to use computers.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
All kinds of non-medical services.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
This organization, called Villages,

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
is founded by the elderly in the community

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
and by the local residents.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
This organization is run by the local volunteers

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
and the non-governmental organizations.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
They also contribute to the organization.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Sometimes they apply for funds

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
from the government or non-governmental organizations.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Some of the donations are from private donors.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
The first organization, called Villages,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
was founded in Beacon Hill, Boston.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
It was founded in 2002.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
A lot of people heard about this organization

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
and thought it was a good idea.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
So they decided to follow the Boston model

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
and set up an organization in their community.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
This is just an example.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
One of the Villages is in California.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Their website provides services

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
such as health information,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
free education,

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
social activities,

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
and sports.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
The number of Villages is increasing.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
with low-income communities.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Not only in the U.S.,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
but also in Australia, Canada, and South Africa.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Villages have influenced

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
their local communities.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
It's not like McDonald's

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
where there are branches in the headquarters.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
Each Village is an independent organization.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
They are registered as a non-profit organization.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
with low-income communities.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
They follow the Boston model.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
There are many different types of Villages.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Some Villages may belong to other organizations,

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
such as senior centers,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
churches, and so on.

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
There are many different types of Villages.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
They are different from one another.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
The most typical example is a Village

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
that is registered as a non-profit organization.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
There is another non-profit organization

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
called Hop & Spook Model.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
It's located in Portland, Metropolitan.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
It's like a headquarters with branches.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
The headquarters is called NW Village.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
It's a non-profit organization.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
It's a non-profit organization.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
It's a non-profit organization.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
It's a non-profit organization.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
The average cost per m僚 is higher.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
The cost will be covered

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
by the headquarters.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
The independent Villages will only take care of

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
service members and training staff.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
The average cost per m僚

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
will be lower.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
The cost per m僚

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
will be covered by the headquarters.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
The independent Villages will only take care

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
of service members and training staff.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
The average cost per m僚

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
will be covered by the headquarters.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
The independent Villages will only take care of

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
service members and training staff.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
It is subordinate to other organizations.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Some você

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
code of conduct

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
is the filiation

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
or program

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
whereas there may be a unit

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
that is installed independently.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
The value of this model is

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
that it is driven by users

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
compared to other organizations

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
that provide care for the elderly.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
It reflects the needs of the elderly

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
rather than those provided by the government

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
or other private organizations.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
It is a service provided by the user

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
to provide community resources.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
On the other hand,

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
the village model

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
is less dependent on the government.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
As I mentioned,

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
the village model

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
is more flexible

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
compared to other organizations.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
For example,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
there is a village

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
with several group homes.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Some elderly need professional care

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
and some elderly need professional care.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
It is similar to

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
single-family homes.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
Each room is for one elderly.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
One or two nurses

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
supervise the elderly

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
or take care of their daily needs.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
The village model

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
has several group homes.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
The elderly,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
for example,

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
provide care for the elderly.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
The village model

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
It reflects the needs of the elderly

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
and provides community resources.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
The village model

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
The village model

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
The village model

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
The village model

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
The village model

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
is more flexible

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
compared to other organizations.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
In my opinion,

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
the village model

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
is more flexible compared to other organizations.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
It's more flexible compared to other organizations.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
Another special thing about the village model

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
is the coalition.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
For example,

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
in a region,

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
like DC,

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
there will be a coalition.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
The purpose of the coalition is to provide a platform

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
to share resources.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
For example,

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
if a community wants to build a village,

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
they will go to the coalition to learn

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
and learn from the experience.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
For example,

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
California has a village network.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
Washington has a village network.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
Bay Area has a village network.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
The main function of the coalition

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
is to share resources.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
For example,

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
Washington DC has a village network.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
Washington DC has a village network.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
Washington DC has a village network.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
My research question is

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
why this type of organization

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
appeared in the US in the past 20 years?

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
Why didn't it appear earlier?

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Why didn't it appear earlier?

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Second,

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
which communities are more likely to have such an organization?

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
For example,

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
what is the background of the local community?

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
Third,

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
which communities are more likely to have such an organization?

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
What is the background of the local community?

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
What is the background of the local community?

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
These are my assumptions.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
These are my assumptions.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
First,

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
the aging of society

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
has led to the emergence of the village model.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
has led to the emergence of the village model.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
Second,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
the emergence of the village model

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
is an important factor.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
It's like a new venture.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
It's like a new venture.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
It's like a new venture.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Creators' individual improvements

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
are very important in this process.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Creators' individual improvements are very important in this process.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
Finally,

22:55.000 --> 23:00.080
the dispersion of social networks

23:00.080 --> 23:05.080
is very important

23:05.080 --> 23:10.080
in this process.

23:10.080 --> 23:15.080
In this process,

23:15.080 --> 23:20.080
it is very important

23:20.080 --> 23:25.080
that the community

23:25.080 --> 23:30.080
has a strong social network.

23:30.080 --> 23:35.080
It is very important

23:35.080 --> 23:40.080
that the community has a strong social network.

23:40.080 --> 23:45.080
It is very important

23:45.080 --> 23:50.080
that the community has a strong social network.

23:50.080 --> 23:55.080
It is very important

23:55.080 --> 24:00.080
that the community has a strong social network.

24:00.080 --> 24:05.080
It is very important

24:05.080 --> 24:10.080
that the community has a strong social network.

24:10.080 --> 24:15.080
It is very important

24:15.080 --> 24:20.080
that the community has a strong social network.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.080
It is critical

24:25.080 --> 24:29.720
that the community has a strong social network.

24:29.720 --> 24:34.720
It is critical

24:34.720 --> 24:37.720
that the community has a strong social network.

24:37.720 --> 24:42.720
It is critical

24:43.660 --> 24:48.660
that the community has a strong social network.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.400
It is critical that the community has a strong social network.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.020
It is critical that the community has a strong social network.

24:57.020 --> 25:01.360
It is critical that the community has a strong social network.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.860
Since then,

25:03.860 --> 25:07.860
it is reported that the relevance of our series

25:07.860 --> 25:11.360
of presentations

25:11.360 --> 25:15.360
has become an important factor.

25:15.360 --> 25:19.360
The average income of a community

25:19.360 --> 25:23.360
The average income of a community

25:23.360 --> 25:27.360
is a positive factor or a negative factor.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.360
is a positive factor or a negative factor.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.360
My assumption is that

25:34.360 --> 25:38.360
it is a linear relationship.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.360
If it is a very low-income community,

25:42.360 --> 25:46.360
the organization needs to invest a lot of effort

25:46.360 --> 25:50.360
the organization needs to invest a lot of effort

25:50.360 --> 25:54.360
If it is a very low-income community,

25:54.360 --> 25:58.360
it is difficult to maintain the livelihood.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.360
It is difficult to maintain the livelihood.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.360
For a very high-income community,

26:06.360 --> 26:10.360
the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.

26:10.360 --> 26:14.360
so there is no right-wing organization to build a community.

26:14.360 --> 26:18.360
For a very high-income community,

26:18.360 --> 26:22.360
the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.

26:22.360 --> 26:26.360
So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.

26:26.360 --> 26:30.360
So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.

26:30.360 --> 26:34.360
However, there are some differences in my interviews.

26:36.360 --> 26:40.360
For example,

26:40.360 --> 26:44.360
when a community has a village,

26:44.360 --> 26:48.360
when a community has a village,

26:48.360 --> 26:52.360
there will be new social connections.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.360
These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.360
These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.

27:00.360 --> 27:04.360
This is a community phenomenon,

27:05.180 --> 27:09.180
so they can't really observe it.

27:09.180 --> 27:13.180
so they can't really observe it.

27:13.180 --> 27:17.320
So, my method includes

27:17.320 --> 27:20.740
studying and

27:20.740 --> 27:24.740
looking around detailed.

27:24.740 --> 27:28.740
For large city RoV criteria,

27:28.740 --> 27:32.740
I generally look into individual people with disabilities,

27:32.740 --> 27:36.740
and use ground theory to do some research.

27:36.740 --> 27:40.740
and use ground theory to do some research.

27:40.740 --> 27:44.740
I'll talk about this in detail later.

27:44.740 --> 27:48.740
So, how do I find these villages?

27:48.740 --> 27:52.740
My research is limited to the United States,

27:52.740 --> 27:56.740
so it's relatively simple.

27:56.740 --> 28:00.740
So, how do I find the villages in the United States?

28:00.740 --> 28:04.740
A list of the cities under the Yoga Village Coalition

28:04.740 --> 28:08.740
includes members and non-members

28:08.740 --> 28:12.740
and listed on the listing.

28:12.740 --> 28:16.740
There are two biggest Coalition in the region.

28:16.740 --> 28:20.740
The UC and D.C.

28:20.740 --> 28:24.740
have their lists referred to.

28:24.740 --> 28:28.740
First,

28:28.740 --> 28:32.740
they conduct a survey

28:32.740 --> 28:36.740
to understand their basic situation,

28:36.740 --> 28:40.740
such as their establishment time,

28:40.740 --> 28:44.740
service scope, and so on.

28:44.740 --> 28:48.740
Their address is their office address,

28:48.740 --> 28:52.740
but not their service scope.

28:52.740 --> 28:56.740
You don't know how big their service scope is.

28:56.740 --> 29:00.740
Because of the pandemic,

29:00.740 --> 29:04.740
they spend a lot of time on this.

29:04.740 --> 29:08.740
I listed the total number of villages

29:08.740 --> 29:12.740
and how many are still

29:12.740 --> 29:16.740
under preparation.

29:16.740 --> 29:20.740
There are four villages

29:20.740 --> 29:24.740
that are still under preparation

29:24.740 --> 29:28.740
due to the pandemic.

29:28.740 --> 29:32.740
Unfortunately, the village is closed due to the pandemic.

29:32.740 --> 29:36.740
As far as I know,

29:36.740 --> 29:40.740
at least one village has reopened.

29:40.740 --> 29:44.740
I collected 120 samples in this survey.

29:44.740 --> 29:48.740
On the Global Coalition website,

29:48.740 --> 29:52.740
they also listed

29:52.740 --> 29:56.740
their areas of interest.

29:56.740 --> 30:00.740
They identified their areas

30:00.740 --> 30:04.740
as metropolitan, suburban,

30:04.740 --> 30:08.740
or rural areas.

30:08.740 --> 30:12.740
I used this to compare

30:12.740 --> 30:16.740
and show the representation of my sample.

30:16.740 --> 30:20.740
This is the information I collected

30:20.740 --> 30:24.740
in this survey.

30:24.740 --> 30:28.740
You can see that the two villages

30:28.740 --> 30:32.740
are very similar.

30:32.740 --> 30:36.740
As for the establishment time,

30:36.740 --> 30:40.740
the total number of villages

30:40.740 --> 30:44.740
is less than the total number of villages

30:44.740 --> 30:48.740
on the previous table.

30:48.740 --> 30:52.740
You can see that

30:52.740 --> 30:56.740
the first village was established in 2002.

30:56.740 --> 31:00.740
Why is there an earlier year?

31:00.740 --> 31:04.740
Because that village belongs to a certain organization.

31:04.740 --> 31:08.740
The time given is the establishment time

31:08.740 --> 31:12.740
of that unit.

31:12.740 --> 31:16.740
In 1952,

31:16.740 --> 31:20.740
you can see that

31:20.740 --> 31:24.740
the number of villages

31:24.740 --> 31:28.740
is relatively lower than

31:28.740 --> 31:32.740
the number of villages

31:32.740 --> 31:36.740
on the previous table.

31:36.740 --> 31:40.740
There is a big difference

31:40.740 --> 31:44.740
in the scope of service.

31:44.740 --> 31:48.740
The service area is about

31:48.740 --> 31:52.740
5 zip code areas.

31:52.740 --> 31:56.740
It's difficult to calculate

31:56.740 --> 32:00.740
the number of villages on the previous table.

32:00.740 --> 32:04.740
Some services are as large as

32:04.740 --> 32:08.740
two counties,

32:08.740 --> 32:12.740
and some are as small as a building.

32:12.740 --> 32:16.740
I use spatial analysis

32:16.740 --> 32:20.740
to calculate the number of villages

32:20.740 --> 32:24.740
on the previous table.

32:24.740 --> 32:28.740
The spatial analysis is done

32:28.740 --> 32:32.740
by county and county subdivision

32:32.740 --> 32:36.740
based on U.S. census data

32:36.740 --> 32:40.740
and American Community Survey.

32:40.740 --> 32:44.740
The U.S. census data

32:44.740 --> 32:48.740
shows that there are

32:48.740 --> 32:52.740
more than 30,000 county subdivisions

32:52.740 --> 32:56.740
on the previous table.

32:56.740 --> 33:00.740
The U.S. census data

33:00.740 --> 33:04.740
shows that there are more than 60,000 county subdivisions

33:04.740 --> 33:08.740
on the previous table.

33:08.740 --> 33:12.740
The U.S. census data

33:12.740 --> 33:16.740
shows that

33:16.740 --> 33:20.740
most of the volunteers

33:20.740 --> 33:24.740
are local residents.

33:24.740 --> 33:28.740
Most of the volunteers

33:28.740 --> 33:32.740
are retired,

33:32.740 --> 33:36.740
but there are also

33:36.740 --> 33:40.740
a lot of young people

33:40.740 --> 33:44.740
who want to work with us

33:44.740 --> 33:48.740
to provide more resources.

33:48.740 --> 33:52.740
So,

33:52.740 --> 33:56.740
this is the return part.

33:56.740 --> 34:00.740
So,

34:00.740 --> 34:04.740
I use the U.S. census data

34:04.740 --> 34:08.740
to calculate the number of villages

34:08.740 --> 34:12.740
on the previous table.

34:12.740 --> 34:16.740
The U.S. census data

34:16.740 --> 34:20.740
shows the average level of education,

34:20.740 --> 34:24.740
income,

34:24.740 --> 34:28.740
and the number of local residents

34:28.740 --> 34:32.740
who are involved in social organizations.

34:32.740 --> 34:36.740
The U.S. census data

34:36.740 --> 34:40.740
shows the average level of education,

34:40.740 --> 34:44.740
income,

34:44.740 --> 34:48.740
and the number of local residents

34:48.740 --> 34:52.740
who are involved in social organizations.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.740
Thank you.

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.740
Thank you very much for your question.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.740
First of all,

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.740
what is the progress of development in Taiwan?

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.740
What is the progress of development in Taiwan?

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.740
I think there are pros and cons.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.740
The pros are that

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.740
we are still talking about

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.740
the elderly care in society.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.740
We still think about the government

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.740
and what services should be provided.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.740
This is also related to your second question.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.740
This is also related to your second question.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.740
There are several stages of the elderly.

01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.740
There are several stages of the elderly.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.740
The first stage is that

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.740
many elderly people are still healthy

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.740
and have the ability to move.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.740
The next stage is that

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.740
they may have some physical and mental difficulties.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:58.740
The next stage is that

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.740
they may not be able to move in bed.

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.740
In Taiwan,

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.740
we are mainly discussing

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.740
how to deal with the later stages.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.740
The elderly feel they do not need to worry

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.740
about the later stages.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.740
This is a huge mistake.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.740
It's like a machine.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.740
It's like a machine.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:18.740
You have to keep running

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.740
so that it can move smoothly.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.740
you have to keep running so that it can move smoothly.

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.740
For example,

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.740
some people retire and do nothing.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.740
Some people move with their children

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.740
to other countries or cities.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.740
They watch TV all day at home.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.740
They do not have social activities.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:36.740
They can't quickly

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.740
enter the post-mortem

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.740
or the stage of mental decline.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.740
It's all about problems.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.740
How to take care of them.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740
How to take care of them.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.740
We don't put resources

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:50.740
on how to give them more

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740
when they are still healthy.

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.740
We don't put resources

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.740
on how to give them more

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.740
when they are still healthy.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.740
I do interviews here.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.740
I do interviews here.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.740
I interviewed with senior people

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.740
who are in social activities.

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.740
Even when they are old,

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.740
even when they are old,

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.740
they will not stay in bed for a long time.

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.740
Even if they leave,

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.740
they will leave soon and feel no pain.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.740
In Taiwan,

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.740
I think our social resources

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.740
should be more.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.740
Or think more about

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.740
this.

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.740
As I said earlier,

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.740
Village is a very flexible

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.740
and flexible mode.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.740
So in Taiwan,

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.740
I think we can connect with

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:38.740
Taiwan's own social network.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.740
For example, in Taiwan,

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.740
the elderly care is mainly

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.740
based on the first one,

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.740
the community development association.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.740
Mainly based on these two.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:50.740
Then I was thinking if Village

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.740
can be combined with these two.

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.740
In fact, in Taiwan,

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.740
in terms of self-employment services,

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.740
everyone's love is quite high.

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.740
For example, in Taiwan,

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.740
relatively invested in

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:04.740
non-profit organizations,

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.740
relatively invested in religion.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.740
Of course, religious organizations

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.740
can also be combined with this.

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.740
How to think about

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.740
such a part.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.740
For example, on this table,

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740
the United States is facing a problem.

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.740
In fact, these costs are quite high.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.740
Even if you are a middle-income person,

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.740
even if you are a middle-income person,

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.740
even if you are a middle-income person,

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.740
once you get old,

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.740
the source of income is reduced.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.740
And you don't know what kind of

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.740
serious illness you might have.

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.740
For them, it's a big burden.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.740
So that's why

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.740
there's a reason for

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.740
establishing Village.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.740
Like you just said,

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.740
for example,

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.740
there's another thing

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.740
that's not listed here.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.740
It's nursing home.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.740
It's a nursing home

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.740
that avoids that kind of situation.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.740
Especially in nursing homes,

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.740
there are some

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:02.740
medical care.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.740
There are some bad quality

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.740
and a lot of mess inside.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.740
For example, assisted living

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:10.740
in Virginia and Maryland

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.740
has a retired community.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.740
But the costs

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.740
are not too low.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.740
So if you

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.740
just have a little

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.740
inconvenience with some actions,

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.740
for the most part,

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.740
if you want to

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.740
move to another place

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.740
like assisted living,

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.740
especially for

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.740
the elderly,

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.740
your social network

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.740
will be cut off.

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.740
And your social space

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.740
will be more limited.

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.740
So that's what

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.740
the elderly in the U.S.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.740
are facing.

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.740
So they try to

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:52.740
stay where they

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.740
used to live.

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.740
For example,

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.740
how to do some adjustments

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.740
on the house.

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.740
You just said

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.740
that the costs are not low.

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:06.740
I know that

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.740
I checked on the Internet

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.740
that the range of nursing homes

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.740
is up to $100,000.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:14.740
So you said that

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.740
the costs are not too low.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.740
What's the range

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.740
in the U.S.?

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.740
I've only seen

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.740
more than 1,000 nursing homes

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.740
in Virginia.

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.740
Anyway,

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.740
if I want to report,

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.740
I can give you

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:34.740
the statistics.

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.740
Because each home

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.740
is different.

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.740
For example,

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.740
the location,

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.740
the unit,

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.740
the profit unit,

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:48.740
the situation will be miserable.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.740
Thank you.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:56.740
Thank you for your question.

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:58.740
Do you have any other questions?

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.740
I can stop the recording

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.740
first.

01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.740
Then you can ask questions to

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.740
the audience.
