0	8000	First of all, I'm Kao Hsien. I'm a Ph.D. student from the University of Brisbane.
8000	14000	I'm very happy to be able to invite Yiting to talk about today's topic.
14000	23000	In 2019, Yiting received a Ph.D. from Boston University in the field of Rehabilitation Science.
23000	33000	Since last year, 2020, she has been a Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Behavior and Community Science.
33000	39000	During her university and master's degree, she studied in the Department of Cognitive Immunotherapy and the Cognitive Immunotherapy Research Institute.
39000	48000	She has worked in schools, clinics, hospitals, and other places for a long time, about four years.
48000	52000	She mainly serves children with mental disorders and their families.
52000	60000	Until now, her research interests include the communication of mental disorders, cross-cultural and parents' education experience,
60000	67000	and environmental factors affecting the health and quality of mental disorders and family members.
67000	72000	She is also currently involved in the study of COVID-19, the impact of this epidemic on our mental health,
72000	77000	as well as the study plan for the integration of mental patients into the care system.
77000	79000	That's all for my introduction.
79000	81000	The floor is yours.
81000	84000	Yiting, please start your report.
84000	85000	Okay.
85000	93000	First of all, I'd like to thank Yiting for taking the time to prepare so many things for us,
93000	95000	as well as some preliminary communication.
95000	102000	Also, I'd like to thank the T-Rod platform for allowing us to participate in this event on the weekend.
102000	108000	I'd like to thank everyone for having the opportunity to listen to this presentation on the weekend.
108000	112000	Let's get started.
112000	114000	Today's topic is,
114000	116000	Is it their country or our home?
117000	123000	I'd like to share the quote I got from this interview.
123000	129000	I think it's a good way to show that as an immigrant living in a new country,
129000	133000	how does it affect the implementation of their family position in terms of identity?
133000	136000	How do they practice their family position?
136000	141000	My main target is the first generation of Asian immigrants in the United States.
141000	145000	Their children have different developmental disabilities.
145000	146000	Okay.
146000	148000	Later, I will...
148000	150000	Today's presentation...
150000	152000	Okay.
152000	153000	Okay.
153000	155000	Today, I will talk about...
155000	158000	It will take about 10 to 15 minutes.
158000	160000	I will talk about my own experience,
160000	164000	and why I want to do this topic now,
164000	170000	and what led me to get to where I am today step by step.
170000	173000	Next, I will talk about the two studies I want to share today.
173000	176000	These two studies are from my doctoral thesis.
176000	180000	I will talk about the background of these two studies.
180000	183000	Next, I will talk about the first study I did.
183000	185000	It's a meta-synthesis study.
185000	189000	I don't know if you are familiar with this type of study.
189000	193000	I will talk about what it is,
193000	195000	and how I use it.
195000	200000	Lastly, I will talk about a more traditional implementation study.
200000	204000	I will talk about how parents in the U.S.
204000	209000	help their children with developmental disabilities
209000	212000	in the U.S.
212000	215000	and how they arrange their adult life.
215000	217000	At the end of this talk,
217000	220000	we will move on to today's Q&A.
220000	223000	If you have any questions,
223000	225000	you can leave them in the chat box.
225000	227000	If you have any questions,
227000	229000	you can leave them in the chat box.
229000	231000	You can also leave them in the chat box during the Q&A.
231000	233000	The first question is,
233000	235000	as Kou said,
235000	238000	my university and master's degree are both in Chengda University.
238000	240000	They are all in Cognitive Therapy.
240000	242000	Regarding Cognitive Therapy,
242000	244000	I think most people have heard about it.
244000	246000	I will take this opportunity
246000	249000	to give you a brief explanation of Cognitive Therapy.
249000	251000	I think a lot of people
251000	253000	will take Occupational Therapy
253000	255000	as a direct approach.
255000	257000	I think a lot of people
257000	259000	will take Occupational Therapy
259000	261000	as a direct approach.
262000	264000	Occupational therapy is not an Job.
264000	268000	This term, Occupational Therapy,
268000	273000	is not a job-related word
273000	275000	but a meaningful activity to everyone.
275000	277000	This term, occupational therapy,
277000	282000	is important to people of different age groups.
282000	284000	For example,
284000	289000	if I'm a doctor or a worker,
289000	291000	meaningful activities to me
291000	294000	are going to work, doing research,
294000	297000	going to class, and so on.
297000	301000	If I'm in a normal workplace,
301000	305000	due to physiological, psychological,
305000	307000	or other reasons,
307000	310000	I can't go to work,
310000	313000	meaningful activities to me
313000	315000	are going to work.
315000	317000	Occupational therapy
317000	319000	is also for people
319000	322000	who can't go to work.
322000	324000	For example,
324000	326000	it's for workers
326000	329000	who need to evaluate their functions
329000	331000	or help them with their arms
331000	333000	or other body functions.
333000	335000	Occupational therapy
335000	337000	also helps them adjust
337000	339000	their work environment
339000	345000	so that they can go back to work.
345000	347000	For children,
347000	349000	meaningful activities to them
349000	351000	are playing,
351000	353000	socializing with others,
353000	355000	going to school,
355000	359000	or even daily life management.
359000	361000	Can they do these things?
361000	363000	These are meaningful activities to them.
363000	365000	At this point,
365000	367000	I'd like to talk about
367000	369000	the scope of occupational therapy.
369000	371000	It's widely defined in our field.
371000	373000	However,
373000	375000	people who are not in this field
375000	377000	may not have a clear understanding
377000	379000	of this term.
379000	381000	It may be more defined as
381000	383000	occupational therapy.
383000	385000	As occupational therapists,
385000	387000	there are two ways
387000	389000	to help our clients.
389000	391000	We care about
391000	393000	the three circles
393000	395000	in the lower right corner.
395000	397000	We care about
397000	399000	whether the person,
399000	401000	the environment,
401000	403000	and the occupation
403000	405000	can overlap well
405000	407000	and whether the person
407000	409000	can do meaningful things
409000	411000	in their daily life.
411000	413000	In addition to
413000	415000	personal adjustment,
415000	417000	we may also adjust
417000	419000	the environment.
419000	421000	We may also
421000	423000	help the person
423000	425000	to adjust
425000	427000	meaningful activities
427000	429000	so that they can do
429000	431000	what they want to do
431000	433000	but may need
433000	435000	a new way
435000	437000	or a new schedule.
437000	439000	That's the concept
439000	441000	of occupational therapy.
441000	443000	In Taiwan,
443000	445000	once you graduate as an occupational therapist,
445000	447000	you can get a national license
447000	449000	to work as
449000	451000	an occupational therapist.
451000	453000	When I graduated from college,
453000	455000	I went to a vocational school
455000	457000	and worked as
457000	459000	an occupational therapist.
459000	461000	I mainly did early therapy.
461000	463000	Early therapy may be defined
463000	465000	as before the age of three
465000	467000	or six.
467000	469000	Later, I did rehabilitation
469000	471000	for children who were
471000	473000	in the early stages of learning.
473000	475000	Later,
475000	477000	after I graduated from college,
477000	479000	I did other occupational therapies
479000	481000	in Taipei and Tainan.
481000	483000	For example,
483000	485000	I worked as an occupational therapist
485000	487000	in a school
487000	489000	or in a traditional
489000	491000	rehabilitation center
491000	493000	in a hospital.
493000	495000	I also had experience
495000	497000	interacting with patients
497000	499000	as an adult.
499000	501000	I also worked
501000	503000	in a nursing center
503000	505000	as an occupational therapist.
505000	507000	I also had experience
507000	509000	interacting with patients
509000	511000	as an adult.
511000	513000	I mainly worked with
513000	515000	children with mental disabilities
515000	517000	and their families.
517000	519000	At that time,
519000	521000	when I was working in Taipei,
521000	523000	we had a non-official
523000	525000	parent support group.
525000	527000	In Taiwan,
527000	529000	under the health insurance system,
529000	531000	hospitals usually provide
531000	533000	one-on-one
533000	535000	or group therapy
535000	537000	to children.
537000	539000	As a therapist,
539000	541000	it is quite common
541000	543000	to see children
543000	545000	come to you
545000	547000	once a week
547000	549000	for 30 minutes
549000	551000	or even an hour.
551000	553000	It may be a little more than that,
553000	555000	but that's about it.
555000	557000	We can recognize
557000	559000	that if we can
559000	561000	make a long-term
561000	563000	or effective change
563000	565000	in their daily lives,
565000	567000	it is a very important step
567000	569000	because parents spend
569000	571000	most of their time
571000	573000	interacting with their children.
573000	575000	Parents know their children's
575000	577000	strengths and weaknesses,
577000	579000	preferences,
579000	581000	and where they need to improve.
581000	583000	At that time,
583000	585000	we started
585000	587000	the parent support group.
587000	589000	In fact,
589000	591000	parents have a lot of
591000	593000	interesting motivation to develop.
593000	595000	Here is a simple example.
595000	597000	For example,
597000	599000	a parent wants
599000	601000	her child to help
601000	603000	her child practice
603000	605000	taking a bath.
605000	607000	Does the child's
607000	609000	bathroom need some adjustments?
609000	611000	Does the child need
611000	613000	to practice
613000	615000	taking a bath?
615000	617000	However,
617000	619000	another parent
619000	621000	heard our discussion
621000	623000	in the group.
623000	625000	Her child is already
625000	627000	in the third grade,
627000	629000	but she did not realize
629000	631000	that children can
631000	633000	practice taking a bath.
633000	635000	She heard this
635000	637000	through this chat
637000	639000	and then came to
639000	641000	discuss with us
641000	643000	and found that
643000	645000	this is one of the goals
645000	647000	she and her child
647000	649000	want to achieve.
649000	651000	So we started to
651000	653000	discuss with her.
653000	655000	In my experience,
655000	657000	most of the time
657000	659000	parents only
659000	661000	have one or two children.
661000	663000	They may not have
663000	665000	many opportunities
665000	667000	to interact with other parents.
667000	669000	However,
669000	671000	when we set up
671000	673000	this group,
673000	675000	there were not many
675000	677000	relevant evidences
677000	679000	about how to
679000	681000	effectively provide
681000	683000	this kind of
683000	685000	parent support group
685000	687000	in our field.
687000	689000	This is why
689000	691000	I was interested
691000	693000	in reading the
693000	695000	doctor's class
695000	697000	to find out
697000	699000	how to
699000	701000	develop an
701000	703000	evidence-based
703000	705000	support group
705000	707000	for our clients.
707000	709000	I need to know
709000	711000	what I need to know
711000	713000	and what research
713000	715000	I need to do
715000	717000	in order to
717000	719000	know whether
719000	721000	my intervention
721000	723000	is effective or not.
723000	725000	So in 2014
725000	727000	and 2019,
727000	729000	I joined
729000	731000	Youth and Young Adult
731000	733000	Empowerment, Leadership,
733000	735000	and Learning.
735000	737000	We focus on
737000	739000	young adults with
739000	741000	mental disabilities
741000	743000	between 14 and
743000	745000	20 years old.
745000	747000	They are not like
747000	749000	me when I was in Taiwan.
749000	751000	I was in primary school.
751000	753000	There are relatively
753000	755000	few people in Taiwan
755000	757000	with disabilities.
757000	759000	Through the experience
759000	761000	of the doctor's class,
761000	763000	I had the opportunity
763000	765000	to learn more about
765000	767000	young adults.
767000	769000	This influenced
769000	771000	my understanding
771000	773000	of the age group
773000	775000	in my doctoral thesis.
775000	777000	My interests
777000	779000	in this research
779000	781000	are those
781000	783000	related to
783000	785000	education and
785000	787000	immigration.
787000	789000	I'm also interested
789000	791000	in cross-cultural experiences.
791000	793000	I hope that
793000	795000	my research and
795000	797000	future research
797000	799000	will be in the same
799000	801000	field.
801000	803000	In 2020,
803000	805000	I started
805000	807000	my research
807000	809000	called
809000	811000	Health Behavior and
811000	813000	Behavior.
813000	815000	My research
815000	817000	is related to
817000	819000	suicide and
819000	821000	mental illness.
821000	823000	My current boss
823000	825000	is also doing
825000	827000	qualitative research
827000	829000	and quantitative research.
829000	831000	I hope that
831000	833000	my research can
833000	835000	help patients
835000	837000	with mental illness.
837000	839000	Through this opportunity,
839000	841000	I hope that
841000	843000	my research can
843000	845000	help patients
845000	847000	with mental illness.
851000	853000	Next,
853000	855000	I will talk about
855000	857000	the two research
857000	859000	I mentioned today.
859000	861000	First,
861000	863000	I think parental involvement
863000	865000	is important.
865000	867000	Some people
867000	869000	may be involved
869000	871000	from the perspective of
871000	873000	their brothers and sisters.
873000	875000	Some people
875000	877000	may be involved
877000	879000	from the perspective
879000	881000	of their teachers
881000	883000	such as
883000	885000	doctors
885000	887000	and so on.
887000	889000	I'm interested in
889000	891000	the same thing
891000	893000	I mentioned earlier.
893000	895000	I'm interested in
895000	897000	the same thing
897000	899000	such as
899000	901000	parent involvement
905000	907000	that can lead to
907000	909000	positive effects
909000	911000	in the child's
911000	913000	social, emotional,
913000	915000	and functional outcomes.
915000	917000	Developmental disabilities
917000	919000	happened
919000	921000	when the child was
921000	923000	18 years old.
923000	925000	So it happened
925000	927000	quite early
927000	929000	and affected
929000	931000	the child for a long time.
931000	933000	You may
933000	935000	hear of
935000	937000	intellectual disability
937000	939000	or autism
939000	941000	or hearing loss
941000	943000	or mental illness
943000	945000	and so on.
945000	947000	These are the so-called
947000	949000	developmental disabilities.
949000	951000	Simply put,
951000	953000	according to
953000	955000	my research in the U.S.,
955000	957000	there is
957000	959000	a law
959000	961000	on the right
961000	963000	to learn
963000	965000	for people with
965000	967000	mental disabilities
967000	969000	called
969000	971000	Individuals with Disabilities
971000	973000	Education Improvement Act,
973000	975000	or IDEA.
975000	977000	The law
977000	979000	ensures that
979000	981000	people with disabilities
981000	983000	can access
983000	985000	the resources
985000	987000	they need
987000	989000	at their local
989000	991000	public schools
991000	993000	or private schools.
993000	995000	The law
995000	997000	clearly states
997000	999000	that parents
999000	1001000	have the right
1001000	1003000	to participate
1003000	1005000	in the child's education.
1005000	1007000	For example,
1007000	1009000	if the child's
1009000	1011000	private education
1011000	1013000	is related to
1013000	1015000	the child's
1015000	1017000	private education,
1017000	1019000	parents need to
1019000	1021000	participate.
1021000	1023000	Of course,
1023000	1025000	it's a different matter
1025000	1027000	whether parents can
1027000	1029000	participate,
1029000	1031000	but the school
1031000	1033000	must provide
1033000	1035000	the platform
1035000	1037000	for the child
1037000	1039000	to learn.
1039000	1041000	The number of
1041000	1043000	Asian immigrants
1043000	1045000	in the U.S.
1045000	1047000	grew rapidly
1047000	1049000	from more than
1049000	1051000	2 million in 1980
1051000	1053000	to more than 12 million
1053000	1055000	in 2014.
1055000	1057000	The number
1057000	1059000	increased rapidly
1059000	1061000	in 2021.
1061000	1063000	In the past,
1063000	1065000	the number
1065000	1067000	of Asian immigrants
1067000	1069000	in the U.S.
1069000	1071000	was estimated
1071000	1073000	to exceed
1073000	1075000	the number of
1075000	1077000	Hispanic immigrants
1077000	1079000	in 2025.
1079000	1081000	So,
1081000	1083000	the number
1083000	1085000	of Asian immigrants
1085000	1087000	in the U.S.
1087000	1089000	grew rapidly
1089000	1091000	and parents
1091000	1093000	couldn't provide
1093000	1095000	the appropriate services
1095000	1097000	for their children.
1097000	1099000	So,
1099000	1101000	if we
1101000	1103000	don't have
1103000	1105000	the appropriate
1105000	1107000	understanding of
1107000	1109000	the population,
1109000	1111000	there will be
1111000	1113000	some difficulties
1113000	1115000	in the service.
1115000	1117000	In the past,
1117000	1119000	when Asian parents
1119000	1121000	received education-related services,
1121000	1123000	they encountered
1123000	1125000	more obstacles.
1125000	1127000	For example,
1127000	1129000	they started
1129000	1131000	to receive services
1131000	1133000	later than others,
1133000	1135000	or they spent
1135000	1137000	less time
1137000	1139000	in the education process
1139000	1141000	than others,
1141000	1143000	etc.
1143000	1145000	In the past,
1145000	1147000	the cultural difference
1147000	1149000	between Asian and
1149000	1151000	Hispanic parents
1151000	1153000	was reduced.
1153000	1155000	So,
1155000	1157000	if we eliminate
1157000	1159000	the cultural difference,
1159000	1161000	will the obstacles
1161000	1163000	disappear naturally?
1163000	1165000	But is there
1165000	1167000	a day when
1167000	1169000	there is no cultural difference?
1169000	1171000	This is a question
1171000	1173000	worth thinking about.
1173000	1175000	In the past,
1175000	1177000	Asian parents
1177000	1179000	rarely faced
1179000	1181000	the barriers
1181000	1183000	they encountered.
1183000	1185000	So,
1185000	1187000	why did they
1187000	1189000	choose these methods?
1189000	1191000	So,
1191000	1193000	here are some
1193000	1195000	knowledge gaps in the past.
1195000	1197000	First,
1197000	1199000	they focused on barriers.
1199000	1201000	Second,
1201000	1203000	these barriers
1203000	1205000	are only related to service providers.
1205000	1207000	In fact,
1207000	1209000	there are many things
1209000	1211000	in people's lives.
1211000	1213000	As I said in the beginning,
1213000	1215000	the interaction with service providers
1215000	1217000	is important.
1217000	1219000	However,
1219000	1221000	there are many other things
1221000	1223000	and times in people's lives.
1223000	1225000	In the past,
1225000	1227000	they focused on
1227000	1229000	young children.
1229000	1231000	So,
1231000	1233000	in the past,
1233000	1235000	they focused on
1235000	1237000	young children
1237000	1239000	before high school
1239000	1241000	or high school.
1241000	1243000	In the past,
1243000	1245000	they focused on
1245000	1247000	what they wanted to do
1247000	1249000	and how to achieve
1249000	1251000	their goals.
1251000	1253000	In the past,
1253000	1255000	immigration is
1255000	1257000	a process
1257000	1259000	that changes
1259000	1261000	every day.
1261000	1263000	It's not like
1263000	1265000	you came to the US for 3 years
1265000	1267000	or Europe for 5 years
1267000	1269000	and you achieved
1269000	1271000	cultural adaptation.
1271000	1273000	In fact,
1273000	1275000	you learn new things
1275000	1277000	every day.
1277000	1279000	You have new understanding
1279000	1281000	of the country
1281000	1283000	because of the interaction.
1283000	1285000	You may be
1285000	1287000	culturally adapted
1287000	1289000	in the past.
1289000	1291000	However,
1291000	1293000	there is little research
1293000	1295000	about the changes
1295000	1297000	in the process of
1297000	1299000	cultural adaptation.
1299000	1301000	For example,
1301000	1303000	the first basic thing
1303000	1305000	is the ability to speak.
1305000	1307000	As you stay in the US
1307000	1309000	or abroad longer,
1309000	1311000	your ability to speak may change.
1311000	1313000	Then,
1313000	1315000	your understanding of
1315000	1317000	cultural adaptation may improve.
1317000	1319000	Next,
1319000	1321000	you need to understand
1321000	1323000	the concept of mental disability.
1323000	1325000	This concept may come from
1325000	1327000	your country or your values.
1327000	1329000	Your values may be affected
1329000	1331000	by the environment
1331000	1333000	or the mainstream
1333000	1335000	of society.
1335000	1337000	Next,
1337000	1339000	when you're a parent,
1339000	1341000	you don't know
1341000	1343000	what you want to do.
1343000	1345000	Many people say
1345000	1347000	they learned
1347000	1349000	how to be a parent
1349000	1351000	by being a parent.
1351000	1353000	In fact,
1353000	1355000	there are many changes
1355000	1357000	in the process of
1357000	1359000	mental disability.
1359000	1361000	However,
1361000	1363000	there is little research about it.
1363000	1365000	In my research,
1365000	1367000	I want to use
1367000	1369000	role theory and acculturation theory
1369000	1371000	as my theoretical background.
1371000	1373000	In the first part,
1373000	1375000	the role theory says
1375000	1377000	the role of a parent
1377000	1379000	is related to
1379000	1381000	the behavior
1381000	1383000	of the child.
1383000	1385000	However,
1385000	1387000	the behavior of the child
1387000	1389000	may be different
1389000	1391000	from the behavior
1391000	1393000	of the society.
1393000	1395000	It may affect
1395000	1397000	the role of the child.
1397000	1399000	There may be different adjustments.
1399000	1401000	Next,
1401000	1403000	we know
1403000	1405000	the role of a parent
1405000	1407000	is related to
1407000	1409000	the society.
1409000	1411000	If we want to understand immigrants,
1411000	1413000	we need to consider
1413000	1415000	their cultural background
1415000	1417000	to see if it
1417000	1419000	affects their
1419000	1421000	beliefs
1421000	1423000	and behaviors.
1425000	1427000	I think
1427000	1429000	this part is very simple.
1429000	1431000	We want to know
1431000	1433000	how the parents
1433000	1435000	in the U.S.
1435000	1437000	help their children
1437000	1439000	to find resources
1439000	1441000	or use resources.
1441000	1443000	What are their experiences?
1443000	1445000	I will introduce
1445000	1447000	these two researches one by one.
1447000	1449000	Through these two researches,
1449000	1451000	I want to respond to
1451000	1453000	the biggest goal.
1453000	1455000	Next,
1455000	1457000	let's talk about
1457000	1459000	meta-analysis.
1459000	1461000	I want to explain
1461000	1463000	what is meta-analysis.
1463000	1465000	I think you often hear
1465000	1467000	about meta-analysis.
1467000	1469000	It is a systematic review
1469000	1471000	and systematic analysis.
1471000	1473000	Meta-analysis is
1473000	1475000	about qualitative research.
1475000	1477000	Meta-analysis is
1477000	1479000	about quantitative research.
1479000	1481000	Meta-analysis is
1481000	1483000	about qualitative research.
1483000	1485000	The data of qualitative research
1485000	1487000	comes from other researches
1487000	1489000	related to the topic
1489000	1491000	you are interested in.
1491000	1493000	You can use the data
1493000	1495000	to make
1495000	1497000	the second analysis.
1497000	1499000	Meta-analysis is not
1499000	1501000	just about
1501000	1503000	organizing the researches
1503000	1505000	related to the topic
1505000	1507000	in the past.
1507000	1509000	It emphasizes
1509000	1511000	that you need
1511000	1513000	a new interpretation
1513000	1515000	to explain the researches
1515000	1517000	related to the topic
1517000	1519000	you are interested in.
1519000	1521000	The purpose of meta-analysis
1521000	1523000	is to put the qualitative researches
1523000	1525000	you have published
1525000	1527000	in the past
1527000	1529000	in a new perspective
1529000	1531000	to interpret them.
1531000	1533000	to interpret them.
1533000	1535000	Through this way,
1535000	1537000	we can generate
1537000	1539000	theoretical frameworks.
1539000	1541000	These frameworks
1541000	1543000	can provide
1543000	1545000	new ideas
1545000	1547000	or new guidance
1547000	1549000	to future researches
1549000	1551000	or clinical work.
1551000	1553000	to future researches
1553000	1555000	or clinical work.
1555000	1557000	Meta-analysis
1557000	1559000	was developed in 1997.
1559000	1561000	Meta-analysis was developed in 1997.
1561000	1563000	I just simply
1563000	1565000	selected PubMed as a database.
1565000	1567000	Meta-analysis has been
1567000	1569000	developing step by step.
1569000	1571000	I don't know if you have
1571000	1573000	the chance to see
1573000	1575000	similar researches.
1575000	1577000	If not,
1577000	1579000	I believe there will be
1579000	1581000	more opportunities
1581000	1583000	to see similar researches in the future.
1583000	1585000	Some researches
1585000	1587000	develop meta-analysis
1587000	1589000	and meta-synthesis
1589000	1591000	at the same time
1591000	1593000	in the same paper.
1593000	1595000	Meta-analysis
1595000	1597000	Meta-analysis
1597000	1599000	Meta-analysis
1599000	1601000	aims to develop
1601000	1603000	a theoretical framework
1603000	1605000	to describe
1605000	1607000	parents' experience
1607000	1609000	when accessing
1609000	1611000	or using
1611000	1613000	related services.
1613000	1615000	This research
1615000	1617000	was published last year
1617000	1619000	in Qualitative Health Research.
1619000	1621000	If you are interested,

1629000	1631000	Meta-analysis
1631000	1633000	Meta-analysis
1633000	1635000	is a systematic review.
1635000	1637000	We develop
1637000	1639000	search terms
1639000	1641000	and put them into different databases.
1641000	1643000	We found
1643000	1645000	more than 800 articles.
1645000	1647000	We included some inclusion criteria,
1647000	1649000	such as peer-reviewed articles
1649000	1651000	written in English,
1651000	1653000	samples,
1653000	1655000	subjects,
1655000	1657000	and topics.
1657000	1659000	We included
1659000	1661000	11 articles
1661000	1663000	in the 800 articles.
1663000	1665000	The translation
1665000	1667000	is based on
1667000	1669000	the synthesis of 11 articles.
1673000	1675000	There are
1675000	1677000	more than
1677000	1679000	170 parents
1679000	1681000	in Meta-analysis.
1681000	1683000	It was published
1683000	1685000	in 1987,
1685000	1687000	more than 30 years ago.
1687000	1689000	We published
1689000	1691000	9 articles
1691000	1693000	between 2000 and 2010.
1693000	1695000	The frequency is not high.
1695000	1697000	The latest article was published in 2016.
1697000	1699000	However, the search
1699000	1701000	was checked again in 2020.
1701000	1703000	Maybe there is a new article,
1703000	1705000	but we didn't include it.
1705000	1707000	Most of the articles
1707000	1709000	were published
1709000	1711000	between 12 and 12 years old.
1711000	1713000	There are 7 articles
1713000	1715000	between 12 and 20 years old.
1715000	1717000	Only one article
1717000	1719000	included an older child.
1719000	1721000	However,
1721000	1723000	the topic was not
1723000	1725000	targeted at the child,
1725000	1727000	but the child was older.
1727000	1729000	In the past,
1729000	1731000	most of the articles
1731000	1733000	were written in Korean,
1733000	1735000	some were in Chinese,
1735000	1737000	and some were
1737000	1739000	combined samples
1739000	1741000	from Japan,
1741000	1743000	South Asia,
1743000	1745000	and other countries.
1747000	1749000	These articles
1749000	1751000	were mostly in-person interviews.
1751000	1753000	Some were done
1753000	1755000	by phone interviews,
1755000	1757000	and some were done
1757000	1759000	by other methods.
1759000	1761000	It is worth mentioning
1761000	1763000	that most of the articles
1763000	1765000	were done
1765000	1767000	in a short period of time.
1767000	1769000	Especially,
1769000	1771000	if the interview
1771000	1773000	was a complicated one,
1773000	1775000	and we only had
1775000	1777000	a 30-minute call
1777000	1779000	or an hour-long interview,
1779000	1781000	the depth of the topic
1781000	1783000	was limited.
1783000	1785000	It was a pity
1785000	1787000	for the research
1787000	1789000	in the past.
1789000	1791000	Most of the articles
1791000	1793000	were published in the East Coast,
1793000	1795000	the West Coast,
1795000	1797000	and Chicago,
1797000	1799000	which is where
1799000	1801000	Asian-Americans live.
1801000	1803000	Now,
1803000	1805000	let's talk about
1805000	1807000	my research findings.
1807000	1809000	First,
1809000	1811000	we were curious
1811000	1813000	about the role of parents
1813000	1815000	in the process.
1815000	1817000	We analyzed
1817000	1819000	that the main goal
1819000	1821000	of parents
1821000	1823000	is to help their children
1823000	1825000	to grow up
1825000	1827000	and live a happy life.
1827000	1829000	The role
1829000	1831000	of parents
1831000	1833000	is multifaceted.
1833000	1835000	The role of parents
1835000	1837000	is multifaceted.
1837000	1839000	The role of parents
1839000	1841000	is multifaceted.
1841000	1843000	The role of parents
1843000	1845000	is multifaceted.
1845000	1847000	It is the role of parents
1847000	1849000	to help their children
1849000	1851000	to plan their future.
1851000	1853000	It is the role of parents
1853000	1855000	to help their children
1855000	1857000	to plan their future.
1857000	1859000	Many times,
1859000	1861000	other kids
1861000	1863000	don't have bruises.
1863000	1865000	Even if they only have
1865000	1867000	one child,
1867000	1869000	they still have
1869000	1871000	some things
1871000	1873000	to do
1873000	1875000	such as
1875000	1877000	their parents.
1877000	1879000	These things are
1879000	1881000	related to each other.
1881000	1883000	For example,
1883000	1885000	this father said
1885000	1887000	that he wanted to
1887000	1889000	buy a house
1889000	1891000	before he knew
1891000	1893000	about supportive living.
1893000	1895000	Then he could help
1895000	1897000	his children to
1897000	1899000	run a group home.
1899000	1901000	I don't know if you are familiar with
1901000	1903000	a group home.
1903000	1905000	It is a type of living
1905000	1907000	where 4 to 6
1907000	1909000	or 3 to 6
1909000	1911000	adults with neurodegenerative disorder
1911000	1913000	can live in a
1913000	1915000	apartment.
1915000	1917000	However, the government
1917000	1919000	won't pay their rent.
1919000	1921000	They may have a chance
1921000	1923000	to find a worker
1923000	1925000	who will come
1925000	1927000	once a day
1927000	1929000	to help them
1929000	1931000	with their daily life,
1931000	1933000	such as cooking
1933000	1935000	or washing clothes.
1935000	1937000	It depends on
1937000	1939000	the needs of each group home.
1939000	1941000	This father
1941000	1943000	later realized
1943000	1945000	that he had
1945000	1947000	improved his knowledge
1947000	1949000	about supportive living.
1949000	1951000	Otherwise,
1951000	1953000	he planned to
1953000	1955000	buy a house
1955000	1957000	and run a group home.
1957000	1959000	This quote shows
1959000	1961000	that these aspects
1961000	1963000	are related to each other.
1963000	1965000	Next,
1965000	1967000	we are curious about
1967000	1969000	the process
1969000	1971000	of the paternity.
1971000	1973000	What does it look like?
1973000	1975000	The first thing we see
1975000	1977000	is that it is
1977000	1979000	a continuous process.
1979000	1981000	Usually, it does not
1981000	1983000	end in a circle.
1983000	1985000	It may go on
1985000	1987000	until the parents
1987000	1989000	can't continue.
1989000	1991000	Or the parents
1991000	1993000	have a clear plan
1993000	1995000	for their children's future.
1995000	1997000	Then it may
1997000	1999000	stop in this circle.
1999000	2001000	Otherwise, it is
2001000	2003000	an endless cycle.
2003000	2005000	However, in each cycle,
2005000	2007000	they may experience
2007000	2009000	whether their plan
2009000	2011000	is successful.
2011000	2013000	If it is successful,
2013000	2015000	they may
2015000	2017000	achieve their goal.
2017000	2019000	However, if
2019000	2021000	their plan is not successful,
2021000	2023000	they may experience
2023000	2025000	dissatisfaction.
2025000	2027000	They may face
2027000	2029000	dissatisfaction
2029000	2031000	through coping strategies.
2031000	2033000	This coping strategy
2033000	2035000	may influence
2035000	2037000	their next action.
2037000	2039000	In this process,
2039000	2041000	we can see that
2041000	2043000	the parents
2043000	2045000	change their
2045000	2047000	coping strategies
2047000	2049000	as time goes by.
2049000	2051000	For example,
2051000	2053000	they may decide
2053000	2055000	not to attend
2055000	2057000	the meeting.
2057000	2059000	The parents
2059000	2061000	may go to the meeting
2061000	2063000	at the beginning.
2063000	2065000	However, they may
2065000	2067000	change their
2067000	2069000	coping strategies
2069000	2071000	based on
2071000	2073000	their past
2073000	2075000	interactions
2075000	2077000	with the environment.
2077000	2079000	In the case of
2079000	2081000	individual factors,
2081000	2083000	we can see that
2083000	2085000	there are several factors.
2085000	2087000	For example,
2087000	2089000	the age of the children
2089000	2091000	may influence
2091000	2093000	their actions.
2093000	2095000	In addition,
2095000	2097000	some parents
2097000	2099000	may know
2099000	2101000	how far they can go
2101000	2103000	based on their
2103000	2105000	rights as parents.
2105000	2107000	For example,
2107000	2109000	they may ask
2109000	2111000	for their rights.
2111000	2113000	This may influence
2113000	2115000	their next action.
2115000	2117000	In the case of
2117000	2119000	Korean immigrants,
2119000	2121000	their parents may
2121000	2123000	say that
2123000	2125000	their parents
2125000	2127000	respect their
2127000	2129000	profession and rights
2129000	2131000	based on their
2131000	2133000	traditional culture.
2133000	2135000	Therefore,
2135000	2137000	they may not
2137000	2139000	ask questions
2139000	2141000	because
2141000	2143000	their culture
2143000	2145000	is different from
2145000	2147000	the education of
2147000	2149000	their native country.
2149000	2151000	This may influence
2151000	2153000	their actions
2153000	2155000	In addition,
2155000	2157000	they may use
2157000	2159000	coping strategies
2159000	2161000	based on their
2161000	2163000	past interactions
2163000	2165000	with the environment.
2165000	2167000	In the case of
2167000	2169000	self-reliance,
2169000	2171000	they may not
2171000	2173000	rely on others
2173000	2175000	to solve the problem
2175000	2177000	but rely on themselves.
2177000	2179000	Some people may
2179000	2181000	look for resources
2181000	2183000	and coping strategies
2183000	2185000	based on their
2185000	2187000	past interactions
2187000	2189000	with the environment.
2189000	2191000	However,
2191000	2193000	this does not mean
2193000	2195000	they are self-reliant.
2195000	2197000	They may just
2197000	2199000	measure what happens
2199000	2201000	in their life.
2201000	2203000	The best solution
2203000	2205000	is to compromise.
2205000	2207000	It is also interesting
2207000	2209000	to see how they
2209000	2211000	respond to the
2211000	2213000	expectations of
2213000	2215000	immigrants.
2215000	2217000	However,
2217000	2219000	everyone has
2219000	2221000	different expectations.
2221000	2223000	For example,
2223000	2225000	some parents
2225000	2227000	have learned
2227000	2229000	how to interact
2229000	2231000	with their
2231000	2233000	American parents.
2233000	2235000	Some parents
2235000	2237000	may feel
2237000	2239000	that their country
2239000	2241000	has given them
2241000	2243000	a lot of resources
2243000	2245000	and they should
2245000	2247000	be a good immigrant.
2247000	2249000	Therefore,
2249000	2251000	everyone may have
2251000	2253000	different expectations.
2253000	2255000	These factors
2255000	2257000	may influence
2257000	2259000	their actions.
2259000	2261000	In the process,
2261000	2263000	many system factors
2263000	2265000	may influence
2265000	2267000	their behavior.
2267000	2269000	For example,
2269000	2271000	some parents
2271000	2273000	may have
2273000	2275000	specific guidelines
2275000	2277000	or rules
2277000	2279000	when interacting
2279000	2281000	with their
2281000	2283000	parents.
2283000	2285000	For immigrants,
2285000	2287000	social support
2287000	2289000	is very important
2289000	2291000	for all parents.
2291000	2293000	Especially for immigrants
2293000	2295000	who interact
2295000	2297000	with school or hospital
2297000	2299000	based on their needs.
2299000	2301000	For example,
2301000	2303000	language accommodation
2303000	2305000	is very important
2305000	2307000	for immigrants.
2307000	2309000	It is important
2309000	2311000	for immigrants
2311000	2313000	to know
2313000	2315000	if the information
2315000	2317000	they provide
2317000	2319000	is good
2319000	2321000	or not.
2321000	2323000	For example,
2323000	2325000	if the information
2325000	2327000	they provide
2327000	2329000	is good
2329000	2331000	or not,
2331000	2333000	they may feel
2333000	2335000	that the information
2335000	2337000	they provide
2337000	2339000	is helpful.
2339000	2341000	They may feel
2341000	2343000	that the information
2343000	2345000	they provide
2345000	2347000	is good
2347000	2349000	or not.
2349000	2351000	In the past,
2351000	2353000	they may use
2353000	2355000	the information
2355000	2357000	their parents understand
2357000	2359000	to explain to their parents.
2359000	2361000	In the process,
2361000	2363000	they may feel
2363000	2365000	that their parents' opinion
2365000	2367000	is important
2367000	2369000	and they really
2369000	2371000	want to hear
2371000	2373000	and value their parents' opinion.
2373000	2375000	They may feel
2375000	2377000	that their parents
2377000	2379000	are a support
2379000	2381000	and sometimes a barrier.
2381000	2383000	They may feel that
2383000	2385000	the system factor
2385000	2387000	needs to be considered.
2387000	2389000	This is the first part
2389000	2391000	of the study.
2391000	2393000	There are several
2393000	2395000	points of discussion.
2395000	2397000	We can see that
2397000	2399000	their parents' role
2399000	2401000	is very adaptive.
2401000	2403000	We can see that
2403000	2405000	they use various coping strategies
2405000	2407000	based on their cultural
2407000	2409000	adaptation and experience.
2409000	2411000	In fact,
2411000	2413000	we can see that
2413000	2415000	their role
2415000	2417000	is not that different
2417000	2419000	from those
2419000	2421000	non-immigrant parents.
2421000	2423000	In fact,
2423000	2425000	we can see that
2425000	2427000	their role
2427000	2429000	is not that different
2429000	2431000	from those
2431000	2433000	non-immigrant parents.
2433000	2435000	As parents,
2435000	2437000	no matter where you are,
2437000	2439000	there is a lot of
2439000	2441000	commonality.
2441000	2443000	They are all parents in the U.S.
2443000	2445000	so the environment
2445000	2447000	and the identity
2447000	2449000	of being a parent
2449000	2451000	may be similar
2451000	2453000	when they face
2453000	2455000	what they want to do.
2455000	2457000	The problem is
2457000	2459000	that they have similar goals.
2459000	2461000	However,
2461000	2463000	their approach
2463000	2465000	may be different.
2465000	2467000	We can compare
2467000	2469000	past studies.
2469000	2471000	Some studies
2471000	2473000	show that
2473000	2475000	when parents advocate
2475000	2477000	for their children
2477000	2479000	or families,
2479000	2481000	their parents
2481000	2483000	tend to
2483000	2485000	hope that
2485000	2487000	they sound nice.
2487000	2489000	In the U.S.,
2489000	2491000	non-immigrant parents
2491000	2493000	tend to say
2493000	2495000	that they want to fight
2495000	2497000	for their kids
2497000	2499000	in the process of
2499000	2501000	advocating.
2501000	2503000	Of course,
2503000	2505000	this is not true
2505000	2507000	for everyone.
2507000	2509000	However,
2509000	2511000	we can learn from
2511000	2513000	their experiences
2513000	2515000	that
2515000	2517000	their goal
2517000	2519000	may be different
2519000	2521000	when they face
2521000	2523000	cultural background.
2523000	2525000	After
2525000	2527000	doing this meta-analysis,
2527000	2529000	we found some
2529000	2531000	limitations of past studies.
2531000	2533000	So we decided
2533000	2535000	to conduct
2535000	2537000	a qualitative study
2537000	2539000	to understand
2539000	2541000	what I could not understand
2541000	2543000	in the previous meta-analysis.
2547000	2549000	In this meta-analysis study,
2549000	2551000	we found that
2551000	2553000	adults
2553000	2555000	had less experience
2555000	2557000	than children,
2557000	2559000	mostly before
2559000	2561000	they left the special education system.
2561000	2563000	By the way,
2563000	2565000	in the U.S.,
2565000	2567000	the special education system
2567000	2569000	is required to provide
2569000	2571000	services to children
2571000	2573000	before they graduate
2573000	2575000	from high school
2575000	2577000	or become
2577000	2579000	22 years old.
2579000	2581000	However,
2581000	2583000	in the U.S.,
2583000	2585000	the special education system
2585000	2587000	is not as perfect
2587000	2589000	as in the U.S.
2589000	2591000	when it comes to
2591000	2593000	school regulations
2593000	2595000	and responsibilities.
2595000	2597000	In the U.S.,
2597000	2599000	the special education system
2599000	2601000	relies on parents
2601000	2603000	to plan
2603000	2605000	what to do
2605000	2607000	in the future.
2607000	2609000	Even for
2609000	2611000	non-immigrant families,
2611000	2613000	it is difficult
2613000	2615000	for them to transition
2615000	2617000	to adulthood.
2617000	2619000	Many researches
2619000	2621000	suggest that
2621000	2623000	it sounds easy,
2623000	2625000	but it takes
2625000	2627000	3 to 5 years
2627000	2629000	for the parents
2629000	2631000	to transition
2631000	2633000	to adulthood.
2633000	2635000	It is a challenge.
2635000	2637000	In the past,
2637000	2639000	Asian immigrants
2639000	2641000	were considered
2641000	2643000	to be super big
2643000	2645000	in Asia,
2645000	2647000	including East Asia,
2647000	2649000	Southeast Asia,
2649000	2651000	South Asia,
2651000	2653000	East Asia, West Asia,
2653000	2655000	and so on.
2655000	2657000	However,
2657000	2659000	in the past,
2659000	2661000	the cultural background
2661000	2663000	of every Asian country
2663000	2665000	is very different.
2665000	2667000	If you compare
2667000	2669000	all of them,
2669000	2671000	there may be some problems.
2671000	2673000	For example,
2673000	2675000	in the past few years,
2675000	2677000	some organizations
2677000	2679000	advocating for Asian
2679000	2681000	people in the U.S.
2681000	2683000	have said that
2683000	2685000	people in the U.S.
2685000	2687000	who need help
2687000	2689000	are smart
2689000	2691000	and have good social status.
2691000	2693000	They don't need much help.
2693000	2695000	However,
2695000	2697000	the majority of
2697000	2699000	Asian people
2699000	2701000	are from East Asia,
2701000	2703000	such as Japan,
2703000	2705000	South Korea, Taiwan,
2705000	2707000	China,
2707000	2709000	and so on.
2709000	2711000	They are able to
2711000	2713000	seek better education
2713000	2715000	and make money.
2715000	2717000	In fact,
2717000	2719000	many Asian people
2719000	2721000	from Cambodia,
2721000	2723000	Vietnam,
2723000	2725000	and so on
2725000	2727000	are also Asian.
2727000	2729000	However,
2729000	2731000	due to the label,
2731000	2733000	they are unable
2733000	2735000	to get the support
2735000	2737000	they need.
2737000	2739000	Recently,
2739000	2741000	some organizations
2741000	2743000	are trying to
2743000	2745000	put them under
2745000	2747000	the same umbrella term.
2747000	2749000	In my opinion,
2749000	2751000	in the second phase
2751000	2753000	of the study,
2753000	2755000	we want to
2755000	2757000	have a clearer and
2757000	2759000	narrower group
2759000	2761000	to focus on
2761000	2763000	the experience of
2763000	2765000	the adult period.
2765000	2767000	The narrative study
2767000	2769000	I'll talk about later
2769000	2771000	is about Chinese immigrants
2771000	2773000	who are already
2773000	2775000	in the adult period.
2775000	2777000	The transition
2777000	2779000	to adulthood
2779000	2781000	is defined as
2781000	2783000	the transition from
2783000	2785000	high school to
2785000	2787000	the adult period.
2787000	2789000	The IDEA requires
2789000	2791000	the school to provide
2791000	2793000	the relevant services.
2793000	2795000	However,
2795000	2797000	the implementation
2797000	2799000	is not perfect.
2799000	2801000	If there is a
2801000	2803000	parental involvement,
2803000	2805000	the post-school education
2805000	2807000	or employment outcome
2807000	2809000	of the child
2809000	2811000	will be better.
2811000	2813000	Why do I want
2813000	2815000	to talk about
2815000	2817000	Chinese-speaking immigrants?
2817000	2819000	First,
2819000	2821000	as you can see
2821000	2823000	on the right,
2823000	2825000	Chinese is a commonly
2825000	2827000	used language in the U.S.
2827000	2829000	Among the immigrants,
2829000	2831000	the green and purple
2831000	2833000	represent the ability
2833000	2835000	to speak English
2835000	2837000	or to speak English
2837000	2839000	fluently.
2839000	2841000	In contrast,
2841000	2843000	Chinese-speaking immigrants
2843000	2845000	are more likely to
2845000	2847000	speak English fluently.
2847000	2849000	Vietnamese immigrants
2849000	2851000	are more likely to speak English fluently.
2851000	2853000	Second,
2853000	2855000	we are a research tool
2855000	2857000	so the degree of
2857000	2859000	my language and culture
2859000	2861000	will affect
2861000	2863000	my ability to
2863000	2865000	understand the phenomenon.
2865000	2867000	As an international student
2867000	2869000	and as a
2869000	2871000	Chinese-speaking immigrant
2871000	2873000	who grew up
2873000	2875000	in Taiwan,
2875000	2877000	I have the opportunity
2877000	2879000	to live abroad.
2879000	2881000	To be honest,
2881000	2883000	I am not a real immigrant
2883000	2885000	because I have no experience
2885000	2887000	in Chinese culture
2887000	2889000	and my own language background.
2889000	2891000	To sum up,
2891000	2893000	I decided to
2893000	2895000	research Chinese-speaking immigrants
2895000	2897000	if I wanted to
2897000	2899000	learn more about
2899000	2901000	Chinese-speaking immigrants.
2901000	2903000	The purpose of this research
2903000	2905000	is to understand
2905000	2907000	the experience of Chinese-speaking immigrants.
2907000	2909000	I adopted a narrative approach
2909000	2911000	so that parents
2911000	2913000	can interpret their past experiences.
2913000	2915000	Through the narrative approach,
2915000	2917000	we can learn more about
2917000	2919000	their current and past experiences
2919000	2921000	and how these experiences
2921000	2923000	affect their values,
2923000	2925000	thoughts, and behaviors.
2925000	2927000	My inclusion criteria
2927000	2929000	is that
2929000	2931000	a Chinese-speaking immigrant
2931000	2933000	needs to have a young adult child
2933000	2935000	who is 18 to 35 years old
2935000	2937000	and has a hearing impairment.
2937000	2939000	If a Chinese-speaking immigrant
2939000	2941000	comes from a country
2941000	2943000	where Chinese is spoken,
2943000	2945000	some of the people
2945000	2947000	I interviewed
2947000	2949000	were native speakers.
2949000	2951000	As an executive researcher,
2951000	2953000	I can't speak Cantonese
2953000	2955000	to some of them
2955000	2957000	because of the limitations
2957000	2959000	of my research.
2959000	2961000	However, most of them
2961000	2963000	can communicate better
2963000	2965000	in English
2965000	2967000	through Mandarin Chinese.
2967000	2969000	I can't exclude
2969000	2971000	some families
2971000	2973000	who have complicated medical needs.
2973000	2975000	If a family member
2975000	2977000	needs a 24-hour ventilator,
2977000	2979000	their lifestyle
2979000	2981000	will be different
2981000	2983000	from the family experience
2983000	2985000	of an adult
2985000	2987000	in a community.
2987000	2989000	In this research,
2989000	2991000	we excluded this type of family.
2991000	2993000	The convenient sample
2993000	2995000	is the one I found
2995000	2997000	in my book.
2997000	2999000	During my research,
2999000	3001000	we found five cases.
3001000	3003000	Most of them
3003000	3005000	immigrated to the U.S.
3005000	3007000	from 1983 to 1994.
3007000	3009000	They were
3009000	3011000	about 20 to 32 years old
3011000	3013000	when they immigrated.
3013000	3015000	One of them was a father.
3015000	3017000	Four of them were mothers.
3017000	3019000	One of the children
3019000	3021000	was a girl.
3021000	3023000	The other four were boys.
3023000	3025000	Three of them
3025000	3027000	had different levels of autism.
3027000	3029000	Some of them were highly-functioning
3029000	3031000	and could go to a high school.
3031000	3033000	Some of them
3033000	3035000	had a special education system.
3035000	3037000	Some of them
3037000	3039000	had a combination of intellectual disabilities.
3039000	3041000	The other two
3041000	3043000	had cerebral palsy and intellectual disabilities.
3043000	3045000	William's syndrome
3045000	3047000	is also a genetic disease
3047000	3049000	with some intellectual disabilities.
3049000	3051000	Only one of the parents
3051000	3053000	moved to the U.S.
3053000	3055000	because his child
3055000	3057000	was already 8 years old
3057000	3059000	in Taiwan.
3059000	3061000	He thought
3061000	3063000	the U.S. could provide
3063000	3065000	better special education services
3065000	3067000	for his child.
3067000	3069000	The other four families
3069000	3071000	immigrated to the U.S.
3071000	3073000	for other reasons,
3073000	3075000	such as work or education.
3075000	3077000	They had children
3077000	3079000	after they got married
3079000	3081000	in Taiwan.
3081000	3083000	I had three interviews
3083000	3085000	with the parents
3085000	3087000	in my data collection.
3087000	3089000	Each interview
3089000	3091000	took about two hours
3091000	3093000	and each interview
3093000	3095000	took about a week.
3095000	3097000	I met the parents
3097000	3099000	in person three times
3099000	3101000	and the interview took about
3101000	3103000	a month.
3103000	3105000	The first interview
3105000	3107000	was about self-introduction
3107000	3109000	and their family background
3109000	3111000	and their views on disabilities
3111000	3113000	and their goals
3113000	3115000	for their children.
3115000	3117000	The second interview
3117000	3119000	was about taking photos
3119000	3121000	and asking the parents
3121000	3123000	to talk more
3123000	3125000	about their stories
3125000	3127000	in the photos.
3127000	3129000	We also asked
3129000	3131000	about the impact
3131000	3133000	on their environment
3133000	3135000	during the interview.
3135000	3137000	The third interview
3137000	3139000	was about time
3139000	3141000	and their past
3141000	3143000	and present.
3143000	3145000	We asked the parents
3145000	3147000	to reflect on
3147000	3149000	their past
3149000	3151000	and present
3151000	3153000	and ask the parents
3153000	3155000	to reflect on
3155000	3157000	their past
3157000	3159000	and present
3159000	3161000	and ask the parents
3161000	3163000	to reflect on
3163000	3165000	their past
3165000	3167000	and present
3167000	3169000	and ask the parents
3169000	3171000	to reflect on
3171000	3173000	their past
3173000	3175000	and present
3175000	3177000	and ask the parents
3177000	3179000	to reflect on
3179000	3181000	their past
3181000	3183000	and present
3183000	3185000	and ask the parents
3185000	3187000	to reflect on
3187000	3189000	their past
3189000	3191000	and present
3191000	3193000	These are photos provided by the parents
3193000	3195000	For example, this parent
3195000	3197000	mentioned that
3197000	3199000	her child is a volunteer
3199000	3201000	in the hospital
3201000	3203000	where she goes every morning
3203000	3205000	and every day
3205000	3207000	Another parent
3207000	3209000	mentioned that
3209000	3211000	her child is in his early 20s
3211000	3213000	when he graduated from high school
3213000	3215000	This is very important to her
3215000	3217000	and she wants to talk about it
3217000	3219000	Another parent mentioned
3219000	3221000	that she will participate in
3221000	3223000	community activities
3223000	3225000	with her child
3225000	3227000	for the disabled
3227000	3229000	This is a community activity
3229000	3231000	where they go out
3231000	3233000	and do barbecue
3233000	3235000	It is a community activity
3235000	3237000	where they go out
3237000	3239000	and do barbecue
3239000	3241000	They may discuss
3241000	3243000	the needs of their adult needs
3243000	3245000	These two visual cues
3245000	3247000	are what I will use
3247000	3249000	in the interview
3249000	3251000	I will show this visual cue
3251000	3253000	to the parents
3253000	3255000	I think this design
3255000	3257000	is related to the background
3257000	3259000	of the disability therapist
3259000	3261000	We are used to
3261000	3263000	providing various materials
3263000	3265000	in the communication
3265000	3267000	or service
3267000	3269000	so that people with different needs
3269000	3271000	have a better chance
3271000	3273000	to understand
3273000	3275000	what we are going to talk about
3275000	3277000	We can help them
3277000	3279000	visualize
3279000	3281000	I think this is related
3281000	3283000	to the traditional
3283000	3285000	one-to-one interview
3285000	3287000	We may see more
3287000	3289000	We use different materials
3289000	3291000	to promote this
3291000	3293000	In terms of data analysis
3293000	3295000	After the interview
3295000	3297000	What did the parent
3297000	3299000	say in the interview
3299000	3301000	What did the parent say
3301000	3303000	in the interview
3303000	3305000	Why did the parent say
3305000	3307000	these things
3307000	3309000	and how did the parent
3309000	3311000	say these things
3311000	3313000	I can't talk about
3313000	3315000	the data analysis in detail
3315000	3317000	But if you are interested
3317000	3319000	I have some extra reports
3319000	3321000	I put them at the end of the report
3321000	3323000	We can discuss
3323000	3325000	Finally, I will compare
3325000	3327000	what the parent said
3327000	3329000	Let's jump to the
3329000	3331000	finding part
3331000	3333000	The first one is
3333000	3335000	what they want to do
3335000	3337000	In comparison to the
3337000	3339000	Meta-Fitness Study
3339000	3341000	They focus on
3341000	3343000	their adult life
3343000	3345000	There are two things
3345000	3347000	they want to do
3347000	3349000	The first one is
3349000	3351000	I want to help my child
3351000	3353000	develop independent living skills
3353000	3355000	so that they can live independently
3355000	3357000	The second one is
3357000	3359000	I want to help my child
3359000	3361000	develop independent adult life
3361000	3363000	Finally, I want to
3363000	3365000	help my child
3365000	3367000	live a happy and meaningful life
3367000	3369000	live a happy and meaningful life
3371000	3373000	In this process
3373000	3375000	We see several themes
3375000	3377000	The first one is
3377000	3379000	their life
3379000	3381000	The first one is
3381000	3383000	their life
3383000	3385000	The first one is
3385000	3387000	their life
3387000	3389000	How do they deal with
3389000	3391000	the environment
3391000	3393000	The environment
3393000	3395000	their life
3395000	3397000	Disagreements
3397000	3399000	Perceptions
3399000	3401000	How do they deal with
3401000	3403000	the situation
3407000	3409000	about immigration
3409000	3411000	How do they feel
3411000	3413000	about
3413000	3415000	their country
3415000	3417000	This is just a demo
3417000	3419000	It may be more complicated than this
3419000	3421000	But what I want to say is
3421000	3423000	There may be his family
3423000	3425000	There are experts he interacts with
3425000	3427000	Then there are also his service providers
3427000	3429000	There may also be this society
3429000	3431000	for
3431000	3433000	The attitude of the society
3433000	3435000	towards the family
3435000	3437000	The community he lives in
3437000	3439000	His resources and the whole
3439000	3441000	Maybe the related policy in the United States
3441000	3443000	For him, it may all affect
3443000	3445000	the role of his father-in-law
3445000	3447000	For example, this parent said
3447000	3449000	When his child graduated from high school
3449000	3451000	He gave a speech
3451000	3453000	Then he said I was very surprised
3453000	3455000	about his performance
3455000	3457000	His teacher prepared a speech for him
3457000	3459000	Because of this experience, I started to feel
3459000	3461000	In fact, it is possible to help my child
3461000	3463000	to develop self-innovation
3463000	3465000	He may not have this idea
3465000	3467000	He just thought
3467000	3469000	That's what he wanted to do
3469000	3471000	But because he saw this experience
3471000	3473000	He saw the school teacher
3473000	3475000	The school teacher provided this platform
3475000	3477000	The school teacher also showed
3477000	3479000	In fact, if there is appropriate support
3479000	3481000	In fact, the child can
3481000	3483000	Speak out what they want to say
3483000	3485000	So these
3485000	3487000	Things have affected him
3487000	3489000	How can he help his child
3491000	3493000	Just mentioned
3493000	3495000	In addition to the passive influence
3495000	3497000	Parents also feel
3497000	3499000	They have some active influence on their circle of life
3499000	3501000	For example, there is a parent
3501000	3503000	Some parents may
3503000	3505000	It should be said that the first
3505000	3507000	We see all the parents
3507000	3509000	They all feel
3509000	3511000	They play the role of this father-in-law
3511000	3513000	It's very important to their children
3513000	3515000	The second is that some parents think
3515000	3517000	Because this world can't always
3517000	3519000	Adapt to you
3519000	3521000	So we should be the one
3521000	3523000	Learn how to adapt to this world
3523000	3525000	There are also some
3525000	3527000	In the story of their parents
3527000	3529000	You can see their
3529000	3531000	Understanding of the world is more human
3531000	3533000	As long as
3533000	3535000	I have a heart
3535000	3537000	I can do what I want to do
3539000	3541000	So for example
3541000	3543000	This parent
3543000	3545000	I just got two
3545000	3547000	In the story
3547000	3549000	They are very sure
3549000	3551000	They will say that I am very sure
3551000	3553000	I 100% believe
3553000	3555000	It won't help my child
3555000	3557000	Usually this kind of plot
3557000	3559000	They only happen
3559000	3561000	They are describing the interaction between him and his child
3561000	3563000	But he may not necessarily use such a plot
3563000	3565000	Describe his interaction with other people
3565000	3567000	It's just that we talk through the parents
3567000	3569000	We can see
3569000	3571000	Parents actually know their children very well
3571000	3573000	Their relationship with their children
3573000	3575000	To put it bluntly
3575000	3577000	This thing
3577000	3579000	Their children are also their
3579000	3581000	The most important protagonist in the story
3581000	3583000	Okay, then
3583000	3585000	Some parents say
3585000	3587000	He may have to adapt to this world
3587000	3589000	For example, this parent said
3589000	3591000	I think this society is willing to accept
3591000	3593000	This is what he said to his child
3593000	3595000	He told me
3595000	3597000	He said he thought this society was willing to accept you
3597000	3599000	It's already good
3599000	3601000	Because this world can't adjust for you forever
3601000	3603000	So you have to learn how to adapt to this world
3603000	3605000	This thing may be
3605000	3607000	Parents have different views on obstacles
3607000	3609000	Some parents think
3609000	3611000	Because the problem is our own problem
3611000	3613000	It's my own deficiency
3613000	3615000	Caused this situation
3615000	3617000	So I shouldn't have asked
3617000	3619000	This society does too much for me
3619000	3621000	But not every parent thinks so
3621000	3623000	Some parents may think
3623000	3625000	Yes, my child has such an obstacle
3625000	3627000	But I think this society should
3627000	3629000	Let everyone have the right to survive
3629000	3631000	Plus we have such a law
3631000	3633000	So in fact
3633000	3635000	The school should also be able to do more
3635000	3637000	So that my child can live
3637000	3639000	I think this view
3639000	3641000	Also comes from their experience
3641000	3643000	This system is between
3643000	3645000	There are some limitations
3645000	3647000	They may not be able to overcome
3647000	3649000	Then I just talked about
3649000	3651000	This kind of family
3651000	3653000	For example, I saw parents
3653000	3655000	One of the parents even moved his whole family
3655000	3657000	To the United States
3657000	3659000	But of course this is a more specific example
3659000	3661000	But like other parents
3661000	3663000	Moving in different schools is also very common
3663000	3665000	Or they may also talk about
3665000	3667000	There are many other families in my school
3667000	3669000	They are all because
3669000	3671000	This school has good resources
3671000	3673000	So they will move here
3673000	3675000	So they are actively seeking
3675000	3677000	For their family
3677000	3679000	The most beneficial conditions
3679000	3681000	Then choose to start a family business in this place
3681000	3683000	Sometimes they
3683000	3685000	Except for themselves
3685000	3687000	I feel like
3687000	3689000	I am a role that is accepted
3689000	3691000	Sometimes they can actually switch to
3691000	3693000	He also thinks that relying on his own ability
3693000	3695000	Is able to change this society
3695000	3697000	Or change the thoughts of other parents
3697000	3699000	Like this
3699000	3701000	He said that I often take my son
3701000	3703000	To participate in community activities
3703000	3705000	In addition to the general public
3705000	3707000	There are also quite a few politicians
3707000	3709000	I hope they can see my son
3709000	3711000	So they will know more
3711000	3713000	Disabled people are in need in society
3713000	3715000	And his preface is that there are votes
3715000	3717000	So he hopes politicians
3717000	3719000	Can pay more attention to these issues
3719000	3721000	Then he also said
3721000	3723000	He saw more community parents
3723000	3725000	In fact, there is this need
3725000	3727000	He also felt that he had the opportunity
3727000	3729000	To help others through his philosophy
3729000	3731000	He did not think of his own life
3731000	3733000	Can achieve this thing
3733000	3735000	He now feels that this is his life
3735000	3737000	Very important thing
3737000	3739000	Good
3739000	3741000	Then again, for them to immigrate
3741000	3743000	In fact, most parents
3743000	3745000	Still talk about
3745000	3747000	For immigrants
3747000	3749000	He is more difficult
3749000	3751000	But although it is more difficult
3751000	3753000	But
3753000	3755000	Because they still feel
3755000	3757000	Most parents still feel
3757000	3759000	They will choose this place
3759000	3761000	Or because they recognize
3761000	3763000	In this environment in the United States
3763000	3765000	For disability
3765000	3767000	This thing is more positive
3767000	3769000	So this thing
3769000	3771000	Also a big influence
3771000	3773000	They choose this place
3773000	3775000	Take this place as their home
3775000	3777000	For example, this parent
3777000	3779000	In their country
3779000	3781000	We have to bow our heads
3781000	3783000	I often feel that I am an outsider
3783000	3785000	Then he also talked about
3785000	3787000	The story of his child's graduation
3787000	3789000	He said
3789000	3791000	When my child graduated from high school
3791000	3793000	I once discussed with other classmates
3793000	3795000	Can we make a group home together
3795000	3797000	But those white parents
3797000	3799000	Don't want to talk to me
3799000	3801000	They probably just think
3801000	3803000	I can't speak English
3803000	3805000	This parent also said
3805000	3807000	You can't rely on others
3807000	3809000	But it doesn't mean that these things are negative
3809000	3811000	But when you solve the problem
3811000	3813000	In fact, you will learn a lot
3813000	3815000	Then this thing
3815000	3817000	I think these quotes
3817000	3819000	Not only this parent
3819000	3821000	Also called other parents
3821000	3823000	I feel like I'm an outsider
3823000	3825000	This feeling
3825000	3827000	In fact, there will be a lot of challenges
3827000	3829000	So for immigrants
3829000	3831000	Many things he is
3831000	3833000	It's more difficult
3833000	3835000	But their parents
3835000	3837000	When it comes to American society
3837000	3839000	Also talked about a lot of content
3839000	3841000	For example, they feel
3841000	3843000	American society
3843000	3845000	Their views on disability
3845000	3847000	May be much more positive than their native country
3847000	3849000	Like a parent
3849000	3851000	He just came to the United States
3851000	3853000	Just found out
3853000	3855000	These schools
3855000	3857000	They will also be
3857000	3859000	At the end of the semester
3859000	3861000	The child will perform on stage
3861000	3863000	He thinks he has never thought
3863000	3865000	His children can also
3865000	3867000	Even children with special needs
3867000	3869000	Can also have their own stage
3869000	3871000	He thinks these things may come from
3871000	3873000	Americans
3873000	3875000	Or the whole American society
3875000	3877000	The awareness of disability may be different
3879000	3881000	Like this parent
3881000	3883000	He also said that his children participated
3883000	3885000	For them
3885000	3887000	A very important program
3887000	3889000	He interpreted
3889000	3891000	The reason they chose this name
3891000	3893000	They believe
3893000	3895000	Although everyone's ability
3895000	3897000	May be different
3897000	3899000	If they have the right needs
3899000	3901000	Can still live like ordinary people
3901000	3903000	Then he felt
3903000	3905000	This spirit is influenced by American culture
3905000	3907000	He also felt
3907000	3909000	About the training of disabled people
3909000	3911000	There should be no better place
3911000	3913000	Unless you find a better place in the future
3913000	3915000	Otherwise, our whole family will live here
3915000	3917000	This parent
3917000	3919000	He used the word
3919000	3921000	He is a Chinese immigrant
3921000	3923000	He also had the opportunity
3923000	3925000	Under his setting conditions
3925000	3927000	If you want to be in China
3927000	3929000	There is a good development
3929000	3931000	But he felt
3931000	3933000	The training of disabled people is better
3933000	3935000	Like some parents
3935000	3937000	Although they are
3937000	3939000	Foreigners or immigrants
3939000	3941000	But he thinks we are already
3941000	3943000	In the United States
3943000	3945000	We also want to participate in this society
3945000	3947000	Invite other members of the community
3947000	3949000	Participate in local affairs in the United States
3949000	3951000	These things
3951000	3953000	Like what they said here
3953000	3955000	The so-called influence of American culture
3955000	3957000	May be with the American disability movement
3957000	3959000	Maybe from the 60s
3959000	3961000	Starting in the 50s and 60s
3961000	3963000	And their so-called
3963000	3965000	This part of human rights
3965000	3967000	Will affect their whole country
3967000	3969000	Policy planning for mental health
3969000	3971000	Then
3971000	3973000	Also mentioned by many parents
3973000	3975000	It is quite common in the United States
3975000	3977000	There are all kinds of support groups
3977000	3979000	They rarely see in native countries
3979000	3981000	So
3981000	3983000	Through this narrative research
3983000	3985000	Then we are more open
3985000	3987000	Let the parents talk to them
3987000	3989000	A more impressive story
3989000	3991000	Then we can see more
3991000	3993000	They are in life
3993000	3995000	Important things to them
3995000	3997000	Maybe not just in the past research
3997000	3999000	Is the person who provides the service
3999000	4001000	There are also some other things
4001000	4003000	I think using narrative research
4003000	4005000	The uniqueness
4005000	4007000	You can see different things from him
4007000	4009000	Then we can see that
4009000	4011000	They can also be in their narrative
4011000	4013000	In the process of seeing their
4013000	4015000	Concept
4015000	4017000	Or what is the behavior
4017000	4019000	Based on their experience with this new country
4019000	4021000	Accumulated years of experience
4021000	4023000	And these interpretations affect their current
4023000	4025000	Interaction
4025000	4027000	Then this overall is
4027000	4029000	We are back to these two studies
4029000	4031000	Then there are several
4031000	4033000	What we see is that the parents are actually
4033000	4035000	Uh
4035000	4037000	As a parent
4037000	4039000	Their willfulness is actually through
4039000	4041000	They met these challenges
4041000	4043000	There is a chance to show
4043000	4045000	That may be
4045000	4047000	Because the past research is more
4047000	4049000	OK we are
4049000	4051000	Just keep documenting these barriers
4051000	4053000	But in fact, if you pay attention to the parents
4053000	4055000	What are the main things
4055000	4057000	Then they are actually very willful
4057000	4059000	Even if they may encounter some challenges
4059000	4061000	They still have different
4061000	4063000	For example, coping strategies
4063000	4065000	Or they may even be able to
4065000	4067000	Further affect their right to life
4067000	4069000	What I want to say next is actually
4069000	4071000	Uh, because I just started
4071000	4073000	What we are talking about is our professional thinking
4073000	4075000	Very concerned about the environment
4075000	4077000	Interaction between occupation
4077000	4079000	So for example
4079000	4081000	They both
4081000	4083000	In the study, we see that
4083000	4085000	What are the things in this environment
4085000	4087000	In fact, the impact is quite large
4087000	4089000	But every parent
4089000	4091000	They may
4091000	4093000	According to their current state
4093000	4095000	Or the environment around them
4095000	4097000	Their everyone to face the environment
4097000	4099000	Interactive mode is also quite different
4099000	4101000	May still have their own
4101000	4103000	Uniqueness
4103000	4105000	So like this kind of research
4105000	4107000	It's just very simple here
4107000	4109000	Summarize this kind of research
4109000	4111000	Maybe it can be used
4111000	4113000	After we know so much
4113000	4115000	Then the next part may be
4115000	4117000	We represent that in fact
4117000	4119000	A lot of parents are immigrating
4119000	4121000	They actually need a lot
4121000	4123000	Some environmental resources
4123000	4125000	Let them know more
4125000	4127000	What resources are available in this environment
4127000	4129000	There is also a chance to meet
4129000	4131000	Other parents
4131000	4133000	But if we have more in our environment
4133000	4135000	Similar parent center
4135000	4137000	It may be quite helpful
4137000	4139000	Then come again
4139000	4141000	These service providers
4141000	4143000	One or two really
4143000	4145000	Make them feel bad
4145000	4147000	But for them
4147000	4149000	Even after many years
4149000	4151000	It's still very strong
4151000	4153000	I think this thing
4153000	4155000	Although in the past research
4155000	4157000	There is also a constant mention of this matter
4157000	4159000	But maybe we can do this kind of research
4159000	4161000	Emphasize the importance of this matter again
4161000	4163000	We can also review some past documents
4163000	4165000	How do we create this
4165000	4167000	The so-called sham free environment
4167000	4169000	Can do
4169000	4171000	The next is because the parents
4171000	4173000	The uniqueness of their experience
4173000	4175000	And they are actually very capable
4175000	4177000	They are not just people who need help
4177000	4179000	They can actively participate in many things
4179000	4181000	So maybe for them
4181000	4183000	More effective intervention
4183000	4185000	It's kind of like a coach
4185000	4187000	For example, he is a sports player
4187000	4189000	He himself actually
4189000	4191000	I know what I'm doing
4191000	4193000	He has a lot of his
4193000	4195000	Ability to achieve
4195000	4197000	But if there is one at this time
4197000	4199000	We can discuss with him together
4199000	4201000	Then evaluate and help him
4201000	4203000	He said which things you can
4203000	4205000	Think about it again
4205000	4207000	Maybe their
4207000	4209000	On this matter
4209000	4211000	More effective
4211000	4213000	Can be promoted
4213000	4215000	As much as they can
4215000	4217000	What they want to do
4217000	4219000	Except for these things
4219000	4221000	I think we do anything
4221000	4223000	You can't get out of this historical moment
4223000	4225000	Like the recent
4225000	4227000	These hate crimes
4227000	4229000	Based on some prejudices
4229000	4231000	Although it's not
4231000	4233000	Today's research
4233000	4235000	But for a long time
4235000	4237000	It's these Asians
4237000	4239000	Being regarded as
4239000	4241000	The so-called model minority
4241000	4243000	Or like everyone
4243000	4245000	There is no need for their own needs
4245000	4247000	To actively advocate this traditional
4247000	4249000	It may make a lot of people
4249000	4251000	Even if you want to understand
4251000	4253000	They understand this group
4253000	4255000	If you don't have the opportunity
4255000	4257000	To let these groups
4257000	4259000	If the voice is heard
4259000	4261000	Then you are more likely to
4261000	4263000	Understand each other
4263000	4265000	These prejudices may exist for a long time
4265000	4267000	Including what I just said
4267000	4269000	Not just these East Asian countries
4269000	4271000	Maybe other Asian countries
4271000	4273000	Their needs are harder to hear
4273000	4275000	So I think
4275000	4277000	I hope this kind of research
4277000	4279000	It can be promoted
4279000	4281000	Different researchers or different
4281000	4283000	They are different
4283000	4285000	Cultural background
4285000	4287000	There are these ways
4287000	4289000	Can let everyone know
4289000	4291000	This type of research
4291000	4293000	I think it's not just in the United States
4293000	4295000	In Taiwan, there are actually quite a lot of
4295000	4297000	But relatively little
4297000	4299000	For example, Taiwan is actually
4299000	4301000	An immigration society
4301000	4303000	Just say that our immigration structure
4303000	4305000	May not be the same as the United States
4305000	4307000	In fact, from Taiwan
4307000	4309000	Maybe since the 1990s
4309000	4311000	In fact, Taiwan and the United States
4311000	4313000	Their rapid increase
4313000	4315000	This number is actually rapid growth
4315000	4317000	In fact, they are now
4317000	4319000	Our so-called new immigrants
4319000	4321000	But for these new immigrants
4321000	4323000	The process of employment in Taiwan
4323000	4325000	At present, there is no relevant research
4325000	4327000	So I am actually
4327000	4329000	After I returned to Taiwan
4329000	4331000	I also hope
4331000	4333000	If I want to be in this place
4333000	4335000	Develop some
4335000	4337000	For this place
4337000	4339000	For local community
4339000	4341000	Do some more exploratory research
4341000	4343000	Then we can know more about their needs
4343000	4345000	What is it
4345000	4347000	So today I still have some limitations
4347000	4349000	Of course, in the past, our research
4349000	4351000	He will be limited to
4351000	4353000	Maybe we see this finding now
4353000	4355000	It comes from me
4355000	4357000	I met this sample
4357000	4359000	May need more in the future
4359000	4361000	Still need more research
4361000	4363000	Invest in this area
4363000	4365000	It's just that there are good and bad
4365000	4367000	Start from a place
4367000	4369000	I hope this kind of research can be provided
4369000	4371000	Some new understanding
4371000	4373000	Perspective
4373000	4375000	Ok
4375000	4377000	In the part of Acknowledgement
4377000	4379000	Of course, I am very grateful to the parents who participated
4379000	4381000	And my own past
4381000	4383000	Instructors and Kouwei
4383000	4385000	And this is my second research
4385000	4387000	He actually has two
4387000	4389000	Advisory Board Members
4389000	4391000	One is a parent
4391000	4393000	A local NGO in Boston
4393000	4395000	NGO staff
4395000	4397000	He has long been with the local
4397000	4399000	Communicative community
4399000	4401000	So he also helped me with some cases
4401000	4403000	Then provide me a lot of assistance in the process
4403000	4405000	Then come again
4405000	4407000	His founding source is from
4407000	4409000	Boston University
4409000	4411000	We are here
4411000	4413000	The college is called Sargent College
4413000	4415000	They provide a doctoral student
4415000	4417000	A founding
4417000	4419000	Thank you very much for your participation today
4419000	4421000	My report is probably here
4421000	4423000	If you have any questions
4423000	4425000	We should be able to
4425000	4427000	Enter the discussion stage
4429000	4431000	Thank you for the wonderful report
4431000	4433000	And speech
4433000	4435000	At this time we will open
4435000	4437000	Q&A time
4437000	4439000	Then see if there are any participants who want to ask questions
4439000	4441000	You can turn on your microphone at any time
4441000	4443000	To ask questions
4443000	4445000	Or you can also write in the chat room
4445000	4447000	I can also help you ask questions
4447000	4449000	When everyone is thinking
4449000	4451000	I just want to ask you
4451000	4453000	If possible
4453000	4455000	First
4455000	4457000	Thank you
4457000	4459000	First of all
4459000	4461000	Thank you again for your wonderful speech
4461000	4463000	I want to ask
4463000	4465000	Actually when we talk about parenting
4465000	4467000	You just started
4467000	4469000	Talking about parenting involvement
4469000	4471000	In fact, for me
4471000	4473000	I think parenting involvement
4473000	4475000	It's actually a bright concept
4475000	4477000	It's parents
4477000	4479000	How many things to do to the child
4479000	4481000	It's actually a number concept
4481000	4483000	But within this number
4483000	4485000	There may be different behaviors
4485000	4487000	I can imagine
4487000	4489000	In the family of children with special needs
4489000	4491000	Parents to children
4491000	4493000	In fact, in addition to
4493000	4495000	Specific to their
4495000	4497000	Disability
4497000	4499000	Some of the problems
4499000	4501000	A special parenting behavior
4501000	4503000	In addition to
4503000	4505000	They may actually have other
4505000	4507000	General parenting style
4507000	4509000	Or
4509000	4511000	Strategy
4511000	4513000	Or their general parenting atmosphere
4513000	4515000	I'm also very curious
4515000	4517000	In your two studies
4517000	4519000	Especially in your first meta-analysis
4519000	4521000	Did you see
4521000	4523000	In these families
4523000	4525000	These immigrants
4525000	4527000	They deal with children
4527000	4529000	The changes in the special parenting behavior
4529000	4531000	What are the differences from ordinary families
4531000	4533000	Different changes
4533000	4535000	Divided into two levels
4535000	4537000	One is their special plan
4537000	4539000	The other is their
4539000	4541000	General parenting behavior
4541000	4543000	This is the first question
4543000	4545000	The second question is
4545000	4547000	In culture
4547000	4549000	I just said
4549000	4551000	It's a level problem
4551000	4553000	The second level is when they move
4553000	4555000	When they immigrated to the United States
4555000	4557000	Their culture shock
4557000	4559000	It may not only reflect
4559000	4561000	Western culture
4561000	4563000	They are also in their own past
4563000	4565000	If they are Asian
4565000	4567000	Or maybe they are Chinese
4567000	4569000	Or Taiwanese
4569000	4571000	They actually brought their own culture
4571000	4573000	In this way
4573000	4575000	Under the conflict
4575000	4577000	Is it possible that their parenting behavior
4577000	4579000	Or their parenting atmosphere will also change
4579000	4581000	This is the second question
4581000	4583000	The third question is
4583000	4585000	You can answer it again
4585000	4587000	The third question is
4587000	4589000	At the end of the question
4589000	4591000	Parent Perceived Role
4591000	4593000	It's more like
4593000	4595000	Parenting Goal
4595000	4597000	Or Socialization Goal
4597000	4599000	How do parents want to
4599000	4601000	How to raise their children
4601000	4603000	I'm a little curious about this
4603000	4605000	Parents always have some expectations
4605000	4607000	Before they have children
4607000	4609000	They have some fixed expectations
4609000	4611000	After they have children
4611000	4613000	Their expectations will probably change
4613000	4615000	Especially when they
4615000	4617000	When they have children
4617000	4619000	Their expectations
4619000	4621000	How to change
4621000	4623000	After the change
4623000	4625000	As time goes by
4625000	4627000	There may be some changes
4627000	4629000	I don't know your
4629000	4631000	Narrative study
4631000	4633000	Can answer this question
4633000	4635000	How do they face this
4635000	4637000	These three questions
4637000	4639000	There is also a very important aspect
4639000	4641000	You just mentioned
4641000	4643000	Meta-synthesis
4643000	4645000	It's a big
4645000	4647000	Global strategy
4647000	4649000	You mentioned a compound to expectation
4649000	4651000	I feel that
4651000	4653000	In this matter
4653000	4655000	Parents and
4655000	4657000	Interaction with the environment
4657000	4659000	May also be a very important
4659000	4661000	Influence factor
4661000	4663000	I asked three questions
4665000	4667000	These are probably the three questions
4667000	4669000	Thank you
4669000	4671000	Let's start from the last question
4671000	4673000	Just mentioned
4673000	4675000	Is there any change in the expectation
4675000	4677000	In fact, this matter
4677000	4679000	In my sharing today
4679000	4681000	I didn't mention it
4681000	4683000	But because of the change of time
4683000	4685000	I want to answer the question
4685000	4687000	I can give an example
4687000	4689000	For example, there is a parent
4689000	4691000	His child is
4691000	4693000	Autism
4693000	4695000	In his interview
4695000	4697000	Keep mentioning
4697000	4699000	At the beginning
4699000	4701000	Because
4701000	4703000	Autism is
4703000	4705000	You may not find out
4705000	4707000	Maybe he is three or five years old
4707000	4709000	Or even he is already in high school
4709000	4711000	Like a parent
4711000	4713000	He is already in high school
4713000	4715000	It seems to be elementary school or high school
4715000	4717000	His child's anxiety
4717000	4719000	Becomes very serious
4719000	4721000	So my child
4721000	4723000	So-called special child
4723000	4725000	He has this
4725000	4727000	Asperger's or autism
4727000	4729000	He didn't know when he was born
4729000	4731000	So these two parents
4731000	4733000	I think
4733000	4735000	Like a brain paralysis
4735000	4737000	This is usually when you are born
4737000	4739000	You may know
4739000	4741000	Your child has this situation
4741000	4743000	What will happen to him in the future
4743000	4745000	Their doctor
4745000	4747000	May also give them some
4747000	4749000	The so-called aftermath
4749000	4751000	This child is probably like this
4751000	4753000	This kind of
4753000	4755000	Give them a
4755000	4757000	Reduce their expectations
4757000	4759000	I think so
4759000	4761000	They are different obstacles
4761000	4763000	Sometimes this kind of slowly
4763000	4765000	Only realized
4765000	4767000	This kind of obstacle
4767000	4769000	Their parents did mention
4769000	4771000	They were very excited about their children at first
4771000	4773000	I hope he can go
4773000	4775000	Usually go to school like a child
4775000	4777000	Especially if the performance of the school is good
4777000	4779000	Gradually discovered
4779000	4781000	My child has this special need
4781000	4783000	Or he is very anxious
4783000	4785000	He began to adjust slowly
4785000	4787000	Reduce his expectations
4787000	4789000	But later
4789000	4791000	It's not even adjusted
4791000	4793000	The point is different
4793000	4795000	Maybe he started earlier
4795000	4797000	He also put it in
4797000	4799000	I hope his academic performance is good
4799000	4801000	Then he thought that as immigrants
4801000	4803000	We want to be able to succeed in a new country
4803000	4805000	Must rely on education
4805000	4807000	So he felt that my child must
4807000	4809000	Find a good high school
4809000	4811000	But then he slowly
4811000	4813000	Because of these things
4813000	4815000	He slowly adjusted to say okay
4815000	4817000	It's okay if you can't go to college today
4817000	4819000	It's okay if you graduate from high school
4819000	4821000	It's okay if you really graduated from high school
4821000	4823000	It's okay if you can't really graduate from high school
4823000	4825000	Can you at least finish
4825000	4827000	They have been adjusting
4827000	4829000	In the end
4829000	4831000	He talked about my expectations of my children
4831000	4833000	Those looking for a job
4833000	4835000	Of course he still hopes that his children
4835000	4837000	Can live independently
4837000	4839000	But what he cares about
4839000	4841000	He is looking forward to his children
4841000	4843000	Can I let my children have a happy life
4843000	4845000	Better than his original
4845000	4847000	For this child
4847000	4849000	Hope he is a traditional first-time
4849000	4851000	Or through education
4851000	4853000	Then find a good job for yourself
4853000	4855000	This expectation is indeed
4855000	4857000	In this narrative
4857000	4859000	They often see it in the process of narrative
4859000	4861000	Then just
4861000	4863000	The second question is about
4863000	4865000	Their culture shock
4865000	4867000	Please
4867000	4869000	Please
4869000	4871000	Sorry
4871000	4873000	Just because of this question
4873000	4875000	I am also curious
4875000	4877000	Maybe their expectation will change
4877000	4879000	In the process of change
4879000	4881000	How did they transform
4881000	4883000	He may have received
4883000	4885000	External resources
4885000	4887000	Or maybe his friend
4887000	4889000	I think many parents
4889000	4891000	When he is facing this matter
4891000	4893000	His mental change
4893000	4895000	I think more or less
4895000	4897000	There may be some stimuli
4897000	4899000	Let him help him to do this
4899000	4901000	Then he may be emotional
4901000	4903000	Will there be some fluctuations
4903000	4905000	Sorry to interrupt
4905000	4907000	I think the fluctuation is quite common
4907000	4909000	Usually the parents are describing
4909000	4911000	In the process of these things
4911000	4913000	Even if they have adjusted
4913000	4915000	My expectations of my children
4915000	4917000	They usually describe this
4917000	4919000	The process is quite painful
4919000	4921000	He was originally
4921000	4923000	As the expectation of ordinary parents
4923000	4925000	Then slowly
4925000	4927000	He met
4927000	4929000	I think most of the time they will adjust expectations
4929000	4931000	Often encounter a lot of setbacks
4931000	4933000	Then met some of them
4933000	4935000	No matter how hard they try
4935000	4937000	Things that can't be changed
4937000	4939000	Then this time
4939000	4941000	This emotion and this setback
4941000	4943000	This happened
4943000	4945000	Then another one happened
4945000	4947000	They may also interact with the teacher
4947000	4949000	Or interact with other families
4949000	4951000	The setback may be that they have this high expectation
4951000	4953000	Then slowly reduce
4953000	4955000	They will be very anxious
4955000	4957000	They don't know
4957000	4959000	If my child can't do this
4959000	4961000	I only know that way
4961000	4963000	If this way can't succeed
4963000	4965000	Then my child
4965000	4967000	There is no other place to go
4967000	4969000	I can't imagine
4969000	4971000	What should I do
4971000	4973000	But usually this time
4973000	4975000	There will be a slight bounce back
4975000	4977000	Is that they see other children
4977000	4979000	Other families he knows
4979000	4981000	Older children than him
4981000	4983000	They may often mention that I know that
4983000	4985000	Their children are a little older than us
4985000	4987000	Then his ability is about the same
4987000	4989000	A little better
4989000	4991000	But what did I see them do
4991000	4993000	I think they seem to be pretty good
4993000	4995000	So often this time they
4995000	4997000	Fall into that valley
4997000	4999000	I don't know how to go up
4999000	5001000	The model they see around
5001000	5003000	Or need the teacher to provide
5003000	5005000	Suggestions or possibilities
5005000	5007000	For them
5007000	5009000	Is that they adjust this expectation
5009000	5011000	Slowly and more
5011000	5013000	More comfortable
5013000	5015000	A key thing in life
5017000	5019000	Probably like this
5019000	5021000	Then I go back to the second one now
5021000	5023000	The second question
5023000	5025000	Just talked about
5025000	5027000	How to be a parent with the original Asian culture
5027000	5029000	Then to a new place
5029000	5031000	There seems to be some impact
5031000	5033000	This thing actually started with me
5033000	5035000	Because when I was reading the file
5035000	5037000	I did talk about this so-called culture
5037000	5039000	Conflicts
5039000	5041000	Then I was expecting
5041000	5043000	I may see more conflicts in this research
5043000	5045000	Originally my native culture
5045000	5047000	Tell me how my parents should be better
5047000	5049000	It doesn't seem to be the same here
5049000	5051000	So I seem to have some conflicts
5051000	5053000	I'm going to find a way
5053000	5055000	Reorganize myself
5055000	5057000	But the unexpected thing
5057000	5059000	This thing seems to be in my
5059000	5061000	In this sample
5061000	5063000	Obviously I asked them
5063000	5065000	So for example
5065000	5067000	Is there anything you think
5067000	5069000	You want to do what you think you should do
5069000	5071000	But after coming here, I found out that everyone seems not like this
5071000	5073000	I am just this sample
5073000	5075000	I didn't see too many
5075000	5077000	This example is more
5077000	5079000	They feel here
5079000	5081000	In the parents' expectations
5081000	5083000	On the contrary, it is more open
5083000	5085000	He may think
5085000	5087000	Of course there is a piece
5087000	5089000	Advocacy part
5089000	5091000	I didn't have this expectation in the past
5091000	5093000	Now come here and find this expectation
5093000	5095000	But this expectation
5095000	5097000	In my sample
5097000	5099000	It doesn't seem to make them feel very painful
5099000	5101000	But also in that part
5101000	5103000	Can show you a quote
5103000	5105000	He is
5105000	5107000	Other research mentioned
5107000	5109000	But he is 2009
5109000	5111000	So I don't know if this thing is related to time
5111000	5113000	Then this parent he talked about
5113000	5115000	He learned to have advocacy
5115000	5117000	But he also said that he felt this thing was very painful
5117000	5119000	For example, he is very worried
5119000	5121000	Does it look disrespectful or pushy
5121000	5123000	But actually I know
5123000	5125000	I need to do this
5125000	5127000	Then he also recognized that he knew some American mothers
5127000	5129000	They can say a lot of things very quickly
5129000	5131000	Whether it's right or wrong
5131000	5133000	In short, you just say it
5133000	5135000	If you disagree, you have to speak up
5135000	5137000	For him, this mother
5137000	5139000	He is a mother from Japan
5139000	5141000	He thinks this thing is too magical
5141000	5143000	I didn't think I would do this
5143000	5145000	Then it's not the same as the education I received
5145000	5147000	The background is not the same
5147000	5149000	Then we have to do this thing now
5149000	5151000	It's difficult for me
5151000	5153000	Even though I've been here for so many years
5153000	5155000	So like this
5155000	5157000	I thought I was in my interview
5157000	5159000	Will see a similar conflict
5159000	5161000	But in my five samples
5161000	5163000	It seems to be okay
5163000	5165000	But I think this will be because of my sample
5165000	5167000	To be honest
5167000	5169000	He is actually a
5169000	5171000	Their corresponding knowledge level
5171000	5173000	Are relatively high
5173000	5175000	They are relatively
5175000	5177000	There are quite a lot of resources
5177000	5179000	For example
5179000	5181000	If you see this
5181000	5183000	Their family income and education level
5183000	5185000	Except for this second case
5185000	5187000	They seem to be slightly
5187000	5189000	It's not that high
5189000	5191000	In fact, other families
5191000	5193000	They have to have the desire
5193000	5195000	Come to this two-hour interview
5195000	5197000	Three interviews in a row
5197000	5199000	Their family resources
5199000	5201000	Knowledge level is higher
5201000	5203000	So actually I think
5203000	5205000	Maybe it's because of this
5205000	5207000	I didn't see so many conflicts
5207000	5209000	But in this parent
5209000	5211000	On this second parent
5211000	5213000	He described a lot
5213000	5215000	For example, he thinks he doesn't want his children
5215000	5217000	He hopes his children to study hard
5217000	5219000	Don't keep going to parties
5219000	5221000	He has different
5221000	5223000	Except for his own disabled child
5223000	5225000	This child has a brother
5225000	5227000	That brother is an ordinary child
5227000	5229000	He is in the process of telling the story
5229000	5231000	He thinks he doesn't want his children
5231000	5233000	He said his brother
5233000	5235000	That brother may have to take a big test
5235000	5237000	I went to the party the day before
5237000	5239000	He felt bad
5239000	5241000	He had a little dispute with his son
5241000	5243000	As a result, when he went to school
5243000	5245000	The school teacher told him
5245000	5247000	I just like your son
5247000	5249000	I think it's good
5249000	5251000	You should not only read
5251000	5253000	You should also play
5253000	5255000	Americans play this set
5255000	5257000	You should let them look like this
5257000	5259000	Some conflicts
5259000	5261000	It did happen to this mother
5261000	5263000	But I don't know why
5263000	5265000	On the other 1345
5265000	5267000	They will talk about the difference
5267000	5269000	For example, there is a parent
5269000	5271000	He came to America
5271000	5273000	Found that American schools emphasize
5273000	5275000	Independent living ability
5275000	5277000	It's not the same as he imagined
5277000	5279000	They may emphasize
5279000	5281000	You have to let your children use the dishwasher
5281000	5283000	You may have to teach your children
5283000	5285000	Make sandwiches
5285000	5287000	He may be different
5287000	5289000	But he didn't think
5289000	5291000	This is a very difficult conflict for him
5291000	5293000	He felt
5293000	5295000	It turned out to be like this
5295000	5297000	Can I learn
5297000	5299000	I think it's pretty good
5299000	5301000	He has the ability
5301000	5303000	To face new expectations
5303000	5305000	When he thinks it's good
5305000	5307000	For him
5307000	5309000	The cultural difference
5309000	5311000	Did not cause him too much pressure
5311000	5313000	I think I will learn
5313000	5315000	This part is true
5315000	5317000	With me in the file
5317000	5319000	Or before I entered this research
5319000	5321000	Assumption is a bit different
5321000	5323000	I think it has something to do with the sample
5323000	5325000	Then the first question
5325000	5327000	Is about
5327000	5329000	Educational behavior
5329000	5331000	Educational behavior
5331000	5333000	I think this thing is quite interesting
5333000	5335000	He actually has a lot of files
5335000	5337000	The so-called educational behavior
5337000	5339000	It may be more focused on him
5339000	5341000	Interaction between parents and children
5341000	5343000	But in this research
5343000	5345000	The focus we wanted to do
5345000	5347000	Not educational behavior
5347000	5349000	What we want to do is
5349000	5351000	Educational resources in the environment
5351000	5353000	Or interaction with medical resources
5353000	5355000	So this part
5355000	5357000	In my interview
5357000	5359000	There is no great bias
5359000	5361000	To talk about educational behavior
5361000	5363000	But I didn't ask the parents
5363000	5365000	How do you teach your children
5365000	5367000	But because we are talking
5367000	5369000	Transition to adulthood
5369000	5371000	How to help
5371000	5373000	What are they interacting with their children
5373000	5375000	I can think of now
5375000	5377000	Several impressive examples
5377000	5379000	For example
5379000	5381000	They learned some
5381000	5383000	They may see Americans
5383000	5385000	More praise children
5385000	5387000	So they think this set of their children
5387000	5389000	Also quite effective
5389000	5391000	So there may be two or three parents
5391000	5393000	I mentioned that I was teaching him
5393000	5395000	I will always encourage him
5395000	5397000	Then I will know what he is interested in
5397000	5399000	What is stuck
5399000	5401000	I will also say quickly
5401000	5403000	Or do we want to rest first
5403000	5405000	Or I will come back later
5405000	5407000	Re-discuss this matter
5407000	5409000	So I think they are in this process
5409000	5411000	I mentioned some education
5411000	5413000	But this is not my original
5413000	5415000	The focus of the problem
5415000	5417000	So it's more about the parents
5417000	5419000	I didn't ask comprehensively
5419000	5421000	Then I didn't analyze it
5421000	5423000	For this one
5423000	5425000	But their education
5425000	5427000	I think it's special
5427000	5429000	The way they see it in the United States
5429000	5431000	And mainly their children
5431000	5433000	This particularity
5433000	5435000	May make them
5435000	5437000	Compared to ordinary parents
5437000	5439000	They have more opportunities to see
5439000	5441000	Other teachers
5441000	5443000	Or other parents
5443000	5445000	How do they teach
5445000	5447000	Children with neurodegenerative disorders
5447000	5449000	They may be more inclined to learn
5449000	5451000	This type of education
5451000	5453000	But I didn't ask
5453000	5455000	When you teach this child
5455000	5457000	With another child
5457000	5459000	Do you have any
5459000	5461000	Big difference
5461000	5463000	I don't know if I answered
5463000	5465000	The three questions you wanted to ask
5465000	5467000	Thank you
5467000	5469000	Thank you very much
5469000	5471000	I think I learned a lot
5471000	5473000	My question is like this
5473000	5475000	I just saw
5475000	5477000	Pei Chen
5477000	5479000	There is a question
5479000	5481000	Do you want to see the microphone yourself
5481000	5483000	Okay
5483000	5485000	Hello
5485000	5487000	Hello
5487000	5489000	Thank you
5489000	5491000	Thank you
5491000	5493000	Thank you
5493000	5495000	It seems like
5495000	5497000	The sound is a bit cut off
5497000	5499000	Is it a signal
5499000	5501000	Gao Shen, can you hear it clearly? Or is it just me?
5501000	5503000	I don't seem to hear it
5503000	5505000	Can you hear it like this?
5505000	5507000	Yes, I can
5507000	5509000	Much better
5511000	5513000	Sorry
5513000	5515000	Thank you for your presentation
5515000	5517000	I learned a lot
5517000	5519000	Then I am
5519000	5521000	Zhen Pei Chen
5521000	5523000	I just graduated
5523000	5525000	I have a curious question
5525000	5527000	Is
5527000	5529000	You observed these parents in the United States
5529000	5531000	I am quite curious
5531000	5533000	These parents
5533000	5535000	Will they all focus on the same
5535000	5537000	Parental Support Group
5537000	5539000	Or
5539000	5541000	Are they scattered in different
5541000	5543000	Parental Support Group
5543000	5545000	Because your analysis also mentioned
5545000	5547000	They think they can change
5547000	5549000	Some of the community level
5549000	5551000	They can have some influence
5551000	5553000	Or creativity
5553000	5555000	Want to change some community level things
5555000	5557000	Then I am quite curious
5557000	5559000	Are they a group of people to change together
5559000	5561000	Or more
5561000	5563000	One person has to face
5563000	5565000	The whole community
5565000	5567000	People like this
5567000	5569000	I just want to know
5569000	5571000	Your observation
5571000	5573000	Because I found these parents
5573000	5575000	They don't know each other
5575000	5577000	Then they all live in the Greater Boston area
5577000	5579000	But they didn't participate in
5579000	5581000	What Support Group
5581000	5583000	Although they all mentioned
5583000	5585000	The existence of this Support Group
5585000	5587000	But also for Asian
5587000	5589000	Or for families who speak Chinese
5589000	5591000	As far as I know
5591000	5593000	There are not many in Boston
5593000	5595000	It may be one or two years
5595000	5597000	These parents
5597000	5599000	Sometimes they go to school
5599000	5601000	He may participate
5601000	5603000	He may go to this school
5603000	5605000	This school originally their parents
5605000	5607000	There are some organizations like parent meetings
5607000	5609000	Then they have this opportunity to participate
5609000	5611000	Group with other parents
5611000	5613000	But not necessarily a Support Group
5613000	5615000	Maybe just everyone discuss together
5615000	5617000	This so-called IEP
5617000	5619000	Or the school
5619000	5621000	Children's rights
5621000	5623000	He will observe through these ways
5623000	5625000	Other non-Asian immigrants
5625000	5627000	Parents
5627000	5629000	How do they interact with this community
5629000	5631000	One of the parents
5631000	5633000	He mentioned that he also wanted to do this
5633000	5635000	Support Group
5635000	5637000	He found this very interesting
5637000	5639000	Then he just had a person
5639000	5641000	He felt that OK
5641000	5643000	In fact, this is great
5643000	5645000	Then we Asians seem to be relatively small
5645000	5647000	Then I will do it myself
5647000	5649000	He felt good
5649000	5651000	Then I have to rely on myself
5651000	5653000	The quote he used
5653000	5655000	He said he wanted to influence his community
5655000	5657000	That's a dad
5657000	5659000	Just his own job
5659000	5661000	He is in an NGO
5661000	5663000	But his object is the elderly
5663000	5665000	Then he lives in that area
5665000	5667000	More
5667000	5669000	Is a Chinese immigrant
5669000	5671000	Then their position
5671000	5673000	Relatively
5673000	5675000	Not so rich
5675000	5677000	Resource area
5677000	5679000	His original job
5679000	5681000	This Asian community is very close
5681000	5683000	Then he just felt
5683000	5685000	This Asian community was originally doing service
5685000	5687000	But he felt that he could just
5687000	5689000	Through his connection with this community
5689000	5691000	Let everyone in his community know
5691000	5693000	He has a disabled child
5693000	5695000	Then he also encouraged others because of this
5695000	5697000	There are parents in this community who are also disabled
5697000	5699000	Willing to take the child out
5699000	5701000	Strictly speaking
5701000	5703000	I don't think they have yet
5703000	5705000	How many people do we need to gather together
5705000	5707000	Do this thing together
5707000	5709000	I have the ability and resources now
5709000	5711000	I still have time to invest
5711000	5713000	Then I am around me
5713000	5715000	To influence the people I know around me
5715000	5717000	At this level
5717000	5719000	As far as I know
5719000	5721000	I just met another one recently
5721000	5723000	He is a social worker
5723000	5725000	Then he is in Boston
5725000	5727000	They are really providing
5727000	5729000	To parents who speak Chinese
5729000	5731000	They have support groups
5731000	5733000	Then there are parents who speak Portuguese and Spanish
5733000	5735000	But I still don't know about them
5735000	5737000	Because of the situation
5737000	5739000	I met the epidemic
5739000	5741000	Because of the epidemic
5741000	5743000	No face-to-face contact
5743000	5745000	If they are this kind of organization
5745000	5747000	They are more organized
5747000	5749000	Provide this kind of service
5749000	5751000	They are not parents
5751000	5753000	They are more
5753000	5755000	He is a NGO doing similar things
5757000	5759000	Thank you
5759000	5761000	No
5761000	5763000	Thank you
5763000	5765000	Then we ask the audience on site
5765000	5767000	Any other questions
5773000	5775000	If everyone has no other questions
5775000	5777000	Or maybe later
5777000	5779000	We can discuss again
5779000	5781000	Or maybe in private
5781000	5783000	Contact the epidemic
5783000	5785000	If you feel
5785000	5787000	If it's convenient
5787000	5789000	We can do a final sum up
5789000	5791000	Do you have anything
5791000	5793000	I want to share
5793000	5795000	Take home message
5797000	5799000	I think the main first thing
5799000	5801000	I think
5801000	5803000	Why do you want to do this research
5803000	5805000	I think this group of people
5805000	5807000	Their voice is less heard
5807000	5809000	May be limited to
5809000	5811000	Language
5813000	5815000	The past research is still more mainstream
5815000	5817000	Even in white families
5817000	5819000	People with high social status
5821000	5823000	Experience
5823000	5825000	I hope through this kind of research
5825000	5827000	Can let everyone see this kind of research
5827000	5829000	Less presented
5829000	5831000	So this is what I do
5831000	5833000	This kind of research
5833000	5835000	The motivation
5835000	5837000	This kind of research
5837000	5839000	It should be more and more
5839000	5841000	Not just in certain groups
5841000	5843000	I hope it's in all kinds of
5843000	5845000	People with cultural backgrounds
5845000	5847000	Should have this kind of research
5847000	5849000	To understand their experience
5849000	5851000	The second thing I want to talk about
5851000	5853000	Maybe as
5853000	5855000	Professionals or clinical staff
5855000	5857000	Sometimes our perspective
5857000	5859000	Will be more limited
5859000	5861000	The interaction between me and this person
5861000	5863000	But I hope through this kind of research
5863000	5865000	What I want to bring to everyone
5865000	5867000	When you face this person
5867000	5869000	Or his past
5869000	5871000	The present and future
5871000	5873000	Actually affect
5873000	5875000	Why is he here now
5875000	5877000	With what he is doing now
5877000	5879000	But we usually may
5879000	5881000	No more than this
5881000	5883000	Or did not have the opportunity to understand his past
5883000	5885000	You may be right
5885000	5887000	What he is doing now
5887000	5889000	Can't understand
5889000	5891000	If he is different from what you think
5891000	5893000	There may be some conflicts
5893000	5895000	But I hope through this kind of research
5895000	5897000	For everyone to see
5897000	5899000	We face this individual
5899000	5901000	Then
5901000	5903000	Next
5905000	5907000	I think I mainly want to tell you
5907000	5909000	These two things
5909000	5911000	I also hope in the future
5911000	5913000	Can do some in Taiwan
5913000	5915000	Apply this type of research
5915000	5917000	But I don't think this
5917000	5919000	This kind of research discovery
5919000	5921000	It can be directly in another country
5921000	5923000	After all, the conditions of each country
5923000	5925000	Or historical background
5925000	5927000	Are very different
5927000	5929000	I think this kind of thing
5929000	5931000	If you want to be in different places
5931000	5933000	To do it
5933000	5935000	It actually takes some time
5935000	5937000	Do the local community
5937000	5939000	You may have a deeper understanding
5939000	5941000	You know how to target
5941000	5943000	You want to provide services
5943000	5945000	Provide the most effective thing for them
5945000	5947000	So probably
5947000	5949000	If today's take-home
5949000	5951000	I hope these three points
5951000	5953000	Thank you Yiting
5953000	5955000	Thank you for your wonderful speech today
5955000	5957000	And the take-home message just now
5957000	5959000	I think for many of our audience
5959000	5961000	It should be very helpful
5961000	5963000	Okay, our speech today
5963000	5965000	Officially ends here
5965000	5967000	So I will stop recording now
