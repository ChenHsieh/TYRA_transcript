I am the host today, Li Yuejia, and I am very happy that everyone is here to participate in today's talk.
Today's speaker is Chen Hongren, who is currently studying a doctorate degree at Amsterdam University.
He said that his original goal was to become a magical baby master, but when he came back, he was already on his way to medical school and medical school.
His main topic is the immune response of giant cells.
The topic ranges from animal modeling, infectious diseases to cancer, as well as substance immune diseases.
So it's actually quite broad.
In addition to animal experiment models and molecular biology, he also does big data analysis, including genes, transmission, protein, metabolism, and metabolism.
So in fact, his field of research is very broad, and I think it's very impressive.
In addition to the lab, he often appears in the kitchen, gym, mountain, or all kinds of water areas.
So I think he said he was A-zai, but I don't think he looks like A-zai.
This is his personal self-introduction.
If there are people in the same field of research or people who are interested in his field of research, they can interact with him after the speech or exchange opinions.
His speech topic today is COVID-19, the early antibody-forming immune compound that causes the excessive immune response of giant cells.
I'll leave the speech to Peng Ren.
Thank you for the introduction.
I don't know if you can see it.
If you have any questions, you can tell me anytime.
Because I'm afraid if you're lost in the middle, you might not be able to listen.
As I said, the topic I'm going to talk about today is COVID-19, the immune response that it causes in our body, and why it can cause more serious symptoms.
Today is March 14th, which is the day of the International Ape Day.
So I think it's quite interesting.
Let me introduce who I am.
I graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in Taiwan.
I am now a PhD student at the Amsterdam Institute of Medicine.
My main fields of research are immunology, molecular biology, transferology, and biophysics.
The main topic of our group is giant cells.
My boss specializes in arteriosclerosis.
My main field of research is the immune response of immune cells.
I also work on the immune system.
If you're interested in these fields or want to work with me,
I usually want to connect with you through LinkedIn or Twitter.
I have a QR code below.
If you're interested in hiking, anime, or want to get to know new friends,
you can find me on Facebook at the bottom right.
Okay, so...
If you look at my resume, you might think,
since my boss specializes in arteriosclerosis,
why would I introduce COVID-19 today?
The story begins with something that happened last year.
In 2019, as you know, COVID-19 broke out.
When COVID-19 broke out,
I don't know why, but there was a barrier in Taiwan.
It was different from other parts of the world.
In Holland, where I live,
the virus spread and the city was closed down.
So you couldn't go to the lab unless you were doing research on COVID-19.
Obviously, my condition at the time was...
I couldn't complete my thesis.
So I discussed with my boss...
Because my topic is different from others in our group.
I rarely do cardiomyopathy.
I don't have an arteriosclerosis project.
I tend to focus on pure immunity.
So I asked my boss if we could do some research on COVID-19.
On the one hand, it's a good opportunity to do research on immunology.
On the other hand, I want to end the pandemic as soon as possible.
So we started our COVID-19 research project.
The main topic of my talk today
is a preprint we published last year.
Basically, it's about...
Antibodies and viruses form immune compounds.
These immune compounds stimulate cells in the body
and cause severe over-immunity response.
This preprint is being reviewed now.
We also published another preprint with other collaborators.
It's based on this preprint.
We first observed some characteristics in clinical trials.
Then we decided to translate it into a cell model.
I'm going to focus on these two preprints today.
If you're interested in COVID-19,
I think it's worth taking a look at.
First, let's talk about COVID-19.
As you know, it's a severe respiratory infection.
In the early days of the outbreak,
people were already studying the symptoms.
What are the symptoms
that led to such a severe infection?
It's 3 p.m. in the afternoon in Tainan.
It's 3.09 p.m.
Sorry for the interruption.
I'm going to publish a preprint.
Okay, sorry.
It's my nature.
So...
Where was I?
Oh, so it's a process of immune response.
As you can see,
in the early days of COVID-19,
the virus hadn't spread yet,
but it was already infected.
Then the virus increased.
But at that time,
there wasn't a lot of response.
Then at stage 2,
there was some immune response,
and it started to spread.
But the spread wasn't that strong at first.
But because of the immune response,
the virus decreased.
That's the orange line in the middle.
Then the strange thing is that
as the virus decreased,
the immune response also increased.
This is actually interesting.
You'd expect that
you have a pathogen today,
and your body needs to spread to fight it.
But in fact,
regardless of the death rate,
the survival rate,
or the immune response,
it all started to show up
when the virus decreased.
A very important time point is this,
when seroconversion occurs.
What is seroconversion?
Take a look.
Let me turn on a laser.
Is there a way to turn on a laser?
Okay.
So you can see here,
this time point is when
the antibodies in your blood
can start to be detected.
Even though you may have
antibodies in the early stages,
at this time point,
the antibodies in your blood
start to change from negative to positive.
This is seroconversion.
At this time point,
your antibodies reach a detectable level.
This is very interesting.
What's interesting is
when antibodies start to be produced,
the immune response starts to increase.
Then the death rate increases.
This is very interesting.
So researchers have been studying
the overall profile of patients
and their overall condition.
One way to do this is
to measure various substances in the blood,
such as inflammation index, and so on.
They found that
at first,
it was more likely to be seroconversion.
Later on,
the number of seroconversions increased,
and then the more annoying immune response started.
During this time,
a lot of cell hormones are produced.
There are several types of cell hormones
that are more noticeable.
It's mentioned here.
TNF,
Tumor Necrosis Factor.
It's a tumor necrosis factor.
There are also
seroconversion 1 and seroconversion 6.
There is also
MCP1,
single-nucleotide degenerative protein.
Yes.
These are the several types of cell hormones.
They are very important
during this time.
It doesn't matter
the cause or the result.
During this time,
the patient will have
a higher number of these cell hormones.
So,
you might ask
which type of cell
these cell hormones are produced from.
Some reviews show
that these cell hormones are
produced by
cells in the human body.
These cell hormones
are called macrophages.
They can produce
a large number of these cell hormones.
As I mentioned earlier,
macrophages 6,
IL-6,
Tumor Necrosis Factor,
TNF,
IL-10,
IL-8,
these cell hormones.
This chart is a bit complicated.
To put it simply,
today,
we have a SARS-CoV-2
virus infection.
Today,
we are infected
with SARS-CoV-2,
the Wuhan pneumonia.
It will stimulate the
macrophages in the body,
which are called
macrophages,
or macrophages called
macrophages,
or macrophages,
or macrophages.
These macrophages
will produce
a large number of
cell hormones.
These cell hormones,
if they are in
a relatively local range,
will cause
local inflammation,
inflammatory response,
which is
local inflammation.
For example,
for example,
we might have pneumonia.
These people
will talk a lot,
these things.
What is more serious
is that these cell hormones
produced locally
through blood
will cause
a more systematic
inflammatory response
after reaching the body.
This systematic inflammatory response
is called
cell hormone storm.
This thing
may cause
multiple organ failure
because it may
cause hemorrhoids,
various
unnecessary
immune responses.
This will
eventually lead to
death.
So,
macrophages
may play a very,
very important role
in this
disease worsening process.
I just talked about
so many macrophages.
What are
macrophages?
Macrophages,
to name a few,
is a cell
that swallows
and eats a lot.
Right.
Its role
is to
eliminate
pathogens
by eating
or eliminating
pathogens
or cleaning the battlefield.
If there is a serious
inflammatory response today,
and a lot of cells
die,
macrophages
will
act
on the battlefield.
So,
it will
eat
these dead cells
and
digest them.
This is
the most direct function
of macrophages.
So,
at first,
we need to
understand it.
What parts of the body
have macrophages?
In fact,
macrophages are
a very wide
group of cells.
Basically,
they appear in
various organs of the human body.
For example,
in the brain,
there is
a cell group
called microglia
called microglia.
This microglia
is also
a type of macrophage.
Of course,
liver,
immune system,
and even
your bone marrow
all have macrophages.
Today,
we will focus on
macrophages in the lungs,
which are
alveolar macrophages,
which are
lung-cancer macrophages.
Yes,
this is
what we will
talk about today.
Macrophages,
as I said just now,
you may think
that
they are
responsible for
cleaning the battlefield
or eating
the pathogen.
But it's not that simple.
Macrophages
actually have many functions.
Just imagine
that
they are
an important member
of the
adenovirus immune system.
That means
they have the ability
to detect
the pathogen
and know
who the pathogen is.
Another thing is
that
you can imagine
that
the cells
in a person's body
are not
our own cells.
The cells in our body
are bacteria.
So you can imagine
that you don't want
the tissues
all over your body
all day long,
especially the skin
and mucous membranes,
to get inflammation all day long.
You want them
to detect
the harmful bacteria
and know
who their neighbors are.
Right.
So
macrophages
play a very important role
in this process.
They can
be agglomerated
or agglomerated
into
a more
proliferative macrophage.
Or they can
be de-proliferated
into a
macrophage
that eliminates
the proliferative reaction.
This process
is called agglomeration.
So you can imagine
that
the macrophages
in our body
that eliminate
the proliferative reaction
can be agglomerated
into a more
aggressive
and proliferative
macrophage
when we
encounter
a truly harmful
macrophage.
When we
de-proliferate
the macrophage,
it can be agglomerated
into
a more
anti-inflammatory
macrophage.
So it can
be
de-proliferated.
So here's the question.
Is it like
a baby bottle?
It can be
a variety of things.
Actually,
it's not.
A macrophage is
more like a baby bottle.
What do I mean?
If you give it
something
that stimulates
the immune response,
for example,
the example on the slide
is LPS,
Polyis,
and Interferon,
which is a
component of
bacteria,
cells,
or a genetic material
similar to
a virus,
or a disruptor,
which is
a hormone
that secretes
when a cell is infected.
It can be
de-proliferated
into
a more
anti-inflammatory
macrophage.
On the contrary,
when
the environment
tells you
that you shouldn't
de-proliferate,
and that
there are
a lot of
de-proliferative
4 and de-proliferative
10,
which is
IL-4,
IL-10,
or
you've taken
lipoprotein,
which suppresses
the immune response,
then these
compounds
will turn
macrophages
into
macrophages.
But we can imagine
that it's impossible
to be so simple
in the human body.
So, in fact,
in the human body,
we
have
all kinds
of
macrophages.
This is
because we know
that we can
separate
macrophages
from each other
in the body
or in the body,
but there must be
some macrophages
that we don't
know about.
This is
what's
interesting
about
macrophages.
To do this,
to do this experiment,
the first thing
we need to do
is to build
a cell model
that can simulate
macrophages
and macrophages
so that
we can
use clinical samples
in molecular biology
and then
find possible
macrophages.
Yes.
So,
at this time,
we have to
figure out
how to define
macrophages
in macrophages
and find out
what kind of
macrophages
they look like.
So,
we did a
meta-analysis.
Um,
meta-analysis is Chinese.
Anyway,
we did a meta-analysis.
So,
um,
the idea is that
we know
that there are
different labs
that use
different
different
cell technologies
or something.
We're going to find out
if there is
a special characteristic
of a cell technology.
No matter how
strange the cell looks,
as long as there is
this characteristic,
it means that
it has been
activated by
a certain cell technology.
So,
if you are
interested in this article,
it was published
in 2019
in Frontier Immunology.
Anyway,
we used
machine learning
to identify
a group of
cells
that looked
like
lung-like
macrophages.
Anyway,
let's take a look at
this one.
We did
four different
studies
and found
four different
samples.
We found that
lung-like
macrophages
are actually
modified
macrophages.
So,
we used this
as our
research model.
We used
IL-10 to
polarize
the macrophages
to simulate
lung-like
macrophages.
Now,
we have a model
that is in the lungs.
So,
we want to know
why
this cell technology
storm
may be
from
macrophages.
Why
did it
start
during the
atherosclerosis?
Why did it
start during
the decline
of the virus
and the immune
response
to trigger
this cell
technology storm?
Let's go back
to this
disease layer.
As I said,
this is a
hemoglobin transfer period.
The virus
is declining
and the
hemoglobin
is rising.
Why
is the
antibody
produced
at this time?
This is
what we
define as
seroconversion.
This is
IgM and
IgG.
These are
the two
of the
five
types of
antibodies.
IgM is
a relatively
large antibody.
It was first
produced
in the
early stage
of the
disease.
Then,
another
antibody
called
IgG
and
IgA
was
produced
after
IgG.
As you can
see,
the statistical
results
are getting
more and more
consistent.
As I said,
IgM is
an antibody
produced
in the
early stage
of the
disease.
We
speculated
that
IgG
is
more
related
to
IgG
than
IgM.
The first
question is
whether
the
IgG
antibody
has a
serious
effect.
Let's
look at
the
clinical
results.
Yes,
we have
studied
many
samples
in the
Netherlands
this year.
The patient
on the
left
is
infected
with
COVID-19
but
the
symptoms
are
mild.
The
patient
on the
right
is
infected
with
COVID-19
but
the

The

on the
right
is

but
the

The
experiment
is to
stimulate
the
antibody
and
virus,
especially
the
protein,
and
other
components,
such as
RNA
virus,
by
adding
RNA
compounds.
Let's
see if
the
multicellular
model
will
trigger
a
reaction.
The
multicellular
model
is
a
immune
model
that
we
developed.
We
first
take
a single
cell
and
divide it
into
the
cells
that
look
like
lung
cells.
We
give it
spike,
and
then
we give
it
polyIC.
PolyIC
is a
structure
that
simulates
the
two
important
components
of
a
virus.
One
is
the
stimulus
of
the
virus,
the
spike
protein,
and
the
RNA.
RNA
is
completely
zero.
If
you
don't
have anything,
it
won't
be
secreted.
If
you
give it
something
like
a
virus,
like
RNA,
it
will
trigger
a reaction.
But
the
most
important
components
are
IL-6,
IL-8,
and
TNF.
These
and
IL-1
are
the
important
components
of
the
virus.
You
can
imagine
that
this
gives
the
antibody
and
the
spike
protein
a
reaction.
This is
an
interesting observation.
If
we give
an
antibody,
the
spike
protein
will
have
a
strong
reaction.
This
is
a
cell
model.
We
want to
know
what
the
spike
protein
does
to
the
virus.
So
today
we
used water
to
wash
out
the
bacteria
from
the
healthy
donor's
lungs.
It
is a
newly
separated
living
cell.
We
used the
same
method
to
stimulate
the
spike
protein
with
or
without
a
polyIC.
You
can
see
that
in
real
lung
cells,
this
antibody
has a
very
strong
immune
response.
This
is
just
a
model.
We
used a
monoclonal
antibody
to
model
the
antibody
produced
by
the
commercial
industry.
It
is a
very
expensive
antibody.

You
can
see
that
the
blood
of
the
patients
in the
intensive

can
trigger
a
very
strong
immune
