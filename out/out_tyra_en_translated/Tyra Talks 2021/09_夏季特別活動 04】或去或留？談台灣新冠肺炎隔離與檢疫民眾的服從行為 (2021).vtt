WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The recording has started.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
We even discussed where to go to buy alcohol, masks, etc.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Many of my European friends and classmates laughed at these behaviors.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
But to a certain extent, it also shows that Asians, or more specifically,

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Taiwanese have a very different response mode to the epidemic than Westerners.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
So at Project TIRA's summer event this year,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
we specially planned a speech on the COVID-19 epidemic.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
We are honored to have Professor Li Xiongwen as our guest speaker.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
In 2016, Professor Li graduated from Beka University's School of Mathematics.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
He is currently working as an assistant researcher at the Institute of Sociology.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Professor Li's interest spans many different fields.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
He is interested in social network analysis,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
social conflicts and cooperation in evolution,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
and social science quantification.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
We can see that Professor Li has a wide range of interests.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
We look forward to Professor Li's approach to the COVID-19 issue.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Now I will hand over to Professor Li for his speech.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Thank you, Professor Li.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Thank you for the introduction.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
I am very happy to be able to share my research on the TIRA platform.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Let me find my screen.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I don't know if you can see the video.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Can you see it, Professor Li?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Yes, I can see it.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay, let's get started.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
First of all, I would like to thank Professor Li again for his invitation.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
When Professor Li invited me,

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
he specifically mentioned that he wanted to find the topic of COVID-19 and invited me to give a speech.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Actually, I feel very ashamed.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Although I have done the topic of COVID-19,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I have also collected information related to COVID-19.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I will talk about another topic later.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Today I will talk about the first topic.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I will talk about the second topic later.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
However, I am not a disease infectious scientist.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
Although Professor Li mentioned that I work in other fields,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
this field is not the field I am familiar with.

02:49.000 --> 03:01.000
What we do is more like psychology, public policy, or public health related issues related to disease infection.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
This is not the topic I am familiar with.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I am an expert in methodology.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
However, this is the first time I have collected data.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
This is the first time I have collected data for research since I was a child.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
This is data from all over Taiwan.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Of course, the method used is the statistical method.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
This is not the method I am familiar with.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
This is not the field I am familiar with.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
However, since I have collected data, I must have something to say.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
I will try my best to present the data I have collected for research.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
This is the data from my research team from March to May last year.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
If you still have an impression,

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
At the end of January and February last year, the epidemic of COVID-19 began to break out in Taiwan.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
In addition to China, epidemics began to occur around the world in February and March.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
The most tense time in Taiwan was from March to May last year.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
At that time, we rushed out to collect data.

04:16.000 --> 04:27.000
Our supervisor told us that we should not be locked in our own room and do our own thing.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Because the students of natural science are already very busy.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
We also need to go out and collect more data related to COVID-19.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Since the supervisor said, we want to do what our team can do.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
We want to do what we can do in this epidemic.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I will introduce what data we rushed out to collect later.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
This is the data we collected between March and May last year.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
We found some research topics to do.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
This is one of them.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What are we studying?

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
What we are studying is that when the epidemic began, the government of Taiwan will have some corresponding policies.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
One of the very special policies is to ask some people who are at risk to stay at home for 14 days for quarantine.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
He may not stay at home, but he may be quarantined in a medical institution or a quarantine center or at home for 14 days.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
We want to know if he will have the idea of disobedience or resistance during these 14 days.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
The idea of wanting to leave quarantine.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
What are some of the reasons why these people want to leave quarantine?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
This is noncompliance.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
This is the focus of the research we want to focus on.

05:40.000 --> 05:55.000
Because we want to say that if we know the reason why he wants to leave the quarantine, we can know which supporting measures the government can provide to make these people more willing to stay in quarantine to help us control the entire epidemic.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
This research is done by me and my two assistants.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The first two authors are our two research assistants.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Let's start sharing.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
Let's take a look at the latest COVID-19 numbers.

06:13.000 --> 06:28.000
From January last year to August 6 this year, we went to the relevant website of WHO and saw that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world has exceeded 200 million, and the death toll has exceeded more than 4 million.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
The number of confirmed cases in Taiwan is 15,000 until August 6 this year, and the death toll is 809.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
Taiwan's situation is of course different from other countries around the world.

06:42.000 --> 06:50.000
Between March and May of 2020, the government just mentioned that it was a tense moment.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
At that time, the global epidemic began to fever.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
Many young people working and studying abroad returned to Taiwan.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
At that time, the atmosphere in Taiwan was actually more tense.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
At that time, if everyone came back from abroad, would there be a virus?

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
Because everyone did not do the test, they may come back and there may be some infected people who will explode.

07:14.000 --> 07:23.000
At that time, if you still remember in Taiwan, we were worried about a lot of holidays, such as the annual holiday, and then all kinds of holidays.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
I was worried that there would be a large-scale outbreak.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It was at this time last year.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
After May, the performance of Taiwan's government began to be very good, and the epidemic was controlled and did not explode.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
There have been no local epidemics for 253 consecutive days.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Next, let's look at this graph.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
This is a graph of the cumulative confirmed cases and the cumulative death toll in Taiwan.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
From January and February of last year to July of this year, the green line is the cumulative confirmed cases.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
The cumulative death toll only goes up.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
So we see a very small spike.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
It was between March and April of last year, and there were still cumulative confirmed cases.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
It has been flat since mid-April.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Local confirmed cases began in December of last year.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Taiwan has no local confirmed cases for 253 consecutive days.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
There were no local confirmed cases from April of last year to December of last year.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Later, there were local confirmed cases from December of last year to May of this year.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
Everyone knows that this is a new wave of epidemic in Taiwan.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
However, the outbreak of the new wave of epidemic has also been gradually reduced.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
It has now dropped from level 3 to level 2.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
In fact, the peak of the outbreak is at the end of May and the beginning of June.

08:44.000 --> 08:53.000
Later, we will also have a new collection of data to share with you.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Let's take a look at the situation in Taiwan.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Taiwan is a very special example that I just shared with you.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Taiwan was very well controlled in the early days.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
We are a model god in these countries.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
I also saw a lot of articles analyzing the reasons why Taiwan was able to succeed in the early days.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
First of all, we have a central government agency that reacts quickly.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
This is the Central Epidemic Control Center, CECC.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Of course, we hold press conferences every day to announce timely information.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Then do a lot of effective group distribution, such as mask maps and other materials.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
In fact, there is a very fast and transparent information management.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
The second is that we have good border control.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
No matter who he is, he must be quarantined or quarantined for 14 days before entering Taiwan's borders.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
After coming out, you have to track his temperature and see if there is a problem.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
If there is no problem, you can go out and exercise freely, and you have to be self-isolated for 7 days.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
In fact, this border control is very important.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Another one is to add his later isolation and quarantine.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Quarantine is if you have been infected, you will be quarantined.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Quarantine conditions are more strict.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
If you have the risk of infection, such as your host and the infected person may have met in the same place.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Then you may have to be quarantined.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
Quarantine is a lower standard, but it also has to be quarantined for 14 days.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Quarantine is quarantine, and quarantine is isolation.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
We also do contact tracing, which is tracking control.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
In fact, in many places, we will know how the host of the infected person is going.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
You will see the GPS location of his mobile phone, which is to announce his host.

10:44.000 --> 10:58.000
Now we all know that if we go to a public place in Taiwan, we have to send a heavy text message to the central control center to report that we have entered and left that place.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
This is a very common example of contact tracing.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Other related measures include social distancing or wearing a mask.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
These are all key elements of Taiwan's success.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
In this study, we want to focus on two key points.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
The first is that we want to look at quarantine and quarantine.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
What role did quarantine and quarantine play in the process of controlling the epidemic in Taiwan?

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
What policy measures are effective?

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
The second is whether the person who is quarantined or quarantined has the idea of ​​leaving the quarantine area.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
What factors make him want to leave this place?

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
Quarantine is that he has contact with the infected person.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Quarantine is that he may have some contact.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
Another quarantine is that if he comes back from abroad, he must quarantine automatically.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
As mentioned earlier, Taiwan has done very well in many areas.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
The early part has done very well.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
One of the things we want to pay attention to is Taiwan's quarantine and quarantine measures.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
This measure is actually for those who are at risk.

12:19.000 --> 12:29.000
We want them to stay at home or stay in their designated quarantine place, such as a quarantine hotel, a quarantine hospital, or some quarantine places.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Let him stay there for 14 days.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
Of course, these people will have good supplies for 14 days.

12:37.000 --> 12:45.000
The government will know that he is there, and there will be ways to know his location and provide him with sufficient supplies.

12:45.000 --> 13:00.000
From last year, February and March, until now, until July, about 700,000 people have experienced quarantine or quarantine.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
Of these, 2,000 cases violated these regulations.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
If these regulations are violated, they may be fined up to NT$1 million.

13:10.000 --> 13:20.000
So in fact, in most cases, we see that most Taiwanese people cooperate with this policy.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
Of the 700,000 cases, only 2,000 were violated.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
But there are still violations. We want to know the reasons for the violations.

13:28.000 --> 13:38.000
Of course, we may not be able to find these violations, but we want to know why the people who have experienced these measures want to leave the quarantine place.

13:38.000 --> 13:52.000
We want to know what role the government plays in this, whether the information it provides is transparent, and whether the supplies it provides to the people in the quarantine place are sufficient.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Will these affect the idea of ​​wanting to stay in the quarantine place or leave the quarantine place?

13:57.000 --> 14:05.000
Next, in fact, all over the world, we face different measures from the government to do different things.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
In fact, people in each place will have different levels of obedience and even resistance.

14:12.000 --> 14:20.000
In fact, there are also a lot of large-scale protests abroad that may not obey some of the government's actions.

14:20.000 --> 14:30.000
For example, many countries are protesting that the government should not require the people to wear a mask at any time, or wear a mask when entering the factory.

14:30.000 --> 14:42.000
Or there are even people who think that the government's COVID policy is actually a conspiracy theory, and that the government is trying to suppress the people or restrict the freedom of the people.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
So in fact, when the government is doing a lot of relevant measures, it is likely to receive some resistance or rebellion from the people.

14:49.000 --> 14:58.000
We want to know what is the greatest dissatisfaction or greatest pressure on people with the quarantine or quarantine measures alone.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
If we want to make these measures more effective, we should pay attention to which aspects.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.000
Of course, this is not the first time that we have done research on isolation or quarantine-related disobedience.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
In the past, scholars also did research on different situations.

15:20.000 --> 15:28.000
For example, some different diseases will actually restrict the freedom of residence or action of these infected or at-risk people.

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
There are different levels. First of all, it is the level of the government. People are concerned about whether the information given by the government is open and transparent.

15:35.000 --> 15:49.000
Since the government restricts me from moving today, the government should let me know whether the government's policy is correct or whether I have the necessity to stay here and whether I have received sufficient information.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
Next is the level of the individual. What factors will affect the individual whether he wants to leave the quarantine zone?

15:57.000 --> 16:09.000
In the past, scholars also found that he had financial difficulties. For example, if he can't go out to make money, he may feel difficult to go out after being locked up for 14 days.

16:09.000 --> 16:20.000
Or he thinks he has no social responsibility. After being locked up, he has no benefits. He is only limited to freedom of action, but it is of no help to society.

16:20.000 --> 16:30.000
He may have experienced strong negative emotions, which makes him unable to stay. He feels very bored and uneasy. He must go out and leave this place.

16:31.000 --> 16:45.000
Or he lacks a lot of opportunities to get in touch with others. He has no interpersonal interaction. Because he may not be able to get in touch with others in the quarantine zone, he can only force others to give him food. He lacks interpersonal interaction and wants to leave.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
These are the rules that have been found to make people want to stay in a place.

16:53.000 --> 17:06.000
During the period of isolation, it will cause some negative emotions to these people. These negative emotions may also lead to him wanting to leave the quarantine zone.

17:07.000 --> 17:16.000
Of course, there are many sources of negative emotions. Some of the sources we see in the document are related to leaving the quarantine zone.

17:16.000 --> 17:30.000
He may lack some sunshine. Because he is locked up in a place, he may not be able to get sunlight in that place, which may have an impact on his mental health.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
The next one is the financial difficulties that I just mentioned, which may also have an impact on his negative emotions.

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
Or he may be illiterate. There may be a lot of sources of illiteracy. It may be relatives or very good friends who take care of him.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
He may think that he is causing trouble to his relatives and friends.

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
Or he may have a bad relationship with his neighbors. For example, if you are quarantined at home and others know that you have come back from abroad to work or study, you may have a different view of your family.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This may cause his own pressure.

17:59.000 --> 18:08.000
Or a stranger may be illiterate to a group of people. For example, why do these people who work abroad and study abroad have to return to Taiwan within a few days?

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Or why do these people who work abroad and study abroad have to return to Taiwan within a few days?

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
It may be the illiteracy of strangers that causes his negative emotions.

18:18.000 --> 18:28.000
Or some self-evaluation of oneself. I may cause trouble to others. I shouldn't do this. This will also increase negative emotions.

18:28.000 --> 18:37.000
Or some information given by the government is incomplete or inconsistent. This may also have an impact on negative emotions.

18:37.000 --> 18:46.000
We will see if this negative emotion is an intermediary variable, that is, whether a person wants to leave the quarantine area.

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
Because it is related to other variables, the negative emotion itself is a big variable.

18:52.000 --> 19:01.000
We want to analyze a set of systems to see if the negative emotion project is an intermediary variable for a person who wants to leave the quarantine area.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
Of course, the intermediary variable is the statistics. You have to see that a lot of things are X that affect Y.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
The negative emotion is an intermediary variable, let's call it M.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
A lot of things are directly affected from X to Y, and then X will affect M to Y.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
We want to see how much M, the intermediary variable of this negative emotion, accounts for.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
Next, let's talk about how we collect information.

19:29.000 --> 19:48.000
In March and May of last year, when the epidemic in Taiwan was relatively tense, when students and young people from overseas returned to Taiwan, we began to set up a website called epidemic prevention diary.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
We collect several types of information from everyone.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
The first one is that they want to tell us who they are in contact with every day.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
This information lasts for more than a month, from March to May.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
They want to tell us who they are in contact with every day.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Next, he will let us know how he feels every day.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
We recruit people on the Internet. There are two types of people.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Here is the timetable.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
There are two types.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
The first one is quarantine or quarantine.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
How do we know if he is in quarantine or quarantine?

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
The government will give him a home quarantine or home quarantine notice.

20:34.000 --> 20:41.000
If you are a person who has been diagnosed or you are a person who has returned from abroad, the government will give you a home quarantine notice.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Participants have to take this notice and send it to us.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Then our people will check it manually and see if there is no problem.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
It is not fake.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
We will let him come in and join our quarantine group.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
The quarantine group is the first day he is in quarantine or quarantine.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
He is in quarantine or quarantine.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
We will let him participate in our research as a quarantiner.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
The other group is the people who have not experienced quarantine or quarantine.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
When he participates, he does not have the identity of quarantine or quarantine.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
He can also sign up for our survey.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
The survey is very similar.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
At the beginning, when he joined our research, he had a pre-survey.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
He said that he was at this time, March 30 or April 2, his current state.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
The person in quarantine is currently in quarantine.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
This is where he is different.

21:33.000 --> 21:40.000
The next 30 days, he will let us know who he contacted and who he contacted every day.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
Then there are some moods in his daily life or how much time he spends doing what.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
How is the time allocation of daily life?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
You will see some related questions later.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
We will give him a follow-up when the investigation is over.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
When the quarantine is over, we will give him a questionnaire.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
This is the questionnaire after the quarantine.

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
If he participated in this research on the 7th, he will fill out a questionnaire on the 14th.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
This is a screenshot of our website.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
This part is what I just said.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
We want these participants to record who they interact with every day.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
He has to establish the interaction between me and Zhang Yanping.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Our interaction is on the Internet.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I have to write down who initiated it and how long it took.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Did I get it?

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
How do I feel?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Did we get specific emotions?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Get information, etc.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
We call this contact.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
You can think of it as an interaction.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
The daily interaction should be recorded on this platform.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
The other part is the part of life that I just talked about.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Is there a cool body temperature?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Did you let the sun bask into the house?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Do you feel lonely?

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
How long does it take to work, study, have fun, socialize, etc.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Some daily life-related questions.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
Of course, we also give some subsidies or rewards.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
They can participate in this study.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
If it meets our standards, we will send him a gift certificate.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Let them draw.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
They are willing to participate in this activity.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
It is worth noting that we are recruited on the Internet.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
We are recruited on Facebook, LINE, and some websites.

23:30.000 --> 23:41.000
We can see that the people we recruit are relatively young.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
You can see that the group on the left who has not experienced isolation is on average 33 years old.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
The group that is undergoing isolation is on average 28.3 years old.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
It is a relatively young group.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
But this is also the result we expect.

24:00.000 --> 24:06.000
In fact, this group of people, especially those who are isolated, are mostly from abroad.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Like studying abroad or working abroad.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
This group of people is relatively young.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
We also expect this situation.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
And young people use the Internet more.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
So the people we recruit on the Internet are mostly young people.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
This group of people are mostly women.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
The women accounted for about 70%.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
The men accounted for more than 20%.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Since they are young, most of them are unmarried.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
And the group of people who are undergoing isolation.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Because they are younger and more unmarried.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Most of them live in big cities.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
There are a total of 158 people who have not been isolated.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
There are about 140 people who are undergoing isolation.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
The information we are sharing now is the group of people who are undergoing isolation.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.000
That is to say, the first day of his study, he is in isolation.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
He may be isolated after 7 days or 5 days.

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
Then he has to do the remaining 25 days or the remaining 21 days of this questionnaire.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
He will do another questionnaire after the end.

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
What we are discussing is the group of people who are undergoing isolation on the first day.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
This is a total of 140 people.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
What are some of the changes that we care about?

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
Is it related to his idea of ​​leaving the isolation area?

25:24.000 --> 25:32.000
First of all, he thinks that his own isolation or isolation restrictions are helpful to society.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Does he think his social responsibility is high?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Does he think he is helpful?

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Next is whether the government's relevant information is sufficient.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
This is what we measure every day.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Repeat means measuring every day.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
We will measure the number of contacts or interactions with him every day.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Of course, our interaction does not necessarily refer to face-to-face interaction.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
It may be network interaction, it may be voice, it may be text.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
He can record it all.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
We record whether he blames himself.

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
We also investigate their quality of life.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
Here we use the WHO's quality of life, which is a simplified version of the 26-point version.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
It is divided into four aspects in total.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
We put it all into physiology, psychology, society and the environment.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Next, we measure his negative emotions.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Ask if you are in a good mood today.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Did you feel negative emotions?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
How strong?

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Next, did you let the sun shine into your home?

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
Or ask him how many people are quarantined every day.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
How many people want to leave the quarantine area every day?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
We will see how to ask this question later.

26:42.000 --> 26:50.000
It depends on the negative evaluation of oneself, the degree of anonymity, and the degree of financial difficulties he has experienced.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
Next is some preliminary analysis.

26:55.000 --> 27:09.000
We can see that among the 140 people who are quarantined, their quality of life is compared to the long-term model.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
The long-term model is that we use the same questionnaire to measure other people in Taiwan.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
This is called the long-term model.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
Is there any difference between these people and those who are quarantined or quarantined when we found this group?

27:23.000 --> 27:30.000
This group of people who are being quarantined or quarantined may be in a bad situation on the first day.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Maybe just got off the plane or just came back from abroad, everything is in a hurry.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
His physiological quality is relatively low.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
We see that he is prominent.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
His P is very small, less than 10 to the negative 4.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
He is negative.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
He is lower than the long-term model.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
The psychological aspect is also lower than the long-term model.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
This is also prominent.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
In terms of the quality of life in the environment, this is not prominent.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
They are prominent in social relations.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Because his P is also less than 10 to the negative 4.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
He is higher than the long-term model.

28:05.000 --> 28:14.000
So this group of people, on the first day of the study, their physiology and psychology are worse than the long-term model.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
But they have better social relations.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
We have asked three questions.

28:23.000 --> 28:31.000
The first day of the study, the end of the quarantine, and the end of the study.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
The end of the study is the 31st day.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
We want to see his changes.

28:34.000 --> 28:41.000
What we are looking at now is the first day of the study and the day of the end of the study.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Which of his various changes is significantly different?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
This group of people is the isolation group.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
They believe that their isolation is helpful to society.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
They are significantly reduced in social responsibility.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
What we put here is significant.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
He is significantly reduced.

29:00.000 --> 29:07.000
This group of people believes that their isolation is not helpful to society.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
The second group of people is significant.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
They believe that the transparency of government information has increased.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
This is significant.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
They believe that the transparency of government information is high.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
This group of people is significantly reduced from the beginning to the end.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
The third group of people is significant.

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
The number of people in contact every day from the beginning to the end is relatively low.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Sorry.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
It was relatively low at the beginning, but it was higher at the end.

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
At the beginning of the study, the number of people in contact with him was less.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
At the end, after the 30th day, he was free to socialize outside.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
So the number of people in contact at that time was significantly higher.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Let's look at some of the issues we are concerned about.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
First of all, what variables will affect the behavior of these people who do not obey?

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Next is the negative emotion.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
Does it play a role as an intermediary variable?

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Will it also affect the behavior of those who do not obey?

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
First of all, let's look at what our self-variable and one-variable are.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
The dependent variable we want to look at is how much he wants to leave the isolation.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
These people are asked every day.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
He is asked every day during the isolation period that if you want to leave the isolation today.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
If there is, how strong is the degree?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
We ask every day.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
So we have a total of 734 pieces of information.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Because not everyone has 14 days in our research.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
He may be the 8th day to join the study.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
He only has 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 days of information.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
We ask every day of isolation.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
If it is the first day to join, there will be 14 days of information.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
So we have a total of 734 pieces of information.

31:01.000 --> 31:08.000
Of these 734 pieces of information, there are 278 pieces that say they don't want to leave the isolation at all.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
278 is a little bit.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
77 is normal.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Next is very strong.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Next is very strong.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Next is very strong.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Very strong is 18.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
So we do different things for this.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
We know that he is not very strong.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
There is no majority at all.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
There is no majority at all.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
There is no majority at all.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
Then we will analyze which reasons make him want to leave the isolation.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
Then we use the Multi-Level Ordinal Logistic Regression Model.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
In fact, it is Multi-Level.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Multi-Level is that our first layer is every day.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
The second layer is everyone.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
This is Multi-Level.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
The variance of his normal model is 8.5.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Then we use the Random Intercept Model.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
Ordinal is because his Y is a sequence.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
It is from very small to very small.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
We use this return model.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Ok, let's see which variables are for this.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Want to leave the isolation.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
First of all, we see that the conclusion is that there is no male.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
His attitude, his coefficient is negative.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Then he shows that we only put it today.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
He is showing that he does not want to leave the isolation.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
In this study, the male is more obedient.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
That is, his idea of ​​leaving the isolation is smaller than that of women.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Next is Negative Emotion.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
This is also a high value.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
The higher the negative emotion he experiences, the more he wants to leave the isolation.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
Next is how many days he is in isolation.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
This is N-State, which is how many days.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
The higher the number of days, the closer he leaves.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
The closer he wants to leave, the more he wants to leave.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
The 13th and 14th days are the most wanted to leave.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
The more time he is in isolation, the more he wants to leave.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
This is positive.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
The higher the level of dehumanization he experiences, the more he wants to leave.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
This dehumanization is positive.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Next is social responsibility decline.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
He thinks that his isolation is more and more unhelpful to society.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
The more he wants to leave.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Daily contact is negative.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
The more the daily contact declines, the more he wants to leave the isolation.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
This is where we put all the variables at the beginning of the model.

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
We got some information from the Multi-Level Ordinological Regression.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Next is Mediation Analysis.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
We look at negative emotions.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
How many variables will it absorb?

33:45.000 --> 33:53.000
We put all these variables into the model to see how much negative emotions can be absorbed.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
Of course, we use the Perl model.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
We can see that it will divide the variables into several effects.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Direct Effect and Indirect Effect.

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
Which will pass directly from X to Y, not through the intermediate variable M.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
The intermediate variable here is negative emotion M.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.000
Indirect will pass through negative emotion from X to Y.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
We did some analysis.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Here are some conclusions.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Let me give you an example.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Dehumanization.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Dehumanization can be divided into three groups.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Weak, medium and strong.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Let's look at one of them.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Strong.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Total effect is positive.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Positive 4.71.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
The stronger the dehumanized emotion, the more it wants to leave the quarantine.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
The intermediate variable is direct.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
Direct is 83.9%.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
From X to Y.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
From strong dehumanization to Y wanting to leave the quarantine.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
The direct effect is 83%.

35:01.000 --> 35:09.000
The indirect effect is that these strong dehumanized emotions to negative emotions are about 13%.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
So we can look at the path in this way.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
How many variables will pass through the intermediate variable negative emotion?

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
Which will directly affect from X to Y?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
We have discussed the following.

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
Let's summarize the discovery of this topic.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
What factors will affect these people?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Want to leave the quarantine?

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Like dehumanization or people you meet every day.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
The fewer people you meet, the more you want to leave the quarantine.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
The more people like this, the more you want to leave the quarantine.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
As the number of quarantine days increases, the more you want to leave the quarantine.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Maybe it's because you can't stand it anymore.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I've been quarantined for too long.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
The more you want to leave, the more you want to leave.

35:53.000 --> 35:59.000
He feels that his own isolation has no effect on the community.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
The more he wants to leave, the more negative emotions he experiences, the more he wants to leave.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
What are the factors that cause negative emotions?

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
Self-accusation or negative evaluation

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
Dehumanization of the outside world

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
We found that the dehumanization from strangers is the most serious.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Or he experienced some financial difficulties.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It will cause more negative emotions.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
Negative emotions indirectly affect this.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
The idea of wanting to leave the quarantine

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
We also have some extended conclusions.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
Some aspects that the government can consider

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
First of all, the government should pay more attention to these people.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
He was quarantined or disinfected.

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
How is his psychological state?

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
We care about whether he is short of supplies.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
Is there anyone who cares enough about him?

37:02.000 --> 37:08.000
We want to let him know that his psychological state is something that the government should know and care about.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
Public health personnel should know every day whether he has experienced a lot of pressure.

37:12.000 --> 37:22.000
Try to eliminate the possibility of dehumanization in society.

37:22.000 --> 37:31.000
Dehumanization from relatives, friends, and strangers

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
This is very serious for them.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
They may want to leave the quarantine.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Therefore, there will be a lot of negative emotions.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
Next, we should strengthen the social responsibility of these people.

37:43.000 --> 37:52.000
He can protect more people from the harm of the disease.

37:52.000 --> 38:02.000
The stronger the social responsibility, the easier it is for these people to stay in quarantine or quarantine.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
The more he doesn't want to leave, the stronger the sense of social responsibility.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.000
What are the restrictions on this study?

38:11.000 --> 38:15.000
The first restriction is the way we recruit.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
These people are recruited by social media, such as Facebook and LINE.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
In fact, their information is relatively sufficient.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
He is a relatively online user.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
He is a young group.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
They are also a very equal group.

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
They are young and about 90% of them came back from abroad.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
They are a very equal group.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
Most of the people they participate in are women.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
This is a very special part of our sample.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
The main topic we want to introduce just finished.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
I want to spend a little time to introduce the other information we received.

39:05.000 --> 39:12.000
This is an article I wrote on my website.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It's more like a science journal article.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
He said that the social impact of COVID-19 is cross-national analysis and comparison.

39:18.000 --> 39:27.000
This is a global cross-national survey we did from September 2020 to the end of May this year.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.000
It is different from the Taiwan survey from March to May.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
The Taiwan survey from March to May is a one-month research.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
He is looking for two groups of people, people who are isolated and people who are not isolated.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
We asked him to write a one-month journal separately.

39:41.000 --> 39:48.000
This cross-national study is a global survey.

39:48.000 --> 39:55.000
There are 12 languages ​​in this survey.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
We want participants to be able to do three surveys.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
One survey will take 90 days.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
In other words, if a person wrote in September last year, he received an email in December last year.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
In April this year, he received an email and filled out three surveys.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
The questions we ask are very similar.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
We also ask about contact, mood, and whether or not we have contacted the patient.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
We also ask about their quality of life and their political attitude.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
If you are interested, you can look at the science journal article on my website.

40:29.000 --> 40:37.000
The organizer invited me to talk about some issues related to COVID-19.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
I will share the latest research here.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
However, we have not sorted it out yet, so we can only talk about it.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
We were very lucky during the collection period.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
From September last year to the end of May this year,

40:53.000 --> 41:00.000
In fact, in Taiwan, there is a very good research topic.

41:00.000 --> 41:07.000
From September last year to May this year, Taiwan did not have any local cases from September last year to December.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Local cases began in December.

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
However, in mid-May this year, the local epidemic began to break out.

41:17.000 --> 41:24.000
As you can see in this picture, after Mother's Day in May, the national level 2 alert was issued.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
On May 15, the level 3 alert was issued.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
On May 19, the national level 3 alert was issued.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
The peak was probably at the end of May.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
That is, at the beginning of June at the end of May.

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
Our data in Taiwan is actually very satisfactory to the government.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
There was no epidemic until the end of May.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
At the end of May, everyone was actually very nervous.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
We felt that the epidemic was about to break out, and we did not know how dangerous it was.

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
We only knew that there were hundreds of people every day, and the number of deaths was constantly increasing.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
We have a question that can be shared today.

42:03.000 --> 42:09.000
If you can get the vaccine, will you get the vaccine?

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
There are more than 1,700 people in Taiwan who answer this question.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
There are three options for more than 1,700 people to answer.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
The first is that I will not get the vaccine.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
The second is that I may or may not.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
The third is that I will definitely get the vaccine.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
In fact, we asked this question from March to May.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
We can see a very obvious change.

42:30.000 --> 42:36.000
That is, before mid-May, before the level 3 alert began, everyone did not want to get the vaccine.

42:36.000 --> 42:44.000
Even though the Delta virus was already very serious at that time, it was already very serious in India and other countries.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
But in Taiwan, you can't see the will of people who want to get the vaccine.

42:48.000 --> 42:58.000
In addition, this model also shows that Taiwan does not particularly want to get the vaccine, at least in Shuangbei.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
We know that this virus spread from Shuangbei.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
But people in Shuangbei don't want to get the vaccine.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
What does it tell us?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
It tells us that you are in the same island.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
You are in Taidong and Taipei.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
In fact, the will of people who want to get the vaccine is the same.

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
What factors will affect the will of people who want to get the vaccine?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We can take a look here.

43:22.000 --> 43:32.000
For example, if you often go to crowded places, or if you are sick, you will let the public health personnel know your situation.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
This means that people with a high awareness of public health will want to get the vaccine.

43:36.000 --> 43:43.000
It is believed that the government can use information technology to track people's whereabouts.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
The stronger the government's control, the more people will want to get the vaccine.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
It is believed that the government can use information technology to track people's whereabouts.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
People who use information technology to track people's whereabouts because of the epidemic will not want to get the vaccine.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
This may be more against the government.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
The more people you think the government gives you enough support, the more you want to get the vaccine.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
The more you believe the government will want to get the vaccine.

44:09.000 --> 44:18.000
The more you worry that fake news related to vaccines will cause harm, the more you want to get the vaccine.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
O is openness, which is the openness of the personality test in psychology.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
The more open your personality is, the more you want to get the vaccine.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
This is also related to quality of life.

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
The higher your physical health, the more you want to get the vaccine.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
This is also related to quality of life.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
The higher your physical health, the more you want to get the vaccine.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Social relationships are negative.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
We observe that this is a repressive phenomenon.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
It is not so related to Y.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
So it may be a model performance.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
The more you worry about the physiological effect of the vaccine, the less you want to get the vaccine.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
The more you think the vaccine is troublesome, the less you want to get the vaccine.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
These are what we think are more reasonable.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
Another study related to literature is that men want to get the vaccine more.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
This may be a study we did in March and May.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
At that time, Taiwan had a lot of information.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Because most of the vaccine discussion at that time was AZ.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
AZ may have more side effects on young women.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Our source is young people.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
So I found that men want to get the vaccine more.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
This may be one of the possible reasons.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
People over the age of 30 will want to get the vaccine more.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
This is also reasonable.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
The more you want to get the vaccine, the more you want to get the vaccine.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
This is what we found.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
What factors make people want to get the vaccine?

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
This is the result we found in the past 1-2 weeks.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
Because we have been collecting and organizing data until now.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Start doing some analysis.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
This is a small conclusion I want to share with you.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
A small result.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
It has nothing to do with the topic of today's speech.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
This is another COVID-19-related survey we did.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
I will share it here for the time being.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Thank you all.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
See if you have any further questions.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
We can all discuss here.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Thank you.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
Thank you for the wonderful speech.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Now we are in Q&A time.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
I saw a question on the chat room.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
William, can you turn on your microphone and ask a question?

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
If you are still here.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
Okay, he may not be here for the time being.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Let me repeat his question.

46:54.000 --> 47:04.000
William asked how to avoid survivorship virus in this way.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
People who can resist the distance may avoid traveling at the beginning.

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
This may be a participant's question.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Can you repeat the second question?

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
What kind of people will avoid traveling?

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
He may be the first question.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
He is just talking about whether this participant is possible.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
Some people are more resistant to isolation.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
It is easier for him to avoid traveling.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Thank you for your question.

47:44.000 --> 47:52.000
Of course, we have a lot of limitations in this study.

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
He mentioned the survival bias.

47:58.000 --> 48:04.000
Of course, I don't think we have a lot of evidence.

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
I don't think we can avoid it.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
It depends on whether you can avoid it or not.

48:15.000 --> 48:23.000
We recruited this group of people because they are interested in this.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
He is willing to participate.

48:25.000 --> 48:30.000
These people have also experienced traveling.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
Because we are looking for Taiwanese people.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
He must be Taiwanese.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
He can't be a foreigner.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
Some people are afraid of COVID-19.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
If isolation or quarantine affects him, he will not return to Taiwan.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
This group of people were not in the range of our survivors at the beginning.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
He must return to Taiwan to participate in this survey.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
If he returns to Taiwan, he will be quarantined or quarantined before he can participate in the survey.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
So we don't have this information.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
If he wants to avoid traveling, what will he do?

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
If he wants to avoid traveling, he will not enter our survey subjects.

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
Of course, he will not face 14 days of isolation or quarantine.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Because they wanted to avoid traveling at the beginning.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
He will not experience 14 days of isolation or quarantine.

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
So this is a bit out of our scope.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
We can't handle it, we can't know.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
We can only know which factors will affect him.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Because he was quarantined and quarantined, he wanted to leave.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
So those who want to avoid this matter are not in our research range.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
Yes, I also think this question is actually quite difficult to answer.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
I don't know if William's answer just now

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
is in line with the information William wants to get.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
If you want to continue to explain, you can look at the microphone

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
and ask these questions in depth.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.000
I don't know if there are any other audience members who want to ask questions.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Hello, I'm Yiting.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
I'm doing a post-doctoral research at the University of Taiwan.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
We are also doing research related to COVID-19.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
Our source of data is a safe zone in Taiwan.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
We also saw some people who were quarantined

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
and called this safe zone for psychological support.

50:43.000 --> 50:49.000
But because our sample wanted to get a group of people who were at higher risk of suicide.

50:49.000 --> 50:54.000
Later, we did not include too many people in the group of people at higher risk of suicide.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
But this group of people often mentioned financial stress.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
I just saw that in your presentation, you also mentioned that

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
one of the factors that will lead to negative emotions is financial difficulties.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I would like to ask about the details.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
In this project, usually in quarantine,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
because it sounds like they are a group of younger people who came back from abroad.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
They may be students or workers.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
What kind of financial difficulties are they facing?

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Or how do you ask this question?

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
This is my question. Thank you.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Thank you for Yiting's question.

51:31.000 --> 51:36.000
Our question is, do you feel any pressure on finance?

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
Will finance give you any pressure?

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
From very little to very much.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
We usually ask for a five-point chart.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
Of course, we did not go into the details of what financial pressure is.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
We think that since financial pressure will affect negative emotions,

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
it may be that he is working overseas,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
he may leave his job,

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
or he knows that he is coming to Taiwan,

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
it will be difficult for him to continue his original job.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
This kind of pressure affects his negative emotions and makes him want to leave.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Because we found that negative emotions are a big influence,

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
it makes him want to leave the idea of quarantine.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.000
This anxiety and uneasiness can directly contribute to this negative emotion,

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
and it will affect him to want to leave the idea of quarantine.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
We did not ask,

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
but the situation you can imagine should be that it will affect his work.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Because it should be okay to stay as a student.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
Of course, we did not cross-compare.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Because of the restrictions on information,

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
we are not sure if he is a student or not.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
He is still a working person.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
We do not know.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
But we know that the people who came back at that time were these two kinds of people.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Working overseas or studying abroad.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
We found that this is one of the factors.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
It may be similar to your research.

53:00.000 --> 53:07.000
We are sure that these people are in quarantine or quarantine when researching and investigating.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
Because some of our samples are completely in line with what I just described.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
He is working abroad.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Because we are the information that comes to the store,

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
so it is a more straightforward organization analysis.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
There are more specific mentions in it.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
For example, his original job development,

53:26.000 --> 53:31.000
Or maybe he used to do business in China or other countries.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
After he suddenly returned to Taiwan,

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
he said that his dental development seemed to be interrupted.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
Or the business is really bad.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
So it doesn't matter.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
It sounds like he subjectively believes that he has some economic pressure.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
But in this questionnaire,

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
there may not be a more detailed part to understand his deep situation.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
I think this is a good comment.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
In fact, this is also limited to the source of our information.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
We know that many people who are quarantined or quarantined do not necessarily come back from abroad.

54:06.000 --> 54:14.000
After that, many people have been in contact with the confirmed person or have been in contact with the confirmed person.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
He went to some places.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
He may be locally, but he did not go abroad.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
He may be affected by his work.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
He can't go out to work.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
There are no such people in the information we receive.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
This is a pity.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
Most of these people came back from abroad in their 90s.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
So it may not be the same as yours.

54:36.000 --> 54:42.000
However, the common point is that financial pressure is a big reason for negative emotions.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Sorry, I'll share it at the end.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
It's about stigmatization.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
We also have a very specific view of those who are really quarantined from abroad.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
He complained that his neighbor put a label on him.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
His family did not support him.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
This really caused him a lot of anxiety and anger.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Some sense of hopelessness.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
So I think from what the teacher just shared,

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
I think there are a lot of things that we see in another research.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
We can echo each other.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Thank you very much for your presentation today.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Thank you.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
In fact, if this can be done,

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
In fact, we can also do some direct and quantitative research.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.000
My colleagues are also doing related research.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
For example, Mr. Zenfanzi on hand.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
He does medical sociology.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
He may visit some people who are quarantined or quarantined.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
Will he experience some stigmatization?

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Or do you need any related resources?

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
If we can identify on quantification,

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
What are the reasons for the negative emotions of these people?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Or the reason for wanting to leave the quarantine.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
The interview on quantification will be able to ask questions about these reasons.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
This can supplement a lot of aspects that we can't see in the data.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
So I think it should be possible to do more complete research.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
That is to look at the follow-up.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
This may be just the beginning.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
I just mentioned that we

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
Sorry, I don't need to look for that information.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
From January and February last year to July this year,

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
There are already 700,000 people who have experienced quarantine or quarantine.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
In fact, there are 23 million people in Taiwan.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
In fact, 700,000 people are already a lot.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
About 3% of people have experienced 14 days of quarantine or quarantine.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
A lot of people have experienced this.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
Our research also hopes to find out what kind of pressure these people experience.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
What kind of help can the government give?

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
What kind of help can the society give?

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Stigmatization is definitely a big one.

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
Because the stigmatization he experienced is significantly higher.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
We also found that the most people came from strangers.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
Compared to relatives and friends, compared to acquaintances,

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
The stigmatization of strangers is the highest.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Got it. Thank you.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Thank you.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Thank you, teachers and audience.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
I don't know if I can take 5 to 10 more minutes from you.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
Because our voting time was originally around 11 o'clock.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
But I don't know if I can take 5 to 10 more minutes from the teacher.

57:19.000 --> 57:26.000
Because I see that the audience seems to have a problem with Pan Haoren and Yanping.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
No problem. We don't have a time limit.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Thank you, teacher.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
No problem.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
Let me invite Pan Haoren to ask the question first.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Thank you.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Can you hear me?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Yes.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Thank you.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Thank you, teacher.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
My question is this.

57:49.000 --> 57:55.000
Because most of this research was conducted last year.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
This year, after the outbreak of the epidemic in Taiwan,

57:59.000 --> 58:05.000
Now, in terms of double-digit, it is about 1 to 2 digits per day.

58:05.000 --> 58:18.000
After this outbreak, the public sentiment in Taiwan may be a little different from last year.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
For example, last year, everyone thought that there could not be a single N5.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
As long as there is a single N5, it is a very bad situation.

58:27.000 --> 58:34.000
But this year, until today, there are still some new cases in double-digit.

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
But people may not feel that panic.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I would like to ask the teacher,

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
In this different time and space between last year and this year,

58:48.000 --> 58:57.000
What impact will it have on the non-compliance behavior of home isolationists or their source of pressure?

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
Thank you.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Is this the question?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Yes, thank you.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
I want to think about it.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
In fact, what I am doing now is a prediction.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Because I don't have this information.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
Thank you Haoren for your question.

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
We only have information from March to May of last year.

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
Then quarantine or quarantine people.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Because this information is from May of last year.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
Then we did another wave of research is the world.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
Then we may have this information, but we have not analyzed it yet.

59:36.000 --> 59:42.000
Because in the second piece of information I just mentioned, we actually asked if he was in isolation.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
He has some people in isolation, but very few.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
At that time, we just found very few people.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
We found very few people in isolation.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I remember only a few.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
So can you analyze a good conclusion?

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
I don't know.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I don't know about my information.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Unless there is a relevant study.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Looking for people who are in isolation or quarantine from May to July this year.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
His negative mood or he wants to leave the idea of isolation.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Otherwise, we actually can't know this thing.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Then I want to turn around and ask what you think will be different.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Because in fact, I also need to think about it.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Because I can only say that we don't have this information.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I only have information from March to May of last year.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I only have a few people in this year's information.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We haven't actually analyzed the data of these people.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And what conclusions can a few people come up with?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
We are also very conservative.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Do you think there will be any different results?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Is it just for these people who want to leave the isolation or the negative emotions of these people?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
My personal guess is because the teacher just mentioned that there was a lot of isolation in the survey last year.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
The source of the isolation may come from relatives and friends around them.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Or even some unknown neighbors.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Some pressure.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
For example, the situation in Shuangbei or some more serious situations before the epidemic.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
From a situation that has broken out.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So far, it has been slowed down to a phenomenon that should be controlled.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I'm wondering if people are more afraid of being isolated at home.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:42.000
If so, the pressure from external public opinion may be reduced.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
But I'm not sure if there will be such a situation.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:04.000
After all, from last year's situation, I feel that as long as there is any local case, everyone will put the alert to the highest level.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I don't think there will be such a strong reaction now.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Thank you for your comment.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I think it makes sense.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
If it is July or August, the degree of isolation may be smaller.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000
For example, many department stores or public transportation may not be able to work or work together.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:39.000
At that time, if there is a collective diagnosis, it should be said that the diagnosis in the workplace should be smaller.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Because it's not voluntary.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
But another type may be at the beginning of May or the middle of May.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:00.000
For example, those who were found in some entertainment venues in Wanhua District may be highly insensitive to isolation or quarantine.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It may be different now, but we also have to think about the impact of other factors.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
For example, the degree of satisfaction with the government in other aspects.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
For example, there is no way to get a vaccine.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Because at that time, the vaccine was not a topic.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Now we can say that the number of vaccines and the proportion of vaccines is the key to this disease.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
The key to fighting this disease.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
There may be another issue now.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The two data are very different.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Last year's government satisfaction was very high.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
When we received this group of people from March to May last year, their government satisfaction was very high.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
They think that the information given by the government is very transparent and they support the government.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
But this year, in May, the government satisfaction was not so high because of the sudden outbreak.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I believe that the government satisfaction should have dropped from May to July.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
At that time, we don't know how much it will affect their emotions.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But this is very complicated.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
I hope there will be related research on the isolation or quarantine from May to July.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
But I don't know if there is.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Thank you.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Thank you.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I will ask Yen-Ping to ask the last question.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
After Yen-Ping asks the question, I will stop recording.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Then everyone can ask questions more freely.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
So I will give it to Yen-Ping first.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
My question is as short as the conversation window above.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I want to ask what kind of negative emotions do you distinguish when you talk about negative emotions?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Like depression, anxiety, anger, sadness.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
These should be different emotions.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Thank you.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I know that Yen-Ping is studying emotions, so I can't talk nonsense.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
We have given him a list of depression.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
They made a list of depression at the end of the isolation.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
We asked him why he wanted to leave the isolation.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
There are two reasons.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
One is anxiety.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The other is negative emotions.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
We don't distinguish too much.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Anxiety is there.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
We have a list of depression.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But the list of depression is not in this list.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Of course it's all negative emotions.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But the list of depression was made after the isolation.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
So there is a distinction, but there is no depression in its variables.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So in summary, the negative emotions are not so detailed.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
But we have the degree of depression, but it is not in this model.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We think of it as a negative emotion of the acute stress syndrome.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
This result is there, but not in this model.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Since Yen-Ping has raised a question, he should thank Yen-Ping.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Because the question of sunshine was raised by Yen-Ping.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Did these people experience sunshine?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Of course, whether or not you have experienced sunshine may affect negative emotions.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
We found this later.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
In another survey, I also found that sunshine is a very important variable.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
For the sense of time, do these people know the current situation?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It also has a lot of decisive impact.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Sorry, I can only say that negative emotions are not so different.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But we have information, but it is not used in this model.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
When I asked this question, I wanted to answer it after Yen-Ping.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Because I think that without Yen-Ping,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yen-Ping's data may have this part of the analysis.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I don't know if you can communicate.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Although Yen-Ping's data is closer to real-life data,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
because it is a secure brick line,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
but it can do some coding.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
The reason why I ask this question is because

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
sometimes people who are depressed lose their energy.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So he doesn't want to run away.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
He thinks he should just die in his room.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
But he won't run away.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
What kind of person will run away?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
If you have been in contact with me before, don't be scared.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000
There was a person in our community who was supposed to be quarantined at home.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
He shouted in the hall, saying,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
why is it me? I can't run away.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
He was very angry and wanted to go out.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The police came.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It seems that people who are angry are easier to run away.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
But people who are depressed don't seem to be.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
So there seems to be a little difference between negative emotions.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
My feeling is like this.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Some people even feel that they are invisible.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Even positive emotions.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But this kind of person will run away.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
But if you are a very peaceful person,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I don't feel like I'm quarantining at home.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Then this kind of person won't run away.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So it doesn't seem to be just positive and negative.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It seems to have a lot to do with what kind of emotion.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I don't know my intuition.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Okay, I think it's a very good suggestion.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Let's go back and analyze this more.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I totally agree.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Because we also asked

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
In fact, there are also these questions in the depression table.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Do you think existence is meaningless?

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I believe most of those people

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I don't think I want to do anything.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Leave this matter

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I just want to end my life.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
There are indeed many different negative emotions.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Then we will explain it again.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But if we only talk about negative emotions,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It seems a bit too big.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Maybe I need to explain more.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Sorry, I can add here.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Are you Yiting?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Yes, I am Yiting.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I am now

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
My current mentor is doing suicide research.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So all of our data analysis

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
He is all focused on

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
He may be informed by some suicide-related theories.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
So we are indeed

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Psychological response related to suicide

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Even in the process of coding

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Can find six

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Especially it will trigger the idea of ​​suicide

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
For example, he wants to feel hopeless.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
He wants to feel insolvent.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Then his low mood may be just one of them.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I think it's just that we don't particularly

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Because the purpose of the time when we were fishing

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
It's not to become a quarantiner or a non-quarantiner.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But that is to say, we don't have

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
We don't have this kind of analysis at the moment.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
But like what Yanping mentioned just now

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I think

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
In fact, in the data we have obtained

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
In fact, it is possible to put a group of us

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
We mark it on the identity label

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Is it a quarantine or a quarantiner?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Then go to understand that the content of their call

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Usually ask some of that

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Just treat it as a 1922 question

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
In addition to that kind of question

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
In fact, there will be quite a lot of emotional parts.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
We have mentioned that we have

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
We have seen that it is

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
It's not a very systematic analysis now.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It's just that when I read these diaries

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I will hear that kind of

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
He may not be satisfied with his health needs.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
For example, he needs to see a doctor.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
He needs to get the medicine.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Then he may think

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Or I think I am pregnant.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Then I want to find my current doctor to check.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Then these things may cause them to want to

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Make a call

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Is to release their heart

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
This feeling of wanting to leave but not leaving

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
This feeling of being trapped

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
But we haven't done a very systematic analysis yet.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So maybe this thing is quite interesting.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I can go back and discuss it with my mentor.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I think maybe it's an interesting topic.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
In the psychological health part of the quarantine interpreter

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I also want to ask Yiting

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Is this information of Anxin special line

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Are you still collecting?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
What we currently have

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
In fact, it is also a bit similar.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Is that we are

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
What we are analyzing now is last year.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Uh, from the end of January to the end of May

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Because Taiwan's first confirmed case

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It seems to be January 23rd or 22nd.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Then our information is from that day

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
After a day

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Start

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Uh, until the end of May

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Because in May

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
In fact, Taiwan was almost

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
There is no confirmed case.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Then this year we have

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Consider that this wave of this year

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Do we want to get it again?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
But this is not yet

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
There is no conclusion like this.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But we have this question now.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Indeed, it is limited to last year.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
When the first wave of Taiwan broke out

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
understand

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Did they mention that contact?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Because we found that the more people we contact

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The more people we contact

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
The more people he wants to leave

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I don't know this

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Because the nature of the security line is

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Yes, because it is a bit like a

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Secondary data analysis

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Because we can't take the initiative to ask

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Hey, which of our anti-corruption

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Take the initiative to understand what the problems are

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
He is more of a messenger

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
He is willing to follow this

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Uh, counselor

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
What is the content of this volunteer?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
What can we hear

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So this is a use

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
A restriction on the security line

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Of course it is

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Uh, yes, so he can't

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
As long as this person did not take the initiative to mention

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
We can't ask

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
There are quite a few people in it

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Uh, say

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
His

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I think

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Hey, his social support is reduced

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Even if we now

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Analyze these 60 people

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
They have a higher suicide rate

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
They are

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Uh, no

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
None of them are quarantined

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
But everyone generally still feels

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
From the end of January to the end of May last year

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
During this period

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Even in Taiwan

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Not very, very serious

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But everyone has some anxiety

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Everyone still thinks

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Oh, at that time

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Uh, social support seems to be reduced

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Then I also feel some of my own

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Uh, freedom of life

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
It seems to have some restrictions

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Um, but we can't go

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Analyze in detail

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
How many people are he in contact with

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Thank you

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
That one

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I know your analysis

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Please say

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I just wanted to respond to the issue

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That is to say, I know your

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Uh, the way of analysis may be

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Then read first

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Then do coding

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Then, but there is a way

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Uh, you can also refer to it

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
There is nothing to do

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I put it on the dialogue box

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It is a more like

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Like uh

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Is natural language processing

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
You just let the city scan these

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
If you have a text

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Then he will give these text

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Make some labels

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Oh, then I put this thing on

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It is quite common in psychology

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Then I know this thing

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
This thing is called look

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Then I know in the eyes of computer science

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
This is very

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Basically the same as the tools of primitive people

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
They are newer

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
But what I mean is

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Maybe in this way

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
You can explore it first

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Because we

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Uh, because I actually

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
We have a lot of other cooperators

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Then we also have some

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
As far as I know, there are some

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Researchers, they also use

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
For example, computer science

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
In the field of computer science

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Then explain to us some

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
What is it like

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Natural language learning and so on

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
To analyze the content of this teacher

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Then we do have some

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But for the epidemic

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It doesn't seem to have accumulated so much

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Is that we

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
After all, he has a lot of power

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
He may have tens of thousands of power in the next few months

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So we have to start with this power

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
To have a meaningful analysis

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Also in line with our research

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Then we go back to the main text

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So if it's during the epidemic

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Our main text seems not to be able to do

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
This thing or I don't know

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Maybe this thing you just put on

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
L I W C this thing

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Uh, we can do it in 60 minutes

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I don't know his

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
How much information does it take

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
To do this

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
60 minutes I think you can try

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Um, but

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
It doesn't matter if it's long or short

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It doesn't matter

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
You can try it

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
At most it is not

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Hahaha

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Because I know our other

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Other members of the other team

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
They are just analyzing other things

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Then they did

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
This kind of natural language learning

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
In general this way

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
For example, uh, the instructor

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
With the user

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
The analysis of the user

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And there should have been some before

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
For example, oh, maybe it's for people with depression

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Which words are they more likely to use

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
That's what they use

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
For example, people with schizophrenia

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Which words are more likely to use

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
These studies seem to be ongoing

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
It's just that I'm with this one

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I learned it this year

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's just a very preliminary exposure

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So I'm not very familiar with it

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
But I can imagine maybe we have something now

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It seems

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Also

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Uh, just use this method to analyze

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Take a look, but we're stuck right now

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It's not particularly stuck in the analysis

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Because it's actually fast to read the text

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It's the process of erasing the text

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's more time-consuming

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Ok

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Hey, I'm done

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Hey, I'll leave it to you

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
In fact, we also have these people

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
The narrative of the text is that we

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
At the end of the collection of data

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That day we have

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Let these people review

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Just this month

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Related to the epidemic

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
What he wants to say to us

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Some of the things he's been through

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Or something that impressed him

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
We actually have one

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Uh, if you just talked about this

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Liwc

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
If this thing can be done

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
We don't have a system to look at

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Because there are no experts in text processing

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
But maybe I think it's classification

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Just

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
One question is

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
In my eyes

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Did he experience isolation or isolation

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
This may be possible

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
He mentioned this thing

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I think the judgment rate may be quite high

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Maybe the next step is to ask

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Uh, how high is his negative emotion

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Because these are also

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
There are sets that can be used to see how negative the words he uses

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Does he have any risks

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
These may all be done

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
But I think it's a pretty good direction

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
It's just that I don't have the data

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
But maybe I need to think about it

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
If psychology already has these

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Tools

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Then we should try

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Ok

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I don't know if there are any more

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Thank you, Yanping

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
If I suggest

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I'll stop recording first

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Then let everyone ask

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Okay, then I'll pause

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
To record
