0	10000	Hello, I'm Annie, and I'm honored to have Ian here to give us an amazing talk.
10000	13000	Ian is a PhD candidate at Cornell University.
13000	20000	Today's topic is called Killing the Obvious, a Scientific Analysis of the Incompetent to be Executed.
20000	31000	Today's talk will be about 40-45 minutes, with a 10-15 minute Q&A.
31000	41000	The recording will be uploaded to Taira's YouTube channel or blog in about a week.
41000	48000	Without further ado, let's welcome Ian.
48000	50000	Thank you, Annie.
50000	56000	I'm not a PhD candidate yet, but I hope to be one soon.
56000	64000	I'm very happy to be here today, especially with the support of my Taiwanese friends.
64000	73000	I'll try to be more introverted, and introduce the topic to those unfamiliar with it.
73000	78000	I'll start by sharing my screen.
78000	88000	Can everyone see the video?
88000	90000	Yes, I can.
90000	98000	If you can't see the video, please let me know.
98000	105000	Today's topic is Killing the Obvious, a Scientific Analysis of the Incompetent to be Executed.
105000	120000	In Chinese, the word oblivious refers to an ignorant person, or a person who has no awareness.
120000	125000	It's a difficult word, so it's normal if you don't know it.
125000	127000	I'm Ian Su.
127000	132000	I'm a postdoctoral student at Cornell University.
132000	136000	I'm currently studying Human Development.
136000	140000	I'll be joining the Department of Psychology.
140000	149000	This is a project I'm working on with Cornell Law School.
149000	153000	Today's talk will be divided into three parts.
153000	167000	In the first part, we'll go over the background of Killing the Oblivious.
167000	173000	In the second part, we'll look at what the project is about.
173000	179000	In the third part, I'll talk about how the project combines psychology and law.
180000	191000	I'll use a simple way to explain how we view food.
191000	194000	I'll start with the first part.
194000	198000	The reason I'm doing this research is because
198000	208000	I was a lawyer in Taiwan two years before I came to Cornell.
208000	213000	During my time as a lawyer, I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.
213000	216000	I didn't choose to be involved in these cases,
216000	221000	because my major was Law.
221000	223000	My master's was Psychology.
223000	233000	I was fortunate to be a lawyer with a background in both psychology and law.
233000	241000	I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.
241000	249000	Many of the defendants were mentally ill.
249000	253000	I was involved in a number of cases involving killing the oblivious.
253000	258000	The reason I came to Cornell Law School
258000	265000	is because I had a five-year Ph.D. program in psychology,
265000	270000	but they have a very strong cross-field discipline.
270000	273000	They have a dual degree program.
273000	276000	The professors here are very strong,
276000	281000	and they like to combine psychology, law, and research topics.
282000	289000	Although I didn't mention the six-year dual degree program on the screen,
289000	295000	my professor told me that I already had a law degree in Taiwan,
295000	299000	so I didn't need to come to the U.S. to study law.
299000	304000	What I'm actually doing is trying to combine the law and psychology that I learned in the past
304000	311000	and see how I can use my research to study legal issues.
311000	316000	The reason I started the killing the oblivious project
316000	321000	is because the two professors above me are professors in the Department of Human Development.
321000	325000	They know that I had experience in the death penalty defense in Taiwan,
325000	333000	so they strongly recommended that I go to Professor John Bloom of Cornell Law School.
333000	339000	Professor John Bloom specializes in death penalty defense,
339000	344000	and he is probably the most famous death penalty defense lawyer in the U.S.
344000	349000	For example, he went to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend himself eight times.
349000	353000	For a lawyer in the U.S., this must be a very difficult experience.
353000	360000	So I went to Professor John Bloom and asked him if he had any interesting topics that we could work on together.
360000	366000	Professor John Bloom is currently the Director of the Cornell Law School's Death Penalty Project.
366000	371000	Law schools in the U.S. usually have to study for three years,
371000	378000	and in the first two years, students will look for the so-called legal aid,
378000	381000	the so-called legal aid clinic course,
381000	386000	and students will usually choose a certain professor to lead the clinic
386000	389000	and hold a special case for this professor.
389000	393000	Professor John Bloom specializes in death penalty defense,
393000	397000	so his legal aid clinic is also a case related to death penalty defense.
397000	402000	So he has been working on this relevant topic.
402000	405000	And because death penalty is very special,
405000	411000	it is often intertwined with many psychological or psychological issues.
411000	415000	So these two books are some of the books he helped with.
415000	420000	Professor John Bloom studies death penalty from a lawyer's point of view.
420000	423000	In the process of death penalty,
423000	429000	he may often come into contact with some so-called intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses.
429000	435000	So he may use a more legal perspective to discuss or observe these things.
435000	438000	Today, we will not discuss the nature of death penalty,
438000	443000	but will focus on one of the issues from a purely academic point of view.
443000	445000	Cornell is quite special.
445000	448000	In addition to focusing on local death cases in the United States,
448000	451000	he also has another center that looks at the death penalty all over the world.
451000	458000	For example, they are currently looking at how to look at it from a more human perspective,
458000	460000	even if it is death penalty.
460000	466000	Some countries may lack the so-called legal procedure for the execution of death penalty.
467000	471000	For example, Cornell's Law School is currently helping some African countries
471000	477000	to reform the execution method of death penalty or related laws.
477000	484000	So this is probably why I am in contact with death penalty-related psychological research here at Cornell.
484000	488000	Because he originally had these faculty members doing these researches.
488000	492000	Now we come to the main topic, what is Killing a Belief?
492000	494000	What is he going to discuss?
494000	501000	The first part is that this research is about criminal liability.
501000	504000	You may think that this ability is abstract.
504000	509000	Basically, in the general criminal litigation process,
509000	514000	because you can imagine that in Taiwan, Taiwan is a three-level, three-provincial system.
514000	517000	So if there is a criminal case today, and it involves a death penalty,
517000	520000	for example, a more serious case, such as murder,
520000	526000	it will go all the way from the local court to the high court to the Supreme Court.
526000	529000	The situation in the United States is similar.
529000	535000	In this process, in addition to the judge going to interrogate some facts,
535000	543000	the judge must also pay attention to whether the parties in the process have the ability to arrest the parties.
543000	548000	So in the U.S. judicial process, including Taiwan, there is a similar law.
548000	555000	Usually, I list the four basic abilities that the parties need to have.
555000	560000	The first is that the parties must have the ability to interrogate.
560000	567000	That is to say, at least he needs to know what the court process means,
567000	569000	and what the role of each person is.
569000	573000	The second ability is competency to plead guilty.
574000	578000	That is to say, if he pleads guilty, does it count?
578000	582000	If he is mentally ill, does he have the ability to plead guilty for himself?
582000	586000	The third ability is competency to waive the right to counsel.
586000	592000	In the United States, it is more special that these serious crimes are not necessarily forced defense cases.
592000	596000	That is to say, the government does not necessarily need to help him get a lawyer.
596000	600000	In this case, or if it is a forced defense case,
601000	605000	can the parties say, I think I have the ability to defend myself,
605000	607000	can I waive the counsel?
607000	609000	I don't need a lawyer to help me.
609000	615000	If a party makes such a statement, is it an effective statement?
615000	618000	The last ability is competency for execution.
618000	621000	This ability is very specific, only in criminal cases.
621000	624000	That is the topic we will focus on today.
625000	631000	Competency for execution means that if a case involves execution,
631000	635000	in the end, he is sentenced to death,
635000	637000	and after being sentenced to death,
637000	640000	that is to say, this person is already in the so-called death penitentiary.
640000	643000	He also obtained an execution date,
643000	647000	that is to say, maybe the state government has issued a date of execution,
647000	651000	where and how he will be executed.
651000	653000	In this case,
654000	658000	he himself or his defense team can help him fight for
658000	662000	that this person may not have the ability to be executed.
662000	665000	We will explain later why the ability to be executed is needed.
665000	669000	For example, he may have serious mental disorders, etc.
669000	672000	This is also equivalent to the judicial procedure,
672000	674000	if it involves an execution case,
674000	677000	he will need the ability to be sentenced in the end.
677000	679000	We will focus on the last one today,
679000	681000	competency for execution.
681000	686000	In Taiwan, the current method is more like the ability to be executed.
686000	690000	At present, Taiwan's execution method is also being revised.
690000	692000	It should be revised recently.
692000	695000	This ability is quite interesting.
695000	698000	It originates from the U.S. Constitution 8th Amendment.
698000	701000	The U.S. Constitution 8th Amendment also states that
701000	705000	there is no way to tolerate
705000	708000	a cruel or unusual way of punishment.
709000	713000	Whether in Taiwan or the U.S.,
713000	720000	execution is a way to punish criminals.
720000	724000	So, in the U.S. judicial discussion,
724000	726000	if it is related to execution,
726000	730000	it is usually quoted in the sentence of the 8th amendment of the Constitution
730000	732000	to discuss the execution.
732000	735000	For example, the most common discussion may be the purgatory,
735000	738000	where the execution is considered unethical or cruel.
738000	742000	As for the specific method of execution,
742000	746000	the U.S. Supreme Court has three very decisive judgments.
746000	749000	They are Fort, Penelope, and Madison.
749000	753000	Today, we will introduce these three judgments.
753000	755000	Why do we need to discuss them?
755000	759000	The reason why we need to do this research is because
759000	764000	although I just explained competency for execution,
764000	770000	it is a legal ability that judges need to consider.
770000	774000	But in fact, its standards are very self-explanatory.
774000	778000	Although in the past Supreme Court judgments,
778000	782000	it said that to have the ability to be executed,
782000	788000	you must be able to understand the facts in a rational way.
788000	789000	What is execution?
789000	791000	And why are you sentenced to death?
791000	794000	Or why are you sentenced to death?
794000	800000	And when this person accepts the relevant judicial procedures for execution,
800000	803000	he must have the ability to help his lawyer.
803000	807000	Although the court has these two standards,
807000	809000	how do you actually,
809000	812000	for example, if a psychologist or psychiatrist,
812000	815000	how do they operate this standard is very self-explanatory.
815000	818000	Next, we will go through these three judgments
818000	824000	and talk about what impact these three judgments have on competency for execution.
824000	826000	Before we talk about the judgment,
826000	832000	I can give you an overview of what the U.S. execution procedure is like.
832000	834000	It's a bit similar to Taiwan.
834000	837000	So let's start with the column on the far left.
837000	842000	Generally speaking, the three columns on the left are very similar to Taiwan's three-level three-judgment system.
842000	845000	The bottom left is similar to our local courts.
845000	850000	Then the top left is the Supreme Court,
850000	852000	and the top right is the Supreme Court.
852000	856000	So generally speaking, the death sentence will almost always end
856000	859000	at the three levels of the column on the left.
859000	861000	Because it's a more serious crime,
861000	864000	and it may be related to life.
864000	868000	Generally speaking, if we take Taiwan or the U.S. as an example,
868000	873000	sentences that are not related to execution usually end at the column on the far left.
873000	875000	But if it's a death sentence,
875000	877000	they also have the so-called re-trial system,
877000	879000	which is the middle column.
879000	883000	The re-trial system also usually has the concept of the so-called three-level three-judgment,
883000	885000	which may reach the Supreme Court all the way.
885000	889000	Re-trial means that the court may want to review some new evidence,
889000	891000	or new facts, or new reasons, etc.
891000	893000	Each has different regulations.
893000	897000	But simply put, it's not like the first column is over.
897000	899000	It will go to the second column.
899000	903000	Even most death sentences may go to the third column.
903000	905000	The third column is very special in the U.S.,
905000	907000	which is related to the part of the life protection order.
907000	911000	It means that because the death sentence is a serious crime,
911000	915000	so they are in the process of the entire legal process.
915000	917000	They are almost all locked up in the so-called death cell,
917000	919000	or in the confinement cell.
919000	921000	This is equivalent to locking people up.
921000	923000	So as long as it's locked up with people,
923000	925000	it may involve a violation of the law.
925000	927000	According to the U.S. law,
927000	931000	people can go through a three-level three-judgment system
931000	935000	based on the issue of life protection.
935000	939000	So if a U.S. death sentence is a serious crime,
939000	943000	there will usually be the so-called nine steps.
943000	947000	This is about five to ten years on average.
947000	951000	So the process of execution is very long.
951000	953000	You might imagine that
953000	957000	if a person may have a mental disorder
957000	961000	or a lack of mental intelligence,
961000	965000	the process of nine years is actually very dynamic.
965000	969000	And because if they are all in the so-called prison,
969000	973000	or if they are suppressed in some organs,
973000	979000	and the medical environment may not be so good,
979000	983000	their mental state may deteriorate.
983000	987000	This is a very common case in the U.S. death cell.
987000	991000	Even if they have been sentenced to death,
991000	995000	it may be a very, very long process
995000	1001000	from the day of execution to the day of execution.
1001000	1005000	So the death sentence in the U.S.
1005000	1007000	is a problem that many people will discuss.
1007000	1009000	The death sentence in the U.S.
1009000	1011000	has a huge number of people,
1011000	1013000	with thousands of people in each unit.
1013000	1015000	And the number of people on duty
1015000	1017000	is also thousands of people in each unit.
1017000	1019000	So it's less than 60 people
1019000	1021000	in the current death sentence in Taiwan.
1021000	1023000	This is a big difference in the number of people.
1023000	1025000	So this is to show you
1025000	1027000	the process of execution in the U.S.
1027000	1029000	There are about three parts,
1029000	1031000	and there are nine steps.
1031000	1035000	The earliest sentence is called the Ford sentence.
1035000	1037000	It was the first time in the U.S. Supreme Court
1037000	1039000	to discuss the death sentence,
1039000	1041000	because the law stipulates
1041000	1045000	how we should deal with it.
1045000	1047000	Mr. Ford himself,
1047000	1049000	he committed the crime of killing a police officer.
1049000	1055000	In the process of execution,
1055000	1057000	it should be said that
1057000	1059000	in the process of case trial,
1059000	1063000	he had schizophrenia,
1063000	1065000	and he had some obvious delusions.
1065000	1067000	For example, he had a delusion
1067000	1069000	that the U.S. was involved
1069000	1071000	in racial discrimination
1071000	1073000	with the 3K Party.
1073000	1075000	So in the end,
1075000	1077000	he went through the nine steps
1077000	1079000	that I just mentioned.
1079000	1081000	And then his lawyer
1081000	1083000	helped him file
1083000	1085000	the so-called claim
1085000	1087000	for the ability to be executed.
1087000	1089000	The challenge is that
1089000	1091000	he may not be able to be executed
1091000	1093000	because he had schizophrenia.
1093000	1095000	He had a very serious delusion.
1095000	1097000	At that time,
1097000	1099000	the judge said
1099000	1101000	that they didn't judge
1101000	1103000	Mr. Ford directly
1103000	1105000	whether he was crazy
1105000	1107000	enough to completely lose
1107000	1109000	the ability to be executed.
1109000	1111000	But they gave a rough definition.
1111000	1113000	In other words,
1113000	1115000	as long as the person
1115000	1117000	who was executed
1117000	1119000	had the rational ability
1119000	1121000	to understand
1121000	1123000	his execution
1123000	1125000	and his reason,
1125000	1127000	we would say that he was capable.
1127000	1129000	On the contrary,
1129000	1131000	he may not be able to be executed.
1131000	1133000	This was a judgment
1133000	1135000	about 40 or 50 years ago in 1986.
1135000	1137000	After the Supreme Court
1137000	1139000	made this judgment,
1139000	1141000	he said,
1141000	1143000	okay, we have finished the definition.
1143000	1145000	Then he threw it back
1145000	1147000	to the lower court
1147000	1149000	to judge
1149000	1151000	whether Mr. Ford
1151000	1153000	was capable of being executed
1153000	1155000	or not.
1155000	1157000	Unfortunately,
1157000	1159000	Mr. Ford passed away
1159000	1161000	due to other reasons.
1161000	1163000	At that time,
1163000	1165000	it was not clear
1165000	1167000	how to operate this definition.
1167000	1169000	It seemed that
1169000	1171000	everything was possible,
1171000	1173000	but in practice,
1173000	1175000	it seemed that
1175000	1177000	Mr. Ford was not capable
1177000	1179000	of being executed.
1179000	1181000	So many cases
1181000	1183000	were failed.
1183000	1185000	After 20 years,
1185000	1187000	there was a second judgment
1187000	1189000	called Panetti v. Quarterman
1189000	1191000	in 2007.
1191000	1193000	It was a judgment
1193000	1195000	after 20 years.
1195000	1197000	It was a similar situation
1197000	1199000	where the person
1199000	1201000	had a long history
1201000	1203000	of visual impairment
1203000	1205000	for example,
1205000	1207000	he wore western jeans
1207000	1209000	and helped his lawyer
1209000	1211000	to open the court.
1211000	1213000	He may decide
1213000	1215000	to call many different witnesses,
1215000	1217000	such as the deceased
1217000	1219000	President of the United States
1219000	1221000	or Jesus,
1221000	1223000	to be the witness of his case,
1223000	1225000	which is not related
1225000	1227000	to the case itself.
1229000	1231000	In this judgment,
1231000	1233000	the judge
1233000	1235000	re-explained
1235000	1237000	the long history
1237000	1239000	of the previous judgment
1239000	1241000	in detail.
1241000	1243000	However,
1243000	1245000	this time,
1245000	1247000	the judge
1247000	1249000	re-explained
1249000	1251000	the reason
1251000	1253000	for the execution
1253000	1255000	and the reason
1255000	1257000	for the sentence.
1257000	1259000	In this case,
1259000	1261000	the execution
1261000	1263000	is meaningless
1263000	1265000	because the judge
1265000	1267000	should be responsible
1267000	1269000	for what he did.
1269000	1271000	If the judge
1271000	1273000	can't understand
1273000	1275000	what he did wrong,
1275000	1277000	there is no way
1277000	1279000	for the execution
1279000	1281000	to work.
1281000	1283000	Therefore,
1283000	1285000	when Panetti v. Quarterman
1285000	1287000	was released,
1287000	1289000	the court finally agreed
1289000	1291000	to solve
1291000	1293000	the issue
1293000	1295000	after 20 years.
1295000	1297000	However,
1297000	1299000	the reason for the confusion
1299000	1301000	is that the court
1301000	1303000	has to say more
1303000	1305000	in the next 20 years.
1305000	1307000	For example,
1307000	1309000	there are psychiatrists
1309000	1311000	in psychology schools,
1311000	1313000	so at least
1313000	1315000	there should be
1315000	1317000	some guidelines
1317000	1319000	for the execution.
1319000	1321000	However,
1321000	1323000	the judge
1323000	1325000	has to say more
1325000	1327000	in the next 20 years.
1327000	1329000	For example,
1329000	1331000	there are psychiatrists
1331000	1333000	in psychology schools,
1333000	1335000	so at least
1335000	1337000	there should be
1337000	1339000	some guidelines for the execution.
1339000	1341000	However,
1341000	1343000	the judge
1343000	1345000	has to say more
1345000	1347000	in the next 20 years.
1347000	1349000	However,
1349000	1351000	there are psychiatrists
1351000	1353000	in psychology schools,
1353000	1355000	so at least
1355000	1357000	there should be
1357000	1359000	some guidelines
1359000	1361000	for the execution.
1361000	1363000	However,

2327000	2329000	This is the second part.
2329000	2331000	The third part
2331000	2333000	is about the
2333000	2335000	legal strategies
2335000	2337000	for the execution.
2337000	2339000	The third part

2341000	2343000	legal strategies
2343000	2345000	for the execution.
2345000	2347000	You may think
2347000	2349000	that you know
2349000	2351000	the legal context
2351000	2353000	but you don't know
2353000	2355000	how to operate it.
2355000	2357000	However,
2357000	2359000	most of the laws
2359000	2361000	in Taiwan
2361000	2363000	are against the U.S.
2363000	2365000	and other countries.
2365000	2367000	In terms of
2367000	2369000	the execution
2369000	2371000	of the Fourth Claim,
2371000	2373000	the progress between Taiwan
2373000	2375000	and the U.S.
2375000	2377000	is not that different.
2377000	2379000	We just started
2379000	2381000	a paper in 2014
2381000	2383000	and we are still
2383000	2385000	working on it.
2385000	2387000	At present,
2387000	2389000	many U.S. law firms
2389000	2391000	will come up with
2391000	2393000	creative legal strategies
2393000	2395000	based on their lawyers.
2395000	2397000	If a particular state
2397000	2399000	is successful,
2399000	2401000	it may influence
2401000	2403000	other states.
2403000	2405000	In the end,
2405000	2407000	each state will
2407000	2409000	have its own
2409000	2411000	lawyers
2411000	2413000	who will
2413000	2415000	determine if
2415000	2417000	a particular client
2417000	2419000	has a serious mental illness
2419000	2421000	and how to
2421000	2423000	deal with it.
2423000	2425000	If the client
2425000	2427000	has been in the prison
2427000	2429000	for more than 10 years
2429000	2431000	and he looks very sick,
2431000	2433000	the state government
2433000	2435000	will not issue a death warrant.
2435000	2437000	If the state government
2437000	2439000	does not issue a death warrant,
2439000	2441000	the defense lawyer
2441000	2443000	will have no choice
2443000	2445000	but to watch the client
2445000	2447000	either go crazy
2447000	2449000	or die in the prison
2449000	2451000	for other reasons.
2451000	2453000	The defense lawyer
2453000	2455000	will coordinate with
2455000	2457000	the state government
2457000	2459000	and if the client
2459000	2461000	is very sick,
2461000	2463000	the state government
2463000	2465000	will issue a death warrant
2465000	2467000	for the client.
2467000	2469000	If the client is in a
2469000	2471000	very bad condition
2471000	2473000	and the state government
2473000	2475000	does not issue a death warrant,
2475000	2477000	the defense lawyer
2477000	2479000	will not be able
2479000	2481000	to issue a death warrant
2481000	2483000	for the client.
2483000	2485000	The defense lawyer
2485000	2487000	will not be able
2487000	2489000	to issue a death warrant
2489000	2491000	for the client.
2491000	2493000	Another example
2493000	2495000	is from California.
2495000	2497000	The state government
2497000	2499000	will issue a death warrant
2499000	2501000	for the client
2501000	2503000	if the client
2503000	2505000	is in a bad condition
2505000	2507000	and the state government
2507000	2509000	does not issue a death warrant
2509000	2511000	for the client.
2511000	2513000	The state government
2513000	2515000	will issue a death warrant
2515000	2517000	for the client
2517000	2519000	if the client
2519000	2521000	is in a bad condition
2521000	2523000	and the state government
2523000	2525000	does not issue a death warrant
2525000	2527000	for the client.
2527000	2529000	Another example is
2529000	2531000	from California.
2531000	2533000	The state government
2533000	2535000	will issue a death warrant
2535000	2537000	for the client
2537000	2539000	if the client
2539000	2541000	is in a bad condition
2541000	2543000	and the state government
2543000	2545000	does not issue a death warrant
2545000	2547000	for the client.
2547000	2549000	So far,
2549000	2551000	the first legal strategy
2551000	2553000	has been used a lot
2553000	2555000	and the probability of success
2555000	2557000	is relatively high.
2557000	2559000	It's like the tacit understanding
2559000	2561000	between the defense team
2561000	2563000	and the state government.
2563000	2565000	Basically,
2565000	2567000	they will hold a hearing
2567000	2569000	to determine
2569000	2571000	whether the person
2571000	2573000	is mentally ill
2573000	2575000	or not.
2575000	2577000	The second strategy
2577000	2579000	is the litigation strategy.
2579000	2581000	Lastly,
2581000	2583000	I'd like to thank
2583000	2585000	my collaborators
2585000	2587000	and the RAs
2587000	2589000	who helped me
2589000	2591000	code my lawsuit.
2591000	2593000	We're still
2593000	2595000	looking at these
2595000	2597000	long-term death warrant
2597000	2599000	and we're still
2599000	2601000	looking at these long-term
2601000	2603000	death warrant
2603000	2605000	and the MakeAuthors Foundation
2605000	2607000	has been focusing on
2607000	2609000	the research on mental illness
2609000	2611000	and death.
2611000	2613000	Is there any possibility of
2613000	2615000	racial inequality?
2615000	2617000	That's all
2617000	2619000	for my presentation
2619000	2621000	and I'd like to see
2621000	2623000	if there are any questions.
2623000	2625000	Thank you.
2625000	2627000	I'll start with Ian.
2629000	2631000	Thank you, Ian.
2631000	2633000	This is not my area
2633000	2635000	but I've learned a lot.
2635000	2637000	I'd like to ask
2637000	2639000	if there are any questions
2639000	2641000	for Ian.
2653000	2655000	I'm happy to ask questions.
2657000	2659000	I'm curious
2659000	2661000	and this might not
2661000	2663000	have much to do with
2663000	2665000	your presentation
2665000	2667000	but I'm curious
2667000	2669000	how the US
2669000	2671000	identifies
2671000	2673000	mental illness
2673000	2675000	when it comes
2675000	2677000	to death warrant.
2677000	2679000	For example,
2679000	2681000	how much
2681000	2683000	mental illness
2683000	2685000	does this person
2685000	2687000	need?
2687000	2689000	How do they
2689000	2691000	consider this?
2691000	2693000	I don't know
2693000	2695000	much about the US.
2695000	2697000	The US court system
2697000	2699000	is not the same as Taiwan.
2699000	2701000	They have a national judge
2701000	2703000	for public prosecution.
2703000	2705000	I'm using the term
2705000	2707000	from Taiwan.
2707000	2709000	I'm curious how they
2709000	2711000	consider these things.
2711000	2713000	Currently,
2713000	2715000	there are a few
2715000	2717000	institutions
2717000	2719000	that have tried to
2719000	2721000	provide guidelines.
2721000	2723000	The guidelines are similar
2723000	2725000	to the ones
2725000	2727000	provided by
2727000	2729000	psychiatrists and psychologists.
2729000	2731000	First,
2731000	2733000	each state has different
2733000	2735000	qualifications.
2735000	2737000	There are no rules
2737000	2739000	for each state.
2739000	2741000	For example,
2741000	2743000	how many people
2743000	2745000	can be identified?
2745000	2747000	It's a mess.
2747000	2749000	For example,
2749000	2751000	there are two psychiatrists
2751000	2753000	in Texas.
2753000	2755000	They need to
2755000	2757000	write their own
2757000	2759000	professional report.
2759000	2761000	They need to write
2761000	2763000	their diagnosis
2763000	2765000	according to
2765000	2767000	DSM-5.
2767000	2769000	The rest is left
2769000	2771000	to the judge.
2771000	2773000	This is an interesting
2773000	2775000	aspect.
2775000	2777000	There are a lot of judges
2777000	2779000	with serious
2779000	2781000	visual impairments
2781000	2783000	and delusions.
2783000	2785000	Some people succeed,
2785000	2787000	some people fail.
2787000	2789000	I don't know why
2789000	2791000	we need to look at
2791000	2793000	so many factors
2793000	2795000	to determine
2795000	2797000	the outcome.
2797000	2799000	In Taiwan,
2799000	2801000	there are no
2801000	2803000	cases like this.
2807000	2809000	I'd like to ask
2809000	2811000	about mental
2811000	2813000	disorders.
2813000	2815000	This is related
2815000	2817000	to the third example,
2817000	2819000	which is about
2819000	2821000	medicine.
2821000	2823000	You said it's related to
2823000	2825000	people in prison
2825000	2827000	for a long time.
2827000	2829000	I'm thinking
2829000	2831000	that
2831000	2833000	people in prison
2833000	2835000	for a long time
2835000	2837000	are sentenced
2837000	2839000	to death.
2839000	2841000	After a long period
2841000	2843000	of time,
2843000	2845000	it's normal.
2845000	2847000	For example,
2847000	2849000	what's the mechanism
2849000	2851000	for them to
2851000	2853000	apply for
2853000	2855000	this kind of
2855000	2857000	sentence?
2857000	2859000	Is it
2859000	2861000	impossible to
2861000	2863000	enforce?
2863000	2865000	It's rare.
2865000	2867000	Most cases
2867000	2869000	require
2869000	2871000	the person to be
2871000	2873000	transferred to
2873000	2875000	a medical institution.
2875000	2877000	It's rare.
2877000	2879000	The reason is that
2879000	2881000	the death penalty
2881000	2883000	is stricter
2883000	2885000	than the death penalty
2885000	2887000	in the United States.
2887000	2889000	It's not easy
2889000	2891000	to get the person out of prison.
2891000	2893000	In fact,
2893000	2895000	thousands of people
2895000	2897000	in the United States
2897000	2899000	are waiting for death
2899000	2901000	and unable to
2901000	2903000	get help.
2903000	2905000	That's why
2905000	2907000	the so-called premature
2907000	2909000	is used
2909000	2911000	to determine
2911000	2913000	whether the person
2913000	2915000	has the ability
2915000	2917000	to survive
2917000	2919000	for a long time.
2919000	2921000	It's to
2921000	2923000	determine whether
2923000	2925000	the person
2925000	2927000	has the ability
2927000	2929000	to survive
2929000	2931000	for a long time.
2931000	2933000	Most people
2933000	2935000	are in prison.
2935000	2937000	Most people
2937000	2939000	are in prison.
2939000	2941000	Is prison
2941000	2943000	different from other prisons?
2943000	2945000	Is prison different from other prisons?
2945000	2947000	It depends on the state.
2947000	2949000	Some states have
2949000	2951000	so-called heavy prisons.
2951000	2953000	Heavy prisons may have
2953000	2955000	one death cell.
2955000	2957000	For example,
2957000	2959000	Texas or California
2959000	2961000	may have thousands of people
2961000	2963000	in death cells.
2963000	2965000	They may have
2965000	2967000	all death cells
2967000	2969000	in prison.
2969000	2971000	Heavy prisons
2971000	2973000	are more common.
2973000	2975000	Some states have
2975000	2977000	fewer death cells.
2977000	2979000	They may be in
2979000	2981000	more independent prisons.
2981000	2983000	It depends on the state.
2985000	2987000	I think it's interesting.
2987000	2989000	I don't know if
2989000	2991000	they are still different.
2991000	2993000	Except for
2993000	2995000	all death cells,
2995000	2997000	what about
2997000	2999000	other prisoners?
2999000	3001000	What about other prisoners?
3001000	3003000	It depends on the state.
3003000	3005000	Some states
3005000	3007000	have
3007000	3009000	heavy prisons.
3009000	3011000	Some states have
3011000	3013000	heavy prisons.
3013000	3015000	It also depends on the state.
3015000	3017000	Some states
3017000	3019000	have more open prisons.
3019000	3021000	They have fewer
3021000	3023000	medical resources.
3023000	3025000	Some states have
3025000	3027000	no prisoners.
3027000	3029000	Some states have
3029000	3031000	many prisoners.
3031000	3033000	Some states have
3033000	3035000	no prisoners.
3035000	3037000	They are waiting for death.
3037000	3039000	It's not like
3039000	3041000	there are no prisoners.
3041000	3043000	The treatment is different.
3043000	3045000	The prison is different.
3045000	3047000	The prison is free.
3047000	3049000	It has minimum
3049000	3051000	guarantees.
3051000	3053000	They are waiting for death.
3053000	3055000	In theory, they can't use
3055000	3057000	too much resources.
3057000	3059000	But there are many people in the US
3059000	3061000	and their policies are changing.
3061000	3063000	It's weird.
3063000	3065000	Some people have been
3065000	3067000	in prison for years
3067000	3069000	but they are not dead.
3069000	3071000	It's awkward.
3071000	3073000	It's not certain.
3073000	3075000	It's a complicated
3075000	3077000	situation.
3077000	3079000	Yes.
3079000	3081000	Any other questions?
3081000	3083000	Any other questions?
3083000	3085000	Any other questions?
3085000	3087000	Any other questions?
3087000	3089000	No.
3089000	3091000	Thank you for the wonderful report.
3091000	3093000	I'm looking forward to
3093000	3095000	your coding.
3095000	3097000	I was thinking
3097000	3099000	to do a Lenten class analysis
3099000	3101000	to see
3101000	3103000	whether the prisoners
3103000	3105000	are successful or not.
3105000	3107000	Their backgrounds
3107000	3109000	and profiles
3109000	3111000	are different.
3111000	3113000	I'm looking forward to
3113000	3115000	your analysis.
3115000	3117000	I hope we can
3117000	3119000	finish coding soon.
3123000	3125000	Thank you, Annie.
3125000	3127000	Thank you, Gao Xian.
3127000	3129000	It's comfortable
3129000	3131000	to talk about
3131000	3133000	heavy topics.
3133000	3135000	I think the topics
3135000	3137000	are sensitive.
3137000	3139000	The ability to save lives
3139000	3141000	is the last
3141000	3143000	decision
3143000	3145000	to be made.
3145000	3147000	It's a complicated decision.
3147000	3149000	I'm glad
3149000	3151000	to have the audience
3151000	3153000	here today.
3153000	3155000	Thank you, Annie.
3155000	3157000	Thank you, Annie.
3157000	3159000	Thank you for the wonderful
3159000	3161000	presentation.
3161000	3163000	Thank you for staying up
3163000	3165000	to listen to our
3165000	3167000	presentations.
3167000	3169000	Thank you.
3169000	3171000	I hope
3171000	3173000	Annie,
3173000	3175000	next year
3175000	3177000	you can
3177000	3179000	tell us
3179000	3181000	about your research.
3181000	3183000	OK.
3183000	3185000	I'll share it
3185000	3187000	with you.
3187000	3189000	Thank you.
3189000	3191000	Good night.
3191000	3193000	Good morning.
3193000	3195000	Good afternoon.
3195000	3197000	Thank you.
3197000	3199000	Bye-bye.
