0	5000	Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.
5000	10000	We are very happy to welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.
10000	16000	He graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2010,
16000	20000	and graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2021,
20000	22000	and received his Master's Degree.
22000	24000	During his Master's Degree,
24000	27000	he worked in coding,
27000	37000	and developed the non-equilibrium screen function,
37000	38000	which is NEGF.
38000	39000	This is also in his title.
39000	43000	If you don't know what NEGF is,
43000	45000	he will explain it to you later.
45000	48000	From 2014 to 2020,
48000	53000	he went to Purdue University, Indiana,
53000	56000	and received his Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering.
56000	62000	His main job there was quantum transport method,
62000	65000	which is the method of quantum transmission.
65000	73000	His main focus was on nanostructure and quantum transmission.
74000	79000	Currently, he works in Intel's TCAP team.
79000	82000	Let's welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.
86000	87000	You can start sharing.
87000	89000	Let me share my screen.
89000	91000	Can everyone see my screen?
95000	97000	Yes, but you can't see the slides.
97000	98000	Okay.
98000	100000	Can you see the slides now?
100000	101000	Yes.
101000	104000	Let's follow the Tyrell tradition.
104000	106000	Please turn on your microphones,
106000	110000	and let's welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.
115000	116000	Hello, everyone.
116000	120000	I will be speaking in English for the next few slides,
120000	125000	because the technical terms may change.
125000	128000	My target audience this time is...
128000	132000	If you're interested in this field,
132000	135000	whether you want to apply for a Master's Degree,
135000	138000	or if you want to know more about this field,
138000	140000	or if you want to use this tool,
140000	144000	my target audience is like that.
146000	147000	If you have any questions,
147000	149000	you can send me an email.
149000	153000	These works were done when I was studying for a Master's Degree at Purdue.
153000	159000	The funding sources were NSF and NCSA.
159000	165000	I also received funding from the Department of Education.
165000	167000	So I wanted to acknowledge that.
167000	169000	I also worked with CELBACO.
169000	175000	This work was done by Purdue's supercomputer,
175000	178000	which we call RCAC.
178000	182000	This is the result of the computation.
182000	185000	My topic today is optoelectronic simulation,
185000	188000	and I will go over from the semi-classical
188000	190000	to quantum transport,
190000	192000	my different perspective.
192000	194000	Here is my outline,
194000	196000	and I will go over the motivation,
196000	198000	and what's the method being used here,
198000	201000	and I will show some results.
201000	205000	In the methods, I will go over the semi-classical.
205000	207000	Here's a missing label here,
207000	209000	and go over to what's NEGF,
209000	211000	and what is a beautiful probe,
211000	214000	and the difficulty of including different processes,
214000	217000	a recombination and generation process inside the NEGF.
217000	218000	How do we do that?
218000	220000	I will show some results to show,
220000	224000	first, the importance of including these kinds of processes.
224000	227000	Also, I will do a comparison.
227000	230000	If we use a semi-classical way to do simulation
230000	234000	versus using quantum transport way to do it,
234000	236000	what's the difference?
236000	238000	And do a summary there.
238000	243000	So, why are we working on this project?
243000	247000	It's because what we have achieved so far as mankind,
247000	249000	because we have solar cell,
249000	251000	and also to harvest energy from sun,
251000	254000	and also we can efficiently emit light
254000	256000	through light-emitting diets,
256000	258000	which is like a really efficient way
258000	264000	to transfer energy from electricity to lighting.
264000	266000	And to push the boundary further,
266000	271000	we need to look into what other new materials are out there,
271000	275000	what different new structures we can optimize
275000	277000	like the current efficiency.
277000	281000	And so, for example, to improve the efficiency of LED,
281000	284000	we have these quantum wells,
284000	287000	and then you can see that when we have quantum well,
287000	290000	the carrier will like to stay there more,
290000	292000	and therefore increase the opportunity
292000	295000	to recombine and emit light.
295000	300000	And also we are looking to the novel new materials,
300000	304000	like, for example, different Indian composition,
304000	306000	or maybe some 2D materials,
306000	308000	and we're looking into these.
308000	313000	So, when we are utilizing all these different new materials,
313000	317000	new structures, and there are lots of quantum effects in it.
317000	321000	So, therefore, like the current,
321000	324000	and we know that the non-equilibrium Green's function,
324000	327000	this method, like it's solving Schrodinger equation
327000	329000	with using Green's function,
329000	330000	it's a well-accepted method.
330000	336000	So, I'm going to go over why do we need NEGF to do it.
336000	339000	So, what is optoelectronics?
339000	343000	And so, I think the best way to understand optoelectronics,
343000	347000	like it's just a simple PN diet we study in school, right?
347000	350000	So, it's usually a bipolar device,
350000	352000	where by bipolar, I mean, like,
352000	354000	there's electrons and there's holes.
354000	357000	And also there are carriers,
357000	360000	like they're in different equilibrium,
360000	361000	for example, electron,
361000	364000	and they're usually separated by a band gap.
364000	366000	That's why we use semiconductors.
366000	367000	So, having a band gap,
367000	371000	and we kind of segregate the carriers to two kinds,
371000	376000	and the electron is injected by the source, one side.
376000	378000	One contact, we inject electron here,
378000	380000	and the other one is like a hole.
380000	381000	And when they see each other,
381000	385000	and there's interesting thing can happen, right?
385000	386000	There are different processes there.
386000	388000	For example, there's like Shockley-Ree hole,
388000	391000	where electron and hole, they can recombine.
391000	392000	And when they recombine,
392000	395000	they can emit phonon, as known as heat, right?
395000	397000	So, this is like a wasteful energy.
397000	400000	When they recombine through the defects,
400000	404000	the heat is generated and nothing gained.
404000	406000	Well, the heat is gained, but it's not that great.
406000	409000	And there's also radiative recombination,
409000	412000	where when the electron and hole, they see each other,
412000	413000	and they can recombine,
413000	415000	and therefore, they can emit like a photon,
415000	417000	or we can see light here.
417000	422000	And the rate it happens usually is,
422000	424000	and there's like, because like,
424000	425000	for example, first one,
425000	428000	they need to see through a defect here,
428000	432000	and therefore, their proportion is like proportional
432000	434000	to the n-type or p-type,
434000	438000	because one carrier can come to the defect here,
438000	440000	and to wait for the other person to come,
440000	441000	and to recombine.
441000	444000	So, therefore, their rate is proportional to,
444000	446000	you know, either the carrier,
446000	449000	either the electrons or the hole concentration here.
449000	451000	But radiative recombination,
451000	454000	it's, you need,
454000	457000	the rate is proportional to the both of them.
457000	461000	So, you need to have a high electron here,
461000	463000	and high hole concentration here,
463000	465000	to make it happen.
465000	467000	And there's like also another process,
467000	469000	which is OJ recombination.
469000	471000	And this is like a three-particle process,
471000	473000	where the electron and hole,
473000	474000	they can recombine.
474000	478000	But instead of like emitting a photon,
478000	480000	it will kick an electron to a higher energy,
480000	481000	or the opposite.
481000	483000	It's either two electron with one hole,
483000	485000	or two hole with one electron.
485000	487000	But the result is like a waste of energy,
487000	491000	and the chance of doing is something like here.
492000	495000	And, yes.
495000	496000	If you have any questions,
496000	498000	you can ask directly,
498000	500000	or pause the video.
500000	506000	And the other part is a generation process,
506000	510000	where the electron hole,
510000	511000	at this place,
511000	513000	at this depletion region,
513000	515000	we can absorb the photon,
515000	517000	and like create an electron and hole pair.
517000	519000	So, all these processes are needed
519000	522000	to simulate an optoelectronic device.
522000	524000	So, that's what we need to cover,
524000	527000	when we are doing a modeling.
527000	530000	So, why do we need quantum model?
530000	532000	So, let's take a look at a simulation result.
532000	535000	And this is from this paper I'm co-author with.
535000	540000	This is like a simulation result
540000	543000	from a commercialized 3-5 LED.
543000	545000	And as you can see here,
546000	549000	this line here means the density of states,
549000	551000	and the color here is the electron density.
551000	555000	So, the contour line is the density of state, right?
555000	558000	And we can see that the electron is coming from the left side,
558000	561000	and occupying these states here.
561000	564000	And there are holes coming from the other direction.
564000	565000	This is injected here.
565000	568000	And they are going to be in here,
568000	571000	and they will recombine and emit light here.
571000	572000	So, we can see that,
572000	575000	if we really do a quantum simulation,
575000	578000	we can see that there is interference everywhere, right?
578000	581000	For example, all these pattern means,
581000	584000	if you treat them as particles,
584000	587000	it doesn't capture everything, right?
587000	588000	So, for example,
588000	590000	electron, they can tunnel through this barrier,
590000	593000	and through these interference.
593000	598000	So, we really need to make use of the quantum transport,
598000	600000	instead of the semi-classical way.
602000	606000	So, the current state of our tool to do this is to,
606000	607000	I mean, the current way,
607000	609000	I mean, before I published the paper, right?
609000	614000	So, before I was working on this,
614000	616000	the best way to deal with this quantumly
616000	618000	is also from this paper,
618000	622000	where we cut the domain into different pieces,
622000	626000	and then we call some of them the red part,
626000	628000	and also the green part.
628000	630000	So, the green part is like equilibrium.
630000	631000	And why are they in equilibrium?
631000	634000	Because usually the source is highly doped,
634000	636000	and then the drain is also highly doped region.
636000	638000	And when you're highly doped,
638000	640000	there's lots of carrier there,
640000	642000	and they will scatter a lot,
642000	645000	and the carrier there will be in equilibrium.
645000	647000	So, when you are in equilibrium,
647000	650000	we can put a Fermi level here,
650000	653000	saying, oh, this is the Fermi energy in this region,
653000	655000	and this is the Fermi energy,
655000	657000	and there's like Fermi level for electron,
657000	660000	Fermi level for holes in this region.
660000	663000	And there's also the pink part,
663000	666000	where we do, this is non-equilibrium region.
666000	670000	So, this is like the previous way of doing it,
670000	673000	where we do NEGF inside the pink region,
673000	677000	and we just put the Fermi level across here.
680000	683000	So, but this method has some defects,
683000	686000	where we cannot even calculate a simple p-n diet,
686000	689000	because a simple p-n diet,
689000	692000	we cannot really tell which region is non-equilibrium,
692000	695000	which region is equilibrium.
695000	698000	So, it's really hard to do quantum transport
698000	700000	in a p-n diet,
700000	703000	when we are trying to include
703000	706000	all the recombination or generation processes.
706000	711000	So, there are different flavor of quantum transport.
711000	713000	There's like ballistic NEGF,
713000	715000	there's like the one I mentioned,
715000	717000	we cut into different domain,
717000	721000	when we try to do the transport calculation,
721000	723000	and there's like the super expensive SE4,
723000	726000	but none of them can have been,
726000	729000	are able to deal with the p-n diets,
729000	731000	like with the recombination processes.
731000	734000	So, therefore, a new model is needed, right?
734000	735000	And also we can see that,
735000	737000	this is from a super old paper,
737000	739000	why the recombination process is important,
739000	741000	is because when you measure IV curve,
741000	743000	there's like different slope here,
743000	745000	and they are in the results
745000	748000	of different recombination process here,
748000	752000	which later on, I will talk more about that.
752000	756000	So, what's the available way to do,
756000	757000	to deal with carrier transport?
757000	760000	So, here's like a list, a roadmap,
760000	763000	like where you can pick and choose,
763000	764000	depending on your needs.
764000	765000	So, if you are,
765000	767000	so here, the axis,
767000	771000	y-axis here is the computational intensity.
771000	773000	So, I'm going from a super cheap,
773000	775000	super fast turnaround time,
775000	776000	computational cost,
776000	778000	like the semi-classical way,
778000	780000	and all the way to go quantum,
780000	782000	where we need to solve Schrodinger equation,
782000	785000	and using it on any GF methods.
785000	786000	So, I will first go over,
786000	789000	what's the Boltzmann transport equation?
789000	792000	And there are different way to solve it,
792000	795000	like the drift diffusion is the most popular way.
795000	797000	It's the first order,
797000	799000	I think, what is it?
799000	802000	The first order approximation,
802000	803000	not approximation,
803000	807000	but it's a simplification of the BTE,
807000	809000	the famous BTE thing,
809000	811000	and that's like we solve it drift diffusion,
811000	813000	and then we can also use Monte Carlo,
813000	815000	like statistically to gather results
815000	818000	for the BTE equation.
818000	822000	So, what's Boltzmann transport equation?
822000	824000	It's by saying that,
824000	827000	oh, there is a distribution function.
827000	829000	By distribution, we mean,
829000	832000	with the occupation of a different state,
832000	834000	and what does this mean?
834000	836000	Like, we want to ask,
836000	840000	what's the possibility of finding a carrier
840000	841000	at a particular location,
841000	843000	at a particular time,
843000	844000	with a particular momentum?
844000	846000	So, if we can,
846000	848000	for example, inside a device,
848000	850000	there's a different location here,
850000	852000	and for each location,
852000	853000	there is a,
853000	855000	I'm trying to draw this like a momentum,
855000	857000	so carrier with low momentum is here,
857000	860000	and carrier with higher momentum
860000	861000	is on the upper here,
861000	862000	and we are asking,
862000	863000	what's the distribution?
863000	865000	How many particles are in those states?
865000	867000	So, if we know this information
867000	869000	across time, across space,
869000	871000	and for different time and space
871000	872000	and different momentum,
872000	873000	we know this,
873000	875000	then the system is solved, right?
875000	878000	So, and why is this distribution useful?
878000	881000	Because from this distribution function,
881000	884000	we can get the carrier density, right?
884000	886000	Because if we want to ask,
886000	888000	what's the carrier density at this location?
888000	890000	Given the F at this location,
890000	892000	we can just do a sum
892000	894000	and know how much carrier is here.
894000	895000	And if you want to know,
895000	897000	oh, for your device you're working on,
897000	898000	what's the current
898000	900000	that you just do,
900000	902000	get their group of velocity
902000	903000	from the band structure
903000	904000	and you do a sum
904000	906000	with this distribution,
906000	907000	then you can get,
907000	908000	oh, how much current you are gaining
908000	910000	at this location.
910000	911000	So, it's useful
911000	913000	because we can get observable
913000	916000	from this distribution function.
916000	919000	And how do we solve this F?
919000	923000	And it's the BTE Boltzmann.
923000	925000	Boltzmann came up with this, right?
925000	927000	Like the Boltzmann transport equation.
927000	928000	It's the governing equation.
928000	930000	So, the equation is listed here.
930000	932000	And I will just try to show
932000	934000	how we understand different terms.
934000	936000	For example,
936000	938000	the first term means,
938000	940000	oh, if you have carrier
940000	943000	coming in, coming out,
943000	945000	the distribution here
945000	946000	will be related to that, right?
946000	948000	Because you have carrier
948000	951000	flowing into here or flowing out.
951000	953000	And the distribution here will be,
953000	955000	if you have lots of people coming in
955000	958000	and a few going out,
958000	960000	then the distribution here will be higher.
960000	962000	So, this is what the first term means.
962000	964000	And the second term means that
964000	966000	the F means the electric field,
966000	969000	the carrier experience in the charge.
969000	971000	And when you are,
971000	973000	when the carrier is experiencing
973000	975000	electric field, it will accelerate.
975000	977000	And it will change its momentum.
977000	979000	So, here we mean like that,
979000	981000	okay, given the electric field
981000	983000	at this location,
983000	985000	the distribution, you know,
985000	987000	it's related to
987000	989000	the distribution nearby.
989000	991000	So, distribution with a lower momentum,
991000	993000	with a higher momentum,
993000	995000	they can come in and out
995000	997000	because of the electric field
997000	999000	at this location.
999000	1001000	And the last one is
1001000	1003000	if you have like, oh,
1003000	1005000	other collision inside a device,
1005000	1007000	for example, a phonon,
1007000	1009000	an electron can absorb a phonon
1009000	1011000	or emit a phonon and come to your
1011000	1013000	this place, if there's a possibility
1013000	1015000	like that, then this term is trying
1015000	1017000	to take that into account.
1017000	1019000	So, we have all this
1019000	1021000	and all combined. And they can be solved
1021000	1023000	really expensively by
1023000	1025000	doing Monte Carlo, by assuming
1025000	1027000	the distribution function and you start to
1027000	1029000	run it, oh, how many carrier coming in,
1029000	1031000	coming out from different momentum space,
1031000	1033000	then it's super expensive to do that
1033000	1035000	Monte Carlo. So, but if it's still
1035000	1037000	too hard, then you can simplify
1037000	1039000	this BT equation
1039000	1041000	to a drift diffusion equation,
1041000	1043000	which is saying that the
1043000	1045000	current at this place is proportional
1045000	1047000	to the carrier with the electric
1047000	1049000	field and the diffusion
1049000	1051000	with the density gradient.
1051000	1053000	So, this is, and the full derivation
1053000	1055000	is in this paper here.
1055000	1057000	People who are interested can go take
1057000	1059000	a look.
1059000	1061000	So, I kind of went over like the
1061000	1063000	semi-classical way where
1063000	1065000	the carrier and the device are
1065000	1067000	like particle-like and then
1067000	1069000	they can recombine
1069000	1071000	by solving
1071000	1073000	the drift diffusion equation and the continuity
1073000	1075000	equation. That's how we
1075000	1077000	deal with the
1077000	1079000	semi-classical way.
1079000	1081000	And now I'm going to step into the
1081000	1083000	Schrodinger equation and our
1083000	1085000	non-equilibrium Green's function.
1085000	1087000	So, we all know about Schrodinger equation.
1087000	1089000	It's like, it's
1089000	1091000	given a Hamiltonian of the system
1091000	1093000	that you can solve it and then to find
1093000	1095000	what's the possible eigenenergies
1095000	1097000	inside the system.
1097000	1099000	And the Green's function,
1099000	1101000	I still won't go into details.
1101000	1103000	I started to disappoint people here.
1103000	1105000	But like, I think
1105000	1107000	there are like really useful
1107000	1109000	material here and like really, I think
1109000	1111000	Professor Datas did a really good job
1111000	1113000	on explaining what
1113000	1115000	an AEGF method is with his
1115000	1117000	introductory material on
1117000	1119000	nanoHUB. So, it's all the information
1119000	1121000	and there's like a
1121000	1123000	famous book. You can reach out to me and I can
1123000	1125000	show you like
1125000	1127000	what's the book you need to read
1127000	1129000	into. But Green's function,
1129000	1131000	from our understanding, Green's function
1131000	1133000	is also
1133000	1135000	in an engineering term, it's like the response
1135000	1137000	to an excitation, right?
1137000	1139000	So usually, oh,
1139000	1141000	Poisson equation, the Green's function,
1141000	1143000	if you know the Green's function for a Poisson equation,
1143000	1145000	then you know, oh,
1145000	1147000	if you put a charge here, what's the
1147000	1149000	resulting potential you can get?
1149000	1151000	So the Schrodinger equation is similar like this.
1151000	1153000	So you put the H psi,
1153000	1155000	E psi all into one side
1155000	1157000	and then you can solve for the Green's function.
1157000	1159000	And the Green's function is that
1159000	1161000	if you multiply this
1161000	1163000	by excitation, then you know what's
1163000	1165000	the response you will get
1165000	1167000	inside this device.
1167000	1169000	So,
1169000	1171000	here, we will
1171000	1173000	first go into the ballistic
1173000	1175000	non-equilibrium Green's function.
1175000	1177000	So once you, so first you have this
1177000	1179000	Hamiltonian, and then you can get the
1179000	1181000	resulting Green's function. And then
1181000	1183000	by, so here
1183000	1185000	it's like the Hamiltonian here, and we can get
1185000	1187000	the Green's function. And using the Green's function,
1187000	1189000	there's like some key terms.
1189000	1191000	There's like the G lesser, which is the
1191000	1193000	the
1193000	1195000	this is proportional to the carrier
1195000	1197000	density. So it's like
1197000	1199000	here's the excitation you have in the system.
1199000	1201000	And you have like, using the Green's
1201000	1203000	function, and there's a Gr
1203000	1205000	and Gr dagger, then you can get the
1205000	1207000	what's the carrier distribution in the device.
1207000	1209000	So,
1209000	1211000	what the
1211000	1213000	NEGF does is that we are interested
1213000	1215000	in a part,
1215000	1217000	only this part of the device. And we are,
1217000	1219000	we want to say, oh,
1219000	1221000	we only want to focus on this small region.
1221000	1223000	And then the left,
1223000	1225000	we call it, that's a
1225000	1227000	contact, that's a lead. And we
1227000	1229000	don't want to care about the information.
1229000	1231000	It's an infinite,
1231000	1233000	going left and right.
1233000	1235000	They are periodically going left
1235000	1237000	and right. But we don't want to simulate
1237000	1239000	the entire universe. We only
1239000	1241000	want to focus on the transistor or the
1241000	1243000	LED we care about.
1243000	1245000	So, given this Green's
1245000	1247000	function, and then we can
1247000	1249000	for different contact,
1249000	1251000	if you are contact to the left, and then there's
1251000	1253000	like a left self-energy
1253000	1255000	and there's like a right side, there's like a
1255000	1257000	self-energy here. And with all this self-energy
1257000	1259000	on the Green's function, you can get what's
1259000	1261000	the carrier distribution in here.
1261000	1263000	And when they are in contact
1263000	1265000	with the reservoir of
1265000	1267000	a different Fermi level here
1267000	1269000	on the left side and right side here.
1271000	1273000	So, but the ballistic
1273000	1275000	and NEGF, there's no scattering.
1275000	1277000	So carrier will not scatter with
1277000	1279000	each other. So how
1279000	1281000	do we do
1281000	1283000	including all these scattering
1283000	1285000	terms in the
1285000	1287000	NEGF is like, there's a
1287000	1289000	popular method
1289000	1291000	that's called Butyprobe method
1291000	1293000	where it's proposed by Marcus
1293000	1295000	Butyprobe back in 1980s.
1295000	1297000	So it's a way to mimic
1297000	1299000	defacing, which means, aka
1299000	1301000	the scattering events.
1301000	1303000	So, we
1303000	1305000	will try, when we're
1305000	1307000	injecting the carrier into
1307000	1309000	the device from the left and right
1309000	1311000	side. So we're adding more
1311000	1313000	more these
1313000	1315000	reservoir inside the device.
1315000	1317000	So we're taking the electron out and
1317000	1319000	put it back in, take it out and put it
1319000	1321000	back in. So in this way, we're
1321000	1323000	mimicking like carrier
1323000	1325000	we can randomize the carrier
1325000	1327000	and the carrier's momentum will go around
1327000	1329000	and like you can see that
1329000	1331000	this is more closer to
1331000	1333000	the real world problem where the
1333000	1335000	device have scattering.
1335000	1337000	But this method
1337000	1339000	was only applicable
1339000	1341000	to unit polar device. For example,
1341000	1343000	if you only have electron here, it can only
1343000	1345000	simulate electrons
1345000	1347000	scattered inside the device.
1347000	1349000	So
1349000	1351000	my work, my PhD
1351000	1353000	was like to ask a question
1353000	1355000	whether we can modify this for
1355000	1357000	bipolar device.
1357000	1359000	Bipolar
1359000	1361000	means
1361000	1363000	when we have, so
1363000	1365000	can we put like two, when we are
1365000	1367000	we simulate electron and hole
1367000	1369000	separately like before, right?
1369000	1371000	We have electron coming in and electron
1371000	1373000	coming out and we also simulate the hole
1373000	1375000	whereas electron coming in, sorry, hole coming
1375000	1377000	in and hole coming out. And we also
1377000	1379000	include this probe here to extract
1379000	1381000	the carrier in, out of
1381000	1383000	the device and put it back in
1383000	1385000	and this
1385000	1387000	way, if we somehow take
1387000	1389000	the carrier out from
1389000	1391000	this electron and hole and that's equivalent
1391000	1393000	to semi-classically
1393000	1395000	how JIP diffusion model
1395000	1397000	the Shockley-Ree hole and different processes.
1397000	1399000	So using this
1399000	1401000	method, we can
1401000	1403000	cover
1403000	1405000	the processes I
1405000	1407000	mentioned in the optoelectronic device. We can
1407000	1409000	model Shockley-Ree hole, we can model
1409000	1411000	radiated, we can model OJ,
1411000	1413000	we can model all these
1413000	1415000	effects inside the
1415000	1417000	enhanced
1417000	1419000	electrical probe method.
1419000	1421000	So here is like all
1421000	1423000	the methodology I've mentioned
1423000	1425000	where from
1425000	1427000	cheap to expensive, we have like
1427000	1429000	JIP diffusion, Monte Carlo's
1429000	1431000	and the NEGF
1431000	1433000	and also
1433000	1435000	in the
1435000	1437000	NEGF we have like the
1437000	1439000	ballistical one and also the
1439000	1441000	what's the time now?
1441000	1443000	Do we still have time?
1444000	1446000	Oops.
1446000	1448000	Oh 540, sorry.
1448000	1450000	Let me put it back on.
1450000	1452000	Yeah, so we have like
1452000	1454000	all the different
1454000	1456000	methodology here and this is the one
1456000	1458000	I was mainly working on.
1458000	1460000	So carriers, they are
1460000	1462000	wave-like.
1462000	1464000	So for example,
1464000	1466000	from before, JIP diffusion and Monte Carlo's
1466000	1468000	each of the carriers, they are particle-like
1468000	1470000	and then we are solving
1470000	1472000	the current continuity equation.
1472000	1474000	For each location, there is like a quasi-Fermi
1474000	1476000	level, which means they follow Fermi
1476000	1478000	direct distribution
1478000	1480000	and
1480000	1482000	quantum correction with
1482000	1484000	artificial.
1484000	1486000	And there are way people
1486000	1488000	when using JIP diffusion, you can
1488000	1490000	couple it with quantum correction like
1490000	1492000	solving Schrodinger equation
1492000	1494000	in a certain region and then couple
1494000	1496000	them with a JIP diffusion and try
1496000	1498000	to mimic it.
1498000	1500000	You will have artificial boundary
1500000	1502000	condition.
1502000	1504000	When do we choose?
1504000	1506000	Which is the part we want to solve at quantum?
1506000	1508000	Where do we solve semi-classically?
1508000	1510000	So there's lots of confusion
1510000	1512000	if you are coupling that.
1512000	1514000	But using NEGF
1514000	1516000	like if it's
1516000	1518000	ballistic, it's not
1518000	1520000	really useful for
1520000	1522000	optoelectronic because there's no
1522000	1524000	recombination scattering processes and
1524000	1526000	there's like the way I mentioned, it's called
1526000	1528000	multi-equilibrium
1528000	1530000	way. So some part of it you
1530000	1532000	simulate, you assume
1532000	1534000	like there's like an equilibrium there.
1534000	1536000	But
1536000	1538000	this method, it requires
1538000	1540000	like
1540000	1542000	really, it only
1542000	1544000	works with, for example, quantum well structure
1544000	1546000	and inside here, we can
1546000	1548000	set it to be equilibrium and somehow to
1548000	1550000	have the carrier recombine.
1550000	1552000	But in this way, the new
1552000	1554000	proposed beautiful probe way
1554000	1556000	where the carriers are always
1556000	1558000	wavelength and we can have
1558000	1560000	recombination generation everywhere in the
1560000	1562000	device and we also can have scattering
1562000	1564000	consider and
1564000	1566000	you don't need to say
1566000	1568000	this part is equilibrium or the other part
1568000	1570000	is non-equilibrium. So you can simulate
1570000	1572000	the entire device without
1572000	1574000	artificial boundary.
1574000	1576000	And of course, there's the SC Born method
1576000	1578000	but that's like super expensive and
1578000	1580000	no one has, I would say
1580000	1582000	like no one has done like
1582000	1584000	a simulation like
1584000	1586000	LED kind of simulation
1586000	1588000	like with it.
1588000	1590000	And so later
1590000	1592000	next one, I will go
1592000	1594000	to talk about the results.
1594000	1596000	So first part, I will show that
1596000	1598000	the importance of recombination.
1598000	1600000	So here is a picture
1600000	1602000	showing, this is a structure
1602000	1604000	where electrons coming
1604000	1606000	again from the left side here and then
1606000	1608000	there's a band structure. There's a
1608000	1610000	band gap in between
1610000	1612000	this and I crop out in between
1612000	1614000	and the hole is coming to here.
1614000	1616000	So
1616000	1618000	there are two paths that electron
1618000	1620000	can, there's
1620000	1622000	a current conducting path, right?
1622000	1624000	So one path is the blue path where
1624000	1626000	electron come here and hole come here
1626000	1628000	and they will recombine and this
1628000	1630000	current, they can form a current path.
1630000	1632000	And the other path is the black line
1632000	1634000	where the carrier come in and can
1634000	1636000	jump over the barrier to the other side.
1636000	1638000	So there are two way that the
1638000	1640000	carrier can
1640000	1642000	that the current can form.
1642000	1644000	So here's a comparison with
1644000	1646000	or without this indium
1646000	1648000	gallium nitride. So when we form
1648000	1650000	the quantum well with a lower
1650000	1652000	band gap material here. So on the two sides
1652000	1654000	gallium nitride with a larger band gap.
1654000	1656000	With indium gallium nitride, you can shrink
1656000	1658000	the band gap and that's why we see this dip
1658000	1660000	here. And with this, you
1660000	1662000	can see that comparing the two
1662000	1664000	the recombination current is
1664000	1666000	much higher with a quantum well
1666000	1668000	because inside a quantum well, there's a
1668000	1670000	higher chance of
1670000	1672000	carrier here and because
1672000	1674000	we also know that
1674000	1676000	the recombination
1676000	1678000	is proportional to the carrier density
1678000	1680000	there, right? They want to see each other
1680000	1682000	they want to recombine. So the more they have
1682000	1684000	at each location, the more
1684000	1686000	they can recombine with each other.
1686000	1688000	So
1690000	1692000	here I'm trying
1692000	1694000	to show that
1694000	1696000	when we do any
1696000	1698000	gift calculation, when we include
1698000	1700000	the recombination here
1700000	1702000	this is a typical
1702000	1704000	IV curve and we can see that
1704000	1706000	this is a log scale
1706000	1708000	current, right? So when we increase
1710000	1712000	when we increase the drain
1712000	1714000	voltage, we are pulling
1714000	1716000	the barrier down
1716000	1718000	so there are more and more current can go
1718000	1720000	through to the other side. So
1720000	1722000	let's focus first on
1722000	1724000	the low Vd
1724000	1726000	side. So on the low Vd side
1726000	1728000	there, you can
1728000	1730000	see that there's still a barrier here. So
1730000	1732000	the black current, so the total
1732000	1734000	current will be, as I said before
1734000	1736000	there's like two parts. There's a recombine
1736000	1738000	the electron hole
1738000	1740000	they can recombine here for a
1740000	1742000	current path. And there's also the
1742000	1744000	thermionic current where the carrier can
1744000	1746000	jump over the barrier to the other side
1746000	1748000	so this is the two part. And when the
1748000	1750000	barrier is still high, we can see that the black line
1750000	1752000	is not in favor because it's hard
1752000	1754000	for the electron to jump out here. There's like
1754000	1756000	few particles here to jump out. So
1756000	1758000	the black part of the current is super
1758000	1760000	small. And
1760000	1762000	at this region
1762000	1764000	the recombination current dominates
1764000	1766000	so we can see that this is
1766000	1768000	the
1768000	1770000	distribution here.
1770000	1772000	And when we increase
1772000	1774000	the bias voltage
1774000	1776000	we're pulling the other side, the barrier down
1776000	1778000	so as you can see here
1778000	1780000	right now the black path is easier
1780000	1782000	the electron can zip through the device
1782000	1784000	and form a current path
1784000	1786000	so right now the blue one is
1786000	1788000	it's still large but
1788000	1790000	compared to the black one it's much smaller
1790000	1792000	so this is on off.
1796000	1798000	So when we include
1798000	1800000	NEGF, when we do
1800000	1802000	non-equilibrium Green's function
1802000	1804000	transport calculation, when we don't
1804000	1806000	have recombination, which current
1806000	1808000	do we get? We get the
1808000	1810000	we don't have
1810000	1812000	the blue line here so we're only getting
1812000	1814000	the black. And if we
1814000	1816000	using this method we're able
1816000	1818000	to include the recombination process
1818000	1820000	which means we get the red line
1820000	1822000	so we're pushing
1822000	1824000	the boundary of NEGF such that
1824000	1826000	we can simulate the device
1826000	1828000	from a black line to a red line
1828000	1830000	which is a really large difference if you look at
1830000	1832000	here and
1832000	1834000	if you look at the
1834000	1836000	before the threshold voltage there's a
1836000	1838000	huge current difference with or without
1838000	1840000	recombination and it
1840000	1842000	also further impact what's the
1842000	1844000	threshold voltage. The threshold voltage means
1844000	1846000	when is your device on
1846000	1848000	or off. So there's a small shift
1848000	1850000	here although on a
1850000	1852000	linear scale but with more recombination
1852000	1854000	the red and
1854000	1856000	also the black line will have a larger
1856000	1858000	shift and therefore a larger impact.
1858000	1860000	So it's really important to
1860000	1862000	include the recombination
1862000	1864000	in your device.
1864000	1866000	Can I ask a question here?
1866000	1868000	Yeah, sure.
1868000	1870000	Can you go back to your previous slide?
1870000	1872000	Yes.
1872000	1874000	Maybe
1874000	1876000	this is a bit stupid but I
1876000	1878000	thought
1878000	1880000	recombination
1880000	1882000	means you have
1882000	1884000	electron hole pair recombine
1884000	1886000	and I thought it will
1886000	1888000	lead to the emission
1888000	1890000	of phonon or emission of photon
1890000	1892000	and usually
1892000	1894000	I would think
1894000	1896000	recombination is bad
1896000	1898000	for the current but here you are saying
1898000	1900000	when you have
1900000	1902000	smaller bias voltage
1902000	1904000	the VT is smaller you
1904000	1906000	actually have higher recombination
1906000	1908000	energy, recombination
1908000	1910000	current. Why does recombination
1910000	1912000	contribute to a current?
1912000	1914000	To a current?
1914000	1916000	Or a current?
1916000	1918000	So there are different
1918000	1920000	recombination process, right? There's like
1920000	1922000	I mentioned like there's a
1922000	1924000	there's radiative recombination
1924000	1926000	and there's OJ recombination.
1926000	1928000	So they are all
1928000	1930000	the consequence of electron hole.
1930000	1932000	I mean OJ
1932000	1934000	is the radiative
1934000	1936000	in the shock wave hole is one electron one hole
1936000	1938000	and they disappear.
1938000	1940000	And the shock wave hole is
1940000	1942000	you emit heat.
1942000	1944000	Yeah, phonons.
1944000	1946000	And the radiative is like you emit
1946000	1948000	photon. And OJ
1948000	1950000	is like you kick another carrier
1950000	1952000	to a higher energy, right? So it's useless
1952000	1954000	too, right? So
1954000	1956000	not all. Okay, so wait, your question
1956000	1958000	is, but here
1958000	1960000	is showing the recombination is
1960000	1962000	the blue line here, right? So when
1962000	1964000	your lower VT is lower, when your
1964000	1966000	higher VT it's
1966000	1968000	higher.
1968000	1970000	But, sorry, what
1970000	1972000	was your question? My question is
1972000	1974000	I, okay, I
1974000	1976000	thought recombination
1976000	1978000	is bad for your, for the current.
1980000	1982000	Why?
1982000	1984000	It's bad because
1984000	1986000	it's
1986000	1988000	I think some, well
1988000	1990000	bad is kind of like a subjective, right?
1990000	1992000	I would call it bad if
1992000	1994000	I would call it
1994000	1996000	this is a bad device if most of your
1996000	1998000	recombination happens for
1998000	2000000	happen in the way, the shock wave hole way
2000000	2002000	or OJ, right? So the black
2002000	2004000	and the red is bad because they don't
2004000	2006000	produce photon, you don't
2006000	2008000	produce light, then why are you
2008000	2010000	recombining? So I think
2010000	2012000	bad is, okay, it depends
2012000	2014000	on which process you are
2014000	2016000	looking at, right? I think
2016000	2018000	the blue one is good because
2018000	2020000	I see, I see, because you want a photon
2020000	2022000	going, I see. Yeah.
2022000	2024000	Okay. Yes, yes.
2024000	2026000	Okay, and the relation between
2026000	2028000	okay, maybe this is
2028000	2030000	a bit specific, like OJ one
2030000	2032000	the radiative one and
2032000	2034000	the phonon one
2034000	2036000	black, blue, and red.
2036000	2038000	Are they always in this order?
2038000	2040000	Won't they cross
2040000	2042000	at some point if you have different lengths
2042000	2044000	of the, I think
2044000	2046000	this X means the size of your
2046000	2048000	Yeah, because it looks like
2048000	2050000	they always have red, blue, and black.
2050000	2052000	Do they ever
2052000	2054000	cross at some point?
2054000	2056000	I think I was showing
2056000	2058000	the interesting
2058000	2060000	question because I was showing
2060000	2062000	previously
2062000	2064000	they have different
2064000	2066000	relationship, right? So
2066000	2068000	this is an ABC model
2068000	2070000	where the
2070000	2072000	shock wave we hold there is proportional to
2072000	2074000	n plus p, and the radiative
2074000	2076000	is n and p, and then
2076000	2078000	the rate is proportional to n
2078000	2080000	squared p. So
2080000	2082000	I think if you engineer it
2082000	2084000	smartly, you can
2084000	2086000	control which one dominates.
2086000	2088000	But somehow in this scenario
2088000	2090000	the red one is always larger
2090000	2092000	but if you look at the equation here
2092000	2094000	it's n squared p
2094000	2096000	so if you make the p much
2096000	2098000	smaller, right now it's equally large
2098000	2100000	n and p are super large both in here
2100000	2102000	but the real device
2102000	2104000	I think is more complicated
2104000	2106000	and maybe in some
2106000	2108000	way, smart way, you can
2108000	2110000	shrink, make the blue
2110000	2112000	dominant and the other two
2112000	2114000	because relatively they are different, right?
2114000	2116000	In this case
2116000	2118000	the red are closer to blue
2118000	2120000	but here you can see that
2120000	2122000	the red and blue is farther away
2122000	2124000	or yeah
2124000	2126000	I think
2126000	2128000	there's some way
2128000	2130000	we can engineer it to make it
2130000	2132000	some area the blue one
2132000	2134000	will dominate, yeah.
2140000	2142000	Is there any other questions?
2142000	2144000	I have a question here.
2146000	2148000	So I guess
2148000	2150000	this case is simple enough
2150000	2152000	I guess this is probably
2152000	2154000	just your test case
2154000	2156000	but this case is simple enough
2156000	2158000	that you can also use semi-classical
2158000	2160000	way to do a simulation
2160000	2162000	so I'm just wondering
2162000	2164000	how do they compare?
2164000	2166000	So that's my next topic
2166000	2168000	it's like comparing on
2168000	2170000	this really small structure and then
2170000	2172000	we are using a semi-classical way and also
2172000	2174000	a quantum way to compute
2174000	2176000	and then I will show some comparison
2176000	2178000	here so I think that's the
2178000	2180000	that will answer your question.
2180000	2182000	Okay, great, yeah.
2182000	2184000	So the next one as the question has
2184000	2186000	elevated us
2186000	2188000	to this point, so I'm going
2188000	2190000	to talk about the comparison between the two, semi-classical
2190000	2192000	and quantum
2192000	2194000	and how do we compare, how do we make a fair comparison
2194000	2196000	yes, that's an important question
2196000	2198000	is that we use the same still
2198000	2200000	the same small, like the structure I was
2200000	2202000	showing here is like 20 nanometer
2202000	2204000	so it's a super tiny structure
2204000	2206000	and then I'm going to apply
2206000	2208000	semi-classical method, a drip
2208000	2210000	diffusion one and also
2212000	2214000	for the quantum way I'm using
2214000	2216000	this new method, the butycoprobe
2216000	2218000	with recombinant generation method
2218000	2220000	which is the tool our lab
2220000	2222000	used to work on in grad school
2222000	2224000	so if you guys are interested in applying for our group
2224000	2226000	email me and I can give
2226000	2228000	you more information
2228000	2230000	so how do we compare this
2230000	2232000	is that in all the transport
2232000	2234000	simulation
2236000	2238000	we're decoupling the transport part
2238000	2240000	with the part, like
2240000	2242000	electrostatic part, so we usually do a
2242000	2244000	self-consistent, we solve for the
2244000	2246000	where's the electron holes and given
2246000	2248000	the electron holes and they have charge
2248000	2250000	and therefore they will form a potential
2250000	2252000	so we will feed back the carrier
2252000	2254000	transport and plug it into Poisson
2254000	2256000	and get a potential and like doing this
2256000	2258000	like a hundred times or whatever
2258000	2260000	it's converging, so it's like self-consistently
2260000	2262000	solving, decouple the two
2262000	2264000	and solve the Poisson
2264000	2266000	and just keep on doing until it doesn't
2266000	2268000	change anymore and then we declare
2268000	2270000	this simulation is finished
2270000	2272000	it's converged
2272000	2274000	so to compare
2274000	2276000	it's easy because we can
2276000	2278000	just focus on this part and then for the
2278000	2280000	carrier we can choose to use
2280000	2282000	NEGF or we can choose the
2282000	2284000	semi-classical way of doing it
2284000	2286000	and when doing the semi-classical way
2286000	2288000	we also choose to
2288000	2290000	because Drift Diffusion, to solve these problems
2290000	2292000	they usually have another quantum correction model
2292000	2294000	where they are solving just
2294000	2296000	a confined Schrodinger
2296000	2298000	but NEGF is more like an open boundary
2298000	2300000	open boundary Schrodinger
2300000	2302000	equation, but like
2302000	2304000	for semi-classical
2304000	2306000	people, they usually will
2306000	2308000	couple it with a quantum correction method
2308000	2310000	which is solving Schrodinger
2310000	2312000	inside an infinite
2312000	2314000	quantum
2314000	2316000	so they will have boundary, but solving Schrodinger
2316000	2318000	only in that region and try to couple them
2318000	2320000	together
2320000	2322000	so the question to answer is
2322000	2324000	how do we
2324000	2326000	compare the quantum and semi-classical models
2328000	2330000	and here is
2330000	2332000	more of like showing
2334000	2336000	so the left side is using
2336000	2338000	the NEGF where
2338000	2340000	we will have a band structure, right?
2340000	2342000	we will have the band gap of
2342000	2344000	I think this is around
2344000	2346000	0.4 to
2346000	2348000	so galenitride is like 3.4
2348000	2350000	electron volts, and inside here
2350000	2352000	there is like a quantum well
2352000	2354000	so the actual
2354000	2356000	will be galenitride
2356000	2358000	and we assume that it is doped with 1E20
2358000	2360000	and there is like a region of galenitride
2360000	2362000	and that will have a smaller band gap
2362000	2364000	and also the galenitride, and this is like
2364000	2366000	the structure we are looking into
2366000	2368000	and in NEGF
2368000	2370000	we will provide like a
2370000	2372000	total energy
2372000	2374000	so the y-axis is the energy range
2374000	2376000	so you know
2376000	2378000	here are some states that can be
2378000	2380000	so here the color means like the density
2380000	2382000	of states, means like the carrier
2382000	2384000	can have a possibility to go in
2384000	2386000	there, but there is some portion of it
2386000	2388000	like brighter, which means
2388000	2390000	because of the interference, carrier
2390000	2392000	doesn't have a
2392000	2394000	even if you have carrier, it cannot go in
2394000	2396000	here, so that's what the density of states
2396000	2398000	means
2398000	2400000	the NEGF we can provide
2400000	2402000	is non-equilibrium throughout the entire
2402000	2404000	device, which means the carrier
2404000	2406000	doesn't have to follow Fermi-Dirac
2406000	2408000	distribution everywhere
2408000	2410000	also we can see that the states
2410000	2412000	is broadened, so because
2412000	2414000	you are in contact with the
2414000	2416000	external source, therefore
2416000	2418000	the state is broadened
2418000	2420000	otherwise, if you solve
2420000	2422000	this in the Schrodinger equation
2422000	2424000	it's going to be confined
2424000	2426000	like a
2426000	2428000	the states is like, you know, it's not
2428000	2430000	broadened, but here we can see that
2430000	2432000	for example, quantum well here, it's not a
2432000	2434000	compared to Schrodinger equation
2434000	2436000	it's a fixed energy level, because
2436000	2438000	you are in contact with the surrounding
2438000	2440000	therefore there is a peak here
2440000	2442000	and for the drift diffusion
2442000	2444000	we can see that
2444000	2446000	here
2446000	2448000	drift diffusion
2448000	2450000	equation assume that
2450000	2452000	in everywhere there is a Fermi
2452000	2454000	energy, right, and for this Fermi energy
2454000	2456000	follows the Fermi distribution
2456000	2458000	which means the carrier will
2458000	2460000	be Fermi distribution everywhere
2460000	2462000	with different Fermi energy
2462000	2464000	and also
2464000	2466000	we are solving the quantum
2466000	2468000	using this Q-well method
2468000	2470000	in ATLAS, which is solving Schrodinger equation
2470000	2472000	here, so that's why we can have this
2472000	2474000	red wave function
2474000	2476000	square here, so that's the wave function
2476000	2478000	form, and how is it solved? It's by solving
2478000	2480000	Schrodinger equation only in this
2480000	2482000	region, so we are defining
2482000	2484000	a region where we want to solve this
2484000	2486000	closed boundary Schrodinger
2486000	2488000	equation, and we are trying to couple this
2488000	2490000	to the drift diffusion methods
2490000	2492000	and there is like several parameters
2492000	2494000	for example, in a drift diffusion
2494000	2496000	you have ABC
2496000	2498000	parameters for the recombination
2498000	2500000	like the circularity hole, the phonon
2500000	2502000	the photon, and also the
2502000	2504000	other ones, the OJ, so there is
2504000	2506000	like the parameters for it, and we are using the same ABC
2506000	2508000	and
2508000	2510000	in drift diffusion, there is like a mobility
2510000	2512000	term, where for
2512000	2514000	NEGF is called self-energy, which is
2514000	2516000	the scattering rates
2516000	2518000	in the device, and that will, in a
2518000	2520000	semi-classical way, that's called the mobility
2520000	2522000	so we need to find
2522000	2524000	a corresponding, oh given this mu
2524000	2526000	what's the scattering rate in the device
2526000	2528000	and therefore what's the self-energy we are using
2528000	2530000	in NEGF, and
2530000	2532000	for drift diffusion
2532000	2534000	when you are, there is a density of
2534000	2536000	states, and you are assuming
2536000	2538000	you will
2538000	2540000	get a carrier, so there is
2540000	2542000	for different M
2542000	2544000	for different effective mass, you
2544000	2546000	correspond to different density of states, and therefore
2546000	2548000	carrier, for
2548000	2550000	NEGF we are using
2550000	2552000	we can support tight binding
2552000	2554000	different way
2554000	2556000	to describe this EK
2556000	2558000	relationship, so
2558000	2560000	that's the corresponding, right
2560000	2562000	we can also use effective mass, or we can use
2562000	2564000	tight binding method, or KRP, or
2564000	2566000	one-year functions
2566000	2568000	so the basis
2568000	2570000	there is a little bit different, in drift diffusion we can only support
2570000	2572000	so this is how we
2572000	2574000	couple them
2574000	2576000	so
2576000	2578000	I'm only going to show that
2578000	2580000	the direct comparison
2580000	2582000	from observable we can see
2582000	2584000	so for example, on the right side
2584000	2586000	this is showing
2586000	2588000	the solid line is the drift diffusion
2588000	2590000	result, and you can see that
2590000	2592000	this is the carrier density across the device
2592000	2594000	we have high electron on one side
2594000	2596000	and we have high hole on the other side
2596000	2598000	and they are penetrating into each
2598000	2600000	into the other side
2600000	2602000	and we can see that the drift diffusion
2602000	2604000	here is much lower
2604000	2606000	this is log scale, so it's like
2606000	2608000	ten to the fifth, the five times
2608000	2610000	smaller than the
2610000	2612000	quantum transports method, right
2612000	2614000	and the reason is
2614000	2616000	understandable, because
2616000	2618000	when you look into here
2618000	2620000	the electron, you know
2620000	2622000	the NEGF, you can
2622000	2624000	what is it like, the
2624000	2626000	when you bounce a ball to the wall, the semi-classical will bounce
2626000	2628000	back, but quantum
2628000	2630000	you can penetrate into the wall, right
2630000	2632000	so you can see that analogy here
2632000	2634000	where you still have some density
2634000	2636000	of states inside the barrier
2636000	2638000	where the semi-classical will just say
2638000	2640000	there's nothing, you bounce
2640000	2642000	into this wall and you will go back directly
2642000	2644000	so this is like the ball analogy
2644000	2646000	so that's why
2646000	2648000	when you're doing quantum transport
2648000	2650000	this carrier inside
2650000	2652000	here is higher, much higher
2652000	2654000	ten to the fifth time higher because of the
2654000	2656000	penetration here
2656000	2658000	but otherwise
2658000	2660000	the potential is pretty
2660000	2662000	matched here, but the carrier
2662000	2664000	difference here will cause you
2664000	2666000	to calculate the
2666000	2668000	recombination rate different, right
2668000	2670000	because you have higher density, therefore your
2670000	2672000	recombination rate will be
2672000	2674000	different, so that's why
2674000	2676000	the potential looks
2676000	2678000	the same between quantum way
2678000	2680000	and semi-classical way, however
2680000	2682000	the recombination rate calculated from
2682000	2684000	which is a post-process
2684000	2686000	using ABC model to predict
2686000	2688000	oh, what's the OJ
2688000	2690000	the photon and also the OJ related
2690000	2692000	process, there's a huge difference
2692000	2694000	at lower bias, you can see here
2694000	2696000	the quantum way
2696000	2698000	because you have more penetrated electrons
2698000	2700000	for them to recombine
2700000	2702000	therefore you have a much higher recombination rate
2702000	2704000	and for higher bias
2704000	2706000	they're pretty much similar
2706000	2708000	but small difference here
2708000	2710000	okay
2710000	2712000	and this case
2712000	2714000	before I was talking about a HOMO
2714000	2716000	junction where we're using
2716000	2718000	galenitride all across but with
2718000	2720000	different doping, and here is a heterojunction
2720000	2722000	where similar things
2722000	2724000	are done, we're comparing
2724000	2726000	the carrier
2726000	2728000	density and we can see that oh, there's
2728000	2730000	some difference here
2730000	2732000	right, like the semi-classical
2732000	2734000	we have a sharp discontinuity
2734000	2736000	probably because we chose
2736000	2738000	the boundary different but
2738000	2740000	which part should we solve Schrodinger
2740000	2742000	it's pretty subjective
2742000	2744000	so I'm putting
2744000	2746000	all the things here and seeing
2746000	2748000	that there is an impact
2748000	2750000	like with or without
2750000	2752000	diffusion like, or any
2752000	2754000	like what's the impact on carrier density
2756000	2758000	and here
2758000	2760000	trying to show the recombination with
2760000	2762000	in this heterojunction, we can also see that
2762000	2764000	because
2764000	2766000	drift diffusion coupled with
2766000	2768000	Schrodinger equation, therefore
2768000	2770000	we can see that the recombination rate after
2770000	2772000	doing this is pretty similar
2772000	2774000	so
2774000	2776000	I think this is like a
2776000	2778000	positive side about drift diffusion, it's pretty fast
2778000	2780000	and with coupling to like quantum
2780000	2782000	correction, it's matching
2782000	2784000	GF pretty well, so it's like
2784000	2786000	also kind of giving confidence but also giving
2786000	2788000	saying like oh, drift diffusion is not that bad
2788000	2790000	like you can still
2790000	2792000	quantumly correct it
2792000	2794000	with solving Schrodinger impartial
2794000	2796000	region
2796000	2798000	and here I'm trying
2798000	2800000	to show the I-V difference
2800000	2802000	for a homojunction device
2802000	2804000	so in a homojunction device, if you
2804000	2806000	measure the I-V curve, and here
2806000	2808000	the solid line is the drift diffusion, and the circle
2808000	2810000	is the quantum well, and we can see
2810000	2812000	that
2812000	2814000	the off current
2814000	2816000	there's like a larger difference
2816000	2818000	between them, and if you
2818000	2820000	have, if you compare the
2820000	2822000	heterojunction device using the
2822000	2824000	and there's some difference here
2824000	2826000	and there, but just like
2826000	2828000	providing the comparison here
2828000	2830000	and this
2830000	2832000	method, we can further
2832000	2834000	you know, solving, we're
2834000	2836000	enabling any GF to be able to
2836000	2838000	solve like
2838000	2840000	carrier generation, because we are
2840000	2842000	injecting the, we can
2842000	2844000	assume the light come in and
2844000	2846000	producing electron hole and
2846000	2848000	and give them, separate them
2848000	2850000	to generate current here, right?
2850000	2852000	So here's the simulation results like
2852000	2854000	using any GF, and this is like the
2854000	2856000	the first
2856000	2858000	the first tool that we can cover
2858000	2860000	all processes into, including
2860000	2862000	generation, and then to enable a device
2862000	2864000	simulation
2864000	2866000	So here
2866000	2868000	the summary, I kind of review
2868000	2870000	different carrier transport method
2870000	2872000	from BTE all the way to any
2872000	2874000	GF, and providing the references there
2874000	2876000	if you're interested, or can ask, email me
2876000	2878000	for more information, and this
2878000	2880000	is like, this work is to propose
2880000	2882000	a really generic
2882000	2884000	method for recombination
2884000	2886000	generation process inside the
2886000	2888000	any GF framework, so we're enabling
2888000	2890000	any GF community to
2890000	2892000	approach problem like recombination
2892000	2894000	generation, and we
2894000	2896000	show the importance, oh, for any GF
2896000	2898000	with or without recombination, what's the
2898000	2900000	difference, and why do we need it, and we
2900000	2902000	also benchmark against like GF diffusion
2902000	2904000	based TCAD tool, and to
2904000	2906000	see that, we can see that the charge is different
2906000	2908000	and with or without methods, and
2908000	2910000	also we can show that there's
2910000	2912000	tunneling and wave phenomena here
2912000	2914000	and I know
2914000	2916000	and lastly, if there's any
2916000	2918000	study group, or
2918000	2920000	want to discuss this, I think
2920000	2922000	it's very helpful to discuss
2922000	2924000	if you have any questions
2924000	2926000	or any questions
2926000	2928000	about this, you can email me
2928000	2930000	yeah, okay
2932000	2934000	is everyone still here?
2934000	2936000	okay, still here, so let's
2936000	2938000	first,
2938000	2940000	everyone please turn on the mic
2940000	2942000	to applaud, and thank the audience
2946000	2948000	so now,
2948000	2950000	do we have any questions?
2950000	2952000	that you want to ask
2952000	2954000	do we have any questions?
2956000	2958000	if you have questions,
2958000	2960000	just turn on the mic
2960000	2962000	okay
2962000	2964000	okay, I want to ask
2964000	2966000	a question that's not
2966000	2968000	that related
2968000	2970000	I'm curious
2970000	2972000	how long have you been at Intel?
2972000	2974000	about
2974000	2976000	a year
2976000	2978000	so
2978000	2980000	do you need
2980000	2982000	when you're doing these simulations
2982000	2984000	do you need to
2984000	2986000	communicate with the people doing the experiments?
2986000	2988000	some people
2988000	2990000	some people
2990000	2992000	this isn't my Intel work, this is my study group's work
2992000	2994000	and Intel
2994000	2996000	yeah, I think
2996000	2998000	they'll communicate with
2998000	3000000	the people doing the experiments
3000000	3002000	for example, they have some data
3002000	3004000	you take this
3004000	3006000	simulation
3006000	3008000	when you're taking these
3008000	3010000	when you're explaining these simulations
3010000	3012000	and communicating with the people doing the experiments
3012000	3014000	do you feel like
3014000	3016000	there's a gap?
3016000	3018000	I think there is
3018000	3020000	but I think they'll
3020000	3022000	draw the problem to
3022000	3024000	yeah, it's not
3024000	3026000	if they're looking for you
3026000	3028000	they might think
3028000	3030000	this might be related
3030000	3032000	so for example
3032000	3034000	like
3034000	3036000	when you're doing these simulations
3036000	3038000	when you're discussing with the people doing the experiments
3040000	3042000	can you compare with the people doing the experiments?
3042000	3044000	or are there some
3044000	3046000	trends
3046000	3048000	when you're explaining the experiments
3048000	3050000	how do you
3050000	3052000	when you're discussing with the people doing the experiments
3052000	3054000	how do you
3054000	3056000	how do you
3056000	3058000	work with the people doing the experiments?
3058000	3060000	it's a bit abstract, I don't know how to explain it
3060000	3062000	for example
3062000	3064000	can you use these tools
3064000	3066000	to explain their data?
3066000	3068000	or can you provide
3068000	3070000	based on this data
3070000	3072000	maybe an improved direction
3072000	3074000	is this doable?
3074000	3076000	that kind of feeling
3076000	3078000	sorry, it's a bit abstract
3078000	3080000	I think it is
3080000	3082000	let me use Boban as an example
3082000	3084000	Boban's project
3084000	3086000	people might say
3086000	3088000	is it because of the recombination
3088000	3090000	causing the current to get smaller or more
3090000	3092000	if you make the defects level
3092000	3094000	bigger or smaller
3094000	3096000	I think it's more of a trend
3096000	3098000	if you increase the defects
3098000	3100000	can you see the curve
3100000	3102000	100% match the experiment data
3102000	3104000	but you might say
3104000	3106000	if this phenomenon
3106000	3108000	more defects, will my recombination rate get bigger or smaller?
3108000	3110000	you can experiment
3110000	3112000	experiment and simulate
3112000	3114000	I think a lot of problems
3114000	3116000	are not that
3116000	3118000	you need to model
3118000	3120000	to say it's really this phenomenon
3120000	3122000	you might observe
3122000	3124000	the current getting bigger
3124000	3126000	but you don't know why
3126000	3128000	you might say
3128000	3130000	you can make this adjustment
3130000	3132000	or add stress
3132000	3134000	there are a lot of things you can change
3134000	3136000	in simulation, there are a lot of parameters you can change
3136000	3138000	you might adjust the defects level
3138000	3140000	or adjust
3140000	3142000	all kinds of parameters
3142000	3144000	to confirm
3144000	3146000	I think this feedback
3146000	3148000	is quite important
3148000	3150000	to identify
3150000	3152000	if what you said is right
3152000	3154000	I think you can verify
3154000	3156000	if it's correct
3158000	3160000	another question
3160000	3162000	I know you are talking about
3162000	3164000	what Boban did
3164000	3166000	another question
3166000	3168000	after you joined Intel
3168000	3170000	do you think you are much better than Boban?
3170000	3172000	I think I'm much better
3172000	3174000	I feel
3174000	3176000	much better
3176000	3178000	so actually
3178000	3180000	I think this thing
3180000	3182000	is
3182000	3184000	already
3184000	3186000	considered
3186000	3188000	a simple geometry
3188000	3190000	but it can be
3190000	3192000	considered as a real device
3192000	3194000	quantity
3194000	3196000	after you joined
3196000	3198000	you will find
3198000	3200000	there are a lot of differences
3200000	3202000	it's just
3202000	3204000	the research field is different
3204000	3206000	I think the form
3206000	3208000	is similar
3208000	3210000	you mostly look at the paper
3210000	3212000	and see what model you can use
3212000	3214000	but I feel
3214000	3216000	in Boban's case
3216000	3218000	the professor tells you
3218000	3220000	what to do
3220000	3222000	it's more specific
3222000	3224000	but in the company
3224000	3226000	it's hard to say
3228000	3230000	I want to say
3230000	3232000	I'm also in the TK department
3232000	3234000	I'm working at TSMC
3238000	3240000	I actually
3240000	3242000	know a bit about this field
3242000	3244000	but now
3244000	3246000	maybe I shouldn't ask
3246000	3248000	my problem is
3248000	3250000	when I talk to Boban
3250000	3252000	he always says
3252000	3254000	you are right
3254000	3256000	these things
3256000	3258000	need to be discussed
3258000	3260000	I feel
3260000	3262000	it's hard
3262000	3264000	I don't know if Intel
3264000	3266000	feels the same
3266000	3268000	different companies
3268000	3270000	might have different
3270000	3272000	I won't
3272000	3274000	I won't
3274000	3276000	talk to an experimenter
3276000	3278000	I might talk to an intermediary
3278000	3280000	it's different
3286000	3288000	any other questions?
3292000	3294000	I want to ask
3294000	3296000	the simulation
3296000	3298000	looks simple
3298000	3300000	and
3300000	3302000	it looks like
3302000	3304000	using Boltzmann's
3304000	3306000	equation can be done
3306000	3308000	even though you need
3308000	3310000	some approximations
3310000	3312000	but
3312000	3314000	I'm thinking
3314000	3316000	the advantage of this
3316000	3318000	is it's more effective
3318000	3320000	on more difficult
3320000	3322000	devices
3322000	3324000	but I feel
3324000	3326000	in BTE
3326000	3328000	let's say it's particles
3328000	3330000	if it's particles
3330000	3332000	can you simulate
3332000	3334000	these details?
3334000	3336000	you can't
3336000	3338000	so if it's particles
3338000	3340000	you're missing a lot of details
3340000	3342000	but the result I'm showing
3342000	3344000	is that some drift diffusion
3344000	3346000	is a lot worse
3346000	3348000	some are similar
3348000	3350000	but
3350000	3352000	I mean
3352000	3354000	how do you know your future device
3354000	3356000	when it's particles
3356000	3358000	will you miss
3358000	3360000	some important details
3364000	3366000	I think BTE
3366000	3368000	can't be replaced
3368000	3370000	even in this small device
3370000	3372000	you can't say BTE is correct
3372000	3374000	did you say BTE or drift diffusion?
3374000	3376000	drift diffusion
3376000	3378000	you mean
3378000	3380000	Monte Carlo solve BTE
3380000	3382000	but even so
3382000	3384000	like interference
3384000	3386000	or tunneling
3386000	3388000	BTE
3388000	3390000	you can't figure it out
3390000	3392000	you need a lot of correction models
3392000	3394000	BTE is how to scatter particles
3394000	3396000	you need to calculate
3396000	3398000	you need to add a lot of calculations
3398000	3400000	but NEG
3400000	3402000	you throw the device in
3402000	3404000	the result is
3404000	3406000	low density of state
3406000	3408000	there's a pattern
3408000	3410000	but BTE can't figure it out
3412000	3414000	I see
3414000	3416000	but the pattern you drew
3416000	3418000	is this equilibrium?
3418000	3420000	like
3420000	3422000	this is
3422000	3424000	density of state
3426000	3428000	what do you mean?
3428000	3430000	density of state is
3430000	3432000	density of state under equilibrium
3434000	3436000	density of state and
3436000	3438000	is it equilibrium are separate
3438000	3440000	because density of state
3440000	3442000	doesn't have so many states
3442000	3444000	equilibrium means
3444000	3446000	you have a distribution function
3446000	3448000	Fermi-Dirac distribution
3448000	3450000	the bottom is 1
3450000	3452000	the top is 0
3452000	3454000	so given this density of state
3454000	3456000	you fill the Fermi-Dirac distribution
3456000	3458000	drift diffusion
3458000	3460000	means any device
3460000	3462000	is Fermi-Dirac
3464000	3466000	let me draw
3466000	3468000	let me see
3468000	3470000	which one is better
3470000	3472000	like this
3472000	3474000	drift diffusion
3474000	3476000	you have a Fermi-Level
3476000	3478000	this is Fermi-Level
3478000	3480000	your distribution is
3480000	3482000	this is 1 and this is 0
3482000	3484000	this is distribution
3484000	3486000	0 to 1
3486000	3488000	any position
3488000	3490000	is bound by Fermi-Level
3490000	3492000	Fermi-Level is lower here
3492000	3494000	Fermi-Level is lower here
3494000	3496000	my distribution is like this
3496000	3498000	to here
3498000	3500000	there may be some small changes
3500000	3502000	NEG means
3502000	3504000	carrier distribution
3504000	3506000	any place is not necessarily Fermi-Distribution
3506000	3508000	you are very free
3508000	3510000	particle you want to be higher
3510000	3512000	you want to be lower
3512000	3514000	your distribution may be like this
3514000	3516000	not necessarily Fermi-Distribution
3516000	3518000	but now we are bound by contact
3518000	3520000	in the middle of the device
3520000	3522000	is it
3522000	3524000	how much will the distribution change
3524000	3526000	your carrier is from the left
3526000	3528000	your left is Fermi-Distribution
3528000	3530000	right
3530000	3532000	this is Fermi-Distribution
3532000	3534000	but when your carrier
3534000	3536000	travel to here
3536000	3538000	will you change
3538000	3540000	you bounce around
3540000	3542000	bounce here
3542000	3544000	you may not be Fermi-Distribution
3544000	3546000	this is the advantage of NEG
3546000	3548000	you will not be limited by drift diffusion
3548000	3550000	you are bound
3550000	3552000	you have to distribute like this
3552000	3554000	understand
3558000	3560000	ok
3560000	3562000	any more questions
3564000	3566000	if not
3566000	3568000	I want to ask the last question
3568000	3570000	you are
3570000	3572000	in the second slide
3572000	3574000	you talked about
3574000	3576000	photon absorption
3576000	3578000	your photon absorption
3578000	3580000	is only in the middle
3580000	3582000	in the middle
3582000	3584000	junction
3584000	3586000	or the whole system
3586000	3588000	is affected by photon
3588000	3590000	this is a toy model
3590000	3592000	so I only hit
3592000	3594000	the green area
3594000	3596000	I should be
3596000	3598000	later I will publish another paper
3598000	3600000	but
3600000	3602000	I assume
3602000	3604000	only hit a certain area
3604000	3606000	from here to here
3606000	3608000	plus generation rate
3608000	3610000	how do you
3610000	3612000	deal with photon
3612000	3614000	how do you
3614000	3616000	deal with photon
3616000	3618000	I didn't simulate photon
3618000	3620000	because of photon
3620000	3622000	the electrons and electrons
3622000	3624000	will run out every second
3624000	3626000	so I didn't simulate photon
3626000	3628000	suppose photon is absorbed
3628000	3630000	one photon
3630000	3632000	you just
3632000	3634000	move it up
3634000	3636000	one photon
3636000	3638000	suppose
3638000	3640000	it moves up
3640000	3642000	so I assume
3642000	3644000	this band gap
3644000	3646000	is 3.2eV
3646000	3648000	or
3648000	3650000	I don't know
3650000	3652000	let's say 3eV
3652000	3654000	assume
3654000	3656000	a photon above 3eV
3656000	3658000	comes in
3658000	3660000	you can
3660000	3662000	split carrier hole
3662000	3664000	electron hole pair
3664000	3666000	ok
3666000	3668000	so you assume
3668000	3670000	electron hole pair is split
3670000	3672000	and start
3672000	3674000	simulation
3674000	3676000	ok, got it
3680000	3682000	any questions?
3684000	3686000	if not
3686000	3688000	let's thank
3688000	3690000	Guan Zhong
3690000	3692000	thank you
3692000	3694000	thank you
3694000	3696000	I'll turn off the recording
