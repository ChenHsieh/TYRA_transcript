251000	253000	Okay
253000	255000	So
255000	257000	today's topic
257000	259000	will be discussed
259000	261000	by me and Professor Chen
261000	263000	Before you apply
263000	265000	for a PhD
265000	267000	what can you
267000	269000	consider
269000	271000	and what information
271000	273000	can you use
273000	275000	to help you
275000	277000	decide
277000	279000	whether to
279000	281000	apply for
281000	283000	a PhD program
283000	285000	So
285000	287000	let's start
287000	289000	with the first part
289000	291000	and then
291000	293000	the second part
293000	295000	and then
295000	297000	Professor Chen
297000	299000	Okay
299000	301000	So
301000	303000	all the
303000	305000	audience
305000	307000	are interested
307000	309000	in applying for
309000	311000	a PhD program
311000	313000	If you are
313000	315000	applying for a
315000	317000	master's program
317000	319000	or a
319000	321000	MBA
321000	323000	or any other
323000	325000	major
325000	327000	it may be
327000	329000	a little
329000	331000	different
331000	333000	So
333000	335000	let me
335000	337000	introduce myself
337000	339000	My name is
339000	341000	Chen
341000	343000	I am a
343000	345000	PhD student
345000	347000	and I am
347000	349000	currently studying
349000	351000	at the
351000	353000	University of
353000	355000	San Francisco
355000	357000	and I am
357000	359000	currently studying
359000	361000	at the
361000	363000	University of San Francisco
363000	365000	In the
365000	367000	US, there is
367000	369000	no salary cap
369000	371000	In the academic world
371000	373000	In Canada,
373000	375000	it is more like
375000	377000	the US
377000	379000	but in many
379000	381000	European and American
381000	383000	countries
383000	385000	there is no
385000	387000	fixed salary
387000	389000	This is a
389000	391000	very important
391000	393000	part of
393000	395000	your career
395000	397000	For example,
397000	399000	the vaccine against
399000	401000	COVID-19
401000	403000	is a very important
403000	405000	part of your
405000	407000	career
407000	409000	I hope that
409000	411000	you can find
411000	413000	a better training
413000	415000	and a better
415000	417000	way of teaching
417000	419000	I hope that
419000	421000	you can
421000	423000	learn about leadership
423000	425000	In addition to teaching
425000	427000	and research, you can
427000	429000	develop your own
429000	431000	career
431000	433000	I hope that
433000	435000	you can
435000	437000	develop your own
437000	439000	career
439000	441000	I hope that
441000	443000	you can
443000	445000	develop your own
445000	447000	career
477000	479000	Thank you
507000	509000	I'm going to let them know
509000	511000	We're about to start
511000	513000	Is it this one?
513000	515000	Yes
515000	521000	Okay, so tell me if you still have a problem
521000	525000	Anyway, I hope I made myself clear
525000	529000	The point is, this is a soft voice
529000	531000	But
531000	533000	Can you follow me?
533000	535000	Yes
535000	537000	Okay
537000	539000	Another one
539000	541000	Future direction
541000	543000	Future direction
543000	545000	Let's start with this
545000	547000	What can you do in the future?
547000	549000	I'm talking about social science
549000	551000	In social science, of course, you can go a long way
551000	553000	Social science is, of course
553000	555000	Except for academic position
555000	557000	For example, research university
557000	559000	Research type R1, R2
559000	561000	Teaching type university
561000	563000	The so-called Boya College
563000	565000	Or community college
565000	567000	Some people even do tenure track
567000	569000	Non-tenure track job
569000	571000	Or even in college
571000	573000	Some are research jobs
573000	575000	Not so-called teaching
575000	577000	But it's a pure research job
577000	579000	Some term faculty
579000	581000	Not tenure track
581000	583000	In Taiwan
583000	585000	The concept of so-called professional assistant
585000	587000	Or there is a visiting professor
587000	589000	Visiting students
589000	591000	This teacher is also relatively
591000	593000	Temporary
593000	595000	Actual position
595000	597000	It's more like Taiwan's part-time
597000	599000	Teaching one or two classes
599000	601000	There is a part-time job in the academic world
601000	603000	Of course there are more
603000	605000	But I'm roughly like this
605000	607000	There are also other people who want to say
607000	609000	I don't want to do academic work
609000	611000	Some of my students say
611000	613000	I'm not interested in pure academic work
613000	615000	But I hope to change the world
615000	617000	Or I hope to be able to
617000	619000	They may go to the library
619000	621000	Some students or friends
621000	623000	Work in government agencies
623000	625000	Whether it's the local government or the federal government
625000	627000	Like me
627000	629000	National Institute of Justice
629000	631000	FBI
631000	633000	Or local police
633000	635000	Of course this part
635000	637000	It depends on your identity
637000	639000	Especially in the United States
639000	641000	For government work
641000	643000	A lot of people ask
643000	645000	You are at least a green card or a citizen
645000	647000	This is a way out
647000	649000	Of course there are some non-research institutions
649000	651000	Or some organizations
651000	653000	For example, some people want to go
653000	655000	For example, criminal protection
655000	657000	Related organizations
657000	659000	Or even anti-human trafficking
659000	661000	Anti-population transmission
661000	663000	Like I have a lot of students
663000	665000	In some different agencies
665000	667000	But there is one thing
667000	669000	I want to talk about
669000	671000	So much good
671000	673000	But also consider
673000	675000	Sometimes looking for a job after graduation
675000	677000	Get a doctor's degree
677000	679000	Does it help you find a job?
679000	681000	This thing
681000	683000	It's not necessarily
683000	685000	Why do you say that
685000	687000	You may have to look at your future work
687000	689000	Standards for the degree you need
689000	691000	Sometimes people work
691000	693000	Especially if you are not in the academic world
693000	695000	If you work in the industry
695000	697000	They are also worried about one thing
697000	699000	Overqualification
699000	701000	You have a doctor's degree
701000	703000	But they only need a master's degree
703000	705000	At least in Europe and the United States
705000	707000	Sometimes they don't want you to have a master's degree
707000	709000	To find a job
709000	711000	Because on the one hand
711000	713000	It's a part of the salary
713000	715000	On the other hand
715000	717000	I think it's a waste of money
717000	719000	So maybe you can think about it first
719000	721000	What is your future career outlook
721000	723000	And then think about it
723000	725000	This is the way to go
725000	727000	Is it the most suitable way for you
727000	729000	So now
729000	731000	Is Powerpoint moving?
733000	735000	I have it here
735000	737000	OK
737000	739000	This is what I said before
739000	741000	When I was talking to Professor Chen
741000	743000	We are all curious about this
743000	745000	I want to share something with you
745000	747000	Sometimes you come to the doctoral class
747000	749000	Before you need to think about it
749000	751000	Why do you want to come to this doctoral class
751000	753000	Why is this question important
753000	755000	Because it's the doctoral class
755000	757000	It's not like the master's class
757000	759000	One or two years
759000	761000	But when it comes to a doctor
761000	763000	You're looking for a job
763000	765000	People will worry about whether you will be highly educated
765000	767000	And then you read the doctor
767000	769000	For you
769000	771000	Some parts of the field become more open
771000	773000	But the work part
773000	775000	Or some parts
775000	777000	Sometimes it becomes narrower
777000	779000	So you might want to think about it
779000	781000	And the time and money you invest
781000	783000	You can think about it
783000	785000	Why do you want to read this doctoral class
785000	787000	It's because of your family's expectations
787000	789000	Your important others' expectations
789000	791000	People around you keep telling you
791000	793000	You're so smart not to read
793000	795000	It's a pity
795000	797000	It's because of other people's expectations
797000	799000	Even the neighbors
799000	801000	Who is so smart
801000	803000	Why don't you read a doctor
803000	805000	Is it because of this
805000	807000	Or because you want to pursue self-fulfillment
807000	809000	I just like to do research
809000	811000	I think this is my mission
811000	813000	Or you are very enthusiastic about a certain topic
813000	815000	Like I might be a student
815000	817000	Tell me when I was very young
817000	819000	I think this is very important
819000	821000	This is his passion
821000	823000	Then it is very clear
823000	825000	Know which way you want to go
825000	827000	Then this may be a
827000	829000	Your internal motivation may be very important
829000	831000	Or is it possible to read this
831000	833000	I feel like I can do some work after reading the doctor
833000	835000	It seems to be a social status
835000	837000	It seems to feel like
837000	839000	The income will be very stable and high
839000	841000	But it's not like that
841000	843000	Just like we said
843000	845000	Although at least in the United States
845000	847000	But at the same time
847000	849000	That is to say
849000	851000	The distribution is not very uniform
851000	853000	For example, it's not the same job
853000	855000	Your payout will be the same
855000	857000	So you may have to think about this
857000	859000	If you come to read
859000	861000	It's to feel like I'm a few years later
861000	863000	Guaranteed to have a job
863000	865000	Guaranteed to have a good salary
865000	867000	There is no way
867000	869000	So if it's so direct
869000	871000	Or so practical
871000	873000	You may consider
873000	875000	Go to the way
875000	877000	Go to the way you want
877000	879000	Because especially now
879000	881000	Everyone knows that Kobe is more serious
881000	883000	In Taiwan
883000	885000	The same job
885000	887000	A lot of people are fighting
887000	889000	This is more serious in the United States
889000	891000	Like last year, we hired two people
891000	893000	Then we hired two people
893000	895000	I seem to have received about 160 applications
895000	897000	This is for two jobs
897000	899000	So this is actually very competitive now
899000	901000	So you got a doctorate
901000	903000	Guaranteed that you will definitely get a job
903000	905000	So this thing is what you have to think about
905000	907000	What is your motivation
907000	909000	Why did you come to read this thing
909000	911000	Some people say I don't know what to read
911000	913000	Especially Taiwan
913000	915000	I have read
915000	917000	I don't know what to do
917000	919000	Just keep reading
919000	921000	This is also an idea
921000	923000	But maybe at some point
923000	925000	Think about where your enthusiasm for the future is
925000	927000	Like I said here
927000	929000	There is nothing right or wrong
929000	931000	But maybe you have to ask yourself first
931000	933000	What is your goal
933000	935000	What kind of self-achievement do you want to achieve
935000	937000	Another very important thing is
937000	939000	Can you accept
939000	941000	Can you accept
941000	943000	If this
943000	945000	Walking back and forth
945000	947000	The result is not what you imagined
947000	949000	Can you bear such a result
949000	951000	Then these are all
951000	953000	I think these can be thought of first
953000	955000	Not to hit you
955000	957000	Not to make everyone feel that life is very pessimistic
957000	959000	But I think you can think about it first
959000	961000	If there is such a thing
961000	963000	More able to face
963000	965000	When it comes to life
965000	967000	Know that this is just a process
967000	969000	This is a process
969000	971000	You may always kick a little stone on the road
971000	973000	That doesn't mean
973000	975000	What will it be
975000	977000	But maybe think about it first
977000	979000	I know
979000	981000	If you are more determined
981000	983000	I think I can overcome this
983000	985000	But if you don't have a very firm idea
985000	987000	I think I want to retreat
987000	989000	Of course, the other part is
989000	991000	It's more practical to consider
991000	993000	What is the price you need to pay
993000	995000	Time to work hard
995000	997000	Your money can face the future
997000	999000	Uncertainty
999000	1001000	After all, there is a lot of pressure
1001000	1003000	Can you do something good
1003000	1005000	Can you finish reading within a certain period of time
1005000	1007000	Then usually this test is
1007000	1009000	There are often some low self-esteem
1009000	1011000	The concept of low self-esteem
1011000	1013000	Why do you feel
1013000	1015000	I don't seem to read fast
1015000	1017000	My presentation is not good
1017000	1019000	My grades are not good
1019000	1021000	It's easy to become
1021000	1023000	Such a lost comparison
1023000	1025000	And often there are setbacks
1025000	1027000	Your first draft is accepted immediately
1027000	1029000	Then everyone goes to celebrate
1029000	1031000	This time is too little
1031000	1033000	If you get R and R
1033000	1035000	If you can modify it
1035000	1037000	You should put it aside
1037000	1039000	You get the first draft
1039000	1041000	You can see right away
1041000	1043000	Is to face
1043000	1045000	As we said at the beginning
1045000	1047000	Of course there are benefits
1047000	1049000	You can learn some knowledge
1049000	1051000	You have a lot of different life experiences
1051000	1053000	Research experience
1053000	1055000	Then you have some different skills
1055000	1057000	Then your field of vision will be more open
1057000	1059000	You will have some ideas of cross-cultural
1059000	1061000	Even say you can meet some very cool people
1061000	1063000	Great master
1063000	1065000	You used to read in textbooks
1065000	1067000	Maybe next to your office
1067000	1069000	You can talk to him about some research questions
1069000	1071000	But we can't just talk about the good side
1071000	1073000	Then don't talk about that
1073000	1075000	Don't talk about some negative parts
1075000	1077000	Jump to the next part
1077000	1079000	I want to ask
1079000	1081000	Do you want to add here?
1081000	1083000	For students
1083000	1085000	That is to come
1085000	1087000	That is to come
1087000	1089000	Some of the parts I want to add
1091000	1093000	No, I think the teacher said very well
1093000	1095000	Please continue
1095000	1097000	Then I will continue to finish
1097000	1099000	I will leave it to you
1101000	1103000	That is
1103000	1105000	If you want to play this thing
1105000	1107000	Still feel very firm
1107000	1109000	I want to go to the institute
1109000	1111000	Of course the first part is
1111000	1113000	You have to find a school
1113000	1115000	Which school is suitable for you
1115000	1117000	Or I said which school
1117000	1119000	In the institute
1119000	1121000	Doctoral class is more specific
1121000	1123000	It's not the part of the school
1123000	1125000	Which is
1125000	1127000	Which department
1127000	1129000	Is suitable for you
1129000	1131000	So we will put that program
1131000	1133000	At the front
1133000	1135000	I think the program should be compared to the school
1135000	1137000	Is
1137000	1139000	The rank is more priority
1139000	1141000	Because after all
1141000	1143000	No matter how good the school
1143000	1145000	For example, some schools like Harvard
1145000	1147000	Maybe some departments are very good
1147000	1149000	Some departments are not so good
1149000	1151000	So it's not that the better the school, the better the department
1151000	1153000	Then I myself
1153000	1155000	I will put the program
1155000	1157000	Is able to provide
1157000	1159000	Even the ranking program content
1159000	1161000	At the top
1161000	1163000	Then you have to see if this department is suitable for your field of study
1163000	1165000	Is it possible to provide the necessary resources
1165000	1167000	For example
1167000	1169000	Is there a teacher in the department
1169000	1171000	Or the lab is special
1171000	1173000	In the part you want to study
1173000	1175000	Because you have to read the doctor
1175000	1177000	Basically there should be some
1177000	1179000	The field you want to understand
1179000	1181000	But that doesn't mean you can't change it in the future
1181000	1183000	Cross-field or transfer field
1183000	1185000	Because I have transferred to the field
1185000	1187000	But this part needs to be understood first
1187000	1189000	If you are very interested
1189000	1191000	That is to find the program
1191000	1193000	It's important to have a professor you want to work with
1195000	1197000	How to choose a good school
1197000	1199000	Of course
1199000	1201000	Carnegie is the
1201000	1203000	Commission of Higher Education
1203000	1205000	There are R1, R2 and D
1205000	1207000	There are many kinds
1207000	1209000	I only list those who can get a doctorate
1209000	1211000	Of course the first one is
1211000	1213000	R1 is very high
1213000	1215000	Respect
1215000	1217000	Focus
1217000	1219000	On the research part
1219000	1221000	Usually the teacher's teaching burden is relatively low
1221000	1223000	Usually 1,2 or 2,2
1223000	1225000	One semester, one door, one semester, two doors
1225000	1227000	R2
1227000	1229000	Also focus on research
1229000	1231000	But also focus on teaching
1231000	1233000	The teacher's teaching burden here is usually bigger
1233000	1235000	But I still hope
1235000	1237000	The teacher can do a good job
1237000	1239000	But this part becomes
1239000	1241000	Because the teacher's teaching burden is slightly higher
1241000	1243000	So usually it can be divided into research time
1243000	1245000	Not necessarily so much
1245000	1247000	D and P
1247000	1249000	Some professional schools
1249000	1251000	For example
1251000	1253000	For example, the Department of Physical Medicine
1253000	1255000	Or
1255000	1257000	Not reading PhD
1257000	1259000	Psychology
1259000	1261000	That's different
1261000	1263000	This is a more professional degree
1263000	1265000	But be careful
1265000	1267000	If you want to get a professional degree
1267000	1269000	A lot of times
1269000	1271000	They will ask you to get a PhD
1271000	1273000	Not a professional doctor
1273000	1275000	There will be some differences
1275000	1277000	Because the requirements are different
1277000	1279000	The evaluation method is not the same
1279000	1281000	When it comes to choosing a program
1281000	1283000	If the program is similar
1283000	1285000	Still have to look back at the school
1285000	1287000	Because the better the school's ranking
1287000	1289000	The better its resources
1289000	1291000	It usually attracts more
1291000	1293000	Different good students
1293000	1295000	Overall reputation
1295000	1297000	It still helps you in the future
1297000	1299000	So when the program is similar
1299000	1301000	Also consider the school's ranking
1301000	1303000	Then there are some
1303000	1305000	When you are considering
1305000	1307000	Like for me
1307000	1309000	There was a very northern school in New York
1309000	1311000	A very southern school in Florida
1311000	1313000	I thought it was too cold and too hot
1313000	1315000	So I went to Maryland to study
1315000	1317000	This is for you
1317000	1319000	Geographic location is important
1319000	1321000	If you think about going back to Taiwan
1321000	1323000	It's convenient
1323000	1325000	University is also an advantage
1325000	1327000	Not only can you fly directly to Taiwan
1327000	1329000	Another point is
1329000	1331000	Do you need to work
1331000	1333000	Easy to travel
1333000	1335000	The convenience of travel
1335000	1337000	Is also a consideration for you
1337000	1339000	Cost of living
1339000	1341000	Is your living expenses
1341000	1343000	You have to consider
1343000	1345000	Usually there will be scholarship
1345000	1347000	But in a big city
1347000	1349000	General graduate scholarship
1349000	1351000	You can't afford your life
1351000	1353000	Maybe you have to make up for some
1353000	1355000	But if you are in some
1355000	1357000	Lower living expenses
1357000	1359000	Many students I heard
1359000	1361000	You can still save some money
1361000	1363000	So cost of living is also a consideration
1363000	1365000	Opportunity
1365000	1367000	For example, my students
1367000	1369000	In DC
1369000	1371000	We often have some opportunities
1371000	1373000	We will do a state report
1373000	1375000	Report to the members of the state
1375000	1377000	We are in crime prevention policy
1377000	1379000	Research results
1379000	1381000	We have a better chance of getting along with them
1381000	1383000	Or even to be an intern
1383000	1385000	There will be more federal agencies
1385000	1387000	Can do internship
1387000	1389000	Or something
1389000	1391000	Or after graduation
1391000	1393000	Like I have a student
1393000	1395000	Before graduation
1395000	1397000	Because it's close
1397000	1399000	So this opportunity is also the future
1399000	1401000	You may want to consider
1401000	1403000	For example, whether it is a long-term job
1403000	1405000	Or some work experience
1405000	1407000	Opportunity is also important
1407000	1409000	Then there is the climate
1409000	1411000	If the climate is for you
1411000	1413000	Your comfort zone is not so big
1413000	1415000	Or you want to experience a very different life
1415000	1417000	Maybe you will choose
1417000	1419000	Some regions have different climates
1421000	1423000	The other one I want to tell you
1423000	1425000	Usually
1425000	1427000	You are in the doctor's class
1427000	1429000	If you want to find a school
1429000	1431000	Maybe you have to do a little more homework
1431000	1433000	Because if you only look at
1433000	1435000	Some of the schools you know
1435000	1437000	Sometimes you may have a sweat
1437000	1439000	Many good schools
1439000	1441000	Taiwanese may not know
1441000	1443000	Like Vanderbilt, Emory Rice
1443000	1445000	Maybe a lot of people know this school
1445000	1447000	But relative to the so-called
1447000	1449000	Some schools that everyone is familiar with
1449000	1451000	They may not be so famous
1451000	1453000	But they are in the professional field
1453000	1455000	Or even in the United States
1455000	1457000	Very distinguished
1457000	1459000	So just do more homework
1459000	1461000	To understand your own field
1461000	1463000	Instead of being influenced by the ranking of schools
1463000	1465000	Known by Taiwanese
1465000	1467000	Because this may lose
1467000	1469000	Some good opportunities
1469000	1471000	Then the other one is
1471000	1473000	So if you are not familiar with the school
1473000	1475000	How do you know
1475000	1477000	The teachers here are good
1477000	1479000	How to do homework
1479000	1481000	Look at every teacher
1481000	1483000	Research experience
1483000	1485000	Do they have a research plan
1485000	1487000	Or their field of research
1487000	1489000	These are all very important
1489000	1491000	I hope everyone is in
1491000	1493000	These parts have to be considered
1493000	1495000	Which ones do you need
1495000	1497000	To do the assessment
1497000	1499000	OK
1499000	1501000	I'll put this part first
1501000	1503000	Professor Chen
1503000	1505000	Professor Chen, I can help you
1505000	1507000	Let's ask Professor Chen
1507000	1509000	When you have considered all these things
1509000	1511000	When you are ready to apply for a school
1511000	1513000	How do you do this preparation
1513000	1515000	And what needs
1515000	1517000	Professor Chen can also add
1517000	1519000	OK
1519000	1521000	Can you hear me
1521000	1523000	All right
1523000	1525000	So now on the slide
1525000	1527000	Basically you are preparing
1527000	1529000	During the application
1529000	1531000	Will experience several
1531000	1533000	Specific process
1533000	1535000	When everyone was preparing at the beginning
1535000	1537000	First prepare some
1537000	1539000	English test
1539000	1541000	Then when you are ready
1541000	1543000	After the English test
1543000	1545000	It's not bad
1545000	1547000	The second thing is to prepare
1547000	1549000	To find the program you want to apply for
1549000	1551000	Or the school you want to apply for
1551000	1553000	Basically I suggest
1555000	1557000	Don't look too much at once
1557000	1559000	Use 5 plus
1559000	1561000	As a target
1561000	1563000	Find the corresponding information
1563000	1565000	I will give you an example later
1565000	1567000	Can let you see
1567000	1569000	How to go through these processes
1571000	1573000	In the application process
1573000	1575000	You also have to prepare a lot
1575000	1577000	Your
1577000	1579000	Track record document
1579000	1581000	For example, your results
1581000	1583000	For example, your CV preparation
1583000	1585000	At this time
1585000	1587000	I suggest everyone
1587000	1589000	The earlier the better
1589000	1591000	Then there will be a very important
1591000	1593000	Two documents
1593000	1595000	My personal feeling is
1595000	1597000	After being
1597000	1599000	Graduate Search Committee
1599000	1601000	I think
1601000	1603000	When reviewing abroad
1603000	1605000	Review in the United States
1605000	1607000	When studying abroad
1607000	1609000	Your Statement of Purpose
1609000	1611000	With Recognition Letter
1611000	1613000	Are the two most important
1613000	1615000	And the most decisive
1615000	1617000	Document
1617000	1619000	To decide if you will be admitted
1619000	1621000	When you prepare all these documents
1621000	1623000	You can go online
1623000	1625000	Then go online application
1625000	1627000	Basically this process
1627000	1629000	No matter which field you are
1629000	1631000	Will not change much
1631000	1633000	Time
1633000	1635000	The earlier the better
1637000	1639000	If you can come today
1639000	1641000	Project Tara Webinar
1641000	1643000	I believe to some extent
1643000	1645000	You are more
1645000	1647000	You prepare early enough
1647000	1649000	You know where to find some useful information
1649000	1651000	Next slide
1651000	1653000	Next slide
1661000	1663000	Step by step
1663000	1665000	How to prepare
1665000	1667000	Be careful
1667000	1669000	Next slide
1675000	1677000	Because I am a chemistry teacher
1677000	1679000	I am in
1679000	1681000	Houston
1681000	1683000	Use our application
1683000	1685000	To make an example
1685000	1687000	Let everyone know
1687000	1689000	When you want to do this
1689000	1691000	Where to look for information
1691000	1693000	When you identify
1693000	1695000	When you want to apply for a school
1695000	1697000	First to the school
1697000	1699000	Top of the department
1699000	1701000	Basically
1701000	1703000	You will see a
1703000	1705000	PhD Program
1705000	1707000	Then you can click in
1707000	1709000	Now in our department
1709000	1711000	There is a Apply Now
1711000	1713000	If you click in
1713000	1715000	It will tell you
1715000	1717000	All kinds of application information
1717000	1719000	With basic requirements
1719000	1721000	you need
1721000	1723000	Next page
1727000	1729000	After going in
1729000	1731000	Usually some documents
1731000	1733000	You can't do much
1733000	1735000	Modification
1735000	1737000	How are you before
1737000	1739000	Now is the time to arrange
1741000	1743000	The most basic document
1743000	1745000	Includes your
1745000	1747000	University or master's degree
1747000	1749000	Certificate
1749000	1751000	Next is your result sheet
1751000	1753000	Next is your CV
1753000	1755000	These three documents
1755000	1757000	Basically you can't think too much
1757000	1759000	Especially your certificate
1759000	1761000	And the result sheet
1761000	1763000	You only need
1763000	1765000	To go to the school
1765000	1767000	Department
1767000	1769000	Apply for these things
1769000	1771000	After applying
1771000	1773000	You have to spend
1773000	1775000	Some time
1775000	1777000	With the school
1777000	1779000	I believe there are some
1779000	1781000	Help college students write their CV
1781000	1783000	Some institutions
1783000	1785000	At this time
1785000	1787000	I would suggest everyone to look for it
1787000	1789000	And use these resources
1789000	1791000	To write your CV
1791000	1793000	To attract people
1795000	1797000	Basically this thing
1797000	1799000	You can't think too much
1799000	1801000	About your CV
1801000	1803000	If you can make it clear
1803000	1805000	Simple is the best
1805000	1807000	But basically
1807000	1809000	There are not many things you can do
1811000	1813000	Next is your English test
1813000	1815000	English test
1815000	1817000	Basically what everyone sees
1817000	1819000	If you are in the United States
1819000	1821000	Basically
1821000	1823000	One is TOEFL
1823000	1825000	One is GRE
1825000	1827000	More and more schools
1827000	1829000	Especially
1829000	1831000	Research Institute
1831000	1833000	I think
1833000	1835000	People don't look at GRE
1835000	1837000	Many schools include
1837000	1839000	UH
1839000	1841000	Medical Center
1841000	1843000	RISE
1843000	1845000	Basically in the next year
1845000	1847000	They didn't ask for GRE
1847000	1849000	Graduation
1849000	1851000	So I think
1851000	1853000	At this stage
1853000	1855000	I guess more and more schools
1855000	1857000	Provide
1857000	1859000	This kind of convenience
1859000	1861000	This is because
1861000	1863000	Everyone wants to recruit good international students
1863000	1865000	Many international students
1865000	1867000	They look very outstanding in all aspects
1867000	1869000	But on GRE
1869000	1871000	They can't pass the threshold
1871000	1873000	That will cause a lot of sweat
1873000	1875000	In foreign schools
1875000	1877000	If you look at the results of GRE
1877000	1879000	And the performance of students in the course
1879000	1881000	Basically
1881000	1883000	There is no connection
1883000	1885000	So more and more schools are pushing
1885000	1887000	Abolish GRE
1887000	1889000	So
1889000	1891000	If you don't know
1891000	1893000	Do you want to apply for a school
1893000	1895000	GRE is necessary
1895000	1897000	Then I would suggest
1897000	1899000	Go to their website
1899000	1901000	Look at their latest
1901000	1903000	Certificate
1903000	1905000	On the other hand
1905000	1907000	I think GRE is a
1907000	1909000	Very important
1909000	1911000	English test
1911000	1913000	Because
1913000	1915000	If you go to
1915000	1917000	Tier 1 school
1917000	1919000	Basically
1919000	1921000	There will be enough support
1921000	1923000	For students' salary
1923000	1925000	They provide you
1925000	1927000	Financial support
1927000	1929000	Basically ask you to be a TA
1929000	1931000	TA is the so-called
1931000	1933000	Your main job is
1933000	1935000	You must
1935000	1937000	Communicate with
1937000	1939000	Undergraduate students
1939000	1941000	You are a TA
1941000	1943000	You must have good enough
1943000	1945000	English expression ability
1945000	1947000	To help
1947000	1949000	University students study
1949000	1951000	So GRE is usually
1951000	1953000	There is no way
1953000	1955000	Every school
1955000	1957000	Requirements for GRE
1957000	1959000	I think there has been a gradual rise in trends in recent years
1959000	1961000	So when you are preparing
1961000	1963000	I would suggest
1963000	1965000	Put more effort on TOEFL
1965000	1967000	GRE, I think
1967000	1969000	As expected
1969000	1971000	Maybe in the future
1971000	1973000	There will be fewer and fewer schools requiring GRE
1973000	1975000	Next slide
1979000	1981000	OK
1981000	1983000	This is
1983000	1985000	When you enter
1985000	1987000	After entering our website
1987000	1989000	Every school
1989000	1991000	There will be a
1991000	1993000	Frequently asked question
1993000	1995000	The students will
1995000	1997000	Always provide questions
1997000	1999000	Usually in that part
1999000	2001000	You will see
2001000	2003000	The department will provide
2003000	2005000	Very specific standards
2005000	2007000	This is before
2007000	2009000	Revealed on our department website
2009000	2011000	GRE is still a
2011000	2013000	Required document
2013000	2015000	On their
2015000	2017000	On our website
2017000	2019000	It will provide
2019000	2021000	Basically we must meet these requirements
2021000	2023000	For example, how many points do you need for TOEFL
2023000	2025000	How many points do you need for GRE
2025000	2027000	You are qualified
2027000	2029000	Enter
2029000	2031000	Graduate Search Committee to review
2031000	2033000	Otherwise the school will directly
2033000	2035000	Block your file
2035000	2037000	You don't even have the right to be reviewed
2037000	2039000	So
2039000	2041000	Everyone must know when applying
2041000	2043000	Are you in line with these
2043000	2045000	Requirements
2045000	2047000	Otherwise your application will be a mess
2047000	2049000	There is no way to be reviewed
2049000	2051000	Alright
2051000	2053000	Next slide please
2053000	2055000	OK
2055000	2057000	Next we are going to talk about
2057000	2059000	The most important document
2059000	2061000	It's called Statement of Purpose
2061000	2063000	When I was young
2063000	2065000	When applying for school
2065000	2067000	When I was writing the Statement of Purpose
2067000	2069000	I didn't know what to write
2069000	2071000	So I just wrote it
2071000	2073000	When I
2073000	2075000	After so many years
2075000	2077000	As a committee member
2077000	2079000	After so many years
2079000	2081000	I summarized
2081000	2083000	A good Statement of Purpose
2083000	2085000	Should include
2085000	2087000	Several elements
2087000	2089000	The first element
2089000	2091000	I think it's motivation
2091000	2093000	Basically it means
2093000	2095000	Why do you want to apply
2095000	2097000	Your Statement of Purpose
2097000	2099000	The second element
2099000	2101000	You have to
2101000	2103000	Honestly discuss
2103000	2105000	Your GPA
2105000	2107000	The third element
2107000	2109000	You have to discuss
2109000	2111000	Do you have any research experience
2111000	2113000	You can see
2113000	2115000	I wrote leadership
2115000	2117000	Leadership basically means
2117000	2119000	Have you ever
2119000	2121000	Worked with others
2121000	2123000	OK
2123000	2125000	The last one is research interest
2125000	2127000	OK
2127000	2129000	When you apply for school
2129000	2131000	I think research interest
2131000	2133000	Very important
2133000	2135000	Because you have to
2135000	2137000	Log into their website
2137000	2139000	Find your own interesting teacher
2139000	2141000	So every school will be different
2141000	2143000	You can't use the same
2143000	2145000	Statement of Purpose
2145000	2147000	To vote for all schools
2147000	2149000	OK
2149000	2151000	If that's what you plan to do
2151000	2153000	Basically
2153000	2155000	I personally feel
2155000	2157000	It will be lower
2157000	2159000	OK
2159000	2161000	Let's go back to the beginning
2161000	2163000	Let's talk about
2163000	2165000	In these five elements
2165000	2167000	What should you write
2167000	2169000	Like the first one
2169000	2171000	Motivation
2171000	2173000	I think it goes back to what Professor Yang said
2173000	2175000	You have to think carefully
2175000	2177000	Why do you want to take a PhD
2177000	2179000	OK
2179000	2181000	Of course you can't write
2181000	2183000	I just have nothing to do
2183000	2185000	Not a strong
2185000	2187000	Reasoning
2187000	2189000	So everyone
2189000	2191000	Why at the beginning
2191000	2193000	Professor Yang
2193000	2195000	I hope everyone can think about it
2195000	2197000	Why do I want to apply for a PhD
2197000	2199000	OK
2199000	2201000	Because in your Statement of Purpose
2201000	2203000	Basically your beginning
2203000	2205000	Will be a very important element
2205000	2207000	OK
2207000	2209000	The second one I wrote
2209000	2211000	The main reason I wrote this is because
2211000	2213000	When you are in elementary school
2213000	2215000	OK
2215000	2217000	Very few students can be in
2217000	2219000	Keep a good GPA for eight semesters
2219000	2221000	OK
2221000	2223000	I take myself as an example
2223000	2225000	When I was young
2225000	2227000	Especially when I was in freshman year
2227000	2229000	OK
2229000	2231000	I'm not a student who likes to study
2231000	2233000	OK
2233000	2235000	My GPA is very, very bad
2235000	2237000	OK
2237000	2239000	Then
2239000	2241000	It's so bad that I feel
2241000	2243000	If I really wrote it casually at that time
2243000	2245000	I must not apply for school
2245000	2247000	OK
2247000	2249000	If you say
2249000	2251000	If you have a similar situation
2251000	2253000	Maybe in your student life
2253000	2255000	In college life
2255000	2257000	You may have one or two semesters
2257000	2259000	The GPA is very bad
2259000	2261000	Then you have to think carefully
2261000	2263000	To make an explanation
2263000	2265000	Because if you don't make an explanation
2265000	2267000	When the reviewer looks at your CV
2267000	2269000	Look at your SOP
2269000	2271000	I will start to think about it
2271000	2273000	OK, why didn't this student explain
2273000	2275000	Why your grades were not good at that time
2275000	2277000	OK
2277000	2279000	I take myself as an example
2279000	2281000	When I was in college
2281000	2283000	My grades in freshman year
2283000	2285000	In our class is very bad
2285000	2287000	The last class
2287000	2289000	There may be 60 students in our class
2289000	2291000	I may rank around 50
2291000	2293000	My GPA may only be more than 2
2293000	2295000	Yes
2295000	2297000	But when I
2297000	2299000	When I was in senior year
2299000	2301000	And when I was in freshman year
2301000	2303000	I may be the first or second in our class
2303000	2305000	So
2305000	2307000	At that time you will find
2307000	2309000	My case has become a relatively vague case
2309000	2311000	Because when I was discussing my GPA
2311000	2313000	I can say that when I was in freshman year
2313000	2315000	I actually don't know what I want to do
2315000	2317000	OK
2317000	2319000	So I just
2319000	2321000	Find myself to relax
2321000	2323000	OK
2323000	2325000	When I realized that
2325000	2327000	Chemistry is my passion
2327000	2329000	And I decided to be a chemistry teacher
2329000	2331000	Things get wrong
2331000	2333000	Right
2333000	2335000	This situation will be a very positive lead
2335000	2337000	OK
2337000	2339000	When you are discussing your GPA
2339000	2341000	When the reviewer
2341000	2343000	Look at your
2343000	2345000	SOP
2345000	2347000	This is a big plus
2347000	2349000	OK
2349000	2351000	The best idea is that you always
2351000	2353000	If you don't have anything to say
2353000	2355000	That is very excellent
2355000	2357000	In that case, you just need to list
2357000	2359000	What you have won
2359000	2361000	OK
2361000	2363000	But I think GPA is a
2363000	2365000	Everyone must think about it
2365000	2367000	Explain why your GPA looks like this
2367000	2369000	Everyone
2369000	2371000	Put your GPA with what you want to do now
2371000	2373000	That is to apply for Ph.D.
2373000	2375000	To make a link
2375000	2377000	OK
2377000	2379000	What else can help you add points
2379000	2381000	This is the so-called research experience
2381000	2383000	OK
2383000	2385000	Like me
2385000	2387000	I went abroad to study after finishing my master's degree
2387000	2389000	So when I was studying for my master's degree
2389000	2391000	In fact, I have already
2391000	2393000	For many
2393000	2395000	Common scientific instruments
2395000	2397000	Quite familiar
2397000	2399000	There is such a research experience
2399000	2401000	This is a big plus
2401000	2403000	The reason is that the students who apply in the United States
2403000	2405000	They basically
2405000	2407000	Apply for Ph.D. directly from the university
2407000	2409000	Ph.D.
2409000	2411000	This is not popular in foreign countries
2411000	2413000	OK
2413000	2415000	Because they apply for Ph.D. directly from the university
2415000	2417000	So many students actually don't have
2417000	2419000	Enough
2419000	2421000	Scientific training
2421000	2423000	If you say
2423000	2425000	You have done a lot of research
2425000	2427000	Then this time
2427000	2429000	Will be a big plus
2429000	2431000	Then you have to explain
2431000	2433000	What you know
2433000	2435000	To prove
2435000	2437000	That this thing is
2437000	2439000	On scientific training
2439000	2441000	Already have
2441000	2443000	Enough maturity
2443000	2445000	OK
2445000	2447000	So if you have these
2447000	2449000	You have won some awards
2449000	2451000	You do some presentations
2451000	2453000	Or you publish some papers
2453000	2455000	These will be big plus
2455000	2457000	Another point is
2457000	2459000	Leadership
2459000	2461000	This thing is actually
2461000	2463000	Although the United States emphasizes heroism
2463000	2465000	But when we review
2465000	2467000	A Ph.D. student
2467000	2469000	We actually value more
2469000	2471000	Is this student
2471000	2473000	Culturable
2473000	2475000	Is it a talent
2475000	2477000	OK
2477000	2479000	Can he be a team member
2479000	2481000	Can he
2481000	2483000	Cooperate with others
2483000	2485000	Complete a project
2485000	2487000	OK
2487000	2489000	But at the same time have their own unique insights
2489000	2491000	OK
2491000	2493000	It sounds very
2493000	2495000	Contradictory
2495000	2497000	But in the end
2497000	2499000	When you become a Ph.D.
2499000	2501000	You must have so many different characteristics
2501000	2503000	How to write
2503000	2505000	To prove
2505000	2507000	Demonstrate you are a leader
2507000	2509000	The best
2509000	2511000	Example
2511000	2513000	If you say
2513000	2515000	Volunteer experience
2515000	2517000	OK
2517000	2519000	For example, you may go to the hospital
2519000	2521000	Be an intern
2521000	2523000	Interact with people
2523000	2525000	OK
2525000	2527000	What did you do
2527000	2529000	For example
2529000	2531000	Because
2531000	2533000	You care about someone
2533000	2535000	You provide some advice
2535000	2537000	Solve something
2537000	2541000	This will be a good example
2541000	2543000	OK
2543000	2545000	You can think about it
2545000	2547000	Is there a similar example in everyday life
2547000	2549000	If not
2549000	2551000	If your application time is still long
2551000	2553000	Try to find these opportunities
2553000	2555000	So you can write it in your SOP
2555000	2557000	OK
2557000	2559000	The last one
2559000	2561000	I think it is also
2561000	2563000	Very important but also very time-consuming
2563000	2565000	A component
2565000	2567000	You identify
2567000	2569000	Which lab
2569000	2571000	You are interested in
2571000	2573000	Obviously this thing
2573000	2575000	Must be done by every school
2575000	2577000	It will be very tiring
2577000	2579000	So if you do five schools
2579000	2581000	Must look at
2581000	2583000	At least identify 15 faculties
2583000	2585000	But this thing will make your
2585000	2587000	SOP
2587000	2589000	Very attractive
2589000	2591000	OK
2591000	2593000	Especially when
2593000	2595000	The teacher you like
2595000	2597000	Is their department
2597000	2599000	Decide who can
2599000	2601000	Admit
2601000	2603000	Can decide
2603000	2605000	This time
2605000	2607000	It will be very very powerful
2607000	2609000	OK
2609000	2611000	So I would suggest
2611000	2613000	Don't be lazy
2613000	2615000	Don't feel tired
2615000	2617000	Really just put
2617000	2619000	The teacher in the department
2619000	2621000	Find three
2621000	2623000	Now basically every teacher
2623000	2625000	Have their own website
2625000	2627000	So everyone just go in and take a look
2627000	2629000	I suggest you take a look at their latest paper
2629000	2631000	Don't find a paper
2631000	2633000	If you are going to do
2633000	2635000	One of these things
2635000	2637000	I would suggest not to do this
2637000	2639000	Because the research ten years ago
2639000	2641000	It will be very different now
2641000	2643000	So just read
2643000	2645000	What they wrote on the website
2645000	2647000	Plus this one or two years of paper
2647000	2649000	That's it
2649000	2651000	In this case you will have enough
2651000	2653000	And profound understanding
2653000	2655000	OK
2655000	2657000	And in this case
2657000	2659000	Even that
2659000	2661000	The teacher in the paper is not the teacher you are interested in
2661000	2663000	They are very likely to refer to
2663000	2665000	Those teachers you are interested in
2665000	2667000	If those teachers think you qualify
2667000	2669000	Then you get the admission chance
2669000	2671000	Will be a big expert
2671000	2673000	OK
2673000	2675000	So I think this is the summary
2675000	2677000	These key elements
2677000	2679000	For the study purpose
2679000	2681000	Next slide please
2681000	2683000	OK
2683000	2685000	The last one is the so-called
2685000	2687000	Recommendation letter
2687000	2689000	This thing
2689000	2691000	I think in Taiwan
2691000	2693000	With what I saw in the United States
2693000	2695000	The difference is very, very big
2695000	2697000	OK
2697000	2699000	I think the big reason is because
2699000	2701000	People don't usually talk to teachers
2701000	2703000	Relationship
2703000	2705000	OK
2705000	2707000	So when you are a student
2707000	2709000	Or when I was a student
2709000	2711000	I'm actually very afraid of talking to teachers
2711000	2713000	OK
2713000	2715000	But when you go abroad
2715000	2717000	I think it's a very important document
2717000	2719000	OK
2719000	2721000	In Taiwan, my feeling now is
2721000	2723000	Teachers will teach students to write the draft of the recommendation letter first
2723000	2725000	And then they do some minor modifications
2725000	2727000	OK
2727000	2729000	Usually when students do this
2729000	2731000	Basically
2731000	2733000	May be very close to your deadline
2733000	2735000	OK
2735000	2737000	The teacher basically doesn't know you
2737000	2739000	You may be his student
2739000	2741000	You may perform very well
2741000	2743000	He knows you
2743000	2745000	He doesn't know who you are
2745000	2747000	He doesn't really know who you are
2747000	2749000	He doesn't know what you want to do
2749000	2751000	He doesn't know what is your dream
2751000	2753000	OK
2753000	2755000	In this case
2755000	2757000	You draft the letter yourself
2757000	2759000	And then sign it to the teacher
2759000	2761000	And then the teacher sends it to us for review
2761000	2763000	The most common case is that we see this letter
2763000	2765000	OK
2765000	2767000	This letter
2767000	2769000	Very plain
2769000	2771000	OK
2771000	2773000	And this letter
2773000	2775000	This application document
2775000	2777000	Basically will be put into
2777000	2779000	Secondary pool
2779000	2781000	OK
2781000	2783000	So when you want a recommendation letter
2783000	2785000	You don't want a plain letter
2785000	2787000	That doesn't help you
2787000	2789000	OK
2789000	2791000	Sometimes it actually hurts you
2791000	2793000	OK
2793000	2795000	When we see a letter that says everything
2795000	2797000	But it seems like nothing is said
2797000	2799000	Then we will try to
2799000	2801000	Try to
2801000	2803000	Read between the lines
2803000	2805000	OK
2805000	2807000	When you see a lot
2807000	2809000	When you save about one or two hundred minutes
2809000	2811000	You will know
2811000	2813000	The teacher doesn't really want to recommend you
2813000	2815000	If the teacher doesn't really want to recommend you
2815000	2817000	Then we have to follow the teacher's advice
2817000	2819000	Put you in
2819000	2821000	The category we don't like
2821000	2823000	OK
2823000	2825000	So how do you prepare your recommendation letter?
2825000	2827000	The first is that you have to prepare early
2827000	2829000	How early is early
2829000	2831000	Early until the teacher really knows you
2831000	2833000	OK
2833000	2835000	There are a lot of my students
2835000	2837000	When they are in the second year
2837000	2839000	They start to talk to me
2839000	2841000	Start to discuss with me
2841000	2843000	What they want to do
2843000	2845000	OK
2845000	2847000	When they are in the third or fourth year
2847000	2849000	When they come to ask me for a letter
2849000	2851000	I totally know
2851000	2853000	What are the characteristics of this student
2853000	2855000	OK
2855000	2857000	But there are students
2857000	2859000	Like this
2859000	2861000	I don't know this process
2861000	2863000	What kind of student
2863000	2865000	He may be a month before the application
2865000	2867000	Come to ask me for a letter
2867000	2869000	OK
2869000	2871000	The first one I don't know this student
2871000	2873000	Then the second
2873000	2875000	A month for me
2875000	2877000	For the teacher
2877000	2879000	Generally speaking
2879000	2881000	For the professor
2881000	2883000	A month is a very short time
2885000	2887000	OK
2887000	2889000	For the teacher
2889000	2891000	Because it doesn't match
2891000	2893000	OK
2893000	2895000	So I would suggest you
2895000	2897000	Once you decide to go abroad
2897000	2899000	You can start talking to the teacher
2899000	2901000	OK
2901000	2903000	You need at least three teachers
2903000	2905000	Let them really know you
2905000	2907000	Let them know
2907000	2909000	What kind of student you are
2909000	2911000	What are your strengths
2911000	2913000	When you go to ask for a recommendation letter
2913000	2915000	OK
2915000	2917000	Don't just say
2917000	2919000	Can you help me write a recommendation letter
2919000	2921000	This is actually a very irresponsible approach
2921000	2923000	The more appropriate approach is
2923000	2925000	OK
2925000	2927000	You have prepared your results
2927000	2929000	Prepare your CV
2929000	2931000	Prepare your SOP
2931000	2933000	OK
2933000	2935000	When you prepare all these documents
2935000	2937000	And then talk to the teacher
2937000	2939000	Believe me
2939000	2941000	The teacher will be moved by your sincerity
2941000	2943000	OK
2943000	2945000	Then I would suggest
2945000	2947000	When you really want to start
2947000	2949000	When I want you to help me write a recommendation letter
2949000	2951000	It's best to do it two months in advance
2951000	2953000	OK
2953000	2955000	Basically, these documents must be prepared for the teacher
2955000	2957000	It's possible that your SOP is not fully prepared
2957000	2959000	It doesn't matter
2959000	2961000	Just put a draft
2961000	2963000	OK
2963000	2965000	Let the teacher know
2965000	2967000	What do you think is the highlight of your life
2967000	2969000	When the teacher sees it
2969000	2971000	Once the teacher knows what you are doing
2971000	2973000	Once the teacher knows you
2973000	2975000	The teacher can play freely
2975000	2977000	OK
2977000	2979000	So you have to provide enough information to the teacher
2979000	2981000	Give the teacher enough time
2981000	2983000	OK
2983000	2985000	Of course, the sooner the better
2985000	2987000	OK
2987000	2989000	The other thing is
2989000	2991000	When the teacher agrees to help you write a recommendation letter
2991000	2993000	I would suggest everyone
2993000	2995000	One week before due date
2995000	2997000	If you find that the teacher has not sent out the recommendation letter
2997000	2999000	Give the teacher a reminder
2999000	3001000	OK
3001000	3003000	This is definitely a very appropriate action
3003000	3005000	So don't be shy
3005000	3007000	Think OK
3007000	3009000	I remind the teacher is a disrespectful behavior
3009000	3011000	No, this is a responsible behavior
3011000	3013000	Because the teacher is sometimes too busy
3013000	3015000	He will forget a lot of things
3015000	3017000	OK
3017000	3019000	So don't be shy to remind the teacher
3019000	3021000	I would suggest everyone
3021000	3023000	One week before due date
3023000	3025000	Send a reminder to the teacher
3025000	3027000	OK
3027000	3029000	Next please
3029000	3031000	OK
3031000	3033000	So we just talked about a lot of things
3033000	3035000	Right
3035000	3037000	What makes you stand out
3037000	3039000	OK
3039000	3041000	Usually everyone thinks
3041000	3043000	GPA
3043000	3045000	GRE
3045000	3047000	Of course these things are important
3047000	3049000	OK
3049000	3051000	But I would say the importance of the English test
3051000	3053000	For science students
3053000	3055000	I think the importance is relatively low
3055000	3057000	GPA is important
3057000	3059000	Because GPA is our
3059000	3061000	The first criteria we use
3061000	3063000	To cut off
3063000	3065000	Those not so great students
3065000	3067000	OK
3067000	3069000	So if your GPA is not very good
3069000	3071000	Then you can
3071000	3073000	The only chance you can get
3073000	3075000	Admission
3075000	3077000	It comes from your SOP and your recommendation letters
3077000	3079000	OK
3079000	3081000	If those two are very strong
3081000	3083000	They will compete
3083000	3085000	Your GPA
3085000	3087000	OK
3087000	3089000	SOP is a very very very
3089000	3091000	Important document
3091000	3093000	OK
3093000	3095000	It takes a lot of time to prepare
3095000	3097000	OK
3097000	3099000	Recommendation letter
3099000	3101000	You have to let the teacher know you
3101000	3103000	OK
3103000	3105000	Taiwan's current
3105000	3107000	Taiwan's current atmosphere
3107000	3109000	I don't think it's a very healthy atmosphere
3109000	3111000	Still a lot of
3111000	3113000	Teachers ask students to write
3113000	3115000	Draft
3115000	3117000	This is actually not very good
3117000	3119000	OK
3119000	3121000	I found that very few teachers do this
3121000	3123000	OK
3123000	3125000	All right
3125000	3127000	So I guess
3127000	3129000	OK
3129000	3131000	So I guess
3131000	3133000	Spend time
3133000	3135000	May be much longer than you think
3135000	3137000	Because a lot of preparation
3137000	3139000	In fact, it's not just you
3139000	3141000	OK
3141000	3143000	You need the teacher's support
3143000	3145000	You need time
3145000	3147000	Put some key elements
3147000	3149000	Make it
3149000	3151000	For example, you do research
3151000	3153000	For example, you are an intern
3153000	3155000	These things take time
3155000	3157000	So if you are now
3157000	3159000	If you want to go abroad
3159000	3161000	Now you can probably start slowly
3161000	3163000	Be prepared
3163000	3165000	You won't feel so stressed
3165000	3167000	OK, next
3169000	3171000	OK, this is another
3171000	3173000	I think I agree with Mr. Yang
3173000	3175000	Is also a very
3175000	3177000	Effective way
3177000	3179000	When you find a teacher
3179000	3181000	You really like it
3181000	3183000	Like it so much
3183000	3185000	If you don't go
3185000	3187000	Then I will suggest you
3187000	3189000	Try to contact the professor
3189000	3191000	OK
3191000	3193000	Abroad
3193000	3195000	From time to time
3195000	3197000	There will be students actively
3197000	3199000	Come to contact us
3199000	3201000	This thing is actually very common
3201000	3203000	So when you do this
3203000	3205000	Don't think it's a
3205000	3207000	Very rare
3207000	3209000	Then you shouldn't do it
3209000	3211000	You should think about it
3211000	3213000	This is a
3213000	3215000	Can fully show that you are
3215000	3217000	Actively looking for the right teacher
3217000	3219000	A mode
3219000	3221000	OK
3221000	3223000	When you contact the teacher
3223000	3225000	Pay attention to
3225000	3227000	Make sure
3227000	3229000	Your tone is appropriate
3229000	3231000	OK
3231000	3233000	Then
3233000	3235000	When you
3235000	3237000	When you write to the teacher
3237000	3239000	In your
3239000	3241000	Email
3241000	3243000	Just introduce yourself
3243000	3245000	But remember to attach your SOP
3245000	3247000	Your CV and transcript
3247000	3249000	This way the teacher will know
3249000	3251000	What is the level of this student
3251000	3253000	He will decide
3253000	3255000	Do you want to continue to contact you
3255000	3257000	OK
3257000	3259000	Of course doing this
3259000	3261000	It may be a useful way
3261000	3263000	But it doesn't necessarily guarantee
3263000	3265000	You will get admission
3265000	3267000	OK
3267000	3269000	But I think it's worth a try
3269000	3271000	OK
3271000	3273000	Next
3273000	3275000	OK
3275000	3277000	Financial support
3277000	3279000	This is a very important thing
3279000	3281000	If you want to apply
3281000	3283000	School
3283000	3285000	Belongs to R1
3285000	3287000	If you are a student
3287000	3289000	You don't have to worry about this
3289000	3291000	OK
3291000	3293000	In R1
3293000	3295000	Teachers usually
3295000	3297000	Will ask you to do TA or RA
3297000	3299000	OK
3299000	3301000	I believe this part
3301000	3303000	For R1
3303000	3305000	Not a problem
3305000	3307000	But
3307000	3309000	Social science
3309000	3311000	I believe you have to think about it
3311000	3313000	OK
3313000	3315000	I want to ask Professor Yang
3315000	3317000	To add
3317000	3319000	His thoughts
3319000	3321000	Thank you
3321000	3323000	Professor Chen
3323000	3325000	This thing is basically
3325000	3327000	Like what Professor Chen said
3327000	3329000	The students of the science department
3329000	3331000	Because their resources are more abundant
3331000	3333000	Then the funding is more abundant
3333000	3335000	So in my experience
3335000	3337000	The science department
3337000	3339000	If you are admitted to the doctor's class, you will definitely be paid
3339000	3341000	But social humanities
3341000	3343000	It's not necessarily like this
3343000	3345000	In the economy
3345000	3347000	Especially in the past few years
3347000	3349000	Because of the epidemic
3349000	3351000	In fact, many schools
3351000	3353000	Funds are tight
3353000	3355000	Some schools
3355000	3357000	Will insist
3357000	3359000	For example, a fixed fee
3359000	3361000	In this case
3361000	3363000	Some schools
3363000	3365000	If the number of people does not decrease
3365000	3367000	Or some schools do not have enough funding
3367000	3369000	He might say
3369000	3371000	We will accept you
3371000	3373000	But we do not guarantee your funding
3373000	3375000	Do you want to come
3375000	3377000	Unfortunately, our social humanities
3377000	3379000	Sometimes the funding is not so abundant
3379000	3381000	As I remember a few years ago
3381000	3383000	Our department is now
3383000	3385000	We are in an interesting situation
3385000	3387000	Many teachers in our department are very successful
3387000	3389000	Get all kinds of research funding
3389000	3391000	This is a permanent
3391000	3393000	So permanent
3393000	3395000	If it is a school or department
3395000	3397000	Long-term spending
3397000	3399000	We can write it on the offer letter
3399000	3401000	Tell the student
3401000	3403000	We provide you a few years of funding
3403000	3405000	But we have a plan
3405000	3407000	For example, the three-year plan, the four-year plan
3407000	3409000	Because that plan is so-called non-permanent
3409000	3411000	So we can't write it on the letter
3411000	3413000	We can also contact the student
3413000	3415000	We have this opportunity
3415000	3417000	But we can't write it on the letter
3417000	3419000	For example, our student
3419000	3421000	Older
3421000	3423000	Because he is married and has children
3423000	3425000	I remember he wrote a letter
3425000	3427000	He said
3427000	3429000	You did not guarantee that we have funding
3429000	3431000	Do you know that I have a family and children
3431000	3433000	Don't you make it difficult for me
3433000	3435000	Although you are right
3435000	3437000	It's also very sad
3437000	3439000	Sometimes there is this sad part
3439000	3441000	So I have to say
3441000	3443000	If it's my own student
3443000	3445000	I give my own student advice
3445000	3447000	I think this is very important
3447000	3449000	Even I think this is the most important
3449000	3451000	If there are two or three schools
3451000	3453000	The ranking is almost the same
3453000	3455000	If the other conditions are almost the same
3455000	3457000	Definitely consider going to a school that gives you funding
3457000	3459000	It's not just about money
3459000	3461000	Of course there is funding
3461000	3463000	For you
3463000	3465000	It's been so long
3465000	3467000	Your economic pressure will be much smaller
3467000	3469000	But it's not just about the economy
3469000	3471000	Another one is when you have funding
3471000	3473000	Especially you may have GRA
3473000	3475000	Or fellowship
3475000	3477000	Especially a graduate research assistant
3477000	3479000	It means you will be assigned to a teacher
3479000	3481000	To help the teacher plan
3481000	3483000	Or even do research with the teacher
3483000	3485000	Relatively speaking, it means that there is a teacher
3485000	3487000	Will pay special attention to your progress
3487000	3489000	For you
3489000	3491000	This is an opportunity to get along with the teacher
3491000	3493000	You can learn from the teacher
3493000	3495000	Usually you don't have funding
3495000	3497000	It's not that you can't find a teacher to work with
3497000	3499000	But that one
3499000	3501000	If you have this job opportunity
3501000	3503000	The level you can understand
3503000	3505000	Will be much weaker
3505000	3507000	Even if it's a GTA
3507000	3509000	You can also
3509000	3511000	It should be to help my teacher
3511000	3513000	Teaching assistant
3513000	3515000	For example, you can follow the class
3515000	3517000	Then see how the teacher teaches
3517000	3519000	You can also have a deep connection with the teacher
3519000	3521000	So no matter what I think
3521000	3523000	Financial support
3523000	3525000	I will put it with the student
3525000	3527000	I will put it in a very high priority
3527000	3529000	Unless for example
3529000	3531000	You don't need to think about it
3531000	3533000	This is of course
3533000	3535000	You may still choose your dream school
3535000	3537000	But of course
3537000	3539000	All the conditions are the same
3539000	3541000	I still recommend
3541000	3543000	Financial support school
3543000	3545000	If it's the school's budget
3545000	3547000	Some schools give GRA
3547000	3549000	Some schools give fellowship
3549000	3551000	GRA
3551000	3553000	I think it's best for students
3553000	3555000	Why is it best for students
3555000	3557000	Some school fellowships
3557000	3559000	No compulsory
3559000	3561000	Of course it's a good thing
3561000	3563000	When students have a high degree of autonomy
3563000	3565000	Or when students know what to do
3565000	3567000	You have the autonomy to follow the teacher
3567000	3569000	Who do I want to follow
3569000	3571000	You bring the research you want to do
3571000	3573000	Of course there is a gap in each department
3573000	3575000	But GRA
3575000	3577000	It's basically you
3577000	3579000	If you don't have a very clear direction
3579000	3581000	In fact, it is a better start for students
3581000	3583000	Let you have some opportunities
3583000	3585000	Contact research work
3585000	3587000	GRA is for
3587000	3589000	Language will be more demanding
3589000	3591000	Because you have to face the students directly
3591000	3593000	Then for example, take homework
3593000	3595000	Some courses you may have to bring
3595000	3597000	Or some parts you may need
3597000	3599000	There is a group discussion time
3599000	3601000	In terms of language
3601000	3603000	It becomes a very important thing
3603000	3605000	You have to be able to get in touch with students directly
3605000	3607000	That part is
3607000	3609000	I think it's good
3609000	3611000	There are a lot of English students in Taiwan
3611000	3613000	It's not bad
3613000	3615000	After five years of teaching
3615000	3617000	The experience of teaching again in the United States
3617000	3619000	Now Taiwanese students
3619000	3621000	English is generally much better than when we were in college
3621000	3623000	So in terms of language
3623000	3625000	But this is still a
3625000	3627000	Adapting process
3627000	3629000	So I mean if there is a choice
3629000	3631000	I will encourage students to choose GRA
3631000	3633000	If there is no choice, of course
3633000	3635000	It's really like this
3635000	3637000	Then of course
3637000	3639000	But this is your dream school
3639000	3641000	I have seen other students
3641000	3643000	For example
3643000	3645000	Libraries also provide jobs
3645000	3647000	Even I have seen students
3647000	3649000	Work in the school's gym
3649000	3651000	Administrative office
3651000	3653000	Of course it's all for me
3653000	3655000	If you want to study English
3655000	3657000	Or maybe it's a process
3657000	3659000	It's too much
3659000	3661000	Just waiting for you to find a chance
3661000	3663000	But if you really didn't
3663000	3665000	If not
3665000	3667000	This is also a
3667000	3669000	Out-of-the-box thinking
3669000	3671000	And of course
3671000	3673000	In addition to the school
3673000	3675000	Since everyone is studying in Taiwan
3675000	3677000	I just want to go abroad
3677000	3679000	The Ministry of Science and Technology also provides scholarships abroad
3679000	3681000	The Ministry of Education also has the Ministry of Education
3681000	3683000	A lot of scholarships
3683000	3685000	Like Fulbright
3685000	3687000	Or even if you are already studying in the United States
3687000	3689000	Then the school funding may be
3689000	3691000	Especially our social science
3691000	3693000	It's often read to the end of the world
3693000	3695000	Even if the school guarantees you four or five years of funding
3695000	3697000	Maybe I'm still not enough
3697000	3699000	The school also provides dissertation fellowship
3699000	3701000	Or some institutions like
3701000	3703000	The Ministry of Justice
3703000	3705000	Or NIH or something
3705000	3707000	There will be a dissertation fellowship
3707000	3709000	This can all be discussed with the teacher
3709000	3711000	You need the teacher to support you to apply
3711000	3713000	Then the teacher will usually be happy
3713000	3715000	If you have a good idea
3715000	3717000	Then this will usually provide you
3717000	3719000	Not only your stipend
3719000	3721000	It will also provide you some research funding
3721000	3723000	So you can go
3723000	3725000	If you can do your research well
3725000	3727000	If you have such a dissertation fellowship
3727000	3729000	In fact, it is also a bonus for you
3729000	3731000	It means you have a good experience
3731000	3733000	Your process
3733000	3735000	In fact, your research has been
3735000	3737000	The evaluation is recognized
3737000	3739000	I think your achievements are good
3739000	3741000	So this is also a very good experience
3741000	3743000	There are many other funding sources
3743000	3745000	I have suggested my students to apply
3745000	3747000	Like what female scientists
3747000	3749000	Some scholarship
3749000	3751000	That's not a lot
3751000	3753000	But in the process
3753000	3755000	You can put it on your CV
3755000	3757000	Some experience
3757000	3759000	It's a good thing to have this experience
3759000	3761000	What you need to pay attention to
3761000	3763000	The eligibility requirements for each scholarship
3763000	3765000	Different
3765000	3767000	Like Fulbright, Monster
3767000	3769000	Education
3769000	3771000	They all have requirements
3771000	3773000	For example, two years of residency
3773000	3775000	For example, especially Fulbright is quite strict
3775000	3777000	When you get your degree
3777000	3779000	You need to go back to your motherland
3779000	3781000	Then do two years of service
3781000	3783000	Some of these things you need to understand
3783000	3785000	If it's like the United States
3785000	3787000	Government agencies
3787000	3789000	Some fellowships will require you to have a green card
3789000	3791000	These things need to be read clearly
3791000	3793000	What are the requirements for you
3793000	3795000	I hope the information you send
3795000	3797000	Do you meet
3797000	3799000	Even if you have GREGT
3799000	3801000	Sometimes you can also
3801000	3803000	See if there are other funds
3803000	3805000	Can apply to help you
3805000	3807000	In the process of learning
3807000	3809000	For example, to supplement your research funding
3809000	3811000	Some of the costs of attending international conferences
3811000	3813000	This is also a way to consider
3815000	3817000	Of course, the most important thing
3817000	3819000	If you want to study for a doctorate
3819000	3821000	Usually when you apply for a fellowship
3821000	3823000	Because again, all humanities
3823000	3825000	It's not so abundant
3825000	3827000	If you get admission, it means you have money
3827000	3829000	That's not the case
3829000	3831000	You have to hook
3831000	3833000	Do you want to be considered for funding
3833000	3835000	This is very important
3835000	3837000	This goes with what Professor Chen just said
3837000	3839000	Contact the teacher if the teacher has funding
3839000	3841000	If the teacher thinks the research is suitable
3841000	3843000	In addition to the teacher
3843000	3845000	I want to talk to the department
3845000	3847000	I think this student is good
3847000	3849000	We can support him
3849000	3851000	If the teacher has funding
3851000	3853000	The first thing that comes to mind is
3853000	3855000	This student, I have this plan now
3855000	3857000	Is it possible to find him to take this plan
3857000	3859000	Like before
3859000	3861000	We received a student
3861000	3863000	In fact, he did not get our department's funding
3863000	3865000	He was very proactive
3865000	3867000	He wrote very specific
3867000	3869000	Not a letter
3869000	3871000	Then he received a response
3871000	3873000	And very active
3873000	3875000	Can I schedule a virtual meeting with you
3875000	3877000	Now everyone is used to virtual meetings
3877000	3879000	It doesn't take a lot of time
3879000	3881000	I know there are several colleagues
3881000	3883000	Including me, I talked to him for half an hour
3883000	3885000	I know his experience is quite special
3885000	3887000	Sometimes I feel so active
3887000	3889000	You also hope that if there is a chance
3889000	3891000	Give him a chance to try
3891000	3893000	This Taiwanese student
3893000	3895000	I want to tell the students
3895000	3897000	In fact, especially in the United States
3897000	3899000	In this cultural environment
3899000	3901000	If you take the initiative
3901000	3903000	In fact, there is a benefit
3903000	3905000	Give you a chance to show yourself
3905000	3907000	Even give you a chance
3907000	3909000	Let others know you
3909000	3911000	This is not a bad thing
3911000	3913000	Of course, it's not just writing an email
3913000	3915000	Talk to everyone casually
3915000	3917000	Of course you have to do this
3917000	3919000	Of course, be fully prepared
3919000	3921000	Practice well
3921000	3923000	To do this kind of contact work
3923000	3925000	Then
3925000	3927000	So what should I say
3927000	3929000	Of course, I emphasize that I think
3929000	3931000	Financial support is very important
3931000	3933000	But it doesn't mean
3933000	3935000	You didn't hear it at the beginning
3935000	3937000	There will be no chance
3937000	3939000	Speaking of this, I think
3939000	3941000	It's a very inspirational case
3941000	3943000	Just now
3943000	3945000	Mr. Chen said that his university hospital GPA is not very good
3945000	3947000	It doesn't matter
3947000	3949000	My first, second, third, fourth GPA is not very good
3949000	3951000	So I had to study in a research institute
3951000	3953000	Study a master's degree
3953000	3955000	That master's degree, of course, is not bad
3955000	3957000	Turned to the field
3957000	3959000	I was a psychology major
3959000	3961000	Turned to criminal studies
3961000	3963000	You can say a lot
3963000	3965000	Why do I study this
3965000	3967000	I have my own internship experience
3967000	3969000	So it's not that
3969000	3971000	Master's degree is not an advantage
3971000	3973000	But that gives you a chance
3973000	3975000	Demonstrate your academic research
3975000	3977000	Because college students are usually
3977000	3979000	But you have a master's degree
3979000	3981000	You will have more food experience
3981000	3983000	Even research experience
3983000	3985000	There may even be a master's thesis
3985000	3987000	To support
3987000	3989000	You are not only potential
3989000	3991000	But you already have some performance
3991000	3993000	So this is also an idea
3993000	3995000	Then
3995000	3997000	OK, wait a minute, I seem to jump
3997000	3999000	I don't like to jump to the front page
3999000	4001000	That's probably
4001000	4003000	A situation like this
4003000	4005000	Mr. Chen, are we
4005000	4007000	If you have any questions
4007000	4009000	If you have any questions
4009000	4011000	If you want to discuss with us
4021000	4023000	Thank you for the two professors
4023000	4025000	The sharing is very
4025000	4027000	A lot of details
4027000	4029000	Then we want to say
4029000	4031000	Wei Zhe has put it before
4031000	4033000	The registration form
4033000	4035000	If Wei Zhe has given us before
4035000	4037000	We should all write
4037000	4039000	I have seen Wei Zhe before
4039000	4041000	Give me the list
4041000	4043000	We should all write
4043000	4045000	In our PowerPoint
4045000	4047000	Or is there anything we didn't mention
4047000	4049000	Or did you say that
4049000	4051000	I didn't notice
4051000	4053000	I think you've covered a lot of questions
4053000	4055000	It's very detailed
4055000	4057000	Thank you
4057000	4059000	Thank you
4059000	4061000	Thank you
4061000	4063000	Thank you
4063000	4065000	Thank you
4065000	4067000	Thank you
4067000	4069000	Thank you
4069000	4071000	Thank you
4071000	4073000	Thank you
4075000	4077000	Thank you
4077000	4079000	Thank you
4079000	4081000	I think I've probably done it
4083000	4085000	So now
4085000	4087000	Is there anyone at the scene who has any questions?
4091000	4093000	If you feel embarrassed to ask
4093000	4095000	You are also welcome to
4095000	4097000	I or Yixuan
4097000	4099000	Or other staff you know
4099000	4101000	We will help you
4101000	4103000	Ask the professor
4105000	4107000	Ok, wait
4109000	4111000	Mr. Chen
4111000	4113000	I have a question for you
4113000	4115000	How do I
4115000	4117000	How do I get to know you
4117000	4119000	How do I get to know you
4119000	4121000	Ok, Tsingtao Materials
4121000	4123000	Ok
4123000	4125000	I'm from Tsingtao, so I'm good
4125000	4127000	Ok
4127000	4129000	So the first one is
4129000	4131000	From a review point of view
4131000	4133000	Is it positive to have an internship at a company?
4133000	4135000	Yes
4135000	4137000	But the point is
4137000	4139000	If you have an internship somewhere
4139000	4141000	It's useless
4141000	4143000	The point is
4143000	4145000	Is there any story in your internship
4145000	4147000	You can tell
4147000	4149000	In your SOP
4149000	4151000	To reinforce
4151000	4153000	Reviewer's impression
4153000	4155000	You know you are a
4155000	4157000	A person who can be a team worker
4157000	4159000	When you are a team worker
4159000	4161000	You can also show your leader's talent
4161000	4163000	If there is such an article
4163000	4165000	That's definitely a big plus
4165000	4167000	Is it constructive to let the teacher know you early?
4167000	4169000	Yes
4169000	4171000	Usually I think
4171000	4173000	More approachable
4173000	4175000	Step would be
4175000	4177000	You find some
4177000	4179000	Classes that you think you are better at
4179000	4181000	Try to
4181000	4183000	Talk to the teacher
4183000	4185000	In Taiwan
4185000	4187000	I don't know if everyone is used to
4187000	4189000	When you are in class
4189000	4191000	Encounter some problems
4191000	4193000	Have you taken the initiative to find a teacher
4193000	4195000	The habit of asking questions
4195000	4197000	If not
4197000	4199000	To
4199000	4201000	Start to develop this habit
4201000	4203000	Because I think this habit will let you
4203000	4205000	Improve very quickly in all aspects
4205000	4207000	Because when you have a chance
4207000	4209000	Talk to the teacher
4209000	4211000	At the time
4211000	4213000	You will know
4213000	4215000	The teacher's idea
4215000	4217000	There is actually a very big difference
4217000	4219000	The main reason is because
4219000	4221000	The teacher is actually
4221000	4223000	On the other side
4223000	4225000	The side you see
4225000	4227000	The person who does the operation
4227000	4229000	You have to talk to the teacher
4229000	4231000	You have to say
4231000	4233000	What are the attitudes of these reviewers
4233000	4235000	What are their focus
4235000	4237000	Once you have
4237000	4239000	After this information
4239000	4241000	You are preparing your materials
4241000	4243000	Will be more efficient
4243000	4245000	You don't have to think about it
4245000	4247000	The materials you prepared
4247000	4249000	Will be more
4249000	4251000	Really able to address
4251000	4253000	What these reviewers want to see
4253000	4255000	OK
4255000	4257000	If you say this
4257000	4259000	If you start doing it in the second or third year
4259000	4261000	OK
4261000	4263000	If you say you are off duty
4263000	4265000	After a year
4265000	4267000	If you want to go abroad
4267000	4269000	I think you have to do it now
4269000	4271000	Another
4271000	4273000	The method is
4273000	4275000	If you have a partner
4275000	4277000	If you have a co-director
4277000	4279000	There are basically only two recommendations
4279000	4281000	Let the teachers
4281000	4283000	Have a good impression of you
4283000	4285000	Get things done
4285000	4287000	Give the teacher enough time
4287000	4289000	I think
4289000	4291000	The teacher's letter is usually good
4291000	4293000	OK
4293000	4295000	I hope this answers
4295000	4297000	The question of the student
4301000	4303000	There is a second question
4303000	4305000	I think it should be
4305000	4307000	For the recommended choice
4307000	4309000	Will choose
4309000	4311000	The same field but not the most familiar
4311000	4313000	Or two different fields
4313000	4315000	But a teacher who is familiar with himself
4315000	4317000	Professor Yang answered that he was more inclined to be two
4317000	4319000	Can you give me a reason
4319000	4321000	What do you think
4321000	4323000	Because like we said
4323000	4325000	Now apply for a doctorate
4325000	4327000	Your field
4327000	4329000	It's impossible for you to be in the same field as now
4329000	4331000	You usually have to read the doctorate
4331000	4333000	You will read more professionally
4333000	4335000	You have to do some changes in the teacher's field
4335000	4337000	It's more important
4337000	4339000	You are in college or doing something
4339000	4341000	What kind of experience do you have
4341000	4343000	Your performance
4343000	4345000	Whether it's your class performance
4345000	4347000	Or your performance with the teacher
4347000	4349000	Of course, find a teacher who is familiar with you
4349000	4351000	To be able to recommend you more deeply
4351000	4353000	Where is your strength
4353000	4355000	Where is your performance
4355000	4357000	You find the same field
4357000	4359000	It's like what Mr. Chen just said
4359000	4361000	It's better not to write
4361000	4363000	I don't know how to recommend
4363000	4365000	You have to be in the same field
4365000	4367000	But you are not familiar with me
4367000	4369000	What am I going to write
4369000	4371000	It's not good for you
4371000	4373000	It's better to find
4373000	4375000	What we mean by familiar
4375000	4377000	It's not that you have a good relationship with the teacher
4377000	4379000	It's not useful
4379000	4381000	I often go to the bathroom with the teacher
4381000	4383000	It's not like that
4383000	4385000	The teacher may be able to evaluate your personality
4385000	4387000	But not only personality
4387000	4389000	Familiar is that you take the teacher's class
4389000	4391000	I think it's very impressive
4391000	4393000	For example, you often take the initiative to ask the teacher
4393000	4395000	For example, after class, go to the teacher to discuss
4395000	4397000	Or the teacher has a very good impression of your research plan
4397000	4399000	Or something
4399000	4401000	It's like this
4401000	4403000	I don't know if this answer
4403000	4405000	Mr. Chen, do you want to add
4405000	4407000	I think Mr. Yang said very well
4407000	4409000	I think it's the field
4409000	4411000	Everyone will find it when they get older
4411000	4413000	Not so important
4413000	4415000	I use my own example
4415000	4417000	My university is doing 5G material synthesis
4417000	4419000	I went abroad to study
4419000	4421000	When I went abroad to study
4421000	4423000	Physics and chemistry
4423000	4425000	When I was a doctor
4425000	4427000	It's biophysics
4427000	4429000	And now it's neuroscience
4429000	4431000	Biophysics
4431000	4433000	I've been turning my field
4433000	4435000	So I think the field is actually in
4435000	4437000	When you do high-level education
4437000	4439000	It's not that important
4439000	4441000	Because in the end everyone is together
4441000	4443000	You need knowledge in all aspects
4443000	4445000	To do integration
4445000	4447000	The teacher must really know you
4447000	4449000	When the teacher is writing a recommendation
4449000	4451000	Don't let everyone think
4451000	4453000	The teacher's recommendation is
4453000	4455000	I'm familiar with you, I'll write you well
4455000	4457000	Not like this
4457000	4459000	A strong recommendation must be a
4459000	4461000	Fact-based recommendation
4461000	4463000	OK
4463000	4465000	The teacher will do what you do
4465000	4467000	Then comment on that thing
4467000	4469000	From his point of view
4469000	4471000	OK, the student did this thing
4471000	4473000	From my point of view
4473000	4475000	What are the advantages
4475000	4477000	What is it that I think
4477000	4479000	It's very suitable for a PhD student
4479000	4481000	OK, so if you're just
4481000	4483000	I'm familiar with the teacher
4483000	4485000	OK, but you don't have any specific evidence
4485000	4487000	Please write the teacher
4487000	4489000	It's also difficult for the teacher to write
4489000	4491000	A strong and powerful recommendation
4491000	4493000	So don't forget your root
4493000	4495000	You are actually
4495000	4497000	The performance is very strong
4497000	4499000	The teacher knows you
4499000	4501000	The teacher can follow you
4501000	4503000	Do further comment
4503000	4505000	This will be a strong recommendation
4505000	4507000	OK, you have to let the teacher know
4507000	4509000	You know so much
4509000	4511000	What did you do
4511000	4513000	Then let the teacher extend from this thing
4513000	4515000	His unique idea of ​​you
4515000	4517000	These all take time
4517000	4519000	OK, I hope this answers
4519000	4521000	The student's question
4521000	4523000	I believe
4523000	4525000	For the recommendation
4525000	4527000	Is to give more detailed information
4527000	4529000	The next question is from
4529000	4531000	I want to ask
4531000	4533000	I'm sorry
4533000	4535000	I just found out
4535000	4537000	On the way to the speech
4537000	4539000	Someone asked two questions
4539000	4541000	So I want to say because that student
4541000	4543000	Asked me early
4543000	4545000	Ask the student first
4545000	4547000	OK, no problem
4547000	4549000	Thank you
4549000	4551000	The first question of this student is
4551000	4553000	I want to ask the teacher GPA
4553000	4555000	Every semester in college
4555000	4557000	About 3.8 to 4
4557000	4559000	Do you still need to spend the score sheet to write
4559000	4561000	Or can you not mention it at all in the architecture
4561000	4563000	See the score sheet or CV is enough
4563000	4565000	I can mention
4565000	4567000	If you are 3.8 to 4
4567000	4569000	Then you must have won a lot of awards
4569000	4571000	Right
4571000	4573000	Then you have to write what you have won
4573000	4575000	Or like this
4575000	4577000	Then my other one is
4577000	4579000	If you only have a good GPA
4579000	4581000	Then there is nothing else to mention in life
4581000	4583000	Then only mention GPA
4583000	4585000	Am I talking too much
4585000	4587000	But of course I hope
4587000	4589000	In addition to GPA
4589000	4591000	There are more in-depth questions
4591000	4593000	Why do I want to do this research
4593000	4595000	Why do I want to do this research
4595000	4597000	That thing your motivation
4597000	4599000	It's definitely not because I have a GPA of 3.8
4599000	4601000	It's definitely not like this
4601000	4603000	So I think SOP is for you
4603000	4605000	Do some more in-depth
4605000	4607000	Introduction
4607000	4609000	Your own process
4609000	4611000	How your research experience
4611000	4613000	How did you get to this step
4613000	4615000	You can also say because of me
4615000	4617000	Very enthusiastic
4617000	4619000	So my grades are very good
4619000	4621000	Of course you won't take the initiative
4621000	4623000	My grades are all 3.8 4.0
4623000	4625000	Everyone will say so
4625000	4627000	So that's not the point
4627000	4629000	Then because you introduce you
4629000	4631000	You can write it clearly on your CV
4631000	4633000	You will also write it clearly on your CV
4633000	4635000	But you will mention that there must be a purpose
4635000	4637000	I want to say because of me
4637000	4639000	I am very enthusiastic about these lessons
4639000	4641000	Although I work in full time
4641000	4643000	I still maintain my grades very well
4643000	4645000	Bring this thing into a situation like this
4645000	4647000	Instead of the main thing
4647000	4649000	My grades are very good
4649000	4651000	Otherwise, life is a bit sad
4651000	4653000	I finished writing your SOP in one paragraph
4653000	4655000	I think I want to add
4655000	4657000	If GPA
4657000	4659000	If GPA
4659000	4661000	Then
4661000	4663000	You should be able to
4663000	4665000	Use GPA as an example
4665000	4667000	Use GPA as an example
4667000	4669000	To say that GPA is so good
4669000	4671000	No one is
4671000	4673000	Just for the sake of GPA
4673000	4675000	The reason why your GPA is good
4675000	4677000	There must be a reason in your heart
4677000	4679000	Why should I make my GPA so good
4679000	4681000	The most direct way to think about it
4681000	4683000	You are really enthusiastic about this science
4685000	4687000	You can use your GPA as a proof
4687000	4689000	You can say
4689000	4691000	What am I particularly interested in
4691000	4693000	So I spent a lot of time
4693000	4695000	So I spent a lot of time
4695000	4697000	On this special project
4697000	4699000	Inventor's Outcome
4699000	4701000	My GPA is very good
4701000	4703000	This is also OK
4703000	4705000	When you are drafting these things
4705000	4707000	GPA can be used as a fact
4707000	4709000	GPA can be used as a fact
4709000	4711000	You have to explain
4711000	4713000	Why in this
4713000	4715000	How to connect this fact
4715000	4717000	I want to apply for a Ph.D.
4717000	4719000	I want to apply for a Ph.D.
4719000	4721000	Why am I suitable for a Ph.D.
4721000	4723000	Why am I suitable for a Ph.D.
4723000	4725000	OK
4725000	4727000	Word is a very
4727000	4729000	Strong and meaningful fact
4729000	4731000	If a person
4731000	4733000	Has been winning the Nobel Prize for so many years
4733000	4735000	He immediately
4735000	4737000	Brought out the message
4737000	4739000	This student is very
4739000	4741000	Knowledgeable
4741000	4743000	And very
4743000	4745000	Persistent
4745000	4747000	If there are these records
4747000	4749000	Reviewers will also explain
4749000	4751000	Why can this student
4751000	4753000	Continue to perform so well for so long
4753000	4755000	Right?
4755000	4757000	What are his characteristics?
4757000	4759000	It looks very clear
4759000	4761000	The results of this thing
4761000	4763000	For students with good grades
4763000	4765000	That section
4765000	4767000	Not so critical
4767000	4769000	It is important
4769000	4771000	But it won't be a
4771000	4773000	Breaking point
4773000	4775000	But when your GPA is not so outstanding
4775000	4777000	But when your GPA is not so outstanding
4777000	4779000	You still hope to be accepted
4779000	4781000	The story behind
4781000	4783000	You have to make it clear
4783000	4785000	I hope I can answer
4785000	4787000	The question of that student
4787000	4789000	Wei Zhe
4789000	4791000	He has another question
4791000	4793000	The other question of the same student
4793000	4795000	The other question of the same student
4795000	4797000	He is currently with his former intern
4797000	4799000	He is currently with his former intern
4799000	4801000	Want to let the other person know more
4801000	4803000	His question is
4803000	4805000	His question is
4805000	4807000	When talking to the former intern
4807000	4809000	What do you think about forms?
4809000	4811000	What do you think about forms?
4811000	4813000	You have not prepared the terms of the forms
4813000	4815000	You have not prepared the terms of the forms
4815000	4817000	Still want to ask this famous student
4817000	4819000	This famous student
4819000	4821000	Maybe 1 month later
4821000	4823000	Maybe 1 month later
4823000	4825000	Start again
4825000	4827000	Start again
4827000	4829000	Do you talk about school application?
4829000	4831000	Do you talk about school application?
4831000	4833000	Do you talk about school application?
4833000	4835000	16 months
4835000	4837000	Suddenly contacted
4837000	4839000	suddenly contacted
4839000	4841000	Go to chat with the teacher later
4841000	4843000	Go to chat with the teacher later
4843000	4845000	Go to chat with the teacher later
4845000	4847000	Should not chat
4859000	4861000	Should not chat with the teacher later
4861000	4863000	Should not chat with the teacher later
4863000	4865820	If the teacher's response is also good, then tell the teacher directly
4865820	4867820	Of course you can tell the teacher
4867820	4869820	Something is still being prepared
4869820	4871820	What is the result
4871820	4873820	I have to give it to the teacher first
4873820	4875820	The remaining thing I prepared and sent it to the teacher
4875820	4877820	It's very clear to tell the teacher
4879820	4881820	I want to add
4881820	4883820	My experience
4883820	4885820	Like talking to me
4885820	4887820	want
4887820	4889820	Recommended students
4889820	4891820	I agree with the recommended students
4892640	4894640	At the beginning
4894640	4896640	Will ask the teacher
4896640	4898640	What is the opinion of the class
4898640	4900640	OK
4900640	4902640	I think this is a good point
4902640	4904640	Just
4904640	4906640	Demonstrate
4906640	4908640	You are interested in applying for the class
4908640	4910640	But you are not so sure
4912640	4914640	If you ask the teacher about this
4914640	4916640	You will let the teacher know
4916640	4918640	This student is likely to apply for the class
4918640	4920640	Then I can put
4921460	4923460	You don't have to prepare anything at this stage
4923460	4925460	Right
4925460	4927460	But when you do this
4927460	4929460	Tell the teacher
4929460	4931460	I think I will
4931460	4933460	Interested in research
4933460	4935460	But my knowledge of the doctoral class is very limited
4935460	4937460	Can you share with me
4937460	4939460	Do you know the doctoral class
4939460	4941460	I believe it will be for me
4941460	4943460	Decide my future life
4943460	4945460	Has a great help
4945460	4947460	In this case
4947460	4949460	You don't have to worry about whether you have prepared your file
4950280	4952280	You can start from the teacher
4952280	4954280	Let you know
4954280	4956280	What do you think about the other side
4956280	4958280	The teacher will know
4958280	4960280	This student is likely to apply for the doctoral class
4960280	4962280	After several talks
4962280	4964280	Actually
4964280	4966280	When you ask the teacher for a recommendation letter
4966280	4968280	The teacher already has enough knowledge
4968280	4970280	When you really want to apply
4970280	4972280	Give the teacher enough time to write
4972280	4974280	Then put your
4974280	4976280	Grades
4976280	4978280	CV and SOP to the teacher
4979100	4981100	OK
4981100	4983100	OK
4987100	4989100	Is this OK
4989100	4991100	Should be OK
4991100	4993100	If we follow the chat
4993100	4995100	Answer directly
4995100	4997100	For example, Carrie asked
4997100	4999100	Can you ask the teacher directly
4999100	5001100	Of course
5001100	5003100	Because sometimes you tell the teacher
5003100	5005100	I want to apply for the doctoral class
5005100	5007100	When the teacher is interested in the teacher's work
5007920	5009920	Usually the teacher will tell you directly
5009920	5011920	The teacher won't say he's not here
5011920	5013920	And he won't tell you in the past few years
5013920	5015920	The teacher won't do this
5015920	5017920	If you know that the teacher is interested in your work
5017920	5019920	The teacher will tell you directly
5019920	5021920	Of course you can ask
5021920	5023920	In fact, the teacher will answer directly
5023920	5025920	Teacher Chen asked a lot of questions
5025920	5027920	I will read it
5027920	5029920	Some may be answered by Teacher Chen
5029920	5031920	OK
5031920	5033920	Let you answer this part
5033920	5035920	He said
5036740	5038740	Is leadership important for all fields?
5038740	5040740	Or is it more emphasis on some fields?
5040740	5042740	Leadership
5042740	5044740	I think there is a bonus
5044740	5046740	If not, it won't matter
5046740	5048740	Some schools will become very important
5048740	5050740	I see
5050740	5052740	I think the most important thing now
5052740	5054740	If you want to go to medical school
5054740	5056740	Medical school
5056740	5058740	Leadership
5058740	5060740	Everyone has to have
5060740	5062740	If you apply for a foreign school in Taiwan
5062740	5064740	I think if it's a general R1 school
5065560	5067560	Not so much
5067560	5069560	But if you have
5069560	5071560	It will be a bonus
5071560	5073560	I will add one more thing
5073560	5075560	I think leadership is more important
5075560	5077560	When you apply for a teaching job
5077560	5079560	When applying for a teaching job
5079560	5081560	Leadership will be more important than graduate students
5081560	5083560	More important
5083560	5085560	Yes
5085560	5087560	I agree
5087560	5089560	Then
5089560	5091560	He said that if he had known
5091560	5093560	Can you mention the graduation age first?
5094380	5096380	How many years can you consider taking the exam?
5096380	5098380	How many years to intern outside?
5098380	5100380	I can only say that dreams are sweet
5100380	5102380	Reality is bitter
5102380	5104380	Does Teacher Chen want to add anything?
5104380	5106380	Of course you can mention
5106380	5108380	But do you want to ask the teacher to write the contract?
5108380	5110380	The teacher has to sign
5110380	5112380	How many years do I have to take the exam?
5112380	5114380	And how many years can I intern?
5114380	5116380	I think of course you can mention
5116380	5118380	But sometimes the teacher has to work with you
5118380	5120380	To know your situation
5120380	5122380	Or look at your questions
5123200	5125200	Then you may have to
5125200	5127200	Or I have a good class
5127200	5129200	The teacher told me
5129200	5131200	Don't take classes anymore
5131200	5133200	You have more credits than college students
5133200	5135200	Okay, I should be ready to graduate
5135200	5137200	Everyone has a different
5137200	5139200	But this thing
5139200	5141200	At least in our society
5141200	5143200	I don't know if natural science can sign a contract
5143200	5145200	I guess there is no way
5145200	5147200	I think this question
5147200	5149200	The topic we talked about today
5149200	5151200	It's a bit irrelevant
5152020	5154020	Now we focus more on how to apply
5154020	5156020	This is more like you have already got the admission
5156020	5158020	You have to find a teacher
5158020	5160020	Can you ask these questions?
5160020	5162020	For this question
5162020	5164020	I think
5164020	5166020	If you want to find the real answer
5166020	5168020	In fact, it is not to ask the instructor
5168020	5170020	But to ask the student of the instructor
5170020	5172020	You are quite reasonable
5172020	5174020	Will be closer to
5174020	5176020	Your actual expectations
5176020	5178020	Because
5178020	5180020	To be honest
5180840	5182840	Usually
5182840	5184840	You won't get any useful information
5184840	5186840	If you get the answer
5186840	5188840	You will say it depends
5188840	5190840	Because too many things will decide
5190840	5192840	The timeline of graduation
5192840	5194840	If the teacher says you have to submit three papers
5194840	5196840	To graduate
5196840	5198840	If you find the experiment is stuck
5198840	5200840	What should you do?
5200840	5202840	You don't want the teacher to use
5202840	5204840	Specific papers to limit your graduation time
5204840	5206840	Right?
5206840	5208840	So I think this is very professor-dependent
5209660	5211660	So when you are a non-admission
5211660	5213660	There are still a lot of questions
5213660	5215660	How do you choose a teacher?
5215660	5217660	What should you focus on?
5217660	5219660	Of course, we didn't talk about it today
5219660	5221660	I think
5221660	5223660	If you think
5223660	5225660	This is really a problem
5225660	5227660	I think you can participate
5227660	5229660	Maybe Tara has some other
5229660	5231660	Webinars
5231660	5233660	Talk about
5233660	5235660	How to choose
5235660	5237660	Advisor
5238480	5240480	How to have a successful PhD
5240480	5242480	I think that's a good topic
5242480	5244480	If you just want
5244480	5246480	First-layer information
5246480	5248480	I think
5248480	5250480	You don't need to ask the teacher
5250480	5252480	Because you won't get any useful answer
5252480	5254480	Maybe it's better to ask the students
5254480	5256480	If it's the same
5256480	5258480	We skip the advisor part
5258480	5260480	Because it's also
5260480	5262480	How to have a successful experience
5262480	5264480	Guanjing
5264480	5266480	She said
5267000	5269000	Not good enough
5269000	5271000	But you have the paper experience
5271000	5273000	That's good
5273000	5275000	But you have the research experience
5275000	5277000	That's also good
5277000	5279000	And then outstanding
5279000	5281000	That's beneficial
5281000	5283000	And outstanding
5283000	5285000	I think
5285000	5287000	Well, I don't think
5287000	5289000	Everyone is outstanding
5289000	5291000	If everyone is outstanding
5291000	5293000	Then no one is outstanding
5293000	5295000	So I think
5295000	5297000	What I should do is
5297000	5299000	How to present my best side
5299000	5301000	To the reviewer in the best way
5301000	5303000	I think that's enough
5303000	5305000	The word outstanding is too heavy
5305000	5307000	Yeah
5307000	5309000	You say
5309000	5311000	You say we receive the best students
5311000	5313000	Is it outstanding?
5313000	5315000	I said most of the time it's not outstanding
5315000	5317000	Right?
5317000	5319000	But are we looking for outstanding students?
5319000	5321000	No, we don't actually need outstanding students
5321000	5323000	OK
5323000	5325000	We just need a coachable
5325000	5327000	OK
5327000	5329000	Then we can
5329000	5331000	We think he can grow and become a Ph.D.
5331000	5333000	Under our education system
5333000	5335000	Then my definition of Ph.D.
5335000	5337000	Of course
5337000	5339000	When this student encounters a problem
5339000	5341000	He can come up with solutions
5341000	5343000	He can find available resources
5343000	5345000	OK
5345000	5347000	Come up with proper hypothesis
5347000	5349000	Design a proper experiment
5349000	5351000	OK
5351000	5353000	Then we can figure out what's going on
5353000	5355000	That's my definition of Ph.D.
5355000	5357000	Right?
5357000	5359000	Do we need to be outstanding?
5359000	5361000	No, we don't
5361000	5363000	As long as we are coachable
5363000	5365000	And know how to do things
5365000	5367000	Right?
5367000	5369000	And have basic scientific sense
5369000	5371000	That's enough
5371000	5373000	So don't put so much pressure on yourself
5373000	5375000	To make yourself outstanding
5375000	5377000	If you want to make yourself outstanding
5377000	5379000	I'm sorry
5379000	5381000	We are done with the discussion
5381000	5383000	Recommendation to find a non-Ph.D.
5383000	5385000	I think it's OK
5385000	5387000	Chinese Academy of Sciences is also a research position
5387000	5389000	If you have any real research experience
5389000	5391000	And some cooperation
5391000	5393000	That's definitely fine
5393000	5395000	I believe we both agree
5395000	5397000	The point is
5397000	5399000	Whether you can really evaluate your ability
5399000	5401000	Your potential
5401000	5403000	Or your research experience
5403000	5405000	I think it's this
5405000	5407000	I think this is what we were talking about
5407000	5409000	In the presentation
5409000	5411000	Do you have any other potential you would like to see
5411000	5413000	Other than your academic achievement
5413000	5415000	I think this is area-dependent
5415000	5417000	I guess
5417000	5419000	In the field of natural science
5419000	5421000	Do you have any lab experience
5421000	5423000	What skills do you have
5423000	5425000	That's important
5425000	5427000	In the field of social humanities
5427000	5429000	Maybe
5429000	5431000	Your social participation
5431000	5433000	Your social care
5433000	5435000	Or something like this
5435000	5437000	Maybe it's important to us
5437000	5439000	That's a motivation
5439000	5441000	Especially if I study criminal studies
5441000	5443000	Some of our students
5443000	5445000	They are very concerned about social justice
5445000	5447000	They have some
5447000	5449000	What kind of group or what kind of leadership
5449000	5451000	What kind of library
5451000	5453000	Those things become important
5453000	5455000	So what I think is
5455000	5457000	Maybe you can look at different areas
5457000	5459000	I think this thing is actually quite area-dependent
5459000	5461000	So I don't think we can deal with it
5461000	5463000	External funding
5463000	5465000	You said public funding
5465000	5467000	There's Director Huang up there
5467000	5469000	I'd like to thank you
5469000	5471000	Director Huang
5471000	5473000	But the question he asked
5473000	5475000	If he had his own
5475000	5477000	Department of Education
5477000	5479000	My last name is Lan
5479000	5481000	But Professor Yang
5481000	5483000	I think his question is
5483000	5485000	If he had his own
5485000	5487000	Department of Education
5487000	5489000	Department of Education
5489000	5491000	I think he's asking
5491000	5493000	If he brought his own funding
5493000	5495000	Does it increase
5495000	5497000	For example, the chance of being accepted by the school
5497000	5499000	There are two points
5499000	5501000	That is
5501000	5503000	The basic answer is yes
5503000	5505000	Because that means
5505000	5507000	It's your external recognition
5507000	5509000	Like we just mentioned
5509000	5511000	This is your recognition of you
5511000	5513000	You've been evaluated
5513000	5515000	You can say I'm the only winner
5515000	5517000	That means you have potential in this place
5517000	5519000	But the other part
5519000	5521000	I saw an experience last year
5523000	5525000	A student in Taiwan
5525000	5527000	He applied for a B.S.
5527000	5529000	And then he applied
5529000	5531000	Of course, many students want it
5531000	5533000	But when the economy is more
5533000	5535000	I know
5535000	5537000	Some schools say
5537000	5539000	Since you have money, we won't give you money
5539000	5541000	So the students feel very depressed
5541000	5543000	Why should I lie to the school
5543000	5545000	I didn't bring any money
5545000	5547000	The school will give me the money
5547000	5549000	Because the student is quite good
5549000	5551000	My answer is
5551000	5553000	I don't think it's necessary
5553000	5555000	Because he still found
5555000	5557000	He brought the money
5557000	5559000	He is still willing to give him the money
5559000	5561000	It's just that it may not be his first or second choice
5561000	5563000	My idea is
5563000	5565000	Of course, when the school's budget is tight
5565000	5567000	There will be such considerations
5567000	5569000	How to divide some of the money
5569000	5571000	To the most students
5571000	5573000	He would like to say that you have money
5573000	5575000	To what extent
5575000	5577000	And what kind of help
5577000	5579000	The student told me
5579000	5581000	If I don't bring the school's budget
5581000	5583000	I still have the school's budget
5583000	5585000	The school's budget may only be given to you for three years
5585000	5587000	You may have to measure this yourself
5587000	5589000	Basically, yes, you are
5589000	5591000	I think so
5595000	5597000	Age will not
5597000	5599000	Age will never be deducted
5599000	5601000	If the United States asks the age
5601000	5603000	Age will not be the deduction point
5603000	5605000	I believe me and Mr. Chen
5605000	5607000	We are basically like this
5607000	5609000	Age will not be deducted
5609000	5611000	If you have work experience
5611000	5613000	In fact, it is usually a bonus
5613000	5615000	I want to add
5615000	5617000	Basically, I agree with Mr. Yang
5617000	5619000	But if you are
5619000	5621000	Maybe 40 or 50
5621000	5623000	If you come out to read PhD
5625000	5627000	The reviewer may have some concerns
5627000	5629000	We actually had a lot before
5629000	5631000	I've been working in the industry for a long time
5631000	5633000	Because everyone knows
5633000	5635000	But it turns out that what you bring is different
5635000	5637000	Like they are actually in the government
5637000	5639000	After working for more than ten years
5639000	5641000	He will bring in a lot of food experience
5641000	5643000	So that means
5643000	5645000	Usually I guess the research institute
5645000	5647000	No school will be all
5647000	5649000	These students came in
5649000	5651000	But there will be some students like this
5651000	5653000	Is to increase its diversity
5653000	5655000	But you will never
5655000	5657000	But definitely not because of age
5657000	5659000	He won't see how old you are
5659000	5661000	Basically this will not happen
5661000	5663000	When everyone is reviewing your information
5663000	5665000	Will feel that this person is very interesting
5665000	5667000	So they will do more discussion
5667000	5669000	I think it will
5669000	5671000	At least in
5671000	5673000	I think there may be this kind of situation in science and engineering
5673000	5675000	Because everyone expects students
5675000	5677000	Everyone hopes
5677000	5679000	Promote young students
5681000	5683000	Education
5683000	5685000	In this case, let's say you are very old
5685000	5687000	I don't know how old I am
5687000	5689000	Maybe 60 or 70 years old
5689000	5691000	Some are too old
5691000	5693000	It's very difficult to move a steel bottle
5693000	5695000	There may be some problems in actual operation
5695000	5697000	They may
5699000	5701000	There will be a more in-depth discussion about this case
5701000	5703000	I should say this
5703000	5705000	But basically
5705000	5707000	The age should not be a problem
5707000	5709000	The student asked
5709000	5711000	Your statement of purpose
5711000	5713000	Do you want to write it very carefully
5713000	5715000	Like a proposal or a summary
5715000	5717000	I think this thing
5717000	5719000	Is
5719000	5721000	Proposal
5721000	5723000	Because he has some
5723000	5725000	If you look at the teacher for too long
5725000	5727000	There will be no way to endure
5727000	5729000	To be honest
5729000	5731000	But if you write too rough
5731000	5733000	I'm just interested in this
5733000	5735000	There is no evidence to prove
5735000	5737000	I think it's too weak
5737000	5739000	So I think
5739000	5741000	What are you interested in
5741000	5743000	If you can support
5743000	5745000	Why are you interested in this
5745000	5747000	Instead of just saying that I am interested in this
5747000	5749000	I think this is a stronger case
5749000	5751000	Of course, I don't know how to write it like a proposal
5751000	5753000	Unless the school specifically requires you to write a proposal
5753000	5755000	I think it's in the middle
5755000	5757000	I think this is a good practice
5757000	5759000	Let everyone be able to use two or three
5759000	5761000	Two or three sentences
5761000	5763000	Summarize what you have learned
5765000	5767000	I think it takes time to practice
5767000	5769000	Like Mr. Yang said
5769000	5771000	I don't think you can write it too fine
5771000	5773000	You can't write it too broad
5773000	5775000	It must be right
5775000	5777000	We were reminded
5777000	5779000	That we are already entering the breakout section
5779000	5781000	And we are over time
5781000	5783000	It turned out to be 9.30
5783000	5785000	We are already over time
5785000	5787000	Let's go to the breakout room first
5787000	5789000	I'm sorry to bother you
5789000	5791000	Please help us get to the breakout room
5791000	5793000	OK
5793000	5795000	I would like to remind you
5795000	5797000	Let me remind everyone
5797000	5799000	We are now divided into two breakout room
5799000	5801000	If you have any questions
5801000	5803000	For professors in different fields
5803000	5805000	You are welcome to
5805000	5807000	Ask questions in the corresponding field
5807000	5809000	If there is a question
5809000	5811000	In the general Q&A session
5811000	5813000	If it is not answered
5813000	5815000	You are also welcome to
5815000	5817000	Ask the professor
5817000	5819000	In the general breakout room
5819000	5823000	Ideally, you should be able to
5823000	5825000	Choose the breakout room
5825000	5827000	We will leave one or two people
5827000	5829000	In the main session
5829000	5831000	To answer some technical questions
5831000	5833000	If you have any technical questions
5833000	5835000	You are welcome to let me know
5845000	5847000	Thank you Wei Zhe
5847000	5849000	Thanks Wei Zhe
5877000	5885000	Wei Zhe and Terry were talking about writing sample.
5885000	5889000	How important is writing sample?
5889000	5893000	Sociology students want to know how good your English writing ability is.
5893000	5896000	Sociology students focus on your English ability.
5896000	5900000	You need to be able to communicate, even write.
5900000	5904000	It's similar to SOP.
5904000	5908000	You need to be able to convince people that you have an important goal.
5908000	5912000	Writing sample wants to know how good your academic ability is,
5912000	5915000	and how good your English ability is.
5915000	5919000	The recommended direction is what you have written before.
5919000	5922000	Of course, writing an essay or diary will be a little awkward.
5922000	5926000	Of course, it is more focused on academic papers.
5926000	5928000	Unless you are applying to the Department of Humanities and Sciences,
5928000	5932000	for example, you are applying for a master's degree in literature.
5932000	5937000	Of course, it is more related to the field of writing.
5937000	5941000	Let me explain.
5941000	5946000	Professor Yang is assigned to the first breakout session.
5946000	5950000	Professor Chen is assigned to the second breakout session.
5950000	5955000	Everyone else is assigned to the second breakout session.
5955000	5958000	You can choose to accept or not accept.
5958000	5963000	If you choose not to accept, you can go to another session.
5963000	5968000	If you choose not to accept, you can go to another session.
5968000	5973000	Thank you, Professor Chen.
5973000	5977000	Thank you, both professors.
5977000	5982000	There is no follow-up after the breakout session today.
5982000	5985000	You can leave the meeting now.
5986000	5993000	Please remember that a postgraduate lecture is scheduled on August 28th.
5993000	6000000	Please remember that a postgraduate lecture is scheduled on August 28th.
6000000	6005000	CVSOP will have a free review soon.
