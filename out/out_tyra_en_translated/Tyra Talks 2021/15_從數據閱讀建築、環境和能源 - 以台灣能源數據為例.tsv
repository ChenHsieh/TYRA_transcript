91000	95000	That's about it for today's presentation.
95000	100000	Now, let's have another host, Hu-Jun-Wei, to introduce today's speaker, Fu-Chun.
101000	102000	Hello, everyone.
102000	110000	Fu-Chun is a Ph.D. student at the University of Singapore, NUS.
110000	118000	He is currently studying architecture and urban data science in the University of Singapore.
118000	123000	His research focuses on the application of large data related to architecture,
123000	129000	including architectural energy, indoor environment comfort, and architectural IoT data, etc.
129000	133000	At the same time, he is also doing some community activities in the lab.
133000	140000	For example, he held an energy prediction competition at the well-known data platform Kaggle the year before last,
140000	146000	and provided data science courses to the public in an open platform course, EDS.
147000	150000	Interestingly, before Fu-Chun was a Ph.D. student,
150000	157000	he worked as a three-year data scientist at a Taiwanese innovation company,
157000	159000	Knowledge Analysis Based Exploration,
159000	163000	and was committed to the development of large data related to architecture,
163000	169000	including the detection of labor abnormalities, energy prediction, and data visualization, etc.
169000	174000	In addition, he is also involved in the development of artificial intelligence services
174000	177000	and energy data analysis of the Taipei City Government.
177000	185000	Today, Fu-Chun will focus more on issues related to food in the industry.
185000	190000	In today's speech, he will talk about the academic development of energy prediction,
190000	195000	and finally share how to work with open data to do energy prediction.
195000	197000	Let's welcome Fu-Chun.
200000	202000	Can you hear me?
202000	204000	Yes, we can.
204000	205000	Great.
205000	211000	Next, let me play my video.
213000	219000	Today's topic is data reading, architecture, environment, and energy,
219000	221000	based on Taiwan energy data.
221000	226000	This speech is mainly about architecture data prediction models,
226000	229000	as well as the introduction of related open data.
229000	231000	At the end of the speech,
231000	234000	I will use the open data provided by Taipei Electric Power Corporation,
234000	236000	and the weather forecast provided by the Meteorological Bureau,
236000	238000	to cooperate with the model of machine learning,
238000	241000	to make an energy prediction service that can predict the future.
241000	244000	I hope the difficulty of today's speech is not too high.
244000	245000	The main thing is to let everyone know
245000	249000	how to apply data science in human resources or architecture.
249000	254000	I hope everyone can get to know more about open data
254000	256000	and how to do these things.
258000	259000	OK.
263000	265000	This is my basic self-introduction.
265000	267000	I am a Ph.D. student at INU-S.
267000	270000	I graduated from Shenzhen University of Technology,
270000	275000	and I had three years of experience as a data scientist before I got my Ph.D.
275000	279000	This also allows me to focus on the problems in the industry
279000	282000	during my Ph.D. career.
283000	285000	This is what I just said.
285000	289000	We have been doing some community-related things.
289000	291000	For example, in the Cargo Competition,
291000	294000	if you are playing this kind of data science competition,
294000	296000	this is the most famous competition at present.
296000	299000	We have held an energy prediction competition on it.
299000	301000	In addition, we also have some open data.
301000	303000	I put it in Cargo.
303000	305000	Cargo not only holds competitions,
305000	307000	but also provides an open data platform
307000	310000	for everyone to upload data and play together.
310000	314000	In addition, we also have OpenCourse on EDX.
314000	318000	It is mainly about construction, architecture, and engineering.
318000	320000	It is about building data,
320000	324000	including indoor humidity, CO2, and energy.
324000	328000	How to use some Python programs
328000	330000	to process these data,
330000	333000	and how to build a simple machine learning model.
333000	335000	Its difficulty is very simple.
335000	337000	Even people who don't have much programming experience
337000	339000	can take this course.
339000	342000	You don't need to have professional knowledge in architecture.
342000	344000	As long as you want to learn
344000	348000	how to use Python in the scientific field
348000	350000	or in some simple data processing,
350000	353000	I think this course is quite suitable.
353000	355000	This is today's agenda.
355000	359000	Because today's topic is mainly energy prediction,
359000	362000	we will spend some time reviewing
362000	364000	past energy prediction models and methods.
364000	367000	Next, we will use Cargo Competition
367000	369000	energy prediction competition as an example.
369000	373000	How do people predict energy?
373000	376000	What strategy do data scientists use
376000	379000	to accurately predict energy?
379000	382000	Next is Project Study.
382000	385000	We will use Taiwan's open energy data
385000	387000	to do a simple experiment
387000	389000	to see how it works.
389000	392000	Finally, we will introduce some interesting open data sets.
392000	395000	It is mainly about Taiwan's weather,
395000	398000	or open data sets related to holidays.
400000	401000	First of all,
401000	403000	I would like to let you feel
403000	407000	what the energy trend looks like.
407000	408000	This is a year,
408000	412000	from January 2017 to the end of the year.
412000	414000	This is an actual electricity meter
414000	416000	obtained from a campus in Taiwan.
416000	418000	First, I would like to let you observe
418000	421000	what is special about this electricity meter.
422000	427000	First, we can zoom in here.
427000	430000	You can see that after zooming in,
430000	432000	you can see some trends.
432000	434000	Because it collects data every hour,
434000	435000	so you can see that
435000	439000	a day is actually a profile like this.
439000	440000	It will have a peak,
440000	441000	which is around noon.
441000	444000	So you can see that the first pattern
444000	446000	is actually a weekly pattern.
446000	448000	It is weekly.
449000	453000	1 to 5 is actually a fixed working pattern.
453000	455000	It is high at noon and low at night.
455000	456000	But there is no one on the 6th,
456000	459000	so the peak is a little lower.
472000	474000	The next pattern is vocation.
475000	478000	1 to 5 is very low.
478000	480000	That's because it's the Chinese New Year.
480000	482000	It's the time of the lunar new year,
482000	484000	so the energy is relatively low.
484000	486000	In addition, there is a seasonal trend.
486000	489000	In the summer or hot weather,
489000	490000	the energy is relatively high.
490000	492000	In the winter or cold weather,
492000	493000	the energy is relatively low.
493000	494000	This is normal
494000	495000	because Taiwan is a country
495000	496000	that focuses on heat.
496000	498000	Most of us don't have heaters,
498000	499000	so in winter,
499000	501000	the energy is relatively low.
502000	505000	So this is our first and simplest model.
505000	507000	It is also a more classic model.
507000	510000	It is a TOWT model
510000	512000	proposed by Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
512000	515000	TOW stands for Time of Week.
515000	516000	That is to say,
516000	519000	if we take the number of hours of a week
519000	521000	as X-axis and draw it out,
521000	523000	the energy is actually 365 days.
523000	525000	If you put it on this graph,
525000	526000	you can see that 1 to 5
526000	528000	is actually very regular,
528000	530000	which is higher during the day.
530000	533000	It is relatively low at night.
533000	534000	So we have several variables.
534000	536000	The first one is the time of week.
536000	537000	The second variable is what I just said.
537000	539000	It actually has something to do
539000	540000	with the temperature of the outside air.
540000	542000	So what we draw here
542000	543000	is the relationship
543000	546000	between temperature and energy.
546000	549000	But we also distinguish
549000	551000	whether it is occupied or unoccupied.
551000	552000	That is to say,
552000	553000	is there anyone or no one here?
553000	555000	But we can see that at night,
555000	557000	we will define it as the so-called no one.
557000	558000	During the day,
558000	560000	we will define it as the so-called someone.
560000	562000	So this division is actually very rough.
562000	564000	It may be according to what time to go to work,
564000	565000	what time to get off work,
565000	566000	and then cut it like this.
566000	567000	But when you cut it out,
567000	568000	you can see that
568000	569000	when it is occupied,
569000	571000	its trend is very obvious.
571000	572000	This is a
574000	575000	low-temperature
576000	577000	and high-temperature
578000	579000	transition.
579000	580000	Occupied is that it is
582000	583000	with regression.
583000	585000	It is actually a linear model.
585000	586000	That's it.
586000	588000	Basically, it is with
588000	589000	a linear model.
589000	590000	There will be a linear model.
590000	592000	Then it is related to temperature.
592000	594000	The return line of temperature here
594000	595000	is a
596000	598000	division to return.
598000	599000	Because in fact,
600000	603000	it is related to temperature.
603000	605000	If you call it out,
605000	606000	you will find that
606000	608000	cooling is actually related.
608000	610000	If in some Korean countries,
610000	612000	when your temperature is getting lower,
612000	613000	its energy will rise.
613000	615000	That's mainly because of heating.
616000	618000	It's a simple linear return.
618000	620000	So often you can
620000	622000	Of course, you can use a polynomial,
622000	624000	maybe two-dimensional or three-dimensional to beat.
624000	626000	Of course, you can also use a division.
626000	627000	Then again, if it is occupied,
627000	629000	there is no one.
629000	631000	Then it will be more like
631000	632000	using temperature to return.
632000	633000	It is a
633000	634000	single
634000	636000	one-dimensional
636000	637000	linear return.
637000	638000	Because at night,
638000	640000	it is usually simpler.
642000	644000	This is the result of the return.
644000	646000	In fact,
646000	648000	it can catch the profile.
648000	650000	It's just that sometimes the effect
650000	652000	is not so good in some details.
652000	653000	You can see some details
653000	654000	There will be a shock.
654000	656000	So its R-squared is about
656000	658000	less than 0.6.
658000	660000	The next one is a more traditional
660000	662000	physical model, thermal network.
662000	664000	It is basically the structure of the building.
664000	666000	There is heat melt, heat bamboo.
666000	667000	That is to say,
667000	669000	the temperature of the outside world
669000	671000	and the temperature inside
671000	672000	its temperature difference
672000	673000	will cause
673000	675000	its heat to be stored
675000	677000	in the wall.
677000	679000	Or it is said that it is
679000	681000	looking at the thickness of the wall
681000	683000	or its material.
683000	685000	Then decide how fast
685000	687000	it goes into the room.
687000	689000	So usually outside
689000	691000	For example, the surface temperature of the wall
691000	693000	and the surface temperature of the wall
693000	695000	in the room will have a
695000	696000	type.
696000	698000	In addition, the temperature difference
698000	700000	in the room will be relatively
700000	701000	slower.
701000	703000	So under this condition,
703000	705000	we will actually
705000	707000	make a building
707000	709000	all made up of heat melt and heat bamboo.
709000	711000	For example,
711000	713000	we may have
713000	715000	three heat bamboo
715000	717000	and two heat melt.
717000	719000	The outer wall or
719000	721000	internal mass
721000	723000	is a bit like an indoor furniture or an indoor wall.
723000	725000	The whole building can be done
725000	727000	in this way.
727000	729000	Its advantage is that it is very precise.
729000	731000	Its disadvantage is that you have to
731000	733000	decide how many heat melt and heat bamboo it has.
733000	735000	To be honest, this thing is not very simple.
735000	737000	The next one
737000	739000	is the machine learning
739000	741000	that we are more popular with now.
741000	743000	Here is an example of
743000	745000	LightGBM model.
745000	747000	Let's use this model to
747000	749000	make it.
749000	751000	The main advantage of this model is that
751000	753000	its computing speed is very fast and
753000	755000	its tuning is relatively simple.
755000	757000	So we usually use
757000	759000	this model
759000	761000	to do some competitions or some early tests
761000	763000	and so on.
763000	765000	Most of the participants
765000	767000	use this model
767000	769000	to do the cargo competition later.
769000	771000	The model here is actually
771000	773000	the time we just said.
773000	775000	It may be the number of hours in a day.
775000	777000	It is also a Sunday.
777000	779000	In addition, there is outdoor air temperature.
779000	781000	There are other IOTs
781000	783000	or META
783000	785000	or Lag Feature.
785000	787000	It can eat more parameters
787000	789000	than the linear model just now
789000	791000	to capture some more
791000	793000	detailed information.
797000	799000	In addition,
799000	801000	there are so many variables
801000	803000	we just mentioned.
803000	805000	For example, CO2 or
805000	807000	temperature
807000	809000	or weekday
809000	811000	or seasonal hours.
811000	813000	Which of these variables
813000	815000	is the most important?
815000	817000	The model of LightGBM can also tell us
817000	819000	that in the process of modeling,
819000	821000	we found that
821000	823000	the energy 24 hours ago
823000	825000	is the most important.
825000	827000	Then there is the outdoor temperature, etc.
827000	829000	It can tell you the importance of these parameters.
829000	831000	The importance is relatively low.
831000	833000	Maybe you can
833000	835000	get rid of it.
835000	837000	Of course,
837000	839000	some people will think that
839000	841000	the result of LightGBM
841000	843000	will be better than
843000	845000	the linear model just now.
845000	847000	It is less
847000	849000	detailed.
849000	851000	The score is 0.6.
851000	853000	Some people will think
853000	855000	that Neural Network
855000	857000	is another
857000	859000	popular method.
859000	861000	We often need to learn more about this method.
861000	863000	Indeed, this method
863000	865000	is often used in energy prediction.
865000	867000	Such as LSTM or RNN.
867000	869000	However,
869000	871000	unlike Tree-based models,
871000	873000	such as LightGBM,
873000	875000	XGBoost,
875000	877000	or Random Forest,
877000	879000	RNN
879000	881000	usually requires
881000	883000	more training time.
883000	885000	When you tune this model,
885000	887000	you will spend a lot of time and energy.
887000	889000	So in a short-term
889000	891000	competition or a mid-term project,
891000	893000	we still use
893000	895000	Tree-based models like LightGBM.
895000	897000	It is relatively fast
897000	899000	and efficient.
901000	903000	Let's jump to
903000	905000	the Kaggle competition.
905000	907000	Let's see how
907000	909000	professional data scientists
909000	911000	predict
911000	913000	the building's
913000	915000	population.
915000	917000	First, let me briefly introduce Kaggle.
917000	919000	Some people may not be familiar with it.
919000	921000	Kaggle is a subsidiary
921000	923000	of Google.
923000	925000	It is an online community
925000	927000	where data scientists,
927000	929000	students,
929000	931000	or social people
931000	933000	can share their ideas,
933000	935000	share data,
935000	937000	and participate in the competition.
937000	939000	There are three parts
939000	941000	of Kaggle platform.
941000	943000	The first part is competition.
943000	945000	There will be some sponsors.
945000	947000	It could be a company
947000	949000	or a school.
949000	951000	They will give prizes.
951000	953000	Kaggle will help them hold the competition.
953000	955000	There are some interesting competitions.
955000	957000	For example, Jamstree,
957000	959000	where you can use Wi-Fi
959000	961000	to predict where people are.
963000	965000	Next is dataset.
965000	967000	People can freely
967000	969000	upload their dataset.
969000	971000	For example,
971000	973000	COVID-19 vaccine development,
973000	975000	or Netflix,
975000	977000	or Trump's Twitter.
977000	979000	This is also an interesting topic.
979000	981000	Datasets include
981000	983000	professional or non-professional
983000	985000	data.
985000	987000	It is an interesting platform.
987000	989000	The last part is
989000	991000	notebook.
991000	993000	It is a code.
993000	995000	People will put their code on it.
995000	997000	It includes
997000	999000	how to visualize
999000	1001000	or model.
1001000	1003000	Basically,
1003000	1005000	you can copy the notebook
1005000	1007000	and do the same thing.
1007000	1009000	This notebook can
1009000	1011000	connect to the competition
1011000	1013000	and dataset.
1013000	1015000	Basically, you can use
1015000	1017000	the cloud resources,
1017000	1019000	CPU and GPU,
1019000	1021000	to run the dataset
1021000	1023000	on the platform.
1023000	1025000	You can even use the resources
1025000	1027000	to participate in the competition.
1027000	1029000	You don't even need to use
1029000	1031000	your local notebook to run the model.
1031000	1033000	You can use the cloud resources
1033000	1035000	to upload and compute the data.
1035000	1037000	Let me introduce
1037000	1039000	what the competition is.
1039000	1041000	There are
1041000	1043000	more than 2,000
1043000	1045000	data sets.
1045000	1047000	They are from more than 1,000
1047000	1049000	countries around the world.
1049000	1051000	We want to find a good algorithm
1051000	1053000	to accurately predict
1053000	1055000	the resources of most of the buildings.
1055000	1057000	In the past,
1057000	1059000	most researchers
1059000	1061000	said that
1061000	1063000	some buildings are very fast,
1063000	1065000	some buildings are very accurate,
1065000	1067000	some buildings are very easy to run,
1067000	1069000	and so on.
1069000	1071000	But if we have so many buildings
1071000	1073000	across different countries,
1073000	1075000	it will be a more general way.
1075000	1077000	It's not just a case of
1077000	1079000	a single building or a single country.
1079000	1081000	This is the purpose
1081000	1083000	of the energy competition.
1083000	1085000	To find the most general
1085000	1087000	and accurate way.
1089000	1091000	This dataset
1091000	1093000	contains some data,
1093000	1095000	such as the most basic
1095000	1097000	meter reading.
1097000	1099000	This is mainly
1099000	1101000	the data of the meter.
1101000	1103000	It may be 24 hours,
1103000	1105000	single year data,
1105000	1107000	and its height.
1107000	1109000	In addition, there is building meta,
1109000	1111000	what kind of site it is,
1111000	1113000	and what kind of
1113000	1115000	purpose it is.
1115000	1117000	It may be office buildings, it may be school buildings,
1117000	1119000	square feet, floor area, etc.
1119000	1121000	It also provides
1121000	1123000	temperature, humidity,
1123000	1125000	cloud load, etc.
1127000	1129000	In this competition, it will provide
1129000	1131000	training data for 2016
1131000	1133000	to train your model.
1133000	1135000	You have to predict the energy data
1135000	1137000	for 2017 and 2018.
1139000	1141000	In this competition,
1141000	1143000	the method of the competition is
1143000	1145000	that you will first download your dataset,
1145000	1147000	which is your training data.
1147000	1149000	It includes the electric meter data
1149000	1151000	and weather data.
1151000	1153000	After training your model,
1153000	1155000	you can
1155000	1157000	upload your answer.
1157000	1159000	After uploading,
1159000	1161000	it will calculate a score.
1161000	1163000	You can see the score
1163000	1165000	on the leaderboard.
1167000	1169000	Now let's take a look at
1169000	1171000	the result of this competition.
1171000	1173000	First of all, it is very interesting that
1173000	1175000	most of the applications are Python.
1175000	1177000	Python is the most popular application now.
1177000	1179000	There is a little bit, but not the most.
1181000	1183000	What kind of machine learning models
1183000	1185000	do you use?
1185000	1187000	In this competition, it is usually
1187000	1189000	gradient boosting.
1189000	1191000	Because this data belongs to
1191000	1193000	tabular data,
1193000	1195000	it is structured,
1195000	1197000	like Excel table data.
1197000	1199000	In TreeBase model,
1199000	1201000	they are best at solving this problem.
1201000	1203000	In NN,
1203000	1205000	it is not impossible to deal with this problem.
1205000	1207000	Because the training time is too long,
1207000	1209000	and you need to tune the parameters
1209000	1211000	for a long time.
1211000	1213000	Then there are some tags.
1213000	1215000	You can find that
1215000	1217000	most of the notebooks
1217000	1219000	are provided by EDA or Beginner,
1219000	1221000	which are more visualized.
1223000	1225000	Data is its exploration,
1225000	1227000	which parameters it has,
1227000	1229000	its distribution,
1229000	1231000	and its time series.
1235000	1237000	Let's take a look at
1237000	1239000	most of the solutions.
1239000	1241000	You can see that
1241000	1243000	the rank is from
1243000	1245000	high to low,
1245000	1247000	from 9th to over 2000.
1247000	1249000	You can see that the score
1249000	1251000	can be from low to high.
1251000	1253000	Low means that this side is better.
1253000	1255000	Because the score here is actually
1255000	1257000	error, the lower the better.
1257000	1259000	You can see that
1259000	1261000	most people use
1261000	1263000	removeAllLiers
1263000	1265000	to remove data,
1265000	1267000	and imputation
1267000	1269000	is to make some
1269000	1271000	data maintenance.
1271000	1273000	Not everyone does this.
1273000	1275000	In Feature Strategy,
1275000	1277000	in Holiday Feature,
1277000	1279000	and Categorical Statistical Feature,
1279000	1281000	it depends on each person.
1281000	1283000	It doesn't seem to be consistent.
1283000	1285000	The number of Feature that everyone uses
1285000	1287000	is either a lot or a little.
1287000	1289000	Some people just didn't publish it.
1289000	1291000	I think the most interesting thing is
1291000	1293000	in Feature Strategy,
1293000	1295000	you can see that the numbers here
1295000	1297000	represent the number of models.
1297000	1299000	The higher the score,
1299000	1301000	the more models they prefer to use.
1301000	1303000	Why is that?
1303000	1305000	In this kind of data competition,
1305000	1307000	if you use a single model,
1307000	1309000	its performance is usually limited.
1309000	1311000	But if you use different models today,
1311000	1313000	for example, you use NN,
1313000	1315000	you use lightGBN,
1315000	1317000	or you use different modeling methods,
1317000	1319000	you put all the results of these modeling
1319000	1321000	If you use a simple average,
1321000	1323000	sometimes you can get very good results.
1323000	1325000	Maybe 0.5 times the first model,
1325000	1327000	0.5 times the second model,
1327000	1329000	and then add it up,
1329000	1331000	its performance may be better than individual models.
1331000	1333000	So that's why they use so many
1333000	1335000	models to do the average.
1335000	1337000	Because it can
1337000	1339000	effectively improve the performance of the model.
1343000	1345000	Let's take out the top five
1345000	1347000	and take a look at its content.
1347000	1349000	The most important thing is that
1349000	1351000	in preprocessing,
1351000	1353000	it is very important to remove anomalies
1353000	1355000	or outliers.
1355000	1357000	Because in this competition,
1357000	1359000	there are a lot of data missing and outliers.
1359000	1361000	In fact, this is not only found in this competition.
1361000	1363000	In fact, most of the real world data
1363000	1365000	is like this,
1365000	1367000	a lot of data missing, a lot of outliers.
1367000	1369000	If you don't do this,
1369000	1371000	it may cause your model to learn
1371000	1373000	some strange patterns or phenomena.
1373000	1375000	Next is features.
1375000	1377000	This is not necessarily the case.
1377000	1379000	Some people use 10, some use 28.
1379000	1381000	Some have outliers, some don't.
1381000	1383000	It depends on how you choose.
1383000	1385000	In modeling,
1385000	1387000	you can see that most of them use
1387000	1389000	LinearGBN, XGBoost,
1389000	1391000	which are tree-based models.
1391000	1393000	There are relatively few NNN models.
1393000	1395000	Post-processing,
1395000	1397000	as I just said, is a model
1397000	1399000	to do the average.
1399000	1401000	It's actually ensembling.
1401000	1403000	I made a lot of models today and
1404000	1406000	this is a simple
1406000	1408000	flowchart they provide.
1408000	1410000	This is the first flowchart they provide.
1410000	1412000	You can see the pre-processing in front of it.
1412000	1414000	This is what I just said.
1414000	1416000	Feature engineering.
1416000	1418000	Then there are a lot of models.
1418000	1420000	Finally, do the ensembling prediction.
1420000	1422000	These predicted results
1422000	1424000	are averaged.
1424000	1426000	In fact,
1426000	1428000	every
1428000	1430000	flowchart in the competition is a bit like this.
1430000	1432000	They do some pre-processing.
1432000	1434000	Then there are a lot of models.
1434000	1436000	Then do the ensembling.
1436000	1438000	This is also a classic
1438000	1440000	machine learning pipeline.
1440000	1442000	Pre-processing, modeling,
1442000	1444000	and then
1444000	1446000	if it's ensembling,
1446000	1448000	it's more of a special use than set.
1448000	1450000	It's a method
1450000	1452000	that will be used to get high scores.
1454000	1456000	The third is a similar method.
1456000	1458000	This competition,
1458000	1460000	to be honest,
1460000	1462000	is more data science.
1462000	1464000	If the audience
1464000	1466000	is more interested
1466000	1468000	in this place,
1468000	1470000	you can check the details
1470000	1472000	in our publication.
1472000	1474000	We have a review paper
1474000	1476000	for this competition.
1476000	1478000	You can go up and see the details of this competition.
1478000	1480000	If you want to know the program,
1480000	1482000	you can go to Github
1482000	1484000	to find some models
1484000	1486000	or some details.
1486000	1488000	In addition,
1488000	1490000	we even have their interview videos.
1490000	1492000	You can also find these YouTube videos
1492000	1494000	from Github
1494000	1496000	to see how they introduce their models
1496000	1498000	and how they do things.
1498000	1500000	The main purpose of talking about Kaggle today
1500000	1502000	is to give some
1502000	1504000	slightly interested in
1504000	1506000	energy prediction, but not
1506000	1508000	too familiar with these machine learning models.
1508000	1510000	It's a simple overview.
1510000	1512000	How does this competition work?
1512000	1514000	What kind of model is it?
1516000	1518000	Next, we will talk about
1518000	1520000	our project study today.
1520000	1522000	We want to do low prediction
1522000	1524000	using data from Taiwan.
1524000	1526000	We want to ask
1526000	1528000	if we can really do
1528000	1530000	an energy prediction service.
1532000	1534000	Let me put this PowerPoint
1534000	1536000	aside first.
1536000	1538000	This is the Kaggle
1538000	1540000	platform I just mentioned.
1540000	1542000	If you go to
1542000	1544000	kaggle.com,
1544000	1546000	you can come in here.
1546000	1548000	There will be a bunch of competitions,
1548000	1550000	some data, and notebooks.
1550000	1552000	Here,
1552000	1554000	Project Tyra has created
1554000	1556000	four notebooks.
1556000	1558000	You can see that
1558000	1560000	there are a lot of Python programs in this notebook.
1560000	1562000	You can just copy
1562000	1564000	and run it.
1564000	1566000	Here,
1566000	1568000	I want to copy
1568000	1570000	this notebook I have already built.
1570000	1572000	If you want to copy
1572000	1574000	and you want to use my notebook,
1574000	1576000	you can use the Copy & Edit Notebook here.
1576000	1578000	Click on it.
1578000	1580000	It will create a new copy here.
1584000	1586000	You can see that
1586000	1588000	it will use
1588000	1590000	cloud resources in this notebook.
1590000	1592000	But it's on the narrow path now.
1592000	1594000	There are some datasets here.
1596000	1598000	The dataset here is
1598000	1600000	from the Kaggle dataset.
1600000	1602000	You can read it directly
1602000	1604000	into this notebook.
1604000	1606000	You can see some CPU and RAM here.
1606000	1608000	You can even run GPU
1608000	1610000	and use its cloud resources
1610000	1612000	to do some operations.
1612000	1614000	In this notebook,
1614000	1616000	the first thing we need to do
1616000	1618000	is to download data.
1618000	1620000	We want to download weather data
1620000	1622000	and energy data.
1622000	1624000	Let's run this thing
1624000	1626000	on the scene.
1626000	1628000	Run all.
1628000	1630000	At the same time,
1630000	1632000	let's introduce
1632000	1634000	today's dataset.
1634000	1636000	The first is energy data.
1636000	1638000	It's data from Taiwan Electricity.
1638000	1640000	It contains
1640000	1642000	some peak
1642000	1644000	power consumption
1644000	1646000	per day.
1646000	1648000	The peak power consumption
1648000	1650000	of Taiwan Electricity
1650000	1652000	per day.
1652000	1654000	In addition,
1654000	1656000	there are energy categories
1656000	1658000	of Taiwan Electricity.
1658000	1660000	There are a lot of energy categories in Taiwan.
1660000	1662000	There are traditional
1662000	1664000	blue gas,
1664000	1666000	blue coal, nuclear energy,
1666000	1668000	and wind and solar energy.
1668000	1670000	These data
1670000	1672000	are also released by Taiwan Electricity.
1674000	1676000	In addition,
1676000	1678000	I know some listeners
1678000	1680000	are more interested in
1680000	1682000	local energy.
1682000	1684000	For example,
1684000	1686000	how much electricity they use
1686000	1688000	in a village or a city.
1688000	1690000	Taiwan Electricity does have some data
1690000	1692000	in this part,
1692000	1694000	but it's not covered
1694000	1696000	in today's speech.
1696000	1698000	In addition, there are some village metadata,
1698000	1700000	such as its precision,
1700000	1702000	population,
1702000	1704000	and area.
1704000	1706000	For example, the open data provided by this website.
1706000	1708000	If you want to know
1708000	1710000	its outline, you can also find
1710000	1712000	the open data provided by Hulu.
1712000	1714000	The picture on the left
1714000	1716000	is a good data visualization.
1716000	1718000	It's a picture provided
1718000	1720000	by Prof. Chen
1720000	1722000	from FB.
1722000	1724000	As you can see,
1724000	1726000	the village area
1726000	1728000	and energy are mapped
1728000	1730000	together to see
1730000	1732000	the density of energy.
1734000	1736000	Let's take a look
1736000	1738000	at the data
1738000	1740000	provided by Hulu.
1740000	1742000	First,
1742000	1744000	we have the weather data.
1744000	1746000	We got the weather data
1746000	1748000	from the weather data.
1748000	1750000	We got data for 2 years.
1750000	1752000	The first year,
1752000	1754000	the winter temperature was lower than the summer one,
1754000	1756000	and the second year,
1756000	1758000	the temperature was higher than
1758000	1760000	the summer one.
1760000	1762000	The third year,
1762000	1764000	we took the average of the three points
1764000	1766000	and used them as feature
1766000	1768000	to predict the power consumption.
1768000	1770000	The next one is the energy data
1770000	1772000	from Taiwan.
1772000	1774000	There are a lot of data in it.
1774000	1776000	In addition to the
1776000	1778000	monitoring load,
1778000	1780000	there are also data from various
1780000	1782000	power generation sources.
1782000	1784000	We can take a look at
1784000	1786000	the industrial power consumption
1786000	1788000	and the electricity consumption.
1788000	1790000	For industrial power consumption,
1790000	1792000	we can see that
1792000	1794000	the annual power consumption
1794000	1796000	is relatively low.
1796000	1798000	The annual power consumption
1798000	1800000	is relatively low.
1800000	1802000	On weekends,
1802000	1804000	there is a fixed pattern.
1804000	1806000	There is a fixed pattern.
1806000	1808000	This is the so-called
1808000	1810000	near-peak power supply.
1810000	1812000	This is the so-called
1812000	1814000	near-peak power supply.
1814000	1816000	The power station must decide
1816000	1818000	how much electricity
1818000	1820000	to deal with the maximum
1820000	1822000	load on that day.
1822000	1824000	We can't let the maximum load
1824000	1826000	exceed the power supply,
1826000	1828000	or there will be power outages.
1828000	1830000	Next, there are wind power
1830000	1832000	and solar power.
1832000	1834000	Solar power is
1834000	1836000	relatively general.
1836000	1838000	It depends on how much radiation
1838000	1840000	you have that day.
1840000	1842000	In summer, it's more.
1842000	1844000	In winter, it's less.
1844000	1846000	Let's go back
1846000	1848000	to the data set.
1848000	1850000	As you can see,
1850000	1852000	weather data is what I just said.
1852000	1854000	You can use this to observe
1854000	1856000	the historical weather data.
1856000	1858000	the historical weather data.
1858000	1860000	This is the platform
1860000	1862000	that Cargo just grabbed.
1862000	1864000	This is the platform that Cargo just grabbed.
1864000	1866000	There is also a local weather forecast.
1866000	1868000	You can use the forecast API
1868000	1870000	provided by the Meteorological Bureau
1870000	1872000	to catch the forecast for the next week
1872000	1874000	and the weather forecast every three hours.
1874000	1876000	Google Trend
1876000	1878000	is more interesting.
1878000	1880000	You can search
1880000	1882000	the search volume
1882000	1884000	of a keyword on Google.
1884000	1886000	For example, you can search
1886000	1888000	the search volume
1888000	1890000	of a keyword on Google.
1890000	1892000	You can see a pattern.
1892000	1894000	One, two, three, four.
1894000	1896000	Sorry, I typed it wrong.
1896000	1898000	It's actually two, three, four, five.
1898000	1900000	It's Saturday and Sunday.
1900000	1902000	You can also say
1902000	1904000	that if I use
1904000	1906000	the date as a unit,
1906000	1908000	you can see that
1908000	1910000	one, two, three, four, five is higher,
1910000	1912000	and six is lower.
1912000	1914000	If you look at one and two,
1914000	1916000	you can see that
1916000	1918000	this is in the United States,
1918000	1920000	so it's actually lower
1920000	1922000	in the New Year
1922000	1924000	or in the National Day.
1924000	1926000	You can also see
1926000	1928000	that if I use
1928000	1930000	Taiwan's data as an example,
1930000	1932000	the search volume
1932000	1934000	mentioned in the first video
1934000	1936000	is the search volume
1936000	1938000	in Taiwan Campus.
1938000	1940000	If you compare the search volume
1940000	1942000	of Microsoft Excel,
1942000	1944000	you can see that
1944000	1946000	it can correspond to
1946000	1948000	some holidays,
1948000	1950000	such as the New Year,
1950000	1952000	and the search volume of
1952000	1954000	Excel becomes lower.
1954000	1956000	For example,
1956000	1958000	the search volume of
1958000	1960000	Microsoft Excel,
1960000	1962000	whether it's tourism
1962000	1964000	or your sales volume,
1964000	1966000	is a very useful keyword
1966000	1968000	to compare.
1968000	1970000	This is also mentioned that
1970000	1972000	if our Power Meter
1972000	1974000	is classified,
1974000	1976000	you can find that
1976000	1978000	some buildings are
1978000	1980000	related to education,
1980000	1982000	and some buildings
1982000	1984000	may be related to
1984000	1986000	the office,
1986000	1988000	which is also a very interesting
1988000	1990000	open data set.
1990000	1992000	Here I have provided
1992000	1994000	how to grab data
1994000	1996000	in Google Trend.
1996000	1998000	You can see that
1998000	2000000	it's lower in the New Year
2000000	2002000	and lower in the National Day.
2002000	2004000	For example,
2004000	2006000	October 10th.
2006000	2008000	October 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th
2008000	2010000	are National Day holidays,
2010000	2012000	so these days are also lower.
2012000	2014000	Holiday data
2014000	2016000	is actually
2016000	2018000	from a website
2018000	2020000	called TimeDate.
2020000	2022000	You can find
2022000	2024000	the holiday of
2024000	2026000	each country on it.
2026000	2028000	You just need to enter
2028000	2030000	your country's name on the website
2030000	2032000	and its year.
2032000	2034000	Then you can find the national holiday
2034000	2036000	that corresponds to that country.
2036000	2038000	This is also a very useful website,
2038000	2040000	so I also grabbed
2040000	2042000	some data.
2042000	2044000	In this notebook,
2044000	2046000	the main thing we do is
2046000	2048000	to grab data.
2048000	2050000	In the end,
2050000	2052000	what we can
2052000	2054000	generate is like this.
2054000	2056000	In this notebook,
2056000	2058000	there is
2058000	2060000	an output.
2060000	2062000	We can output
2062000	2064000	Google Trend CSV, Demand CSV, Holiday.
2064000	2066000	You can even download
2066000	2068000	the data directly from here.
2068000	2070000	It's quite convenient to
2070000	2072000	store data
2072000	2074000	and build a notebook.
2076000	2078000	Next,
2078000	2080000	if we want to
2080000	2082000	predict Taiwan's
2082000	2084000	energy,
2084000	2086000	we need to build a model.
2086000	2088000	Here,
2090000	2092000	our goal is to
2092000	2094000	meet the deadline on time.
2094000	2096000	Of course, there are other things
2096000	2098000	that we don't need to cover.
2098000	2100000	Let's use a simple
2100000	2102000	time-to-time load to predict.
2102000	2104000	This is one data per day,
2104000	2106000	which is the highest energy load
2106000	2108000	in a day.
2108000	2110000	If we only use the simplest
2110000	2112000	weekday to predict,
2112000	2114000	that is,
2114000	2116000	let's say it's Monday or Tuesday,
2116000	2118000	or it's Saturday or Sunday.
2118000	2120000	First of all,
2120000	2122000	we can look at its trend.
2122000	2124000	0 to 4 is Monday to Friday,
2124000	2126000	and 5 to 6 is Saturday.
2126000	2128000	1 to 5 is higher,
2128000	2130000	and Saturday is lower.
2130000	2132000	It's normal.
2132000	2134000	If we build a model like this,
2134000	2136000	it will look like
2136000	2138000	a weekly forecast.
2138000	2140000	It's like a blue line.
2140000	2142000	This is the so-called prediction.
2142000	2144000	It's very inaccurate,
2144000	2146000	because it only has
2146000	2148000	the feature of Monday.
2148000	2150000	Its Oscar O is only 0.1.
2150000	2152000	It's terrible.
2152000	2154000	For the second model,
2154000	2156000	if we want to be more seasonal,
2156000	2158000	we can add weather conditions.
2158000	2160000	We only add temperature today.
2160000	2162000	The temperature here
2162000	2164000	is the overall energy
2164000	2166000	forecast in Taiwan.
2166000	2168000	So we simply sample
2168000	2170000	the temperature of three regions,
2170000	2172000	Taipei, Tainan, and Taichung.
2172000	2174000	You can see that
2174000	2176000	if we
2176000	2178000	use temperature
2178000	2180000	and energy
2180000	2182000	to get a plot,
2182000	2184000	you can see that
2184000	2186000	there is a very obvious curve on weekday,
2186000	2188000	and there is a very obvious curve on weekend.
2188000	2190000	We use a two-dimensional curve
2190000	2192000	to draw it.
2192000	2194000	You can see that there is a very obvious relationship here.
2194000	2196000	So
2196000	2198000	after we add it here,
2198000	2200000	you can see that this prediction
2200000	2202000	is actually a lot more accurate.
2202000	2204000	It can roughly draw this seasonal line,
2204000	2206000	and its Oscar can reach 0.81.
2206000	2208000	Sorry, I forgot to mention that
2208000	2210000	the training data is used to train
2210000	2212000	the whole year of 2019,
2212000	2214000	and then use 2020
2214000	2216000	as our test data to see its accuracy.
2216000	2218000	So you can see
2218000	2220000	that even if we only have
2220000	2222000	weekly weather conditions,
2222000	2224000	the prediction of the next year
2224000	2226000	is actually quite accurate.
2226000	2228000	The third model
2228000	2230000	is to say that
2230000	2232000	in addition to the weather conditions here,
2232000	2234000	we can see some
2234000	2236000	of the predictions here,
2236000	2238000	but it's not very accurate.
2238000	2240000	The main reason is that the model can't know
2240000	2242000	which day is the holiday,
2242000	2244000	so you have to tell it this feature.
2244000	2246000	The third model is called Holiday,
2246000	2248000	which is the holiday data
2248000	2250000	we just got from IronDate.
2252000	2254000	How many types
2254000	2256000	of holiday types are there here?
2256000	2258000	0 is the most common,
2258000	2260000	1 is the most
2260000	2262000	common ordinary day,
2262000	2264000	that is, it doesn't have a holiday,
2264000	2266000	and 2 is the weekend.
2266000	2268000	You can see that their grouping methods
2268000	2270000	are not the same.
2270000	2272000	After adding this,
2272000	2274000	you can see that the prediction
2274000	2276000	here in the new year seems to be a little lower.
2276000	2278000	For example, around October 10,
2278000	2280000	it will also be here
2280000	2282000	in these three days,
2282000	2284000	its prediction value will also be lower.
2284000	2286000	That's because there's a feature
2286000	2288000	added to it,
2288000	2290000	so it's improved from 0.81 to
2290000	2292000	almost 0.9.
2292000	2294000	The most important thing is that
2294000	2296000	our scope can actually predict
2296000	2298000	the energy for the next week,
2298000	2300000	so it actually includes the previous day,
2300000	2302000	including the previous seven days
2302000	2304000	and so on, these past energy data
2304000	2306000	can actually be our feature.
2306000	2308000	For example, I'm going to predict tomorrow's energy,
2308000	2310000	but if I can know
2310000	2312000	what the trend
2312000	2314000	of today's energy looks like,
2314000	2316000	then we can use today's trend
2316000	2318000	and maybe add a little bit more.
2318000	2320000	If the temperature is high, we can add a little bit.
2320000	2322000	Then predict tomorrow's energy.
2322000	2324000	So the energy data
2324000	2326000	from the previous day or the previous seven days
2326000	2328000	is also a pretty useful feature.
2328000	2330000	I'm here in Australia.
2330000	2332000	If we add
2332000	2334000	the energy data
2334000	2336000	from the previous day
2336000	2338000	and the previous seven days
2338000	2340000	and two weeks ago,
2340000	2342000	you can see that
2342000	2344000	in fact,
2344000	2346000	they are highly related,
2346000	2348000	that is, the previous day
2348000	2350000	our current energy
2350000	2352000	their relationship
2352000	2354000	is very close.
2354000	2356000	The previous seven days or the previous 14 days
2356000	2358000	are also very close,
2358000	2360000	which is also reasonable.
2360000	2362000	It's like 9 o'clock in the morning
2362000	2364000	and 9 o'clock in the morning yesterday.
2364000	2366000	It's like 9 o'clock now and 9 o'clock
2366000	2368000	a week ago, and it's like
2368000	2370000	9 o'clock two weeks ago.
2370000	2372000	So after adding this feature,
2372000	2374000	our Oscar can directly
2374000	2376000	increase to 0.94.
2376000	2378000	This thing is of course based on
2378000	2380000	my short-term prediction today.
2380000	2382000	If you predict tomorrow or the next week's energy,
2382000	2384000	then I can use this
2384000	2386000	energy from the previous few days as my feature.
2388000	2390000	OK, so here,
2390000	2392000	this notebook is mainly to do this model training,
2392000	2394000	which is to establish this model.
2394000	2396000	At the end of this model,
2396000	2398000	when it is to be output,
2398000	2400000	we will actually use two years of data to do training.
2400000	2402000	Just to do some validation,
2402000	2404000	we might have to come out a year ago
2404000	2406000	to see how it works.
2406000	2408000	If the parameters of this model are fine
2408000	2410000	and the effect is very good,
2410000	2412000	then we can use two years of data
2412000	2414000	to do training.
2414000	2416000	So the output here is
2416000	2418000	actually a light GBM model.
2420000	2422000	The last notebook here
2422000	2424000	is actually a real-time prediction.
2424000	2426000	Then we use the light GBM model
2426000	2428000	we built just now
2428000	2430000	to import it in.
2430000	2432000	Then we can use this model to predict.
2432000	2434000	Just before doing the prediction,
2434000	2436000	we still have to grab some data.
2436000	2438000	Because what we just grabbed is historical data.
2438000	2440000	If we want to predict the energy
2440000	2442000	for the next seven days,
2442000	2444000	then we have to catch the future weather forecast.
2444000	2446000	Then we have to catch
2446000	2448000	the holiday data.
2448000	2450000	Then we also have to catch
2450000	2452000	the energy data from the previous few days
2452000	2454000	as our feature.
2454000	2456000	So the first thing here
2456000	2458000	is to spread some
2458000	2460000	energy data.
2460000	2462000	Here we can see
2462000	2464000	that we will catch
2464000	2466000	all the energy data this year.
2466000	2468000	Then you can see that
2468000	2470000	here is
2472000	2474000	the energy data
2474000	2476000	a month ago.
2476000	2478000	You can see that it is December,
2478000	2480000	January, and then the data by the end of January.
2480000	2482000	Here is also
2482000	2484000	the estimated data
2484000	2486000	provided by Taiden.
2486000	2488000	Their predicted data
2488000	2490000	to predict what it looks like
2490000	2492000	at the bottom of the peak.
2492000	2494000	Then we will
2494000	2496000	catch the weather forecast
2496000	2498000	from the Central Meteorological Bureau.
2498000	2500000	Then we can predict
2500000	2502000	the energy for the next seven days.
2502000	2504000	Basically, we use the model
2504000	2506000	of LightGBM.
2506000	2508000	Here we can catch the weather forecast
2508000	2510000	for Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan.
2510000	2512000	Because this is a notebook I made
2512000	2514000	a week ago.
2514000	2516000	January 28th to February 3rd
2516000	2518000	is the estimated date.
2518000	2520000	So this is Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan.
2520000	2522000	Here is the temperature provided by the weather forecast.
2522000	2524000	Then
2524000	2526000	the following
2526000	2528000	are some features,
2528000	2530000	such as the week,
2530000	2532000	one day ago, seven days ago,
2532000	2534000	and 14 days ago.
2534000	2536000	Because only the first day
2536000	2538000	has the energy of the day before,
2538000	2540000	so there will be data here.
2540000	2542000	From the second day,
2542000	2544000	there will be no data on the first day.
2544000	2546000	Because our prediction will actually start
2546000	2548000	from the first day,
2548000	2550000	and then predict the second day, the third day.
2550000	2552000	Then the data of the day before,
2552000	2554000	we will use the prediction value of the day before to put it in.
2554000	2556000	So we can look at
2556000	2558000	the prediction result.
2558000	2560000	The prediction result can actually be seen here.
2560000	2562000	That is to say,
2564000	2566000	here is the data.
2566000	2568000	The limit is what happened in the past.
2568000	2570000	The blue line and the green line are
2570000	2572000	the LGBM model we predicted.
2572000	2574000	The green line is the LGBM prediction.
2574000	2576000	You can see that our prediction seems to be low.
2576000	2578000	So we can
2578000	2580000	predict it.
2580000	2582000	We can evaluate it later.
2582000	2584000	What is the difference between the two
2584000	2586000	we predicted with LGBM?
2586000	2588000	Who is more accurate?
2588000	2590000	Or what is the difference between the two features?
2590000	2592000	Because this is
2592000	2594000	the prediction 11 days ago.
2594000	2596000	So I didn't make any changes to it.
2596000	2598000	We can now
2598000	2600000	take a look at the prediction result.
2602000	2604000	Ok.
2606000	2608000	This is the prediction result.
2608000	2610000	You can see that the orange line
2610000	2612000	is the
2612000	2614000	LGBM prediction.
2614000	2616000	The blue line is the LGBM prediction.
2616000	2618000	You can see that
2618000	2620000	at the beginning,
2620000	2622000	the error was very high.
2622000	2624000	The blue bar is the error.
2624000	2626000	We almost accurately predicted
2626000	2628000	what the energy would be like three days ago.
2628000	2630000	But as time goes by,
2630000	2632000	the accuracy is getting worse and worse.
2632000	2634000	It's mainly because of the weather forecast.
2634000	2636000	It's very likely that
2636000	2638000	the accuracy of the weather forecast
2638000	2640000	is getting worse and worse
2640000	2642000	from the first day to the second day.
2642000	2644000	Or the temperature I brought in
2644000	2646000	is not enough.
2646000	2648000	So the prediction is not very accurate.
2648000	2650000	LGBM's prediction
2650000	2652000	is relatively stable.
2652000	2654000	It can maintain
2654000	2656000	a certain error every day.
2656000	2658000	I don't know how to do it.
2658000	2660000	The error of the prediction
2660000	2662000	is mostly positive.
2662000	2664000	But this is just a seven-day data.
2664000	2666000	So it can't be
2666000	2668000	simply solved like this.
2668000	2670000	You can find this phenomenon
2670000	2672000	from these seven days.
2672000	2674000	The accuracy of the prediction
2674000	2676000	is not very different.
2676000	2678000	Ok.
2678000	2680000	I also put the link of the notebook here.
2680000	2682000	If you are interested, you can go to Kaggle.
2682000	2684000	Or you can search for the keyword
2684000	2686000	pocket tyrant.
2686000	2688000	Notebook.
2690000	2692000	I didn't miss anything in the beginning.
2692000	2694000	The first part is
2694000	2696000	the introduction of OpenDataSet.
2696000	2698000	A brief summary of today's summary.
2698000	2700000	In the field of architecture,
2700000	2702000	in the part of energy prediction,
2702000	2704000	in addition to being affected
2704000	2706000	by external conditions
2706000	2708000	and the variables of these environments,
2708000	2710000	behavior is also very important.
2710000	2712000	When do people go to work?
2712000	2714000	What time does he go to work?
2714000	2716000	Is it holiday or non-holiday that day?
2716000	2718000	Or is it weekend?
2718000	2720000	In fact, it has a great impact.
2720000	2722000	The second point is that we actually
2722000	2724000	learned from Kaggle Competition,
2724000	2726000	which is what we learned in the energy prediction competition.
2726000	2728000	First of all, the tree-based model
2728000	2730000	is actually
2730000	2732000	most of the solutions
2732000	2734000	that Wiener will use.
2734000	2736000	Mainly because of its performance
2736000	2738000	and its training time
2738000	2740000	and tuning parameter time
2740000	2742000	can achieve a balance.
2742000	2744000	Then you can achieve good performance.
2744000	2746000	So everyone will use this method.
2746000	2748000	The other thing is that
2748000	2750000	the data scientists in it
2750000	2752000	mainly focus on this.
2752000	2754000	What I mean is that these data scientists
2754000	2756000	don't have any personnel or
2756000	2758000	building-related background.
2758000	2760000	But based on their data skills,
2760000	2762000	it is the sharing of the community above.
2762000	2764000	Everyone shares with each other
2764000	2766000	what they found in these data.
2766000	2768000	What are the characteristics?
2768000	2770000	Then everyone can use these knowledge
2770000	2772000	to make the most accurate predictions
2772000	2774000	based on their model experience
2774000	2776000	and their know-how.
2776000	2778000	So the winners in the front
2778000	2780000	don't have any professional
2780000	2782000	building-related background.
2782000	2784000	Then there is the actual
2784000	2786000	demand forecasting model.
2786000	2788000	Then use Taiwan energy
2788000	2790000	to do the actual part.
2790000	2792000	In fact, Taiwan Open Data is very
2792000	2794000	enough to do such a model.
2794000	2796000	It takes about two years.
2796000	2798000	But in my opinion,
2798000	2800000	Taiwan Open Data is already enough
2800000	2802000	to build a model with good accuracy.
2802000	2804000	In the field of architecture.
2804000	2806000	Then there is
2806000	2808000	its performance.
2808000	2810000	It's pretty good.
2810000	2812000	Everyone can do more than 0.9.
2812000	2814000	And it's also very simple.
2814000	2816000	You can support it for free
2816000	2818000	in the Kaggle platform.
2818000	2820000	Finally, it is Open Dataset.
2820000	2822000	In fact, Taiwan has a very rich
2822000	2824000	and very diversified dataset.
2824000	2826000	Compared to other Open Datasets
2826000	2828000	Open Datasets are very limited.
2828000	2830000	Taiwan has a lot.
2830000	2832000	Of course, there are a lot of messy
2832000	2834000	and I don't know how to use the dataset.
2834000	2836000	But in fact, there are some very useful
2836000	2838000	and very interesting datasets that
2838000	2840000	everyone can play.
2840000	2842000	In addition, these datasets can help
2842000	2844000	researchers like us
2844000	2846000	to find some interesting patterns.
2846000	2848000	For example, Google Search
2848000	2850000	can also help you
2850000	2852000	to find some details
2852000	2854000	in Building Energy.
2854000	2856000	Next, we will have 10 minutes
2856000	2858000	for Q&A.
2860000	2862000	Thank you for the wonderful
2862000	2864000	presentation today.
2864000	2866000	You made a very good
2866000	2868000	summary.
2868000	2870000	About the competition
2870000	2872000	of Azure,
2872000	2874000	the competition on the Kaggle platform,
2874000	2876000	and some model introduction,
2876000	2878000	LGBM,
2878000	2880000	XGBoost,
2880000	2882000	or Neural Network,
2882000	2884000	as well as the overall introduction
2884000	2886000	of architecture prediction
2886000	2888000	and Open Data Science.
2888000	2890000	It's very exciting.
2890000	2892000	Now we see that
2892000	2894000	in the chat box,
2894000	2896000	a friend asked
2896000	2898000	that he wanted to ask
2898000	2900000	that there may be no accurate
2900000	2902000	temperature prediction in the future
2902000	2904000	when actually using it.
2904000	2906000	Will the performance of the model
2906000	2908000	be affected at this time?
2908000	2910000	In fact, it will.
2910000	2912000	It should be said that
2912000	2914000	the difference in temperature
2914000	2916000	may be that
2916000	2918000	according to our observation,
2918000	2920000	the temperature difference in weather forecast
2920000	2922000	is very full.
2922000	2924000	But the temperature
2924000	2926000	prediction error
2926000	2928000	is about 1-2 degrees.
2928000	2930000	Most weather forecasts
2930000	2932000	can accurately predict
2932000	2934000	the temperature profile.
2934000	2936000	For example, 18-29 degrees
2936000	2938000	is actually quite accurate.
2938000	2940000	Next is the architecture energy.
2940000	2942000	It's actually a pretty stable
2942000	2944000	profile.
2944000	2946000	It's not because the temperature suddenly rises
2946000	2948000	or falls.
2948000	2950000	So in this regard,
2950000	2952000	although the weather forecast
2952000	2954000	is not completely accurate,
2954000	2956000	it does not affect
2956000	2958000	the accuracy of the prediction.
2958000	2960000	Of course, if you want to predict
2960000	2962000	the next month or next week,
2962000	2964000	the prediction error may be slightly higher.
2964000	2966000	But if you predict
2966000	2968000	one day tomorrow or three days later,
2968000	2970000	I don't think the accuracy of the energy
2970000	2972000	will be much higher.
2976000	2978000	Thank you for your answer.
2978000	2980000	Do you have any questions
2980000	2982000	for the audience here?
2982000	2984000	You can mute your questions
2984000	2986000	or type them in the chat.
2994000	2996000	Hello, I'm Louis.
2996000	2998000	I have one last question.
2998000	3000000	It's a very good question.
3000000	3002000	It's a time series question.
3002000	3004000	How do you do validation?
3004000	3006000	You mentioned that you use
3006000	3008000	2019's trend on 2019
3008000	3010000	and then 2020's
3010000	3012000	to predict.
3012000	3014000	Is there a more complete
3014000	3016000	way to do validation?
3018000	3020000	Sorry to interrupt,
3020000	3022000	but before you answer,
3022000	3024000	I'd like to ask the audience
3024000	3026000	to introduce their backgrounds.
3026000	3028000	So that we can
3028000	3030000	get to know each other better.
3030000	3032000	Thank you.
3034000	3036000	I'm in the US.
3036000	3038000	I'm a data scientist.
3038000	3040000	I haven't done much
3040000	3042000	on the time series,
3042000	3044000	but I think it's pretty interesting.
3044000	3046000	I'd like to learn more.
3046000	3048000	No problem. Thank you for your question.
3048000	3050000	For the time series,
3050000	3052000	I'm not sure
3052000	3054000	what you mean by validation.
3054000	3056000	But if you mean
3056000	3058000	how to cut the fold,
3058000	3060000	how to cut the data
3060000	3062000	to do cross-validation.
3062000	3064000	For example, we cut four or five
3064000	3066000	common cuts.
3066000	3068000	We don't do shuffle.
3068000	3070000	We don't do random
3070000	3072000	cut.
3072000	3074000	We don't do random
3074000	3076000	cut.
3076000	3078000	We don't do random cross-validation.
3078000	3080000	For example,
3080000	3082000	we do training
3082000	3084000	for the first four years,
3084000	3086000	and then validation for the last year.
3086000	3088000	Or we do training for the next four years,
3088000	3090000	and then validation for the first year.
3090000	3092000	We want to
3092000	3094000	cut the time series
3094000	3096000	to do cross-validation,
3096000	3098000	not to do random
3098000	3100000	cut.
3100000	3102000	We don't do random
3102000	3104000	cut.
3104000	3106000	Because time series
3106000	3108000	is related to
3108000	3110000	time before and after.
3110000	3112000	So you can't
3112000	3114000	randomly do validation.
3114000	3116000	Does this answer your question?
3116000	3118000	Yes.
3118000	3120000	Thank you.
3120000	3122000	Okay.
3124000	3126000	What a wonderful discussion.
3126000	3128000	Does anyone
3128000	3130000	have any questions
3130000	3132000	to ask?
3132000	3134000	Hi, I'm
3134000	3136000	Xie Cheng.
3136000	3138000	Can you hear me?
3138000	3140000	Okay.
3140000	3142000	Hi.
3142000	3144000	I used to study in Taiwan University.
3144000	3146000	Now I'm studying in the US.
3146000	3148000	My question is
3148000	3150000	if
3150000	3152000	your model needs to be
3152000	3154000	used in the future,
3154000	3156000	will there be any security concerns?
3156000	3158000	For example,
3158000	3160000	maybe not too serious security.
3160000	3162000	Maybe there is a sudden event.
3162000	3164000	For example,
3164000	3166000	there is a joke about Excel
3166000	3168000	that occurs on holidays,
3168000	3170000	resulting in a large increase
3170000	3172000	in the search volume of Excel
3172000	3174000	on holidays,
3174000	3176000	or something like that.
3176000	3178000	How to avoid
3178000	3180000	this kind of
3180000	3182000	negative situation?
3182000	3184000	Yes, there is such a situation.
3184000	3186000	If you apply it to the industry,
3186000	3188000	you still have to set a threshold.
3188000	3190000	If the temperature
3190000	3192000	is normal in Taiwan,
3192000	3194000	it may be 0 to
3194000	3196000	40 degrees or so.
3196000	3198000	You may say
3198000	3200000	there is a mistake here,
3200000	3202000	I may stop my service.
3202000	3204000	You may tell users
3204000	3206000	why the service has stopped.
3206000	3208000	For example,
3208000	3210000	you can't use automatic
3210000	3212000	or something like that.
3212000	3214000	This is really necessary to add
3214000	3216000	additional rules to avoid such a situation.
3216000	3218000	Because in the industry,
3218000	3220000	if you use this kind of low prediction
3220000	3222000	to do automatic control,
3222000	3224000	there will be such a risk.
3224000	3226000	Cool.
3226000	3228000	I want to ask another question
3228000	3230000	related to Cargo.
3230000	3232000	I have been studying for a while.
3232000	3234000	I saw that last year,
3234000	3236000	I don't know what to say now.
3236000	3238000	Anyway, I saw two competitions last year.
3238000	3240000	One is the target of wheat,
3240000	3242000	and the other is
3242000	3244000	the image detection of
3244000	3246000	a special type.
3246000	3248000	In fact, I also know some traditional
3248000	3250000	breeders who have collected a lot of
3250000	3252000	this kind of image data.
3252000	3254000	Their quality may not be
3254000	3256000	so uniform,
3256000	3258000	but they may have to give up.
3258000	3260000	But if you put it on Cargo now,
3260000	3262000	let this kind of
3262000	3264000	data scientist community
3264000	3266000	have a good result.
3266000	3268000	I'm curious about this kind of academic unit
3268000	3270000	to put the data on it,
3270000	3272000	and then let everyone
3272000	3274000	come together
3274000	3276000	to find a solution
3276000	3278000	and then publish it.
3278000	3280000	Is there anything to pay attention to
3280000	3282000	in this process?
3282000	3284000	How is it usually achieved?
3284000	3286000	This Cargo competition,
3286000	3288000	because I was
3288000	3290000	preparing for this competition
3290000	3292000	at the end of the previous year.
3292000	3294000	At that time, I had not yet
3294000	3296000	entered the lab,
3296000	3298000	so I did not participate in this part.
3298000	3300000	But as far as I know,
3300000	3302000	they will actually do some cleaning first.
3302000	3304000	I mean, this is our lab,
3304000	3306000	because we are the organizer.
3306000	3308000	We will process these data first
3308000	3310000	and then confirm that
3310000	3312000	the quality of these data is probably no problem.
3312000	3314000	Then it will be sent to Cargo
3314000	3316000	and their team to explain the data.
3316000	3318000	Cargo also has a group of
3318000	3320000	very professional data scientists
3320000	3322000	to check the quality of the data,
3322000	3324000	which is probably OK,
3324000	3326000	and they won't clear the data for you,
3326000	3328000	because data missing and outliers
3328000	3330000	are things to deal with in the competition.
3330000	3332000	Then they will go and see
3332000	3334000	if the data is OK,
3334000	3336000	and then they will
3336000	3338000	test it internally
3338000	3340000	and confirm that
3340000	3342000	if the data is used for the competition,
3342000	3344000	how much training data and validation data
3344000	3346000	do I have?
3346000	3348000	Although when we give him the data,
3348000	3350000	we give him two years of training and one year of validation.
3350000	3352000	But they strongly recommend
3352000	3354000	one year of training and two years of prediction.
3354000	3356000	They have their
3356000	3358000	basis,
3358000	3360000	which is what they think,
3360000	3362000	and we respect it.
3362000	3364000	They have a lot of know-how
3364000	3366000	to organize this competition.
3366000	3368000	Most of the Cargo competitions so far
3368000	3370000	are not very controversial,
3370000	3372000	so I think Cargo and their internal team
3372000	3374000	are still very strong.
3374000	3376000	If it's more local,
3376000	3378000	their data platform,
3378000	3380000	competition platform,
3380000	3382000	sometimes they have a lot of controversy,
3382000	3384000	and sometimes the quality of the competition
3384000	3386000	is poor,
3386000	3388000	but I can't say that the competition platform is wrong.
3388000	3390000	That is, their internal professionals
3390000	3392000	don't have much resources,
3392000	3394000	so they can't hire such a large team
3394000	3396000	to check the details of these competitions.
3396000	3398000	In addition, the domestic platform
3398000	3400000	doesn't charge
3400000	3402000	the organizer.
3402000	3404000	If it's in Cargo,
3404000	3406000	the organizer will use their team
3406000	3408000	to check the data and collect the fees.
3408000	3410000	So the prize is not only
3410000	3412000	the organizer
3412000	3414000	who provides the prize,
3414000	3416000	but also the host of the competition
3416000	3418000	who needs to pay
3418000	3420000	an extra fee to Cargo.
3420000	3422000	Yes,
3422000	3424000	to ensure that this competition
3424000	3426000	is of good quality.
3426000	3428000	Thank you. Nice talk.
3428000	3430000	Thank you for your question.
3430000	3432000	I don't rule out
3432000	3434000	any discussion
3434000	3436000	about Open Data Say
3436000	3438000	in Cargo competitions.
3438000	3440000	You can ask any questions.
3440000	3442000	It's fun.
3442000	3444000	Due to time constraints,
3444000	3446000	we will open the last question.
3446000	3448000	Let's see
3448000	3450000	if there are any questions from the audience.
3458000	3460000	If not,
3460000	3462000	we will open the last question
3462000	3464000	for our host.
3464000	3466000	It's the same.
3466000	3468000	Please introduce yourself.
3468000	3470000	Hello,
3470000	3472000	host and audience.
3472000	3474000	I am
3474000	3476000	the host,
3476000	3478000	Hu Junwei.
3478000	3480000	My father
3480000	3482000	used to be a student of
3482000	3484000	NTUC,
3484000	3486000	and I studied
3486000	3488000	renewable energy systems
3488000	3490000	at NTUC.
3490000	3492000	I am very interested in
3492000	3494000	today's topic.
3494000	3496000	I have a question.
3496000	3498000	This model
3498000	3500000	can be used
3500000	3502000	to assess
3502000	3504000	events in energy
3504000	3506000	or social development
3506000	3508000	such as dynamic events.
3508000	3510000	For example,
3510000	3512000	in 2016 and 2017,
3512000	3514000	there was a power outage
3514000	3516000	in Taipei.
3516000	3518000	Is there a way
3518000	3520000	to predict
3520000	3522000	when there will be
3522000	3524000	a power outage
3524000	3526000	in the next few days?
3526000	3528000	Or
3528000	3530000	in the case of
3530000	3532000	COVID-19,
3532000	3534000	many countries
3534000	3536000	are working
3536000	3538000	from home,
3538000	3540000	so the energy use
3540000	3542000	will be very different.
3542000	3544000	Is there a way
3544000	3546000	to do dynamic analysis
3546000	3548000	for specific events?
3548000	3550000	I would like to hear
3550000	3552000	your opinion.
3552000	3554000	I think it's pretty cool.
3554000	3556000	First of all,
3556000	3558000	if it is a power outage
3558000	3560000	or a power outage,
3560000	3562000	I think it is relatively difficult.
3562000	3564000	The first is that it is a rare event,
3564000	3566000	so the rare event
3566000	3568000	may only happen
3568000	3570000	ten times in the past.
3570000	3572000	It's hard to predict
3572000	3574000	because there is not enough data
3574000	3576000	for training.
3576000	3578000	Even if there are
3578000	3580000	a lot of events,
3580000	3582000	you need enough features
3582000	3584000	to describe them.
3584000	3586000	For example,
3586000	3588000	you need to detect
3588000	3590000	voltage, current,
3590000	3592000	frequency,
3592000	3594000	etc.
3594000	3596000	I don't know
3596000	3598000	if there is such open data,
3598000	3600000	but I know Kaggle
3600000	3602000	can also find open data like this.
3602000	3604000	Next,
3604000	3606000	let me think of
3606000	3608000	a recent competition
3608000	3610000	in IEEE.
3610000	3612000	They are specifically predicting
3612000	3614000	what the energy forecast
3614000	3616000	will look like after COVID-19.
3616000	3618000	They are heading
3618000	3620000	electricity demand forecasting post-COVID.
3620000	3622000	They want to know
3622000	3624000	what changes will happen
3624000	3626000	to most energy
3626000	3628000	after COVID-19.
3628000	3630000	Most of them should be
3630000	3632000	related to
3632000	3634000	human behavior.
3634000	3636000	I have done
3636000	3638000	one thing before.
3638000	3640000	If you use Google Keywords,
3640000	3642000	I can show you
3642000	3644000	quickly today.
3644000	3646000	If you use Google Trends,
3646000	3648000	this is what I found recently.
3648000	3650000	It is quite related to
3650000	3652000	travel keywords.
3652000	3654000	For example,
3654000	3656000	I went to
3656000	3658000	travel.
3664000	3666000	You can see that
3666000	3668000	it suddenly dropped
3668000	3670000	on March 1st.
3670000	3672000	It was quite stable
3672000	3674000	in the first four years.
3674000	3676000	It dropped in the summer,
3676000	3678000	but it suddenly dropped
3678000	3680000	in March this year.
3680000	3682000	Of course,
3682000	3684000	this is just a correlation.
3684000	3686000	Whether this is a causal relationship
3686000	3688000	may be confirmed in more detail.
3688000	3690000	This is just an example.
3690000	3692000	You can find out from some data
3692000	3694000	if you can predict
3694000	3696000	what will happen
3696000	3698000	to the energy
3698000	3700000	after COVID-19.
3700000	3702000	This is also what everyone is concerned about.
3702000	3704000	I am not sure
3704000	3706000	if this can be done.
3706000	3708000	You can find out
3708000	3710000	whether to describe
3710000	3712000	this feature.
3712000	3714000	This is a very cool question.
3714000	3716000	Thank you.
3718000	3720000	Thank you for the wonderful explanation.
3722000	3724000	Due to time constraints,
3724000	3726000	I know that
3726000	3728000	everyone here may have
3728000	3730000	some potential questions.
3730000	3732000	However,
3732000	3734000	this is the end of
3734000	3736000	today's presentation.
