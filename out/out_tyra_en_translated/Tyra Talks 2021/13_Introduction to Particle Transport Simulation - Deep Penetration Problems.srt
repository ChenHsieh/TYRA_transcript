00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The first TerraTalk in 2021, today is January 9th.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We are very happy today to invite Dr. Wang Mengren to tell us about his topic today.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
His topic today is Introduction to Particle Transport Simulation Deep Penetration Problems.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Before we start, let me introduce our speaker today.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
His name is Vince Mengren.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He is a Research Scientist at the University of Utah.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me introduce his background.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He is a Research Scientist at the University of Utah.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Before this, he got his PhD in Nuclear Engineering at Virginia Tech in 2019.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
His main research interest is Particle Transport Simulation.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is the topic he will talk about today.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is another topic that is not today's topic, but it is very cool.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It is Robotic Arm Applications in Nuclear Industry.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Obviously, you can't do anything by yourself.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is a very important application.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There is a very special thing.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is our online speech.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome our speaker.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please turn on the microphone so that our speaker can hear our applause.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Vince to give us a wonderful speech today.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll leave it to you.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you, Ian.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
First of all, thank you all for coming to listen to my speech.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My topic today is Introduction to Particle Transport Simulation.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Basically, Particle Transport Simulation can be used in many ways.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My main focus today is Deep Penetration Problem.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will introduce what Deep Penetration Problem is later.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In fact, this chart has already told you some information.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
At first, I will talk about what Particle Transport is.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why do we need Particle Transport?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Second, what are the main applications?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just said that Particle Transport has many applications.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If I have to talk about everything, I won't be able to finish it in an hour.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I'm focusing on Deep Penetration Problem today.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's actually a shielding problem.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Basically, you need to have a method to do this simulation.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There is a Governing Equation behind it.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Then you have to develop some methods to solve it.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I will talk about what the mainstream methods are now.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are their advantages and disadvantages?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are some more advanced methods?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Basically, I'm talking about Variance Reduction Techniques here.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Finally, of course, I will give a Demonstration Problem.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Finally, there is a Summary.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Before we solve any problem,

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we have to talk about the Governing Equation behind it.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The Governing Equation behind Particle Transport is the Boltzmann Transport Equation.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can see that the above equation looks very complicated.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is General Form.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You have Time Dependent Terms.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We talk about Particle Streaming.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your particle will be in Boundary Loss.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then you may have an extra position.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For example, if you are an electrolyte, you may have magnetic force.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Gravity is generally not considered.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because the particle is very small.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Then you have Collision.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The right side is basically Particle Gain.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When we calculate the Particle Transport,

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We will talk about whether it is Lost or Gain.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can see that the left side is basically Lost.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The right side is Gain.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't focus too much on Mathematics.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Because if you are not doing this field,

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Mathematics will take a long time to understand.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The above is General Form.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The following is basically

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you need to do radiation transfer calculation.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Calculate their mass.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the Governing Equation we usually use.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is from the above equation.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We talk about Steady State and Linear Boltzmann Equation.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You can see that there is a word called Linear here.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Steady State should not need to explain, everyone knows.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Basically, what we mean by Linear here is

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For example, if you want to calculate the mass today.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
For example, I am Photon today.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Photon will cause mass to me.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Today I assume that there will be no effect between Photon and Photon.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So this Linear is from here.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So you can see here

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Basically, it only looks like once.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is the function we want to solve.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We call it Flux.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Basically, you can see that the above and below

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
These two equations actually look a bit like.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The only difference is that one is General Form.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The other is Specifically.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We are not too independent and it is Linear.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We can explain a little bit about what this equation is doing.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Just use this example.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This example is basically if you go to the hospital.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You often see these X-ray machines.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This X-ray machine basically has a radiation source inside.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The middle one is inside.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Basically, a general X-ray machine is a beam of light.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Basically, you can circle a boundary.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If this beam of light runs out of this system.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't think about it.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because it basically won't come back.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Basically, my patient may be here.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You basically have to estimate the number of patients.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The beam of light that goes out here.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I just talked about streaming.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This beam of light has run out of this boundary.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Basically, it is unlikely to hit back again.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
On the one hand, the energy you hit is getting lower and lower.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Its path will be shorter and shorter.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So this is basically a little bit.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Just connect this equation.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is he talking about?

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Take advantage of this problem.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
OK.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Speaking of Particle Transport.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Its application is actually very wide.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What I just talked about is a medical radiation device.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Or a physical accelerator that is often used.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You need to generate high energy particles.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Basically, you know that when the electric field is turning.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You will put the light out.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Basically, you will need to design its radiation barrier.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How do you design it?

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
To make the staff at work.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't let its dosage exceed the specified limit.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Whether it's nuclear fusion or nuclear separation reaction.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I basically need it.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Nuclear fusion reaction, if you need a place.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Basically, it's the same as I said.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's basically a high-energy particle.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You cut it out again.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It will emit light.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Basically, you will have the same radiation barrier.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The problem needs to be calculated.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Nuclear separation reaction is no longer necessary.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
From the core to the radiation barrier outside.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Basically, you need Particle Transport.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Here is a brief introduction to Deep Penetration Problem.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Basically, I just talked about Particle Transport.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There are many applications.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Basically, Deep Penetration Problem is radiation barrier calculation.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How much radiation barrier material do you need?

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In front of your staff.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let your dosage reach the value you want.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's not too high.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Basically, we talk about Deep Penetration Problem in academia.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why do we talk about Deep Penetration Problem?

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because these particles need to go through.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If it has to go through such a thick barrier.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Basically, this calculation is not very easy.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So basically, we talk about Deep Penetration Problem.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Generally speaking, if you are talking about radiation barriers.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We will have an interesting example.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Basically, there are only three.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Mainly the first two.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Medium value and light value.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Basically, there is time for electrons.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Basically, when you need electrons.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Most of them are in medical equipment.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Medical radiation radiation source equipment.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In the nuclear industry.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Basically, we do not consider this.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because it is an electrolyte.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Then it's light.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It basically can't get out.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And the nuclear industry is basically.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The barriers you don't see are basically very thick.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So these two.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The first two are basically without electricity.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So it's easier to get out.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Basically.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Basically, every calculation.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to have his goal.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Basically, we just talked about it.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You have to protect the staff.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And you have to calculate.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Know how much your dosage is.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Here I listed some of the general.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The unit we will use for radiation.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can take a look.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is not directly related to the topic I am talking about today.

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Just mention it a little bit.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You basically have some units.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It is considered to be biological.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Like these are what we usually use.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Some of them are not.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Because you have these different particles.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It may cause damage to our human body.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Will be different.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Especially the seed.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
OK.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Ok, then.

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If we take a system to do.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Which one is.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If there is a color system.

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's do it.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For example.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You can take this.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This should be very necessary in Taiwan now.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because Taiwan is basically.

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now the nuclear power plant is going to be established.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You will have these radiation.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
In the process of loading the barrel.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
In the process of shipping.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You basically have to.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Calculate how much radiation it will protect.

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Basically, you can see.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Here is the nuclear fuel inside.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
These nuclear fuels are basically.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Burned in the reactor.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm talking about burning here.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Actually, it's not burning.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It is nuclear transmutation.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes, because basically the nuclear reaction.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not the same as the general chemical reaction.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes, basically you.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Burned in the reactor.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's basically been activated.

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is being activated.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Then you basically.

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
There may be these.

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
These radiation.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
These radiation are basically.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Spent nuclear.

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Used nuclear fuel.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Basically, it may be released.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Basically, you can't just.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Take it out.

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Then.

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Use people to operate.

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So basically it's all mechanical.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then put it in these barrels.

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
These barrels are basically very thick.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That light inside.

236
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Inside is the inner barrel.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Basically, that steel.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That stainless steel is basically.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's already 25 centimeters thick.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So basically there is such a thick.

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There is such a thick.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Radiation barrier.

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You basically have some particles.

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You don't need to think about it at all.

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For example, Alpha Particle.

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Alpha Particle.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You are basically in the air.

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's about five centimeters.

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So don't say you have.

250
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You have a little bit.

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then Electron doesn't have to say.

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It is very light and has electricity.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then Neutrinos basically.

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It doesn't react with matter.

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So we don't consider it.

256
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So basically.

257
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Ah.

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We basically.

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are in the nuclear industry.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We have to calculate.

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ah.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If it's a measure.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Basically, most of them are these two.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it's about 100%.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The rest is basically.

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can say it is negligible.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It depends on the case.

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
OK.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So basically you can see that.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because we only.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Only interested in this non-electric particle.

272
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So we just use this.

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Steady linear.

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Steady linear Boltzmann equation.

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Basically, you can use it directly.

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ah.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
To do this calculation.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OK.

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ok.

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then you want to do this calculation.

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The physical model behind you has developed well.

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It is.

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Ah.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Transport equation.

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Basically, you basically have to.

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
To solve this equation.

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ah.

288
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But that equation.

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You just saw it.

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Basically, it has.

291
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ah.

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you expand all the variables.

293
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Include.

294
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If it includes time.

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It has seven variables.

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Ah.

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
XYZ.

298
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ah.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then the energy.

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Then the angle.

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Is the particle.

302
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What angle does it shoot?

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then.

304
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are basically two angles.

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It has.

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ah.

307
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Z-multiple and polar.

308
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And then.

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It also has time.

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Basically, there are seven.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then it.

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That.

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That.

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That.

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That.

316
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That.

317
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That.

318
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That.

319
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That.

320
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That.

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That.

322
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That.

323
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That.

324
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That.

325
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That.

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That.

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That.

328
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That.

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That.

330
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That.

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That.

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ah.

333
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Ah.

334
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ah.

335
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Ah, basically, you can only solve the number.

336
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So, basically, the number is.

337
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is the first deterministic model here.

338
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You really have to go.

339
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This equation.

340
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Break it down one piece at a time.

341
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then you can see it has a lot of.

342
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It is a square of space.

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It is XYZ.

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You have to break everything down.

345
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And then you have to break down the energy.

346
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And then there are two parts of the angle.

347
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have to break down.

348
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, this is basically a module.

349
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It is a very difficult process.

350
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There is another method.

351
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It is basically a Monte Carlo method.

352
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You can put this whole.

353
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can use this method.

354
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Basically, you can.

355
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You do not have to go directly.

356
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The one who solved the equation.

357
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You basically, we are.

358
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
All the physical processes.

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Turn it into a probability function.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Then go down to do the signal.

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Basically, these two methods.

362
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It has good and bad.

363
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So, basically, I am now.

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I will talk about it next.

365
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Where is it good and bad?

366
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And why is it bad?

367
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Because it is a.

368
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It is a, it is a, it is a, it is a, it is a.

369
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It is a, it is a, it is a, it is a.

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It is a, it is a, it is a.

372
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:58,000
