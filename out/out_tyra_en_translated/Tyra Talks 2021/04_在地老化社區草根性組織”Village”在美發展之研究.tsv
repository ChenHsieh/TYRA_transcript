0	14000	Today's speaker is Qiu Yiting. Yiting graduated from Chenggong University with a master's degree in urban planning, and at the same time retired from political studies.
14000	23000	His master's degree is in the National Institute of Development, Taiwan University, and he is now a PhD candidate for George Mason's Public Policy.
23000	30000	Yiting's research is cross-field policy research, and his main interest is local and national development.
30000	42000	His important experiences in recent years include the assistant of the Chinese and French branch of the Taiwan Economic Research Institute's Sino-US Trade War, and the course teacher of the NCAR Learning, a non-profit organization for the benefit of the French.

96000	99000	It seems to be coming out.
100000	117000	I see only gray.
118000	121000	Do I have to share it again?
121000	124000	Yes, let's share it again.

226000	229000	Can you see the screen now?
231000	234000	Can you see the screen now?
235000	238000	It's okay.
238000	241000	Why do I see a black screen now?
251000	254000	I'm black now. What should I adjust?
255000	259000	I'm black now. What should I adjust?
263000	266000	Look at your software.
266000	269000	Look at your software.
272000	275000	Look at your software.
275000	278000	Look at your software.

308000	329000	Please wait for me to use it again.
329000	332000	Do you see it?
332000	335000	Now it becomes your checklist of the Lord of the Rings.
335000	339000	Yes, I'll change it later.
339000	340000	Now it works.
340000	343000	Can everyone see it?
343000	346000	Yes.
346000	349000	Thank you. I'm very sorry.
349000	352000	Thank you very much for listening to today's lecture.
352000	356000	This is the topic of my doctoral thesis.
356000	361000	I'm discussing a type of community grass roots
361000	366000	that is growing rapidly in Taiwan.
366000	371000	I think this organization is initiated by the residents
371000	376000	and provides non-medical but vital care and services
376000	380000	to the local elderly residents.
380000	383000	I think many countries, including Taiwan,
383000	387000	are facing an aging problem.
387000	392000	So I think it's meaningful to discuss this phenomenon
392000	397000	and the causes behind it.
397000	402000	This organization is called Villages.
402000	405000	It's not an ordinary village.
405000	410000	The village is its name.
410000	413000	So my research goal is to discuss
413000	418000	the social and economic factors
418000	421000	behind this organization.
421000	423000	In the past 20 years,
423000	426000	there have been more and more organizations like this
426000	429000	in the United States.
429000	432000	So here's a definition.
432000	437000	It's a community organization.
437000	442000	Its goal is to help the local residents
442000	447000	to grow old together.
447000	452000	Villages provide non-medical services
452000	455000	to the local residents,
455000	460000	especially the elderly residents.
460000	463000	For example, they drive you to the doctor's office
463000	466000	or provide you with some growth courses
466000	469000	or social activities.
469000	472000	For example, they change light bulbs
472000	477000	or teach the elderly how to use computers.
477000	482000	All kinds of non-medical services.
482000	485000	This organization, called Villages,
485000	490000	is founded by the elderly in the community
490000	495000	and by the local residents.
496000	501000	This organization is run by the local volunteers
501000	506000	and the non-governmental organizations.
506000	511000	They also contribute to the organization.
511000	514000	Sometimes they apply for funds
514000	517000	from the government or non-governmental organizations.
517000	521000	Some of the donations are from private donors.
521000	526000	The first organization, called Villages,
526000	531000	was founded in Beacon Hill, Boston.
531000	536000	It was founded in 2002.
536000	541000	A lot of people heard about this organization
541000	546000	and thought it was a good idea.
547000	552000	So they decided to follow the Boston model
552000	557000	and set up an organization in their community.
557000	560000	This is just an example.
560000	563000	One of the Villages is in California.
563000	568000	Their website provides services
569000	574000	such as health information,
579000	583000	free education,
583000	588000	social activities,
588000	593000	and sports.
594000	597000	The number of Villages is increasing.
597000	602000	There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.
602000	607000	with low-income communities.
607000	610000	Not only in the U.S.,
610000	615000	but also in Australia, Canada, and South Africa.
615000	618000	Villages have influenced
618000	623000	their local communities.
623000	628000	It's not like McDonald's
628000	633000	where there are branches in the headquarters.
633000	638000	Each Village is an independent organization.
638000	643000	They are registered as a non-profit organization.
644000	649000	There are more than 300 Villages in the U.S.
649000	654000	with low-income communities.
654000	659000	They follow the Boston model.
659000	664000	There are many different types of Villages.
664000	669000	Some Villages may belong to other organizations,
670000	675000	such as senior centers,
676000	681000	churches, and so on.
681000	686000	There are many different types of Villages.
687000	692000	They are different from one another.
692000	696000	The most typical example is a Village
696000	701000	that is registered as a non-profit organization.
701000	706000	There is another non-profit organization
706000	711000	called Hop & Spook Model.
711000	716000	It's located in Portland, Metropolitan.
716000	721000	It's like a headquarters with branches.
721000	726000	The headquarters is called NW Village.
726000	731000	It's a non-profit organization.
731000	736000	It's a non-profit organization.
736000	741000	It's a non-profit organization.
741000	746000	It's a non-profit organization.
746000	751000	The average cost per m僚 is higher.
755000	760000	The cost will be covered
760000	765000	by the headquarters.
765000	770000	The independent Villages will only take care of
770000	775000	service members and training staff.
775000	780000	The average cost per m僚
780000	785000	will be lower.
785000	790000	The cost per m僚
790000	795000	will be covered by the headquarters.
795000	800000	The independent Villages will only take care
800000	805000	of service members and training staff.
805000	810000	The average cost per m僚
810000	815000	will be covered by the headquarters.
815000	820000	The independent Villages will only take care of
820000	825000	service members and training staff.
825000	830000	It is subordinate to other organizations.
830000	831000	Some você
831000	835000	code of conduct
835000	841000	is the filiation
841000	844000	or program
844000	849000	whereas there may be a unit
849000	854000	that is installed independently.
854000	859000	The value of this model is
859000	864000	that it is driven by users
864000	869000	compared to other organizations
869000	874000	that provide care for the elderly.
874000	879000	It reflects the needs of the elderly
879000	884000	rather than those provided by the government
884000	889000	or other private organizations.
889000	894000	It is a service provided by the user
894000	899000	to provide community resources.
899000	904000	On the other hand,
904000	909000	the village model
909000	914000	is less dependent on the government.
914000	919000	As I mentioned,
919000	924000	the village model
924000	929000	is more flexible
929000	934000	compared to other organizations.
934000	939000	For example,
939000	944000	there is a village
944000	949000	with several group homes.
949000	954000	Some elderly need professional care
954000	959000	and some elderly need professional care.
959000	964000	It is similar to
964000	969000	single-family homes.
969000	974000	Each room is for one elderly.
974000	979000	One or two nurses
979000	984000	supervise the elderly
984000	989000	or take care of their daily needs.
989000	994000	The village model
994000	999000	has several group homes.
999000	1004000	The elderly,
1004000	1009000	for example,
1009000	1014000	provide care for the elderly.
1014000	1019000	The village model
1019000	1024000	is more flexible compared to other organizations.
1024000	1029000	It reflects the needs of the elderly
1029000	1034000	and provides community resources.
1034000	1039000	The village model
1039000	1044000	is more flexible compared to other organizations.
1044000	1049000	The village model
1049000	1054000	is more flexible compared to other organizations.
1054000	1059000	The village model
1059000	1064000	is more flexible compared to other organizations.
1064000	1069000	The village model
1069000	1074000	is more flexible compared to other organizations.
1074000	1079000	The village model
1079000	1084000	is more flexible
1084000	1089000	compared to other organizations.
1089000	1094000	In my opinion,
1095000	1100000	the village model
1100000	1105000	is more flexible compared to other organizations.
1105000	1110000	It's more flexible compared to other organizations.
1110000	1115000	It's more flexible compared to other organizations.
1115000	1120000	It's more flexible compared to other organizations.
1120000	1125000	Another special thing about the village model
1125000	1130000	is the coalition.
1130000	1135000	For example,
1135000	1140000	in a region,
1140000	1145000	like DC,
1145000	1150000	there will be a coalition.
1150000	1155000	The purpose of the coalition is to provide a platform
1155000	1160000	to share resources.
1160000	1165000	For example,
1165000	1170000	if a community wants to build a village,
1170000	1175000	they will go to the coalition to learn
1175000	1180000	and learn from the experience.
1180000	1185000	For example,
1185000	1190000	California has a village network.
1190000	1195000	Washington has a village network.
1195000	1200000	Bay Area has a village network.
1200000	1205000	The main function of the coalition
1205000	1210000	is to share resources.
1210000	1215000	For example,
1215000	1220000	Washington DC has a village network.
1220000	1225000	Washington DC has a village network.
1225000	1230000	Washington DC has a village network.
1230000	1235000	My research question is
1235000	1240000	why this type of organization
1240000	1245000	appeared in the US in the past 20 years?
1245000	1250000	Why didn't it appear earlier?
1250000	1255000	Why didn't it appear earlier?
1255000	1260000	Second,
1260000	1265000	which communities are more likely to have such an organization?
1265000	1270000	For example,
1270000	1275000	what is the background of the local community?
1275000	1280000	Third,
1280000	1285000	which communities are more likely to have such an organization?
1285000	1290000	What is the background of the local community?
1290000	1295000	What is the background of the local community?
1295000	1300000	These are my assumptions.
1300000	1305000	These are my assumptions.
1305000	1310000	First,
1310000	1315000	the aging of society
1315000	1320000	has led to the emergence of the village model.
1320000	1325000	has led to the emergence of the village model.
1325000	1330000	Second,
1330000	1335000	the emergence of the village model
1335000	1340000	is an important factor.
1340000	1345000	It's like a new venture.
1345000	1350000	It's like a new venture.
1350000	1355000	It's like a new venture.
1355000	1360000	Creators' individual improvements
1360000	1365000	are very important in this process.
1365000	1370000	Creators' individual improvements are very important in this process.
1370000	1375000	Finally,
1375000	1380080	the dispersion of social networks
1380080	1385080	is very important
1385080	1390080	in this process.
1390080	1395080	In this process,
1395080	1400080	it is very important
1400080	1405080	that the community
1405080	1410080	has a strong social network.
1410080	1415080	It is very important
1415080	1420080	that the community has a strong social network.
1420080	1425080	It is very important
1425080	1430080	that the community has a strong social network.
1430080	1435080	It is very important
1435080	1440080	that the community has a strong social network.
1440080	1445080	It is very important
1445080	1450080	that the community has a strong social network.
1450080	1455080	It is very important
1455080	1460080	that the community has a strong social network.
1460080	1465080	It is critical
1465080	1469720	that the community has a strong social network.
1469720	1474720	It is critical
1474720	1477720	that the community has a strong social network.
1477720	1482720	It is critical
1483660	1488660	that the community has a strong social network.
1492400	1495400	It is critical that the community has a strong social network.
1495400	1497020	It is critical that the community has a strong social network.
1497020	1501360	It is critical that the community has a strong social network.
1501360	1503860	Since then,
1503860	1507860	it is reported that the relevance of our series
1507860	1511360	of presentations
1511360	1515360	has become an important factor.
1515360	1519360	The average income of a community
1519360	1523360	The average income of a community
1523360	1527360	is a positive factor or a negative factor.
1527360	1530360	is a positive factor or a negative factor.
1530360	1534360	My assumption is that
1534360	1538360	it is a linear relationship.
1538360	1542360	If it is a very low-income community,
1542360	1546360	the organization needs to invest a lot of effort
1546360	1550360	the organization needs to invest a lot of effort
1550360	1554360	If it is a very low-income community,
1554360	1558360	it is difficult to maintain the livelihood.
1558360	1562360	It is difficult to maintain the livelihood.
1562360	1566360	For a very high-income community,
1566360	1570360	the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.
1570360	1574360	so there is no right-wing organization to build a community.
1574360	1578360	For a very high-income community,
1578360	1582360	the wealthy can afford to buy a lot of services.
1582360	1586360	So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.
1586360	1590360	So, there is no right-wing organization to build a village.
1590360	1594360	However, there are some differences in my interviews.
1596360	1600360	For example,
1600360	1604360	when a community has a village,
1604360	1608360	when a community has a village,
1608360	1612360	there will be new social connections.
1612360	1616360	These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.
1616360	1620360	These social connections will help to maintain such an organization.
1620360	1624360	This is a community phenomenon,
1625180	1629180	so they can't really observe it.
1629180	1633180	so they can't really observe it.
1633180	1637320	So, my method includes
1637320	1640740	studying and
1640740	1644740	looking around detailed.
1644740	1648740	For large city RoV criteria,
1648740	1652740	I generally look into individual people with disabilities,
1652740	1656740	and use ground theory to do some research.
1656740	1660740	and use ground theory to do some research.
1660740	1664740	I'll talk about this in detail later.
1664740	1668740	So, how do I find these villages?
1668740	1672740	My research is limited to the United States,
1672740	1676740	so it's relatively simple.
1676740	1680740	So, how do I find the villages in the United States?
1680740	1684740	A list of the cities under the Yoga Village Coalition
1684740	1688740	includes members and non-members
1688740	1692740	and listed on the listing.
1692740	1696740	There are two biggest Coalition in the region.
1696740	1700740	The UC and D.C.
1700740	1704740	have their lists referred to.
1704740	1708740	First,
1708740	1712740	they conduct a survey
1712740	1716740	to understand their basic situation,
1716740	1720740	such as their establishment time,
1720740	1724740	service scope, and so on.
1724740	1728740	Their address is their office address,
1728740	1732740	but not their service scope.
1732740	1736740	You don't know how big their service scope is.
1736740	1740740	Because of the pandemic,
1740740	1744740	they spend a lot of time on this.
1744740	1748740	I listed the total number of villages
1748740	1752740	and how many are still
1752740	1756740	under preparation.
1756740	1760740	There are four villages
1760740	1764740	that are still under preparation
1764740	1768740	due to the pandemic.
1768740	1772740	Unfortunately, the village is closed due to the pandemic.
1772740	1776740	As far as I know,
1776740	1780740	at least one village has reopened.
1780740	1784740	I collected 120 samples in this survey.
1784740	1788740	On the Global Coalition website,
1788740	1792740	they also listed
1792740	1796740	their areas of interest.
1796740	1800740	They identified their areas
1800740	1804740	as metropolitan, suburban,
1804740	1808740	or rural areas.
1808740	1812740	I used this to compare
1812740	1816740	and show the representation of my sample.
1816740	1820740	This is the information I collected
1820740	1824740	in this survey.
1824740	1828740	You can see that the two villages
1828740	1832740	are very similar.
1832740	1836740	As for the establishment time,
1836740	1840740	the total number of villages
1840740	1844740	is less than the total number of villages
1844740	1848740	on the previous table.
1848740	1852740	You can see that
1852740	1856740	the first village was established in 2002.
1856740	1860740	Why is there an earlier year?
1860740	1864740	Because that village belongs to a certain organization.
1864740	1868740	The time given is the establishment time
1868740	1872740	of that unit.
1872740	1876740	In 1952,
1876740	1880740	you can see that
1880740	1884740	the number of villages
1884740	1888740	is relatively lower than
1888740	1892740	the number of villages
1892740	1896740	on the previous table.
1896740	1900740	There is a big difference
1900740	1904740	in the scope of service.
1904740	1908740	The service area is about
1908740	1912740	5 zip code areas.
1912740	1916740	It's difficult to calculate
1916740	1920740	the number of villages on the previous table.
1920740	1924740	Some services are as large as
1924740	1928740	two counties,
1928740	1932740	and some are as small as a building.
1932740	1936740	I use spatial analysis
1936740	1940740	to calculate the number of villages
1940740	1944740	on the previous table.
1944740	1948740	The spatial analysis is done
1948740	1952740	by county and county subdivision
1952740	1956740	based on U.S. census data
1956740	1960740	and American Community Survey.
1960740	1964740	The U.S. census data
1964740	1968740	shows that there are
1968740	1972740	more than 30,000 county subdivisions
1972740	1976740	on the previous table.
1976740	1980740	The U.S. census data
1980740	1984740	shows that there are more than 60,000 county subdivisions
1984740	1988740	on the previous table.
1988740	1992740	The U.S. census data
1992740	1996740	shows that
1996740	2000740	most of the volunteers
2000740	2004740	are local residents.
2004740	2008740	Most of the volunteers
2008740	2012740	are retired,
2012740	2016740	but there are also
2016740	2020740	a lot of young people
2020740	2024740	who want to work with us
2024740	2028740	to provide more resources.
2028740	2032740	So,
2032740	2036740	this is the return part.
2036740	2040740	So,
2040740	2044740	I use the U.S. census data
2044740	2048740	to calculate the number of villages
2048740	2052740	on the previous table.

4098740	4100740	Thank you very much for your question.
4100740	4102740	First of all,
4102740	4104740	what is the progress of development in Taiwan?
4104740	4106740	What is the progress of development in Taiwan?
4106740	4108740	I think there are pros and cons.
4108740	4110740	The pros are that
4110740	4112740	we are still talking about
4112740	4114740	the elderly care in society.
4114740	4116740	We still think about the government
4116740	4118740	and what services should be provided.
4118740	4120740	This is also related to your second question.
4120740	4122740	This is also related to your second question.
4122740	4124740	There are several stages of the elderly.
4124740	4126740	There are several stages of the elderly.
4126740	4128740	The first stage is that
4128740	4130740	many elderly people are still healthy
4130740	4132740	and have the ability to move.
4132740	4134740	The next stage is that
4134740	4136740	they may have some physical and mental difficulties.
4136740	4138740	The next stage is that
4138740	4140740	they may not be able to move in bed.
4140740	4142740	In Taiwan,
4142740	4144740	we are mainly discussing
4144740	4146740	how to deal with the later stages.
4146740	4148740	The elderly feel they do not need to worry
4148740	4150740	about the later stages.
4150740	4152740	This is a huge mistake.
4152740	4154740	It's like a machine.
4154740	4156740	It's like a machine.
4156740	4158740	You have to keep running
4158740	4160740	so that it can move smoothly.
4160740	4162740	you have to keep running so that it can move smoothly.
4162740	4164740	For example,
4164740	4166740	some people retire and do nothing.
4166740	4168740	Some people move with their children
4168740	4170740	to other countries or cities.
4170740	4172740	They watch TV all day at home.
4172740	4174740	They do not have social activities.
4174740	4176740	They can't quickly
4176740	4178740	enter the post-mortem
4178740	4180740	or the stage of mental decline.
4180740	4182740	It's all about problems.
4182740	4184740	How to take care of them.
4184740	4186740	How to take care of them.
4186740	4188740	We don't put resources
4188740	4190740	on how to give them more
4190740	4192740	when they are still healthy.
4192740	4194740	We don't put resources
4194740	4196740	on how to give them more
4196740	4198740	when they are still healthy.
4198740	4200740	I do interviews here.
4200740	4202740	I do interviews here.
4202740	4204740	I interviewed with senior people
4204740	4206740	who are in social activities.
4206740	4208740	Even when they are old,
4208740	4210740	even when they are old,
4210740	4212740	they will not stay in bed for a long time.
4212740	4214740	Even if they leave,
4214740	4216740	they will leave soon and feel no pain.
4216740	4218740	In Taiwan,
4218740	4220740	I think our social resources
4220740	4222740	should be more.
4222740	4224740	Or think more about
4224740	4226740	this.
4226740	4228740	As I said earlier,
4228740	4230740	Village is a very flexible
4230740	4232740	and flexible mode.
4232740	4234740	So in Taiwan,
4234740	4236740	I think we can connect with
4236740	4238740	Taiwan's own social network.
4238740	4240740	For example, in Taiwan,
4240740	4242740	the elderly care is mainly
4242740	4244740	based on the first one,
4244740	4246740	the community development association.
4246740	4248740	Mainly based on these two.
4248740	4250740	Then I was thinking if Village
4250740	4252740	can be combined with these two.
4252740	4254740	In fact, in Taiwan,
4254740	4256740	in terms of self-employment services,
4256740	4258740	everyone's love is quite high.
4258740	4260740	For example, in Taiwan,
4260740	4262740	relatively invested in
4262740	4264740	non-profit organizations,
4264740	4266740	relatively invested in religion.
4266740	4268740	Of course, religious organizations
4268740	4270740	can also be combined with this.
4270740	4272740	How to think about
4272740	4274740	such a part.
4274740	4276740	For example, on this table,
4276740	4278740	the United States is facing a problem.
4278740	4280740	In fact, these costs are quite high.
4280740	4282740	Even if you are a middle-income person,
4282740	4284740	even if you are a middle-income person,
4284740	4286740	even if you are a middle-income person,
4286740	4288740	once you get old,
4288740	4290740	the source of income is reduced.
4290740	4292740	And you don't know what kind of
4292740	4294740	serious illness you might have.
4294740	4296740	For them, it's a big burden.
4296740	4298740	So that's why
4298740	4300740	there's a reason for
4300740	4302740	establishing Village.
4302740	4304740	Like you just said,
4304740	4306740	for example,
4306740	4308740	there's another thing
4308740	4310740	that's not listed here.
4310740	4312740	It's nursing home.
4312740	4314740	It's a nursing home
4314740	4316740	that avoids that kind of situation.
4316740	4318740	Especially in nursing homes,
4318740	4320740	there are some
4320740	4322740	medical care.
4322740	4324740	There are some bad quality
4324740	4326740	and a lot of mess inside.
4326740	4328740	For example, assisted living
4328740	4330740	in Virginia and Maryland
4330740	4332740	has a retired community.
4332740	4334740	But the costs
4334740	4336740	are not too low.
4336740	4338740	So if you
4338740	4340740	just have a little
4340740	4342740	inconvenience with some actions,
4342740	4344740	for the most part,
4344740	4346740	if you want to
4346740	4348740	move to another place
4348740	4350740	like assisted living,
4350740	4352740	especially for
4352740	4354740	the elderly,
4354740	4356740	your social network
4356740	4358740	will be cut off.
4358740	4360740	And your social space
4360740	4362740	will be more limited.
4362740	4364740	So that's what
4364740	4366740	the elderly in the U.S.
4366740	4368740	are facing.
4368740	4370740	So they try to
4370740	4372740	stay where they
4372740	4374740	used to live.
4374740	4376740	For example,
4376740	4378740	how to do some adjustments
4378740	4380740	on the house.
4380740	4382740	You just said
4382740	4384740	that the costs are not low.
4384740	4386740	I know that
4386740	4388740	I checked on the Internet
4388740	4390740	that the range of nursing homes
4390740	4392740	is up to $100,000.
4392740	4394740	So you said that
4394740	4396740	the costs are not too low.
4396740	4398740	What's the range
4398740	4400740	in the U.S.?
4400740	4402740	I've only seen
4402740	4404740	more than 1,000 nursing homes
4404740	4406740	in Virginia.
4406740	4408740	Anyway,
4408740	4410740	if I want to report,
4410740	4412740	I can give you
4412740	4414740	the statistics.
4414740	4416740	Because each home
4416740	4418740	is different.
4418740	4420740	For example,
4420740	4422740	the location,
4422740	4424740	the unit,
4424740	4426740	the profit unit,
4426740	4428740	the situation will be miserable.
4432740	4434740	Thank you.
4434740	4436740	Thank you for your question.
4436740	4438740	Do you have any other questions?
4438740	4440740	I can stop the recording
4440740	4442740	first.
4442740	4444740	Then you can ask questions to
4444740	4446740	the audience.
