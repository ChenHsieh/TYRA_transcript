0	2000	Both are fine.
2000	4000	Do you want to introduce again?
4000	6000	It's okay, no need.
6000	8000	Let's start.
8000	11000	I hope the internet is okay later.
11000	15000	If it breaks again, let me know.
15000	18000	Is the full screen screen okay now?
18000	20000	Okay.
20000	23000	Okay, I'll start right away.
23000	27000	Thanks to the host, Wei Zhe, for the introduction.
27000	31000	I'm Pan Haoren from the Department of Chemical Engineering.
31000	35000	The topic of today's report is related to my research.
35000	40000	It is a high-efficiency algorithm for the optimization of P4 alkynes.
40000	44000	Before I start talking about today's topic,
44000	46000	I want to clarify one thing.
46000	48000	Because when you hear the word alkene,
48000	50000	if you are a material background,
50000	52000	or you may be a chemistry background,
52000	54000	or you are a chemistry background,
54000	56000	or you are a chemistry background,
56000	58000	you may want to discuss,
58000	61000	for example, the problem of alkyne arrangement,
61000	63000	for example, some morphology,
63000	66000	for example, I may want to play SRD,
66000	68000	and so on.
68000	71000	But in the field of procedural engineering,
71000	74000	that is, in the field of PSE,
74000	79000	we are referring to any process that can be obtained from the solution.
79000	82000	So today, even if it is just a sedimentary reaction,
82000	85000	we will also broadly call it crystallization.
85000	88000	Under this definition,
88000	93000	this crystallization is a process of separation and purification.
93000	96000	It can be done in a continuous way,
96000	99000	or in a batch way.
99000	103000	SRD is the so-called supersaturation.
103000	107000	It can be obtained in the following four ways.
107000	112000	What we are discussing today is the crystallization of batches.
112000	114000	Most of the crystallization of batches
114000	118000	is to make some high-added-value compounds,
118000	120000	such as specialized chemicals,
120000	122000	such as food additives,
122000	126000	such as drugs, and so on.
126000	129000	Compared to this continuous way,
129000	132000	its operability is relatively large.
132000	136000	It can also deal with some more difficult-to-deal with systems,
136000	139000	such as toxic chemicals,
139000	143000	such as the higher viscosity of the sedimentary solution,
143000	145000	such as the higher viscosity of the sedimentary solution,
145000	147000	such as the higher viscosity of the sedimentary solution,
147000	151000	Such crystallization has two basic mechanisms,
151000	156000	which are called nucleation, synthesis, and crystal growth.
156000	162000	Nucleation means the new crystal body is generated.
162000	164000	When a new crystal body is generated,
164000	166000	its volume is basically less than zero.
166000	170000	Crystal growth means that a new crystal body exists in a batch.
170000	173000	Because of the high-added-value compounds,
173000	174000	it grows bigger and bigger.
174000	176000	This is what we call crystal growth.
176000	182000	Nucleation can be divided into several different mechanisms.
182000	185000	The first one is homogeneous primary nucleation.
185000	188000	It is a spontaneous reaction in thermodynamics.
188000	192000	Nucleation can only occur in a high-added-value system.
192000	196000	The second one is heterogeneous primary nucleation.
196000	202000	It is a reaction of different particles.
202000	206000	For example, it may be caused by some pink particles.
206000	209000	The third one is secondary nucleation.
209000	215000	It means that nucleation is generated on the surface of the existing crystal body.
215000	218000	For example, in a batch, the crystal body may collide with each other.
218000	220000	There will be some friction.
220000	224000	When the friction occurs, its volume is basically less than zero.
224000	228000	This is what we call nucleation.
231000	232000	Let me give you an example.
232000	234000	If there is a batch today,
234000	237000	there is no crystal body in it at the beginning.
237000	239000	In the early stage of this batch,
239000	242000	because we want to have the crystal body from nothing,
242000	244000	it is called primary nucleation.
244000	246000	However, in the later stage,
246000	248000	because there are more crystal bodies,
248000	250000	crystal growth and secondary nucleation
250000	252000	will become the main mechanism.
252000	255000	In the operation of a batch,
255000	258000	we can usually add some crystals at the beginning,
258000	260000	which are called seed crystals,
260000	262000	or simply called seed.
262000	265000	The reason is that these seeds can quickly
265000	267000	exhaust the over-homogeneity.
267000	269000	Once it is exhausted,
269000	273000	it can inhibit the so-called primary nucleation.
273000	275000	What is the advantage of this?
275000	278000	The advantage is that primary nucleation has a feature
278000	280000	called stochastic,
280000	283000	which means that it is random.
283000	287000	So in this operation,
287000	291000	you can make this process more stable.
293000	299000	Next, let's talk about how to measure the quality of a product.
299000	302000	Of course, we know that the purity of the product
302000	304000	is a very important indicator.
304000	306000	But in addition to purity,
306000	308000	another important indicator is the so-called
308000	312000	crystal size distribution, or CSD.
312000	316000	A good CSD usually has the following features.
316000	318000	For example, it must be single-seam.
318000	324000	For example, the ratio of fine particles should be lower.
324000	327000	Next, because in some circumstances,
327000	329000	for example, if I want to make a drug today,
329000	332000	I would like this drug to be in the human body.
332000	336000	The conclusion curve is a curve that we want.
336000	339000	In this case, I may need to specify
339000	341000	the average filter of a product
341000	344000	and the so-called variance of this CSD.
344000	348000	If we can find a way to design a process
348000	350000	to make the average filter and variance of this product
350000	352000	meet such a requirement,
352000	355000	it will also be a situation that we want.
355000	359000	Of course, if today's CSD is not very good,
359000	361000	it may cause some problems.
361000	366000	For example, if today's product has the so-called double-seam CSD,
366000	370000	or its filter distribution,
370000	373000	or its fine particles are too high,
373000	375000	it may cause the following problems,
375000	378000	including excessive filter resistance,
378000	381000	including the need to use a lot of washing liquid
382000	384000	to clean the solid,
384000	387000	or even when it is sent out,
387000	391000	these small particles may be directly stuck on the tube wall.
391000	394000	These are all situations that we don't want to see.
394000	397000	So basically, what we want to do is
397000	401000	to suppress some excessive nucleation.
404000	406000	Next, if we talk about some
406000	410000	CSD control strategies,
410000	412000	it can be divided into two categories.
412000	415000	The first category is what we call model-free feedback control.
415000	421000	Its idea is that it will use a so-called feedback control loop,
421000	424000	and some corresponding
424000	426000	self-made analytical technology,
426000	428000	the so-called PAT,
428000	430000	to implement this.
430000	433000	Basically, such a control strategy,
433000	436000	I just need to know some basic features of the system,
436000	439000	for example, what kind of filter is OK.
439000	442000	The so-called model-free model here
442000	446000	refers to some kinetic energy of crystal growth and nucleation.
446000	449000	When we use this type of strategy,
449000	453000	we don't need to know the kinetic energy of these growth factors.
453000	457000	One of the so-called model-free strategies
457000	459000	is called supersaturation control.
459000	463000	Some people call it concentration control.
463000	465000	What it means is that
465000	467000	in the entire batch,
467000	470000	we control the saturation in a set value.
470000	473000	Of course, it will need some corresponding
473000	476000	analytical technology.
476000	478000	For example, like this,
478000	481000	it will need an online concentration measurement.
481000	485000	For example, you can use FTIR to do this.
485000	488000	This strategy is not bad,
488000	490000	because we don't need too much information.
490000	492000	But there is a drawback.
492000	498000	We still can't design this product's CSD directly.
498000	502000	Because it doesn't have a model to describe.
502000	504000	So in contrast,
504000	507000	another method is called model-based control.
507000	511000	It basically uses a function called population density function
511000	514000	to describe this CSD.
514000	518000	How does this CSD change in the batch?
518000	522000	We will use a population balance equation
522000	525000	to describe it.
525000	527000	In this strategy,
527000	529000	we usually multiply optimization problems
529000	533000	to find the so-called best control strategy.
533000	536000	The target function may include some
536000	537000	batch time,
537000	542000	or some characteristics of product CSD statistics.
542000	545000	Decision variable is the so-called
545000	548000	control strategy.
548000	552000	For example, it may be related to the temperature trajectory.
552000	555000	Or I may consider some so-called seed recipes,
555000	559000	which is how many seeds I want to add
559000	562000	and its average filter, and so on.
562000	566000	One of the challenges of using this model-based control
566000	569000	is that its burden will be greater.
569000	572000	Because the so-called PBE just now
572000	574000	belongs to a distributed city,
574000	577000	so its computational burden is relatively large.
577000	581000	This is also one of the purposes of our research.
581000	585000	We hope to use some high-performance computational methods
585000	589000	to improve the optimization of these P4 solution.
589000	591000	We will analyze several problems,
591000	595000	including some competition between target functions, trade-off.
595000	600000	Next, we want to find the seed recipe design
600000	604000	and some experience rules of control strategy,
604000	606000	the so-called rule of thumb.
606000	608000	Next, we will also explore
608000	612000	if what we use today is the seed coding process,
612000	617000	what impact will it have on the control of CSD?
617000	621000	Next, we want to introduce some theories.
621000	624000	At the beginning, we want to introduce the so-called
624000	626000	population density function.
626000	629000	As mentioned earlier, it is used to describe CSD.
629000	632000	Assuming that there is a system today,
632000	637000	we only use the feature length of a system to describe it.
637000	640000	For example, if the solution of this system today
640000	642000	is close to the sphere,
642000	645000	then we can use the diameter or radius
645000	647000	as the feature length.
647000	650000	If there is such a description,
650000	654000	we put the pdf to l,
654000	656000	and the result will be
656000	659000	the solution number in the batch.
659000	664000	Next, we can define a pdf moment.
664000	667000	This moment is not a moment.
667000	670000	It has some other translations in physics,
670000	674000	but I don't think it fits our situation.
674000	677000	So I just call it moment.
677000	679000	I won't translate it.
679000	681000	The definition of moment is as follows.
681000	683000	From mu0 to mu3,
683000	685000	these moments all have corresponding physical meanings.
685000	690000	The physical meaning of mu3 is the total volume of the solid.
690000	694000	After we define the pdf,
694000	698000	we can write the corresponding population balance equation.
698000	701000	In this study, we have some assumptions,
701000	704000	including the theory in the batch,
704000	706000	which is uniform,
706000	708000	and its volume is constant.
708000	711000	We also ignore some phenomena,
711000	713000	such as the collision of solids
713000	715000	and the splitting of solids.
715000	717000	This is called crystal breakage.
717000	719000	Or the collision of solids and solids.
719000	721000	This is called aggregation.
721000	724000	Let's ignore these assumptions.
724000	727000	Next is the volume of the solid.
727000	729000	It has a volume of 0 at the beginning.
729000	731000	Under these assumptions,
731000	735000	we can get a corresponding ppe.
735000	738000	As you can see, it is a Pythagorean equation.
738000	740000	Later, we will talk about
740000	743000	the physical meaning of the equation
743000	746000	and some calculations.
746000	750000	If we look at the ppe,
750000	752000	we can see that it contains
752000	756000	the momentum of growth and dissolution.
756000	760000	Therefore, we need to introduce the part of momentum.
760000	762000	As mentioned earlier,
762000	766000	the driving force of the crystal is super saturation.
766000	770000	There are many different definitions of super saturation.
770000	772000	Here are the two most common ones,
772000	775000	the definition of relative and absolute.
775000	780000	We can see that the definition of super saturation
780000	783000	is related to the difference between the density of the solution
783000	785000	and the density of the saturation.
785000	787000	The density of the solution itself
787000	789000	can be calculated by mass balance.
789000	791000	Let's assume that the ppe function
791000	794000	is a function of temperature.
795000	797000	Let's assume that
797000	802000	the ppe function is a function of temperature.
802000	806000	Therefore, the primary nucleation can be ignored.
806000	808000	In this case,
808000	814000	we can define the momentum of growth rate and nucleation rate.
814000	817000	At present, there is no complete theory
817000	821000	to describe this phenomenon in the academic world.
821000	824000	Therefore, we still use some experimental methods.
824000	826000	What we can notice is that
826000	828000	the growth rate is divided into two parts.
828000	831000	The first part is only related to super saturation.
831000	835000	The second part is only related to the size of the crystal.
835000	838000	If the second part is equal to 1,
838000	840000	we call it size-independent growth.
840000	842000	If the second part is not equal to 1,
842000	845000	we call it size-dependent growth.
845000	847000	For most systems,
847000	850000	the nucleation rate is more sensitive to super saturation
850000	853000	than the growth rate.
853000	856000	Therefore, the parameter b is greater than g.
856000	858000	Therefore, the parameter b is greater than g.
858000	860000	Next, I will introduce
860000	862000	how to solve the ppe function.
862000	864000	At the beginning,
864000	866000	we will divide the ppe function into two parts.
866000	868000	Mathematically,
868000	871000	we call it homogeneous and non-homogeneous.
871000	873000	Physically,
873000	877000	we call it homogeneous and non-homogeneous.
877000	880000	Why do we need to divide it into two parts?
880000	882000	There are two reasons.
882000	884000	The first reason is that
884000	887000	it is more convenient to apply some experimental methods.
887000	889000	The second reason is that
889000	892000	we can separate the seed and nucleation
892000	895000	to make a quantitative description.
895000	897000	As I just said,
897000	899000	we want to suppress nucleation.
899000	901000	Therefore, we make a quantitative description
901000	903000	to make a quantitative description.
903000	905000	Before we start to talk about
905000	907000	some quantitative methods,
907000	909000	let's take a look at a simple example.
909000	911000	In this example,
911000	913000	the ppe function has a so-called analysis solution.
913000	915000	By the way, let's understand
915000	917000	the physical meaning of some of the functions.
917000	919000	Let's assume that there is a system
919000	921000	whose growth rate and nucleation rate
921000	923000	are constant.
923000	925000	In this way,
925000	927000	we can write the corresponding ppe
927000	929000	and the corresponding analysis solution.
929000	931000	How can we judge the physical meaning
931000	933000	of the analysis solution?
933000	935000	If there are some seed crystals,
935000	937000	the pdf at the beginning
937000	939000	looks like an orange.
939000	941000	After a while,
941000	943000	they will grow bigger.
943000	945000	How big will they grow?
945000	947000	The size will increase
947000	949000	the growth rate times batch time.
949000	951000	Therefore,
951000	953000	the yellow part
953000	955000	is directly shifted to the right
955000	957000	to shift the growth rate times batch time.
957000	959000	In the case of nucleation,
959000	961000	the size of the seed crystal
961000	963000	at the beginning
963000	965000	will also be the same
965000	967000	as the growth rate times batch time.
967000	969000	Therefore,
969000	971000	the pdf will look like this.
971000	973000	Of course,
973000	975000	this is just a special case.
975000	977000	Let's talk about
977000	979000	some commonly used quantitative methods.
979000	981000	In general,
981000	983000	there are two types of quantitative methods.
983000	985000	The first type is called
985000	987000	the method of moment.
987000	989000	There are two versions,
989000	991000	standard and quadrature.
991000	993000	In the standard version,
993000	995000	ppe is converted to ODE.
995000	997000	It can only be used
997000	999000	in the size-independent
999000	1001000	kinetic system.
1001000	1003000	In the quadrature version,
1003000	1005000	ppe is converted to
1005000	1007000	the differential algebraic equation.
1007000	1009000	In other words,
1009000	1011000	there is a linear equation
1011000	1013000	of the differential equation
1013000	1015000	that can only be used
1015000	1017000	in the size-independent
1017000	1019000	kinetic system.
1019000	1021000	The advantage of this method
1021000	1023000	is that it can quickly
1023000	1025000	solve the moment,
1025000	1027000	but it can't find
1027000	1029000	the complete pdf.
1029000	1031000	Let's take a look at
1031000	1033000	the standard version.
1033000	1035000	The ODE
1035000	1037000	will look like this.
1037000	1039000	As you can see,
1039000	1041000	the seed and nucleation
1041000	1043000	are solved.
1043000	1045000	The second method
1045000	1047000	involves
1047000	1049000	some linear methods.
1049000	1051000	There are many
1051000	1053000	methods,
1053000	1055000	including the method of
1055000	1057000	characteristic,
1057000	1059000	method of classes,
1059000	1061000	or the method of
1061000	1063000	finite volume.
1063000	1065000	The advantage of this method
1065000	1067000	is that it can
1067000	1069000	keep the pdf format
1069000	1071000	and the pdf format
1071000	1073000	will be based on
1073000	1075000	the accuracy of
1075000	1077000	the CSD analysis
1077000	1079000	or the accuracy of
1079000	1081000	the numerical method.
1081000	1083000	It will need a lot of
1083000	1085000	discretization points,
1085000	1087000	which will lead to
1087000	1089000	a greater burden
1089000	1091000	on the calculation.
1091000	1093000	In this study,
1093000	1095000	we use the NOCH method.
1095000	1097000	The idea is that
1097000	1099000	the characteristic curve
1099000	1101000	is represented
1101000	1103000	by the family
1103000	1105000	of ODE.
1107000	1109000	These are some
1109000	1111000	common numerical methods.
1111000	1113000	I'd like to introduce
1113000	1115000	a method that
1115000	1117000	greatly reduces
1117000	1119000	the burden on the calculation.
1119000	1121000	It's called
1121000	1123000	coordinate transformation.
1123000	1125000	This method was
1125000	1127000	proposed by two German
1127000	1129000	scholars.
1129000	1131000	As we just saw,
1131000	1133000	the fixed value
1133000	1135000	will reduce the burden
1135000	1137000	on the calculation.
1137000	1139000	However,
1139000	1141000	since the unit of
1141000	1143000	coordinate transformation
1143000	1145000	is speed,
1145000	1147000	can we use the
1147000	1149000	VT graph
1149000	1151000	that we learned in
1151000	1153000	high school
1153000	1155000	to represent
1155000	1157000	the area?
1157000	1159000	The area
1159000	1161000	is the size
1161000	1163000	of the crystal.
1163000	1165000	So, we define
1165000	1167000	a transformer time,
1167000	1169000	which is the
1169000	1171000	size of the crystal
1171000	1173000	from batch 1
1173000	1175000	to a certain time.
1175000	1177000	The transformer time
1177000	1179000	is a unit of
1179000	1181000	length.
1181000	1183000	We can use
1183000	1185000	the VT graph
1185000	1187000	to represent
1187000	1189000	the area
1189000	1191000	of the crystal.
1191000	1193000	The area
1193000	1195000	is the size
1195000	1197000	of the crystal
1197000	1199000	from batch 1
1199000	1201000	to a certain time.
1201000	1203000	The area
1203000	1205000	is the size
1205000	1207000	of the crystal
1207000	1209000	from batch 2
1209000	1211000	to a certain time.
1211000	1213000	We only need to use
1213000	1215000	the transformer time
1215000	1217000	to represent the
1217000	1219000	area of the crystal.
1219000	1221000	This way,
1221000	1223000	we can reduce the
1223000	1225000	burden on the calculation.
1225000	1227000	After introducing
1227000	1229000	the necessary theories,
1229000	1231000	we can start to look at
1231000	1233000	the case studies.
1233000	1235000	The first part
1235000	1237000	is the competition
1237000	1239000	As mentioned earlier,
1239000	1241000	the model-based control
1241000	1243000	is to find the best
1243000	1245000	control input
1245000	1247000	under the
1247000	1249000	constraint of
1249000	1251000	the target function.
1251000	1253000	There are three types
1253000	1255000	of target function.
1255000	1257000	The first type is
1257000	1259000	to minimize the
1259000	1261000	new creation moment.
1261000	1263000	The second type is
1263000	1265000	to maximize the
1265000	1267000	variable coefficient
1267000	1269000	of variation.
1269000	1271000	Another question is
1271000	1273000	how to define
1273000	1275000	the best strategy.
1275000	1277000	This is a big question.
1277000	1279000	There is a study
1279000	1281000	conducted by
1281000	1283000	my professor
1283000	1285000	and his team.
1285000	1287000	The study found
1287000	1289000	that the best
1289000	1291000	control input
1291000	1293000	seems to have a
1293000	1295000	strong relationship
1295000	1297000	with the
1297000	1299000	target function.
1299000	1301000	Does this mean
1301000	1303000	that there is a
1303000	1305000	strong competition
1305000	1307000	between the
1307000	1309000	target function
1309000	1311000	and the
1311000	1313000	control input?
1313000	1315000	Finally,
1315000	1317000	let's analyze
1317000	1319000	the relationship
1319000	1321000	between the
1321000	1323000	target function
1323000	1325000	and the
1325000	1327000	new creation moment
1327000	1329000	and the
1329000	1331000	variable coefficient.
1331000	1333000	How do we
1333000	1335000	analyze the best
1335000	1337000	strategy of
1337000	1339000	multi-target function?
1339000	1341000	We use the
1341000	1343000	weighting sum method.
1343000	1345000	The idea is to
1345000	1347000	write the target function
1347000	1349000	as a linear addition
1349000	1351000	and the
1351000	1353000	weighting vector
1353000	1355000	should be specified
1355000	1357000	before the
1357000	1359000	optimization problem.
1359000	1361000	After the specification,
1361000	1363000	we can get
1363000	1365000	the point
1365000	1367000	on the
1367000	1369000	Pareto front.
1369000	1371000	If α is 0 or 1,
1371000	1373000	we can get
1373000	1375000	the point on
1375000	1377000	the Pareto front.
1377000	1379000	If α is 0 or 1,
1379000	1381000	we can get
1381000	1383000	the point on
1383000	1385000	the Pareto front.
1389000	1391000	How do we choose
1391000	1393000	the beta?
1393000	1395000	Let's find the
1395000	1397000	point on the
1397000	1399000	Pareto front.
1399000	1401000	Then we define
1401000	1403000	the normalized
1403000	1405000	objective function.
1405000	1407000	The point on the
1407000	1409000	Pareto front
1409000	1411000	should be
1411000	1413000	between 0 and 1.
1413000	1415000	Then we can
1415000	1417000	define the
1417000	1419000	beta.
1419000	1421000	Another advantage is
1421000	1423000	that we can
1423000	1425000	find the best
1425000	1427000	solution
1427000	1429000	in the
1429000	1431000	multiple
1431000	1433000	Pareto optimal
1433000	1435000	solutions.
1435000	1437000	The shortest
1437000	1439000	distance is the
1439000	1441000	best solution
1441000	1443000	for the
1443000	1445000	multiple
1445000	1447000	Pareto optimal solutions.
1447000	1449000	The solution is
1449000	1451000	called
1451000	1453000	knee point.
1453000	1455000	Now we can
1455000	1457000	solve the
1457000	1459000	optimization problem.
1459000	1461000	We need to consider
1461000	1463000	independent kinetics.
1463000	1465000	We also need to
1465000	1467000	consider some
1467000	1469000	restrictions.
1469000	1471000	For example,
1471000	1473000	we need to consider
1473000	1475000	production rate,
1475000	1477000	batch time,
1477000	1479000	and control input.
1479000	1481000	The control input
1481000	1483000	is set as growth rate.
1483000	1485000	We can also set it as temperature
1485000	1487000	or super saturation.
1487000	1489000	They can be
1489000	1491000	considered as
1491000	1493000	equal values.
1493000	1495000	In this case,
1495000	1497000	we can write
1497000	1499000	the problem
1499000	1501000	formulation,
1501000	1503000	as shown in the video.
1503000	1505000	For the
1505000	1507000	optimization problem,
1507000	1509000	the input variable
1509000	1511000	and the state variable,
1511000	1513000	the growth rate and the
1513000	1515000	nucleation moment,
1515000	1517000	are all time functions.
1517000	1519000	This is the
1519000	1521000	dynamic optimization problem.
1521000	1523000	There are many ways
1523000	1525000	to solve the DLP problem.
1525000	1527000	In today's
1527000	1529000	study,
1529000	1531000	we use
1531000	1533000	the optimal control theory.
1533000	1535000	The optimal control theory
1535000	1537000	can be
1537000	1539000	introduced by
1539000	1541000	Pond-Stratton's
1541000	1543000	Minimum Principle.
1543000	1545000	This principle
1545000	1547000	is a two-point
1547000	1549000	boundary-variable problem.
1549000	1551000	It is a two-point
1551000	1553000	boundary-variable problem.
1553000	1555000	It is a two-point
1555000	1557000	boundary-variable problem.
1557000	1559000	It sounds good.
1559000	1561000	It can be introduced
1561000	1563000	as a necessary condition.
1563000	1565000	But it is challenging.
1565000	1567000	First,
1567000	1569000	I just need to write
1569000	1571000	the TP-BVP,
1571000	1573000	which is challenging.
1573000	1575000	The TP-BVP
1575000	1577000	is a two-point
1577000	1579000	boundary-variable problem.
1579000	1581000	We know that
1581000	1583000	there may be
1583000	1585000	some convergence problems
1585000	1587000	in the numerical method.
1587000	1589000	In today's study,
1589000	1591000	we just need to
1591000	1593000	use the coding
1593000	1595000	transformation
1595000	1597000	and some assumptions.
1597000	1599000	Then,
1599000	1601000	we can
1601000	1603000	apply the TP-BVP
1603000	1605000	and TPs
1605000	1607000	to solve
1607000	1609000	the problem.
1609000	1611000	The TP-BVP
1611000	1613000	is a two-point
1613000	1615000	boundary-variable problem.
1615000	1617000	It is a two-point
1617000	1619000	boundary-variable problem.
1619000	1621000	We can use the
1621000	1623000	TP-BVP
1623000	1625000	and TPs
1625000	1627000	to solve
1627000	1629000	the problem.
1629000	1631000	The TP-BVP
1631000	1633000	is a two-point
1633000	1635000	boundary-variable problem.
1635000	1637000	We can use the TP-BVP
1637000	1639000	and TPs
1639000	1641000	to solve
1641000	1643000	the problem.
1643000	1645000	The TP-BVP
1645000	1647000	is a two-point
1647000	1649000	boundary-variable problem.
1649000	1651000	We can use the TP-BVP
1651000	1653000	and TPs
1653000	1655000	to solve
1655000	1657000	the problem.
1657000	1659000	The TP-BVP
1659000	1661000	is a two-point
1661000	1663000	boundary-variable problem.
1663000	1665000	We can use the TP-BVP
1665000	1667000	and TPs
1667000	1669000	to solve
1669000	1671000	the problem.
1671000	1673000	The TP-BVP
1673000	1675000	is a two-point
1675000	1677000	boundary-variable problem.
1677000	1679000	We can use the TP-BVP
1679000	1681000	and TPs
1681000	1683000	to solve
1683000	1685000	the problem.
1685000	1687000	Remember that
1687000	1689000	for any value
1689000	1691000	in the U-star,
1691000	1693000	the u-star
1693000	1695000	must have
1695000	1697000	a minimum value
1697000	1699000	for the Hamiltonian.
1699000	1701000	In this section,
1701000	1703000	the state variable
1703000	1705000	is selected as
1705000	1707000	the movement
1707000	1709000	at increased process time.
1709000	1711000	The control input
1711000	1713000	is the growth rate.
1713000	1715000	The reason for this
1715000	1717000	is to make it easier
1717000	1719000	to push down the equation.
1719000	1721000	The simplification
1721000	1723000	we mentioned earlier
1723000	1725000	is assuming that
1725000	1727000	the nucleation rate
1727000	1729000	is no longer affected
1729000	1731000	by the nucleation crystal.
1731000	1733000	This is a reasonable assumption
1733000	1735000	because the size of the seed
1735000	1737000	should be greater than
1737000	1739000	the size of the nucleation.
1739000	1741000	Because of this simplification,
1741000	1743000	it is possible to
1743000	1745000	calculate the growth rate
1745000	1747000	in the same way.
1747000	1749000	The process is relatively long,
1749000	1751000	so I won't go into details.
1751000	1753000	You can read the paper
1753000	1755000	I published
1755000	1757000	for more details.
1757000	1759000	Let's take a look at
1759000	1761000	some case studies.
1761000	1763000	In this chapter,
1763000	1765000	we used two different systems.
1765000	1767000	One is the nucleation crystal.
1767000	1769000	The other is the
1769000	1771000	pericyclic crystal.
1771000	1773000	Their
1773000	1775000	kinetic parameters
1775000	1777000	are as shown.
1777000	1779000	Note that
1779000	1781000	J refers to
1781000	1783000	the relation between
1783000	1785000	the nucleation rate
1785000	1787000	and mu3,
1787000	1789000	which is the number
1789000	1791000	of crystals in the batch.
1791000	1793000	The nucleation rate
1793000	1795000	is proportional to mu3,
1795000	1797000	but the nucleation rate
1797000	1799000	is not related to mu3.
1799000	1801000	This will lead to some
1801000	1803000	differences in the nucleation rate.
1803000	1805000	I will talk about this later.
1805000	1807000	In addition to the nucleation rate,
1807000	1809000	we will also look at
1809000	1811000	some simple control trajectories
1811000	1813000	that will lead to
1813000	1815000	a control result.
1815000	1817000	We used a system that
1817000	1819000	included linear deceleration,
1819000	1821000	three-dimensional deceleration,
1821000	1823000	and the pericyclic crystal
1823000	1825000	we mentioned earlier.
1825000	1827000	This system is called
1827000	1829000	size-independent kinetics.
1829000	1831000	For the pericyclic crystal control trajectory,
1831000	1833000	the growth rate is measured
1833000	1835000	as a fixed value.
1835000	1837000	The result of these trajectories
1837000	1839000	is as shown in the picture.
1839000	1841000	Let's look at
1841000	1843000	the pericyclic crystal system.
1843000	1845000	If it is a linear deceleration,
1845000	1847000	it will lead to
1847000	1849000	early growth trajectory,
1849000	1851000	which means that
1851000	1853000	the growth rate will be higher
1853000	1855000	due to the
1855000	1857000	nucleation rate.
1857000	1859000	The early growth
1859000	1861000	of the pericyclic crystal
1861000	1863000	will cause
1863000	1865000	the growth rate to increase.
1865000	1867000	This will lead to
1867000	1869000	a larger
1869000	1871000	nucleation rate.
1871000	1873000	On the other hand,
1873000	1875000	a tubid cooling
1875000	1877000	can be considered a net growth
1877000	1879000	because it has a large growth rate
1879000	1881000	later on,
1881000	1883000	which will lead to a
1883000	1885000	larger nucleation rate.
1885000	1887000	If we look at the
1887000	1889000	PENTA system,
1889000	1891000	we will see a similar phenomenon.
1891000	1893000	It is worth mentioning that
1893000	1895000	if we look at the temperature
1895000	1897000	trajectory,
1897000	1899000	we will find that the temperature
1899000	1901000	after the linear cooling
1901000	1903000	is relatively low.
1903000	1905000	The reason is that
1905000	1907000	a lot of the solution
1907000	1909000	will be sucked out
1909000	1911000	from the system.
1911000	1913000	This will cause
1913000	1915000	the batch temperature
1915000	1917000	to be relatively low.
1917000	1919000	Next,
1919000	1921000	if we look at
1921000	1923000	the target function
1923000	1925000	set,
1925000	1927000	we will
1927000	1929000	divide the target function
1929000	1931000	into two categories.
1931000	1933000	The first category is the lower moment.
1933000	1935000	It is composed of mu0 to mu2.
1935000	1937000	The higher moment
1937000	1939000	is composed of mu3 to mu5.
1939000	1941000	In this case,
1941000	1943000	we can divide the target function
1943000	1945000	into groups
1945000	1947000	and use
1947000	1949000	different pairs
1949000	1951000	to analyze.
1951000	1953000	You can see
1953000	1955000	that we have analyzed four groups of target functions.
1955000	1957000	The first two groups
1957000	1959000	are a higher moment
1959000	1961000	and a lower moment.
1961000	1963000	The last two groups
1963000	1965000	are two higher moments
1965000	1967000	and two lower moments.
1967000	1969000	Let's take a look at
1969000	1971000	how the different target functions
1971000	1973000	are related to each other.
1979000	1981000	If we look at
1981000	1983000	the small triangle system,
1983000	1985000	we can draw
1985000	1987000	all four groups.
1987000	1989000	We will find that
1989000	1991000	the first two groups,
1991000	1993000	which are a higher moment
1993000	1995000	and a lower moment,
1995000	1997000	will cause a strong
1997000	1999000	trade-off.
1999000	2001000	This can be seen from the
2001000	2003000	width of the x-axis.
2003000	2005000	The x-axis represents
2005000	2007000	the volume of mu3n.
2007000	2009000	The first group
2009000	2011000	is about
2011000	2013000	5000 to 7000,
2013000	2015000	which is about 40%.
2015000	2017000	The second group is about
2017000	2019000	50,000 to 10,000,
2019000	2021000	which is almost double.
2021000	2023000	The trade-off between
2023000	2025000	3.3 and 3.4
2025000	2027000	is relatively weak.
2027000	2029000	If we look at
2029000	2031000	the yellow circle,
2031000	2033000	it represents
2033000	2035000	the target function
2035000	2037000	obtained by super-saturation control.
2037000	2039000	The value of this target function
2039000	2041000	is quite close
2041000	2043000	to the so-called need point.
2043000	2045000	So we can conclude that
2045000	2047000	super-saturation control
2047000	2049000	seems to get
2049000	2051000	a trade-off result.
2053000	2055000	If we look at
2055000	2057000	the Penta system,
2057000	2059000	the trade-off
2059000	2061000	is quite similar to
2061000	2063000	the super-saturation system.
2063000	2065000	What we need to pay attention to
2065000	2067000	is the 3.1 graph.
2067000	2069000	The yellow circle
2069000	2071000	obtained by super-saturation control
2071000	2073000	is directly
2073000	2075000	overlapped with the need point.
2075000	2077000	Why?
2077000	2079000	Because in the Penta system,
2079000	2081000	the nucleation rate and
2081000	2083000	the density of the
2083000	2085000	mu3 or batch
2085000	2087000	are not related.
2087000	2089000	This means that
2089000	2091000	I don't need to
2091000	2093000	change the value of
2093000	2095000	super-saturation control
2095000	2097000	before or after the batch.
2097000	2099000	I only need to make
2099000	2101000	the nucleation number
2101000	2103000	the lowest value.
2103000	2105000	If we look at
2105000	2107000	the growth rate trajectory,
2107000	2109000	let's look at
2109000	2111000	the single objective
2111000	2113000	of the Penta system.
2113000	2115000	We will find that
2115000	2117000	the early growth trajectory
2117000	2119000	seems to be
2119000	2121000	more friendly to
2121000	2123000	the lower moment
2123000	2125000	objective.
2125000	2127000	The reason is that
2127000	2129000	early growth can avoid
2129000	2131000	the nucleation rate
2131000	2133000	to become very large
2133000	2135000	if the nucleation rate
2135000	2137000	is small.
2137000	2139000	On the other hand,
2139000	2141000	if the nucleation rate
2141000	2143000	is small,
2143000	2145000	the nucleation rate
2145000	2147000	in the later stage
2147000	2149000	will not grow
2149000	2151000	much.
2151000	2153000	This will make
2153000	2155000	the nucleation rate
2155000	2157000	smaller,
2157000	2159000	so it will be more
2159000	2161000	friendly to the higher
2161000	2163000	objectives.
2163000	2165000	If we look at the
2165000	2167000	so-called knee point
2167000	2169000	trajectory,
2169000	2171000	we will find that
2171000	2173000	the growth rate
2173000	2175000	of 3.1 and 3.2
2175000	2177000	is relatively small.
2177000	2179000	This can be verified
2179000	2181000	that super-saturation control
2181000	2183000	has a good balance
2183000	2185000	between the higher moment
2185000	2187000	and lower moment
2187000	2189000	objectives.
2189000	2191000	If we look at the
2191000	2193000	3.3 and 3.4,
2193000	2195000	we will find that
2195000	2197000	3.3 has two higher
2197000	2199000	moment objectives,
2199000	2201000	so its trajectory
2201000	2203000	is more friendly
2203000	2205000	to the later growth.
2205000	2207000	On the other hand,
2207000	2209000	3.4 has two lower
2209000	2211000	moment objectives,
2211000	2213000	so its knee point
2213000	2215000	trajectory is more
2215000	2217000	friendly to the early growth.
2217000	2219000	We can conclude that
2219000	2221000	super-saturation control
2221000	2223000	can be used
2223000	2225000	as a rule of thumb
2225000	2227000	in the
2227000	2229000	Penta system.
2229000	2231000	In conclusion,
2231000	2233000	we use
2233000	2235000	the best control
2235000	2237000	theory
2237000	2239000	to solve
2239000	2241000	these problems
2241000	2243000	in a
2243000	2245000	self-explanatory
2245000	2247000	way.
2247000	2249000	We also analyzed
2249000	2251000	the tradeoff
2251000	2253000	and found that
2253000	2255000	the higher moment
2255000	2257000	and lower moment
2257000	2259000	objectives are more competitive.
2259000	2261000	It seems that
2261000	2263000	super-saturation control
2263000	2265000	is a pretty good
2265000	2267000	strategy in these two systems.
2267000	2269000	However,
2269000	2271000	the SSC
2271000	2273000	super-saturation control
2273000	2275000	is also a good idea.
2275000	2277000	However,
2277000	2279000	we still need to
2279000	2281000	explore other systems.
2281000	2283000	When we were
2283000	2285000	looking for this document,
2285000	2287000	we found that
2287000	2289000	the numerical range
2289000	2291000	of the K-parameter
2291000	2293000	is very wide,
2293000	2295000	and it can be as wide as
2295000	2297000	a dozen orders.
2297000	2299000	In addition,
2299000	2301000	the unit of
2301000	2303000	the K-parameter
2303000	2305000	is related to
2305000	2307000	the unit of
2307000	2309000	the J-parameter.
2309000	2311000	Another problem is that
2311000	2313000	we can't judge
2313000	2315000	the numerical range
2315000	2317000	of the system
2317000	2319000	directly from the value.
2319000	2321000	Another problem
2321000	2323000	is that
2323000	2325000	we also want to explore
2325000	2327000	the design of the C-recipe.
2327000	2329000	A group of Japanese scholars
2329000	2331000	did an experiment
2331000	2333000	to explore
2333000	2335000	several different crystalline systems.
2335000	2337000	They found that
2337000	2339000	as long as the C-loading ratio
2339000	2341000	is increased,
2341000	2343000	the definition of C-loading ratio
2343000	2345000	is a ratio of
2345000	2347000	C and product mass.
2347000	2349000	As long as the C-loading ratio
2349000	2351000	is increased,
2351000	2353000	and the C-mean size is reduced,
2353000	2355000	the numerical range
2355000	2357000	can be as limited as possible.
2357000	2359000	There are two problems here.
2359000	2361000	First, we know that
2361000	2363000	if the C-loading ratio
2363000	2365000	is higher,
2365000	2367000	and the C-mean size is
2367000	2369000	smaller,
2369000	2371000	then the average
2371000	2373000	numerical range of the product
2373000	2375000	will also be smaller.
2375000	2377000	Of course, the goals mentioned earlier
2377000	2379000	are contrary.
2379000	2381000	Next, if the C-loading ratio
2381000	2383000	is too high,
2383000	2385000	or if C is used too aggressively,
2385000	2387000	then the product recycle rate
2387000	2389000	will be higher.
2389000	2391000	This is not a good phenomenon.
2391000	2393000	In order to analyze
2393000	2395000	these problems,
2395000	2397000	we will use
2397000	2399000	a soundless model
2399000	2401000	to quickly analyze
2401000	2403000	these problems.
2403000	2405000	Let me briefly introduce
2405000	2407000	this soundless model.
2407000	2409000	First, in order to reduce
2409000	2411000	the number of parameters,
2411000	2413000	we combine
2413000	2415000	these parameters.
2415000	2417000	After combining,
2417000	2419000	the definition of Kb
2419000	2421000	is different.
2421000	2423000	The definition of Gamma
2423000	2425000	is the relative sensitivity
2425000	2427000	of the nucleation rate
2427000	2429000	and growth rate
2429000	2431000	to the saturation rate.
2431000	2433000	Next, we define
2433000	2435000	the reference quantity
2435000	2437000	with the underline ref.
2437000	2439000	A prime means
2439000	2441000	that this quantity
2441000	2443000	is a soundless quantity.
2443000	2445000	For example,
2445000	2447000	I want to define a soundless growth rate,
2447000	2449000	which is the original value
2449000	2451000	divided by the reference quantity.
2451000	2453000	Based on the following definition,
2453000	2455000	we can build
2455000	2457000	this soundless model.
2457000	2459000	In this model,
2459000	2461000	the soundless C-mass
2461000	2463000	will be the C-loading ratio.
2463000	2465000	In this way,
2465000	2467000	it is easier to see
2467000	2469000	how large the ratio is.
2469000	2471000	In terms of the
2471000	2473000	selection of the target function,
2473000	2475000	we just mentioned
2475000	2477000	the competition between
2477000	2479000	the higher-moment and lower-moment
2479000	2481000	target function,
2481000	2483000	so we choose one
2483000	2485000	as a representative.
2485000	2487000	We choose the volume of nucleation
2487000	2489000	and the number of nucleation
2489000	2491000	as the higher-moment and lower-moment
2491000	2493000	representative.
2493000	2495000	We can also write the target function
2495000	2497000	as a linear addition.
2497000	2499000	We use the same method
2499000	2501000	to solve this addition problem.
2501000	2503000	The process is similar,
2503000	2505000	so I won't go into details.
2505000	2507000	As for the city recipe,
2507000	2509000	we know that
2509000	2511000	there should be an infinite number
2511000	2513000	of city recipes
2513000	2515000	that can balance the nucleation.
2515000	2517000	We define the so-called
2517000	2519000	critical city recipe.
2519000	2521000	It is a combination of
2521000	2523000	C-loading ratio and
2523000	2525000	C-means size.
2525000	2527000	For example,
2527000	2529000	the nucleated volume
2529000	2531000	at the knee point
2531000	2533000	is equal to
2533000	2535000	1% of the city volume.
2535000	2537000	We consider 1%
2537000	2539000	to be negligible,
2539000	2541000	so we can use
2541000	2543000	C-loading ratio
2543000	2545000	to balance
2545000	2547000	the nucleation.
2547000	2549000	Next,
2549000	2551000	let's look at
2551000	2553000	the
2553000	2555000	kinetic parameter.
2555000	2557000	In our research,
2557000	2559000	we found 32 sets of
2559000	2561000	different crystallization systems.
2561000	2563000	We can see the relative
2563000	2565000	parameter gamma
2565000	2567000	and J.
2567000	2569000	In most systems,
2569000	2571000	gamma is between 1 and 2.5,
2571000	2573000	while J is between 0 and 1.
2573000	2575000	You can refer to
2575000	2577000	this paper
2577000	2579000	by me as
2579000	2581000	the first author
2581000	2583000	of the paper.
2583000	2585000	We consider the
2585000	2587000	solution of the crystallization system,
2587000	2589000	including many organic compounds,
2589000	2591000	non-organic compounds,
2591000	2593000	food additives,
2593000	2595000	and medicines.
2595000	2597000	You can refer to
2597000	2599000	these details in the paper.
2599000	2601000	In this case,
2601000	2603000	we can solve
2603000	2605000	the relative parietal front.
2605000	2607000	We find that
2607000	2609000	when the value of gamma
2609000	2611000	is higher than
2611000	2613000	the value of J,
2613000	2615000	the relative parietal front
2615000	2617000	will be wider.
2617000	2619000	On the other hand,
2619000	2621000	if the nucleation rate
2621000	2623000	and growth rate
2623000	2625000	are similar to
2625000	2627000	the sensitivity of
2627000	2629000	super-saturation,
2629000	2631000	gamma will be closer to 1,
2631000	2633000	and the relative parietal front
2633000	2635000	will be weaker.
2635000	2637000	At the same time,
2637000	2639000	the difference between
2639000	2641000	super-saturation and
2641000	2643000	nucleation rate
2643000	2645000	will be greater.
2645000	2647000	In other cases,
2647000	2649000	the difference will be smaller.
2649000	2651000	The reason is that
2651000	2653000	when J is between 0 and 1,
2653000	2655000	the super-saturation will
2655000	2657000	be minimized by
2657000	2659000	mu0n,
2659000	2661000	which is the maximum
2661000	2663000	reduction of nucleation rate.
2663000	2665000	In other cases,
2665000	2667000	if gamma is not large,
2667000	2669000	the relative parietal front
2669000	2671000	will not be wide,
2671000	2673000	and the result of
2673000	2675000	nucleation rate
2675000	2677000	and super-saturation
2677000	2679000	will not be much different.
2679000	2681000	This is another proof
2681000	2683000	that super-saturation
2683000	2685000	is a good control strategy
2685000	2687000	for most systems.
2689000	2691000	As for the series of design,
2691000	2693000	we will discuss
2693000	2695000	the impact of batch time
2695000	2697000	on the series of recipes.
2697000	2699000	The longer the batch time,
2699000	2701000	the smaller the
2701000	2703000	average super-saturation
2703000	2705000	and nucleation rate.
2705000	2707000	In this case,
2707000	2709000	we don't need to add so much seed.
2709000	2711000	However,
2711000	2713000	is it worth it?
2713000	2715000	Because the longer the batch time,
2715000	2717000	it is not a good thing.
2717000	2719000	Is there a CP value
2719000	2721000	to extend the batch time
2721000	2723000	to reduce the
2723000	2725000	amount of seed?
2725000	2727000	Is there a general rule
2727000	2729000	for different
2729000	2731000	systems?
2731000	2733000	Or is there a general rule?
2733000	2735000	We would like to
2735000	2737000	do an analysis
2737000	2739000	through this
2739000	2741000	random framework.
2741000	2743000	The result is
2743000	2745000	the extended batch time
2745000	2747000	affects the
2747000	2749000	seed loading ratio,
2749000	2751000	depending on
2751000	2753000	the system.
2755000	2757000	For example,
2757000	2759000	if I change the batch time
2759000	2761000	from 1 hour to 12 hours,
2761000	2763000	the amount of seed
2763000	2765000	changes from
2765000	2767000	100% to
2767000	2769000	20%.
2769000	2771000	However,
2771000	2773000	for system 3,
2773000	2775000	the extended batch time
2775000	2777000	basically has no effect.
2777000	2779000	This is called
2779000	2781000	system specific.
2781000	2783000	In this chapter,
2783000	2785000	we have analyzed
2785000	2787000	seed recipe design
2787000	2789000	and
2789000	2791000	seed loading ratio.
2791000	2793000	We will
2793000	2795000	use
2795000	2797000	a high-efficiency
2797000	2799000	random framework
2799000	2801000	to analyze
2801000	2803000	the best solution
2803000	2805000	by
2805000	2807000	using
2807000	2809000	a high-efficiency
2809000	2811000	random framework.
2811000	2813000	In the last part,
2813000	2815000	we consider
2815000	2817000	the donor stage.
2817000	2819000	In some documents,
2819000	2821000	it is mentioned that
2821000	2823000	if we include
2823000	2825000	the dissolution mechanism
2825000	2827000	into the operation,
2827000	2829000	we will have the opportunity
2829000	2831000	to control the
2831000	2833000	seed SSD
2833000	2835000	However,
2835000	2837000	if we use
2837000	2839000	the model-based method,
2839000	2841000	we will have to
2841000	2843000	analyze the crystal
2843000	2845000	disappearance.
2845000	2847000	In the process of
2847000	2849000	dissolution,
2849000	2851000	some crystals will
2851000	2853000	disappear.
2853000	2855000	In the past,
2855000	2857000	the model-based description
2857000	2859000	was described in
2859000	2861000	a rational way,
2861000	2863000	but in this chapter,
2863000	2865000	we want to solve this problem.
2867000	2869000	Since we want to
2869000	2871000	analyze the dissolution,
2871000	2873000	we have to analyze
2873000	2875000	the PPE.
2875000	2877000	Let's assume
2877000	2879000	there are many stages in the batch.
2879000	2881000	In each stage,
2881000	2883000	only growth
2883000	2885000	or dissolution occurs.
2885000	2887000	In addition,
2887000	2889000	this process always starts
2889000	2891000	with the dissolution.
2891000	2893000	In this way,
2893000	2895000	we can write the
2895000	2897000	number of growth stage
2897000	2899000	and dissolution stage,
2899000	2901000	and write the PPE.
2901000	2903000	The lower case k
2903000	2905000	is the stage number.
2905000	2907000	At the same time,
2907000	2909000	the kinetic expression
2909000	2911000	and the definition of
2911000	2913000	transform time
2913000	2915000	are based on
2915000	2917000	the growth stage expression
2917000	2919000	and the definition of
2919000	2921000	transform time expression.
2921000	2923000	In this way,
2923000	2925000	we can see that
2925000	2927000	the expression and
2927000	2929000	definition of transform time
2929000	2931000	are similar.
2931000	2933000	Let's divide the
2933000	2935000	PPE into
2935000	2937000	seed and nucleation part.
2937000	2939000	In the seed part,
2939000	2941000	we can solve
2941000	2943000	the expletive solution
2943000	2945000	in the tau domain.
2945000	2947000	We can see that
2947000	2949000	the expletive solution
2949000	2951000	can be expressed
2951000	2953000	in the tau domain
2953000	2955000	regardless of
2955000	2957000	growth stage
2957000	2959000	or dissolution stage.
2959000	2961000	Again,
2961000	2963000	we use a
2963000	2965000	high-performance method
2965000	2967000	to solve the seed PPE.
2967000	2969000	The nucleation part
2969000	2971000	is a bit more complicated
2971000	2973000	because it involves
2973000	2975000	the size-independent
2975000	2977000	growth and dissolution
2977000	2979000	kinetics.
2979000	2981000	The reason for this
2981000	2983000	is that
2983000	2985000	if we want to
2985000	2987000	use the
2987000	2989000	standard method
2989000	2991000	of moment
2991000	2993000	to solve the PPE,
2993000	2995000	this is a necessary
2995000	2997000	assumption.
2997000	2999000	At the same time,
2999000	3001000	it is a reasonable assumption
3001000	3003000	because the value of
3003000	3005000	GL and DL
3005000	3007000	are close to 1
3007000	3009000	when L is small.
3009000	3011000	When we
3011000	3013000	do the experiment
3013000	3015000	to fit the parameter,
3015000	3017000	most of the parameters
3017000	3019000	are used in the
3019000	3021000	seed-goron crystal experiment.
3021000	3023000	There is no evidence
3023000	3025000	to show that
3025000	3027000	small nucleated crystals
3027000	3029000	have the same kinetic behavior.
3029000	3031000	So we make the above assumption.
3031000	3033000	Under this assumption,
3033000	3035000	we can write the
3035000	3037000	corresponding PPE.
3037000	3039000	As you can see,
3039000	3041000	it is a continuous solution.
3041000	3043000	What is the benefit of this?
3043000	3045000	This can lead us to
3045000	3047000	directly use
3047000	3049000	the standard method of moment
3049000	3051000	to match the continuous expression
3051000	3053000	to deduce
3053000	3055000	the corresponding ODE.
3055000	3057000	What is the role of
3057000	3059000	the continuous expression?
3059000	3061000	Let's look at this graph.
3061000	3063000	Suppose we have a batch
3063000	3065000	with only two stages.
3065000	3067000	After the first stage is over,
3067000	3069000	the nucleated
3069000	3071000	CSD
3071000	3073000	looks like this.
3073000	3075000	The second stage
3075000	3077000	will move all the CSD
3077000	3079000	to the left
3079000	3081000	when it is about to
3081000	3083000	dissolve.
3083000	3085000	Once the crystal size
3085000	3087000	is reduced,
3087000	3089000	the continuous expression
3089000	3091000	can be used
3091000	3093000	as a reference
3093000	3095000	for the
3095000	3097000	disappearing crystal rate.
3097000	3099000	After discussing
3099000	3101000	some mathematical methods
3101000	3103000	and theories,
3103000	3105000	we can look at
3105000	3107000	the so-called
3107000	3109000	attenuable seed-goron CSD.
3109000	3111000	Why do we want to
3111000	3113000	find the CSD
3113000	3115000	The main idea is
3115000	3117000	that when we
3117000	3119000	select the crystal
3119000	3121000	or select the product,
3121000	3123000	we often use the
3123000	3125000	sieve to select the product.
3125000	3127000	In this way,
3127000	3129000	the average grain diameter of the product
3129000	3131000	and the width of the CSD
3131000	3133000	will be limited by the
3133000	3135000	size of the sieve.
3135000	3137000	So if we can
3137000	3139000	design a process
3139000	3141000	to control the grain
3141000	3143000	diameter and
3143000	3145000	the width of the CSD,
3145000	3147000	it will be the best.
3147000	3149000	So we can use
3149000	3151000	the algorithm
3151000	3153000	we just introduced
3153000	3155000	to do a quick analysis.
3155000	3157000	In this chapter,
3157000	3159000	we use a
3159000	3161000	simple system.
3161000	3163000	The simple system of kinetic
3163000	3165000	is shown below.
3165000	3167000	The next question is
3167000	3169000	how do we define
3169000	3171000	the so-called
3171000	3173000	attenuable region.
3173000	3175000	We use the
3175000	3177000	mean and
3177000	3179000	variance of the product
3179000	3181000	to define it.
3181000	3183000	We define the
3183000	3185000	seed CSD
3185000	3187000	and some constraints
3187000	3189000	for optimization.
3189000	3191000	The constraints include
3191000	3193000	initial condition,
3193000	3195000	seed loading,
3195000	3197000	solubility,
3197000	3199000	and production rate.
3199000	3201000	Some more detailed
3201000	3203000	explanations can be found
3203000	3205000	in another paper
3205000	3207000	by me.
3207000	3209000	I won't go into
3209000	3211000	too much detail here.
3211000	3213000	Next,
3213000	3215000	the constraints
3215000	3217000	for the product
3217000	3219000	mu0 and mu3
3219000	3221000	can be defined
3221000	3223000	by the
3223000	3225000	mean and
3225000	3227000	variance of the product
3227000	3229000	mu0 and mu3.
3229000	3231000	Finally,
3231000	3233000	when we define
3233000	3235000	the attenuable region,
3235000	3237000	we use the mean size
3237000	3239000	to define the
3239000	3241000	number volume mean.
3241000	3243000	We can then
3243000	3245000	use the constraints
3245000	3247000	we just mentioned
3247000	3249000	and
3249000	3251000	the number volume mean
3251000	3253000	of the target
3253000	3255000	to maximize or minimize
3255000	3257000	the product's sigma p
3257000	3259000	or variance.
3259000	3261000	In this way,
3261000	3263000	we can define the
3263000	3265000	attenuable region.
3265000	3267000	Note that
3267000	3269000	we only talked about the seed.
3269000	3271000	The PBE of the seed
3271000	3273000	can be expressed by tau.
3273000	3275000	Therefore,
3275000	3277000	we can see that
3277000	3279000	we haven't mentioned
3279000	3281000	the sum of saturation
3281000	3283000	of the seed.
3283000	3285000	This is the result.
3285000	3287000	First, let's look at
3287000	3289000	the attenuable region.
3289000	3291000	As a result,
3291000	3293000	if this is a single-stage process,
3293000	3295000	we will get an attenuable curve
3295000	3297000	instead of a region.
3297000	3299000	However,
3299000	3301000	if we have more stages,
3301000	3303000	the region will become wider.
3303000	3305000	However,
3305000	3307000	the width of the region
3307000	3309000	is basically
3309000	3311000	the same as
3311000	3313000	the width of the seed.
3313000	3315000	Therefore,
3315000	3317000	the CSD of
3317000	3319000	A, B, C
3319000	3321000	will become
3321000	3323000	wider and wider.
3323000	3325000	However,
3325000	3327000	the CSD of
3327000	3329000	D, E, F, G
3329000	3331000	will not change much.
3331000	3333000	Why is that?
3333000	3335000	Let's find out.
3335000	3337000	The result is
3337000	3339000	that the growth rate
3339000	3341000	and the dissolution rate
3341000	3343000	have different sensitivities
3343000	3345000	to the crystal size.
3345000	3347000	The growth rate
3347000	3349000	is more sensitive
3349000	3351000	while the dissolution rate
3351000	3353000	is only sensitive
3353000	3355000	in a small range.
3355000	3357000	Therefore,
3357000	3359000	if I want to make the CSD
3359000	3361000	narrower,
3361000	3363000	I can only do cycling
3363000	3365000	in a narrow region.
3365000	3367000	At the same time,
3367000	3369000	the mu3 change
3369000	3371000	in the growth stage
3371000	3373000	is relatively small.
3377000	3379000	Now,
3379000	3381000	let's talk about
3381000	3383000	the attenuable region.
3383000	3385000	If we have
3385000	3387000	the product
3387000	3389000	mean size
3389000	3391000	and sigma p,
3391000	3393000	and the value
3393000	3395000	is in the attenuable region,
3395000	3397000	we can use
3397000	3399000	the optimization problem
3399000	3401000	to find out
3401000	3403000	a set of CDO and
3403000	3405000	a set of TAUF.
3405000	3407000	There are many sets of solutions.
3407000	3409000	The patch time
3409000	3411000	and the nucleated volume
3411000	3413000	of each set
3413000	3415000	are different.
3415000	3417000	However, the patch time
3417000	3419000	and the nucleated volume
3419000	3421000	will depend on
3421000	3423000	the sequence of
3423000	3425000	the second function
3425000	3427000	and the constant function.
3431000	3433000	We can use
3433000	3435000	the optimization problem
3435000	3437000	to find out
3437000	3439000	the minimum patch time
3439000	3441000	under the conditions
3441000	3443000	of the product mean
3443000	3445000	and variance.
3447000	3449000	This is a trade-off.
3449000	3451000	The larger the set point
3451000	3453000	of the super-saturation,
3453000	3455000	the shorter the patch time.
3455000	3457000	However, the same nucleation rate
3457000	3459000	will be larger.
3459000	3461000	So, we draw
3461000	3463000	a curve
3463000	3465000	to analyze
3465000	3467000	the relationship.
3467000	3469000	At the same time,
3469000	3471000	we can deduce
3471000	3473000	the corresponding temperature.
3473000	3475000	Then, we can analyze
3475000	3477000	how large the set point
3477000	3479000	of the super-saturation
3479000	3481000	will be.
3481000	3483000	In this chapter,
3483000	3485000	we used the framework
3485000	3487000	to analyze
3487000	3489000	the C-CSD tailoring problem
3489000	3491000	using
3491000	3493000	gross dissolution cycles.
3493000	3495000	We can also
3495000	3497000	analyze the so-called
3497000	3499000	crystal disappearance.
3499000	3501000	As for
3501000	3503000	the expandability
3503000	3505000	of the attainable region,
3505000	3507000	it will be determined
3507000	3509000	by the kinetic.
3509000	3511000	We also discussed
3511000	3513000	the competitive relationship
3513000	3515000	between patch time
3515000	3517000	and inhibiting nucleation.
3517000	3519000	The conclusion of
3519000	3521000	the last chapter
3521000	3523000	is that
3523000	3525000	we analyzed the following
3525000	3527000	problems
3527000	3529000	using
3529000	3531000	coordinate transformation,
3531000	3533000	optimum control theory,
3533000	3535000	target number trade-off analysis,
3535000	3537000	rule-of-sum
3537000	3539000	control strategy,
3539000	3541000	C0-0 ratio
3541000	3543000	saving problem,
3543000	3545000	and attainable region
3545000	3547000	problem.
3547000	3549000	This kind of framework
3549000	3551000	can be used in
3551000	3553000	different fields.
3553000	3555000	These are some research directions
3555000	3557000	for the future,
3557000	3559000	including the analysis
3559000	3561000	of more complex
3561000	3563000	parameters,
3563000	3565000	including
3565000	3567000	crystal shape process,
3567000	3569000	and temperature dependent
3569000	3571000	systems.
3571000	3573000	We can also consider
3573000	3575000	the control of
3575000	3577000	model-based
3577000	3579000	control.
3579000	3581000	There are some
3581000	3583000	parameter uncertainty problems,
3583000	3585000	so we need
3585000	3587000	robustness analysis.
3587000	3589000	We can also
3589000	3591000	use optimum
3591000	3593000	control theory
3593000	3595000	in some advanced
3595000	3597000	control strategies,
3597000	3599000	such as
3599000	3601000	model predictive control.
3601000	3603000	This kind of
3603000	3605000	control strategy
3605000	3607000	requires higher
3607000	3609000	computational efficiency.
3609000	3611000	This is the
3611000	3613000	end of
3613000	3615000	today's lecture.
3615000	3617000	Thank you for
3617000	3619000	listening to my
3619000	3621000	presentation.
3621000	3623000	If you have any questions,
3623000	3625000	please feel free to ask.
3647000	3649000	Can you hear me?
3649000	3651000	Yes, we can.
3651000	3653000	This is a very
3653000	3655000	informative talk.
3655000	3657000	I have a
3657000	3659000	quick question.
3659000	3661000	You said robust analysis
3661000	3663000	is basically
3663000	3665000	like error analysis.
3665000	3667000	Let's say
3667000	3669000	there is a certain
3669000	3671000	uncertainty in the
3671000	3673000	kinetic parameter.
3673000	3675000	You can only give
3675000	3677000	a rough estimate.
3677000	3679000	If there is
3679000	3681000	such an uncertainty,
3681000	3683000	how much difference
3683000	3685000	will it make
3685000	3687000	if you run
3687000	3689000	it again?
3689000	3691000	Is that what you mean?
3691000	3693000	Yes.
3693000	3695000	I am just
3695000	3697000	curious
3697000	3699000	if this is
3699000	3701000	what you want to do
3701000	3703000	in the future.
3703000	3705000	I am curious
3705000	3707000	about the
3707000	3709000	kinetic parameter.
3709000	3711000	You are right.
3711000	3713000	I can understand.
3713000	3715000	I am a scientist.
3715000	3717000	It is difficult
3717000	3719000	to get a precise
3719000	3721000	kinetic parameter.
3721000	3723000	So I just want to know
3723000	3725000	what is the error.
3725000	3727000	According to
3727000	3729000	the best
3729000	3731000	data set
3731000	3733000	in the future.
3733000	3735000	If
3735000	3737000	there is such an
3737000	3739000	error,
3739000	3741000	how much difference
3741000	3743000	will it make
3743000	3745000	if you run
3745000	3747000	it again?
3747000	3749000	Will it cause
3749000	3751000	serious consequences?
3751000	3753000	If there is
3753000	3755000	a certain error,
3755000	3757000	we know
3757000	3759000	that the model
3759000	3761000	will be different.
3761000	3763000	I just want to know
3763000	3765000	your comment on this.
3765000	3767000	First of all,
3767000	3769000	this is the
3769000	3771000	future research direction.
3771000	3773000	We are still
3773000	3775000	doing some early
3775000	3777000	studies.
3777000	3779000	Indeed,
3779000	3781000	in the robust
3781000	3783000	control
3783000	3785000	or error analysis,
3785000	3787000	there is a lot of research.
3787000	3789000	Will it cause
3789000	3791000	disastrous consequences?
3791000	3793000	It may not.
3793000	3795000	It is because
3795000	3797000	the crystallization
3797000	3799000	process is quite long.
3799000	3801000	Of course, it may cause
3801000	3803000	some troubles
3803000	3805000	in post-processing.
3805000	3807000	Therefore,
3807000	3809000	some batch-to-batch
3809000	3811000	variations
3811000	3813000	or some
3813000	3815000	up-and-down errors
3815000	3817000	need to be studied.
3817000	3819000	As for the
3819000	3821000	systems we just mentioned,
3821000	3823000	we are currently
3823000	3825000	using other people's
3825000	3827000	experimental parameters
3827000	3829000	to do the so-called
3829000	3831000	unknown case analysis.
3831000	3833000	At present, we are
3833000	3835000	focusing on
3835000	3837000	some so-called
3837000	3839000	goal-tradeoff
3839000	3841000	algorithms.
3841000	3843000	We haven't
3843000	3845000	done this kind of
3845000	3847000	research in other
3847000	3849000	groups.
3849000	3851000	I see.
3851000	3853000	Since you are discussing
3853000	3855000	the crystallization process,
3855000	3857000	assuming that
3857000	3859000	there are some errors in
3859000	3861000	the kinetic parameters,
3861000	3863000	but the result is still
3863000	3865000	optimized,
3865000	3867000	it is
3867000	3869000	quite reasonable.
3869000	3871000	Indeed,
3871000	3873000	we may consider
3873000	3875000	some so-called nominal values
3875000	3877000	and some so-called robust values.
3877000	3879000	For example,
3879000	3881000	under some
3883000	3885000	kinetic errors,
3885000	3887000	what is the
3887000	3889000	variation of the result?
3891000	3893000	I see.
3893000	3895000	Have you ever done
3895000	3897000	any experiments
3897000	3899000	with the crystallization
3899000	3901000	process?
3901000	3903000	For example,
3903000	3905000	have you ever
3905000	3907000	compared some
3907000	3909000	experimental data
3909000	3911000	with the result of
3911000	3913000	profiling?
3915000	3917000	To be honest,
3917000	3919000	I haven't.
3919000	3921000	Frankly speaking,
3921000	3923000	we are
3923000	3925000	optimizing
3925000	3927000	and calculating
3927000	3929000	the result.
3931000	3933000	Thank you.
3933000	3935000	Thank you.
3943000	3945000	Any other questions?
3953000	3955000	OK.
3955000	3957000	I have the most questions.
3959000	3961000	I have a question.
3961000	3963000	But I am not sure
3963000	3965000	if I have mentioned it.
3965000	3967000	You mentioned
3967000	3969000	the multi-target
3969000	3971000	PBE.
3971000	3973000	I forgot which page.
3973000	3975000	You mentioned Alpha, Beta,
3975000	3977000	Beta 1 and Beta 2.
3977000	3979000	You mentioned
3979000	3981000	how to
3981000	3983000	look at Beta 1 and Beta 2.
3983000	3985000	Right.
3985000	3987000	When you
3987000	3989000	introduced the function,
3989000	3991000	I was curious
3991000	3993000	how you
3993000	3995000	decide the
3995000	3997000	weight.
3997000	3999000	It seems that
3999000	4001000	you have
4001000	4003000	linked
4003000	4005000	Phi 1 and Phi 2.
4005000	4007000	Have you considered
4007000	4009000	linking more?
4009000	4011000	Or
4011000	4013000	do you use
4013000	4015000	this expression?
4019000	4021000	Phi 1 and Phi 2.
4021000	4023000	Alpha 1
4023000	4025000	will be
4025000	4027000	considered as
4027000	4029000	Phi 1.
4029000	4031000	Alpha between 0 and 1
4031000	4033000	will be
4033000	4035000	Phi 1 and Phi 2,
4035000	4037000	any weight.
4037000	4039000	As long as
4039000	4041000	Alpha between 0 and 1
4041000	4043000	can be
4043000	4045000	analyzed.
4047000	4049000	Sorry.
4049000	4051000	You may have interrupted.
4053000	4055000	You can
4055000	4057000	continue.
4057000	4059000	OK.
4059000	4061000	Alpha between 0 and 1
4061000	4063000	will be considered as
4063000	4065000	Phi 1 or Phi 2.
4065000	4067000	As long as
4067000	4069000	Alpha between 0 and 1
4069000	4071000	can be considered as
4071000	4073000	Phi 1 or Phi 2,
4073000	4075000	any weight.
4075000	4077000	Right.
4077000	4079000	How do you know
4079000	4081000	which one is better?
4081000	4083000	If Alpha is bigger,
4083000	4085000	Phi 1 is more important.
4085000	4087000	If Alpha is smaller,
4087000	4089000	Phi 2 is more important.
4089000	4091000	How do you know
4091000	4093000	which one is more important?
4093000	4095000	OK.
4095000	4097000	Because
4097000	4099000	the first question is
4099000	4101000	it's hard to say.
4101000	4103000	For example, Phi 1 is twice as important as Phi 2.
4103000	4105000	It's hard to define.
4105000	4107000	So the idea is
4107000	4109000	we do a
4109000	4111000	so-called normalization
4111000	4113000	on page 22.
4113000	4115000	We compress Phi 1 and Phi 2
4115000	4117000	to be between 0 and 1.
4117000	4119000	Like this picture on the right.
4119000	4121000	These two points,
4121000	4123000	these two points correspond to
4123000	4125000	the best solution of Phi 1 and Phi 2.
4125000	4127000	After normalization,
4127000	4129000	it corresponds to
4129000	4131000	the two points
4131000	4133000	0 and 1.
4133000	4135000	So on such a plane,
4135000	4137000	the original point is
4137000	4139000	the best solution
4139000	4141000	of two goal functions at the same time.
4141000	4143000	But due to competition,
4143000	4145000	this is not possible.
4145000	4147000	So we want to
4147000	4149000	draw the cradle front first.
4149000	4151000	Then we find a point
4151000	4153000	that is the shortest distance
4153000	4155000	between this point and the original point.
4155000	4157000	It means that
4157000	4159000	the value of this point
4159000	4161000	in Phi 1 and Phi 2
4161000	4163000	and the percentage difference
4163000	4165000	between them
4165000	4167000	is the smallest.
4167000	4169000	And this point is
4169000	4171000	the best trade-off.
4171000	4173000	There is a
4173000	4175000	name in the multi-goal function
4175000	4177000	called knee point.
4177000	4179000	It can be used to describe such a point.
4179000	4181000	Basically, it is done
4181000	4183000	in this way.
4183000	4185000	I see.
4185000	4187000	What I just saw is
4187000	4189000	how to say
4189000	4191000	when you minimize
4191000	4193000	the distance from the original point,
4193000	4195000	my intuition is that
4195000	4197000	in terms of math,
4197000	4199000	that point also means
4199000	4201000	that the plus solution
4201000	4203000	you are looking for
4203000	4205000	should be minimized.
4205000	4207000	Or is it not necessary?
4207000	4209000	I'm just curious
4209000	4211000	if there is a link between them.
4211000	4213000	I should say
4213000	4215000	that there is a
4215000	4217000	so-called double-layer optimization
4217000	4219000	when solving.
4219000	4221000	The first layer is
4221000	4223000	to find any point
4223000	4225000	on this cradle front.
4225000	4227000	We can call any point
4227000	4229000	a plus solution.
4229000	4231000	It's just that
4231000	4233000	we need to find
4233000	4235000	the best solution.
4235000	4237000	Then we need to
4237000	4239000	minimize the distance.
4239000	4241000	So in fact,
4241000	4243000	when solving such a problem,
4243000	4245000	it is actually a double-layer optimization problem.
4247000	4249000	Double-layer may come from
4249000	4251000	you have two goal functions.
4255000	4257000	Because I just saw that
4257000	4259000	you have some different combinations,
4259000	4261000	maybe four combinations,
4261000	4263000	and each of them involves
4263000	4265000	two goal functions.
4265000	4267000	Of course,
4267000	4269000	in optimization,
4269000	4271000	the two goal functions
4271000	4273000	must be a little bit
4273000	4275000	equal to each other.
4275000	4277000	This is more meaningful.
4277000	4279000	Otherwise,
4279000	4281000	it's just that both are minimized
4281000	4283000	or both are maximized.
4283000	4285000	I can imagine
4285000	4287000	that if you have n goal functions,
4287000	4289000	your combination must be
4289000	4291000	c6x2 or something like that.
4291000	4293000	I'm just wondering
4293000	4295000	whether you have ever
4295000	4297000	considered
4297000	4299000	whether it is reasonable to
4299000	4301000	consider more than two goal functions,
4301000	4303000	or even three or more goal functions.
4303000	4305000	OK.
4305000	4307000	There are several ideas.
4307000	4309000	The first idea is
4309000	4311000	that of course we can
4311000	4313000	consider six goal functions.
4313000	4315000	Of course we can do
4315000	4317000	c6x2 or 15.
4317000	4319000	However,
4319000	4321000	is it necessary?
4321000	4323000	In fact,
4323000	4325000	between some goal functions,
4325000	4327000	how should I put it?
4327000	4329000	When doing the analysis,
4329000	4331000	we found that
4331000	4333000	the relationship between
4333000	4335000	the higher moment and lower moment
4335000	4337000	is significantly stronger.
4337000	4339000	So in this case,
4339000	4341000	when we are doing
4341000	4343000	the so-called tradeoff analysis
4343000	4345000	or when we want to find
4345000	4347000	the relationship between
4347000	4349000	the higher moment
4349000	4351000	and lower moment,
4351000	4353000	it is not necessary
4353000	4355000	to consider
4355000	4357000	the so-called
4357000	4359000	two higher moment
4359000	4361000	or two lower moment
4361000	4363000	goal functions.
4363000	4365000	Of course,
4365000	4367000	in fact,
4367000	4369000	it can be done,
4369000	4371000	and it can also be done mathematically.
4371000	4373000	However,
4373000	4375000	the relationship between the higher moment
4375000	4377000	and lower moment
4377000	4379000	may become plateau surface
4379000	4381000	or even higher.
4381000	4383000	I believe it can be done mathematically.
4383000	4385000	It's just that we didn't do
4385000	4387000	such a thing.
4387000	4389000	In addition,
4389000	4391000	when we usually
4391000	4393000	explore the
4393000	4395000	Piscitein's maximization,
4395000	4397000	we probably only see
4397000	4399000	at most two goal functions.
4399000	4401000	At present,
4401000	4403000	we only see more than three
4403000	4405000	goal functions.
4405000	4407000	Another idea may be that
4407000	4409000	these are some of the
4409000	4411000	characteristics of product CST,
4411000	4413000	so the two characteristics
4413000	4415000	can describe
4415000	4417000	the benefits and
4417000	4419000	disadvantages of this product.
4419000	4421000	I see.
4421000	4423000	So in most of your cases,
4423000	4425000	it sounds like
4425000	4427000	before you did it,
4427000	4429000	you probably knew
4429000	4431000	how to get
4431000	4433000	which two
4433000	4435000	or how to say
4435000	4437000	which two
4437000	4439000	goal functions
4439000	4441000	have a stronger
4441000	4443000	anti-alignment relationship.
4443000	4445000	Yes.
4445000	4447000	In fact, in some
4447000	4449000	earlier studies,
4449000	4451000	it was found that
4451000	4453000	for example,
4453000	4455000	the moment of the goal function
4455000	4457000	is relatively large,
4457000	4459000	its trajectory will become
4459000	4461000	larger in the later stage of the growth rate.
4461000	4463000	On the contrary,
4463000	4465000	if the goal function
4465000	4467000	is composed of small moments,
4467000	4469000	its trajectory will be
4469000	4471000	larger in the early stage of the growth rate.
4471000	4473000	Just like this,
4473000	4475000	there will be some
4475000	4477000	ideas that
4477000	4479000	whether the
4479000	4481000	early stage is larger,
4481000	4483000	and the later stage is larger,
4483000	4485000	its trade-off is constant.
4485000	4487000	There is such an idea.
4487000	4489000	But the reason why
4489000	4491000	earlier studies
4491000	4493000	can't draw a
4493000	4495000	plateau front like this
4495000	4497000	is because
4497000	4499000	in fact,
4499000	4501000	if I set an alpha,
4501000	4503000	I have to solve the
4503000	4505000	optimization problem once.
4505000	4507000	If I use
4507000	4509000	some different
4509000	4511000	so-called solving methods,
4511000	4513000	it may involve
4513000	4515000	some non-variable.
4515000	4517000	In this way,
4517000	4519000	I only need one point,
4519000	4521000	and I may die.
4521000	4523000	Not to mention that
4523000	4525000	I have to draw a complete plateau front,
4525000	4527000	and I have to find the knee point.
4527000	4529000	So earlier studies
4529000	4531000	had this idea,
4531000	4533000	but due to
4533000	4535000	computational burden,
4535000	4537000	they didn't do this in the early stage.
4537000	4539000	Until later,
4539000	4541000	the German
4541000	4543000	approach
4543000	4545000	was introduced,
4545000	4547000	we realized that
4547000	4549000	we can quickly
4549000	4551000	measure the
4551000	4553000	trade-off.
4555000	4557000	I'm just curious.
4557000	4559000	You probably know
4559000	4561000	the cost of
4561000	4563000	calculation
4563000	4565000	and
4565000	4567000	the complexity
4567000	4569000	of the time
4569000	4571000	to draw a
4571000	4573000	plateau front.
4575000	4577000	I'm not sure.
4577000	4579000	But I can be sure that
4579000	4581000	if today's situation
4581000	4583000	is like this,
4583000	4585000	because of
4585000	4587000	the time limit of
4587000	4589000	this video,
4589000	4591000	I didn't show it.
4591000	4593000	In fact,
4593000	4595000	the so-called
4595000	4597000	best
4597000	4599000	U-star
4599000	4601000	solution
4601000	4603000	can be written out.
4603000	4605000	It can be written out
4605000	4607000	under some assumptions.
4607000	4609000	But if it's written out,
4609000	4611000	it's just
4611000	4613000	a question of
4613000	4615000	point ODE.
4615000	4617000	And the point
4617000	4619000	refers to
4619000	4621000	the initial value problem.
4621000	4623000	So it becomes a very simple
4623000	4625000	solution
4625000	4627000	that can be solved
4627000	4629000	with some
4629000	4631000	false-order solvers.
4631000	4633000	This method
4633000	4635000	is a very
4635000	4637000	competitive reason.
4637000	4639000	I see.
4639000	4641000	Thank you.
4641000	4643000	Anyone else
4651000	4653000	have any questions
4653000	4655000	for the presentation?
4663000	4665000	I actually have
4665000	4667000	some questions
4667000	4669000	and some
4669000	4671000	ideas.
4671000	4673000	For example,
4673000	4675000	in our lab,
4675000	4677000	there is a senior
4677000	4679000	who is going to
4679000	4681000	parameterize
4681000	4683000	some
4683000	4685000	particles'
4685000	4687000	positions.
4687000	4689000	In the process of
4689000	4691000	parameterization,
4691000	4693000	he is going to
4693000	4695000	predict
4695000	4697000	the two parameters
4697000	4699000	of Lennard-Jones
4699000	4701000	in a particle.
4701000	4703000	He may
4703000	4705000	have four
4705000	4707000	experimental data
4707000	4709000	that he can
4709000	4711000	take down
4711000	4713000	to fit.
4713000	4715000	At that time,
4715000	4717000	he didn't know
4717000	4719000	which of the four
4719000	4721000	should be taken
4721000	4723000	or not.
4723000	4725000	So this is
4725000	4727000	a little bit
4727000	4729000	like a
4729000	4731000	multi-target function.
4731000	4733000	I'm not sure
4733000	4735000	whether this
4735000	4737000	method
4737000	4739000	can be
4739000	4741000	applied in your field.
4741000	4743000	But it reminds me that
4743000	4745000	our senior used
4745000	4747000	Bayesian inference.
4747000	4749000	There is an important
4749000	4751000	thing in Bayesian inference,
4751000	4753000	which is the
4753000	4755000	base factor.
4755000	4757000	The base factor
4757000	4759000	can estimate
4759000	4761000	the accuracy
4761000	4763000	after adding
4763000	4765000	a parameter.
4765000	4767000	Sometimes,
4767000	4769000	adding one more parameter
4769000	4771000	may not be
4771000	4773000	as good as
4773000	4775000	expected.
4775000	4777000	So we use
4777000	4779000	the base factor
4779000	4781000	for multi-target function.
4781000	4783000	I'm curious about the complexity of time.
4783000	4785000	Sometimes, when we think about
4785000	4787000	high-end problems,
4787000	4789000	the cost of
4789000	4791000	calculation
4791000	4793000	may not be linear.
4793000	4795000	So the senior's
4795000	4797000	method may not be
4797000	4799000	applicable to everything.
4799000	4801000	Sometimes, the cost of
4801000	4803000	optimizing is too high.
4803000	4805000	If we consider two parameters
4805000	4807000	and get 90% accuracy,
4807000	4809000	the cost may not be
4809000	4811000	as high as
4811000	4813000	expected.
4813000	4815000	Actually,
4815000	4817000	we have encountered
4817000	4819000	this problem recently.
4819000	4821000	It may be
4821000	4823000	related to this screen.
4823000	4825000	For example,
4825000	4827000	when we are doing
4827000	4829000	production cooperation,
4829000	4831000	we often need to
4831000	4833000	fit some live data.
4833000	4835000	For example,
4835000	4837000	today,
4837000	4839000	a junior
4839000	4841000	is doing a
4841000	4843000	high-polymer analysis
4843000	4845000	project.
4845000	4847000	The reaction of
4847000	4849000	high-polymer analysis
4849000	4851000	is very complicated.
4851000	4853000	There are only 20 or 30
4853000	4855000	power rooms,
4855000	4857000	not to mention
4857000	4859000	each power room
4859000	4861000	has its own parameters.
4861000	4863000	So we are thinking
4863000	4865000	how to do fitting
4865000	4867000	so that
4867000	4869000	the model
4869000	4871000	can be built
4871000	4873000	with Aspen Plus
4873000	4875000	or something else.
4875000	4877000	At that time,
4877000	4879000	a junior
4879000	4881000	used a
4881000	4883000	set of
4883000	4885000	Bayesian optimization
4885000	4887000	in Python.
4887000	4889000	I don't know if you mentioned
4889000	4891000	this just now.
4891000	4893000	There are some projects
4893000	4895000	that have
4895000	4897000	achieved some success
4897000	4899000	with Bayesian
4899000	4901000	optimization.
4903000	4905000	I think it should be the same.
4905000	4907000	I haven't used Python,
4907000	4909000	but I guess it's
4909000	4911000	similar in theory.
4911000	4913000	Yes,
4913000	4915000	I have
4915000	4917000	encountered a similar problem.
4917000	4919000	For example,
4919000	4921000	we want to build
4921000	4923000	a Cydia model.
4923000	4925000	The problem with this model
4925000	4927000	is that it takes
4927000	4929000	quite a long time
4929000	4931000	to calculate
4931000	4933000	with Aspen.
4933000	4935000	One and a half minutes
4935000	4937000	is not too long,
4937000	4939000	but there are
4939000	4941000	a lot of
4941000	4943000	fittings needed.
4943000	4945000	The performance
4945000	4947000	of the computer is also limited.
4947000	4949000	I don't know
4949000	4951000	which parameter combination
4951000	4953000	is the best,
4953000	4955000	so I'm trying to
4955000	4957000	find a better
4957000	4959000	fitting method.
4959000	4961000	Whether it's
4961000	4963000	good parameters
4963000	4965000	or some
4965000	4967000	uncertainty in code data,
4967000	4969000	it's quite big.
4969000	4971000	It's quite a headache for me.
4971000	4973000	It sounds like
4973000	4975000	the idea
4975000	4977000	of machine learning
4977000	4979000	can also be used
4979000	4981000	in some cases.
4983000	4985000	Do you want to consider
4985000	4987000	machine learning?
4991000	4993000	No,
4993000	4995000	fitting is just a part
4995000	4997000	of your job.
4997000	4999000	I'm just kidding.
4999000	5001000	Everyone loves machine learning.
5001000	5003000	Actually,
5003000	5005000	since three years ago,
5005000	5007000	some cases
5007000	5009000	of ASP
5009000	5011000	have been
5011000	5013000	doing machine learning.
5013000	5015000	About two years ago,
5015000	5017000	ASP
5017000	5019000	proposed
5019000	5021000	an idea
5021000	5023000	in the AI era.
5023000	5025000	They asked
5025000	5027000	every department
5027000	5029000	to propose a
5029000	5031000	improvement case
5031000	5033000	and the improvement
5033000	5035000	would directly affect
5035000	5037000	the popularity of the final exam.
5037000	5039000	At that time,
5039000	5041000	the result was
5041000	5043000	that the manufacturers
5043000	5045000	could only
5045000	5047000	vote
5047000	5049000	to see if
5049000	5051000	they could do it.
5051000	5053000	At that time,
5053000	5055000	we didn't know much about it,
5055000	5057000	so we went to
5057000	5059000	the Department of Mechanical Engineering
5059000	5061000	and proposed a case.
5061000	5063000	It turned out
5063000	5065000	to be a team
5065000	5067000	of a chemical plant,
5067000	5069000	a chemical plant,
5069000	5071000	and a factory.
5071000	5073000	However,
5073000	5075000	we found that
5075000	5077000	there were some shortcomings
5077000	5079000	or uncertainties
5079000	5081000	in the sample data
5081000	5083000	or some damage to the sample data.
5083000	5085000	So,
5085000	5087000	the final result
5087000	5089000	was too limited.
5091000	5093000	In my experience,
5093000	5095000	what we could do
5095000	5097000	was quite limited.
5099000	5101000	The results were not very good,
5101000	5103000	but I don't know if it was because
5103000	5105000	we were not
5105000	5107000	well-versed enough.
5107000	5109000	I don't know if it was because
5109000	5111000	we were not well-versed enough.
5111000	5113000	It was indeed in the development stage.
5113000	5115000	Because in the end,
5115000	5117000	you still have to go back to physics.
5117000	5119000	How do you connect
5119000	5121000	with physics in the end?
5121000	5123000	This is also a topic
5123000	5125000	that we have been working on.
5125000	5127000	In addition,
5127000	5129000	this data-driven model
5129000	5131000	is not physically meaningful,
5131000	5133000	so
5133000	5135000	there are a lot of
5135000	5137000	limitations in use.
5137000	5139000	For example, if you want to do a
5139000	5141000	on-site energy saving analysis,
5141000	5143000	it will become
5143000	5145000	impossible to use
5145000	5147000	the data-driven model,
5147000	5149000	because it will
5149000	5151000	make some
5151000	5153000	disruptive changes
5153000	5155000	to the existing operating conditions.
5155000	5157000	This will make it impossible
5157000	5159000	to use the data-based model.
5159000	5161000	It is also quite difficult
5161000	5163000	to handle.
5165000	5167000	If you are doing
5167000	5169000	a machine learning
5169000	5171000	that is not chained,
5171000	5173000	it will result in
5173000	5175000	destructive results.
5175000	5177000	So it becomes
5177000	5179000	that for the cases
5179000	5181000	we have received,
5181000	5183000	the extent to which
5183000	5185000	it can be used is quite limited.
5185000	5187000	Although they are still
5187000	5189000	in the so-called
5189000	5191000	AI era,
5191000	5193000	in the end,
5193000	5195000	some cases will
5195000	5197000	result in
5197000	5199000	the so-called
5199000	5201000	data-driven model,
5201000	5203000	which will
5203000	5205000	result in
5205000	5207000	disruptive changes
5207000	5209000	to the existing
5209000	5211000	operating conditions.
5211000	5213000	In the end,
5213000	5215000	some cases will
5215000	5217000	result in
5217000	5219000	disruptive changes
5219000	5221000	to the existing
5221000	5223000	operating conditions.
5223000	5225000	I will now
5225000	5227000	wrap it up.
5233000	5235000	Hello?
5235000	5237000	Hello?
5237000	5239000	Hello?
5239000	5241000	Hello?
5241000	5243000	Hello?
5243000	5245000	Hello?
5245000	5247000	Hello?
5247000	5249000	Hello?
5249000	5251000	Hello?
5251000	5253000	AI in
5253000	5255000	cases like ours
5255000	5257000	is quite limited.
5259000	5261000	In other words,
5261000	5263000	some cases
5263000	5265000	are not AI,
5265000	5267000	but we still have to
5267000	5269000	wrap it up.
5269000	5271000	Yes, that's another point.
5271000	5273000	What do you think
5273000	5275000	about MLD?
5275000	5277000	It's a bit too flamboyant.
5277000	5279000	Yes.
5279000	5281000	It's easy to
5281000	5283000	wrap it up.
5283000	5285000	It's easy to
5285000	5287000	learn about
5287000	5289000	quantum mechanics.
5289000	5291000	It's easy to
5291000	5293000	become flamboyant.
5293000	5295000	Yes, it's a bit
5295000	5297000	too flamboyant.
5297000	5299000	It's data-driven,
5299000	5301000	and it can't return to physics.
5301000	5303000	It's not reasonable.
5303000	5305000	If it returns to physics,
5305000	5307000	it's still
5307000	5309000	very limited.
5309000	5311000	Yes.
5311000	5313000	Of course,
5313000	5315000	this has nothing to do with
5315000	5317000	today's topic,
5317000	5319000	but we did encounter
5319000	5321000	some
5321000	5323000	problems.
5333000	5335000	Are there any other questions?
5337000	5339000	If not,
5339000	5341000	it's about time
5341000	5343000	to wrap up.
5343000	5345000	Thank you,
5345000	5347000	Haoran,
5347000	5349000	for your presentation.
5349000	5351000	Thank you,
5351000	5353000	everyone.
5353000	5355000	It's been a long time
5355000	5357000	since I've heard
5357000	5359000	this kind of thing.
