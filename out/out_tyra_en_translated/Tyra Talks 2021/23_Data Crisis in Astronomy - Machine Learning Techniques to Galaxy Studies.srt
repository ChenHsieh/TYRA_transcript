00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we are honored to have Dr. Teng-Ting Yun with us to discuss today's lecture.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's topic is Data Crisis in Astronomy, Machine Learning Techniques to Galaxy Studies.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Before we start the lecture, let me introduce Teng-Yun first.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Teng-Yun is now at the Center for Extragalactic Astronomy at Durham University in the UK.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
She is an astrophysicist.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
She got her bachelor's and master's degree in Taiwan.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then she went to Nottingham, also in the UK, and got her doctorate.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She got her doctorate last year.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Her main interest is galactic evolution and formation.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
She is now focusing on machine learning techniques for galaxy study.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In today's lecture, she will talk about her specialty, machine learning for galaxy study.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
She will also talk about her past work.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She will also talk about how machine learning will help galaxy study in the future.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, let's welcome Teng-Yun with a round of applause.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you, everyone.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you, everyone.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you, Chair, for the warm introduction.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, and good night.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm Teng-Yun.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Durham University.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'd like to apologize to everyone first.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think I'm going to talk a lot in Chinese and English.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I can't show my speaker notes.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I usually speak in English.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So my Chinese sometimes gets stuck.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What I'd like to share with you today is about machine learning.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's becoming more and more popular in astronomy.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is a research topic for my postdoctoral research.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm going to share with you some papers I did in my postdoctoral research.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
First of all, let me introduce myself.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What is an astronomer?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Basically, every time I tell everyone that I'm an astronomer,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
everyone has a different idea of what an astronomer is.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Most of the time, people will ask me,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you know what the meteorite of Saturn is?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or people will point to a star in the sky and ask me,

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you know what that star is?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have to be honest and say I really don't know.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If I tell people I'm a postdoctoral researcher,

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
my mom will exaggerate and say,

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do you know that my daughter is a professor?

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's not that exaggerated.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mom, please calm down.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you are an astronomer or a theoretical astronomer,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the most common thing we do every day is to use a computer.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're not writing code, we're debugging.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Especially what we do most often is data analysis.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You may be analyzing certain stars.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Or like me, I'm analyzing big data.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I may be analyzing hundreds of thousands or even millions of galaxies at a time.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm interested in two directions.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
One is information classification,

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which is Galaxy Morphological Classification.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The other part is more cosmological.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I do Lama Napa Forest or IGN-CGN.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know what this term means.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because today I'm going to focus on information classification.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's relatively straightforward.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is the most famous information classification system.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's categorized by human eyes.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's called Hubble Sequence.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a name given by a famous astronomer, Hubble.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Information classification can be divided into many types.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can classify according to different brightness,

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
or different degree of evolution,

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or even different information structures.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Unfortunately, human eye classification is the most commonly used system in astronomy.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We've been using Hubble Sequence for almost 100 years.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
As for big data,

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm showing you the data from various surveys in recent years.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
As you can see from the left side,

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the data you can see in the astronomy survey is about 1TB.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In the future, we expect to break through the 1TB scale.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So we find that the data is growing very fast.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Because of computer technology, we can store a lot of data.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But the problem is that in astronomy,

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we can't handle such a large amount of data in a traditional way.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We have data, but we can't handle it.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me show you the big data.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Since 2005, SDSS has been a very famous large-scale field tracking program.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It has observed about 50 million stars.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But in fact, we've done a lot of analysis,

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and we've done a lot of detailed research.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There are only about 1 million stars.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You know that the speed of our analysis is very, very slow.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's far less than the speed of our data generation.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The most famous program in information classification is Galaxy Zoo.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Galaxy Zoo is a program that invites people from all over the world to do information classification together.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Because you can imagine that information classification is actually a very straightforward thing.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You can look at a star and see if it has a spiral.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Then you can analyze whether it is an elliptical star or a spiral star.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Galaxy Zoo thinks that people from all over the world can do this kind of thing.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So they let the general public participate in this information classification program.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But even if they gather people from all over the world to do this kind of analysis,

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
they only classified about 900,000 galaxies in about three years.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So you know that if, for example, the data I'm doing right now is DAS data.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The initial data for this part of the data is about 30 trillion galaxies.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The analysis I did in my paper is about 2 trillion galaxies.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So you know that if we want to do it in a traditional way today,

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we need to analyze it in a human way.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Even if we do it in the way of Galaxy Zoo,

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
you may not be able to finish it in your life.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So we need some help at this time.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When we say we are in trouble, I always say I am in trouble.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't do this kind of large-scale survey analysis because I have too much data.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
At this time, many people will start to seek help from machine learning.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is my topic today.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Here you can see the recent paper on machine learning in astronomy.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can see that there has been an exponential growth in the past few years.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
More and more papers are doing related things.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I started to read the textbook in 2017.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When I was reading the textbook, I was very impressed.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
At that time, basically no one was doing it.

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Everyone is just starting to do it.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But after that, I will probably have a new paper every day.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I will see a new paper every day talking about machine learning applications.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let me talk about it.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
In astronomy, I think it's pretty much the same in computer science.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Machine learning applications are roughly divided into supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised.

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course, there are other more detailed things.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I won't talk about it for the time being.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is a more general classification.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I will talk about these three categories later.

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So my talk today will be more technical.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you have any questions that you are not familiar with machine learning, you can ask me right away.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It doesn't matter.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In terms of applications, you can roughly divide it into three different questions.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can do classification, or you can do regression.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You want to predict a continuous value.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or you can do data generation.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
These are the things that machine learning can help with.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I basically have a list of these three.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But I'm going to focus on the classification problem today.

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In terms of its purpose, most of the things we want to do in astronomy are what I just said.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because we have a lot of data.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But our traditional way of analyzing is far less than dealing with this data.

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The biggest problem is that we want to deal with efficiency issues.

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
A large part of it is related to how we measure quantity.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Machine learning can basically help us improve the accuracy of some measurements.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So the two main purposes of machine learning are to improve efficiency and accuracy.

141
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But today, in addition to these two, I want to talk to you about what else we can do.

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What else we can do with machine learning?

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can be more creative when it comes to machine learning.

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
To sum up what I just said, it's a long start.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm going to divide it into two parts today.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The first part is very short.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's about how to improve efficiency and accuracy.

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The second part is about what else you can do.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm going to focus on unsupervised machine learning and self-supervised machine learning.

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's go back to the very beginning, the Hubble sequence.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's simplify the problem now.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know what you think of the Hubble sequence.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I'm going to try to explain it in a way that's not my area of expertise.

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So my explanation is going to be a little more shallow.

155
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can usually divide the Hubble sequence into two categories.

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The elliptic sequence and the spiral sequence.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's very simple to classify them.

158
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There's the concept of a spiral coin.

159
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know if you can see my mouse.

160
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Can you see my mouse?

161
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The spiral coin is very obvious.

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's the shape of a spiral.

163
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
As long as there's a spiral coin, we define it as a spiral sequence.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The other is to define it as a elliptic sequence.

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So far, you can just say that it's a very straightforward, very simple thing to classify.

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that's why Galaxy Zoo can get the public to help with this.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry, can I ask a question?

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'd like to ask a naive question.

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why are all the stars in the galaxy in the shape of a circle?

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is there a possibility that they're in the shape of a triangle?

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes, there is.

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
As you can see, they're in the shape of a circle because of the projection.

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In fact, every star has a depth.

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In terms of elliptical stars, they're basically like a ball.

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They're like a ball in a triangular space.

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Their light distribution is also the shape of a ball.

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But if you look at a spiral star today, it's more like a disk.

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So if you project it to 3D today,

179
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the distribution of light will be more like a disk, not a ball.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So this is also in the galaxy.

181
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So my question is, why are some of them in the shape of a disk,

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
instead of a triangular elliptical shape?

183
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's a good question.

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This question is mainly related to the evolution of stars.

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
For example, this question is a bit difficult to answer.

186
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But it's mainly related to the evolution of stars.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Our current theory is that

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
we start with the spiral galaxy.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How do I say it in Mandarin?

190
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Can I speak English?

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, you can.

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
For spiral galaxies, they think that in the beginning,

193
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
you will have some gas that accretions into this structure.

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not like a ball.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's more like a disk.

196
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a flat disk.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's in the shape of an accretion disk.

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's not like a whole ball.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not like a whole ball.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
In our understanding,

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
the main formation of stars should start from that.

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So in our understanding,

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the spiral galaxy is formed first.

204
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Gradually, the two galaxies merge together.

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
After the momentum dissipates,

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
it slowly forms the shape of a ball.

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because the shape of a ball is more like an accretion disk.

208
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Does this answer your question?

209
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's okay. We can discuss it later.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay.

212
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This part is actually quite long.

213
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's not related to what I talked about today.

214
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The first part is supervised learning.

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let me tell you what supervised learning is.

216
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Supervised machine learning is a very simple concept.

217
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We feed a picture to the machine.

218
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Then we give it a label.

219
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
For example, I tell the machine that this is a dog.

220
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then I tell it that this is a fried chicken.

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Then I feed it a lot of pictures.

222
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Pictures of different dogs and fried chickens.

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
After the machine learns,

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it will ask the dog if it is a dog or a fried chicken.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is the concept of supervised learning.

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Supervised learning is a very common concept.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In my 2020 paper,

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I studied 10 different supervised machine learning algorithms.

229
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Today I will focus on the Confluential Neural Network.

230
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let me briefly introduce the Confluential Neural Network

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
to those who are not familiar with machine learning.

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The idea is that we have Confluential Layers

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to do feature extraction.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What Confluential Layers is actually doing

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
is a bit like a filter concept.

236
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It actually wants to capture some features

237
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that can best represent your image.

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When you want to produce these labels,

239
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
what are the key points?

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What are the key points for the machine to make judgments?

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Which part of this image is the key point for the machine to make judgments?

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
In Confluential Layers,

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
for example, the first layer has 6 channels.

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Each channel uses different metrics.

245
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Basically, it's a different filter concept.

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You will get 6 different images here.

247
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
After passing the filter, you will get 6 different images.

248
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Layer by layer,

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the machine will gradually learn

250
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
which part of the image is the most important part for you to make judgments.

251
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The machine will gradually learn this.

252
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's look at the dog's side.

253
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Here is a concept.

254
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is a heat map to show which part is really worth paying attention to.

255
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The machine will ask,

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
where is that part of attention?

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If you want to identify which part is worth paying attention to,

258
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the machine will find out which part is worth paying attention to.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The red part is where I need to pay attention to.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Next, they will input these extracted features

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
to fully connect layers.

262
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
After this,

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
they will connect all the features together

264
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and use the softmax function

265
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to give a probability concept.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
For example,

267
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
if it's a dog or a cat,

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
based on this probability,

269
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the machine can give a category.

270
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is what the Confluential Neural Network is doing.

271
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Now, let's look at the example of a dog and a fried chicken.

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In my example,

273
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I input galaxy images.

274
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
My image is from dark energy survey.

275
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Based on this image,

276
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I use Galaxy Zoo's visual classification to train my machine.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Basically, I tell my machine,

278
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
this galaxy is elliptical,

279
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and this galaxy is spiral.

280
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
After the machine learns the concept,

281
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
it will ask the machine,

282
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is this new galaxy elliptical or spiral?

283
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
In this part of the study,

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
we get some interesting results.

285
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
In the first part,

286
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
we found that some galaxies,

287
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
CNN is very sure that it is a spiral galaxy.

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
However,

289
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
when we look at Galaxy Zoo's classification,

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
we found that they think it is elliptical.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Later, we found that

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
because the depth data has a better resolution

293
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and a deeper depth,

294
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
it can observe a deeper scene.

295
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Therefore,

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the data used in Galaxy Zoo is better.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You can see that

298
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
in the two images I show,

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
they are all the same depth.

300
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
However,

301
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
the depth data on the left

302
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
clearly shows a spiral arm structure.

303
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
However,

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the SDSS data on the right is not visible.

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Galaxy Zoo is based on SDSS data to do visual classification.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Therefore,

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we found that

308
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
using our machine learning and depth data,

309
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
the most reliable visual classification catalog

310
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
needs to be updated.

311
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We found that

312
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
about 2.5% of the galaxies are mislabeled

313
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
and need to be updated.

314
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
After the correction,

315
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
we found that

316
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
using binary classification,

317
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
we can achieve about 99% accuracy.

318
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's quite impressive.

319
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In some cases,

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
it is almost more accurate than the human eye,

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
especially in darker conditions

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
or higher redshift conditions.

323
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This is the heavy ending.

324
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It sounds like

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Galaxy classification using supervised machine learning

326
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
seems to be very reliable.

327
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You can achieve 99% accuracy.

328
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There's nothing to worry about.

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But not quite yet.

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can probably imagine

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that Hubble Sequence is the most commonly used

332
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
binary classification system.

333
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hubble Sequence is the most commonly used binary classification system.

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's based on the human eye.

335
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't know how much confidence you have in humans,

336
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
but I don't have much confidence.

337
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think the human eye is very biased.

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
A lot of research shows that

339
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
even if two very professional astronomers

340
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
are doing the classification,

341
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
their results may not necessarily match.

342
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Especially if the image resolution or image quality has changed,

343
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the two people may have different opinions.

344
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So let's take a look at Hubble Sequence again.

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
When we did supervised,

346
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
it was actually very simple.

347
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We did the elliptical star system and the spiral star system.

348
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But in fact, it's very detailed.

349
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And you don't know why it can be so detailed.

350
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I've been doing galaxy morphology for a long time,

351
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
but I still don't really understand

352
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
why they can be so detailed.

353
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
For example, like the spiral galaxies,

354
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
it can be divided into at least three different evolution stages.

355
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
A, B, and C.

356
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
They are different evolution states.

357
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The elliptical star system is a little bit more understandable.

358
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's based on different ellipticity

359
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and there are seven different stages.

360
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Then there's another one that's more incomprehensible,

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
which is the lenticular galaxies.

362
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Lenticular galaxies are a very awkward existence

363
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
between the elliptical star system and the spiral star system.

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And it doesn't have spiral arms.

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's basically obvious that it doesn't have spiral arms.

366
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But sometimes it might be because of the resolution.

367
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But it's more like a spiral galaxy in terms of structure.

368
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So we think that

369
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
the current theory is that it's in the middle.

370
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Maybe it's a transition period.

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We also have another one called spiral bar galaxies.

372
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's in the middle.

373
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There's a bar in the center of the star system.

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
This is called a bar galaxy.

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And of course, there's the rest.

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We really can't classify it.

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's called irregular galaxies.

378
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It looks weird.

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Then let's talk about the classification.

380
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I don't know if you can...

381
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I don't think you can leave a comment,

382
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
so you can turn on the microphone and say it.

383
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Let's test it.

384
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Can you tell which one is a spiral galaxy?

385
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Actually, you can turn on the microphone and say it.

386
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But you can also leave a comment.

387
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If you want to vote to count it,

388
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
you can type it right next to it.

389
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't think you can see the comments.

390
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can...

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because you're sharing the screen now.

392
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But I can help you see it.

393
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Someone said 3.

394
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll type 4.

395
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Someone said 4.

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Now 1 also has one vote.

397
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
3. 3 also has one vote.

398
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So 3 has two votes now.

399
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
4 has two votes now.

400
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
1 has one vote now.

401
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
2 is very popular.

402
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
There's no 2.

403
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There's 1 and 3.

404
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, that's about it.

405
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Okay.

406
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The answer to this question is 3.

407
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
3 is an early spiral galaxy.

408
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's a relatively early one.

409
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
You just saw the SA part.

410
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
This question is relatively simple.

411
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Let's move on to the next question.

412
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Which one is an elliptical galaxy?

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Okay.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
YT, do you want to answer the previous question or this one?

415
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I think it's an elliptical galaxy.

416
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh, okay.

417
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So from Ethan...

418
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Sorry, it's not Ethan.

419
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
What is it?

420
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Alpha.

421
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay, start.

422
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's 4.

423
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Then I'm going to answer...

424
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't know. 2?

425
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I don't know.

426
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay.

427
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
4 and 2.

428
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
It's probably 2.

429
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
2 has one vote.

430
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Okay.

431
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I have the same answer as YT.

432
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm very confident now.

433
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And Wicca also answered 2.

434
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
YT is an expert.

435
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay.

436
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay.

437
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay.

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Then we're going to announce the answer.

439
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
None of them is an elliptical galaxy.

440
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Oh.

441
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yes.

442
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Everyone can...

443
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
In fact, everyone can give a concept.

444
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Here, 1 and 2 and 4.

445
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You think it feels like an elliptical galaxy.

446
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They are actually all elliptical galaxies.

447
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So you can probably feel that

448
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
human judgment is actually a very, very inaccurate way.

449
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Give everyone a feeling.

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay.

451
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So this is my other research.

452
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm also doing this part more often.

453
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm more interested in this part.

454
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Excuse me, can I ask a question?

455
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yes.

456
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
In those questions just now,

457
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
maybe I missed something just now.

458
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
How do you know what the correct answer is?

459
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
My correct answer is...

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
This is a good question.

461
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is a good question.

462
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So our correct answer is actually based on another astronomer.

463
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Just the other two astronomers.

464
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
At present, it is what we think is the most accurate judgment.

465
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Go up and give the correct answer.

466
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But in fact, they may be wrong.

467
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So...

468
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yes.

469
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
According to you, there may be...

470
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
This is actually...

471
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Maybe 2 is really an elliptical galaxy.

472
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We are not sure.

473
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But according to his answer,

474
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
We think he is the correct answer.

475
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
OK, I see.

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you.

477
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yes.

478
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
1 and 2 are both a little bit tricky.

479
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I would say it's a little bit tricky.

480
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
2, I might be more inclined to say it's an elliptical galaxy.

481
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But...

482
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's just that it's really tricky to judge.

483
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Then I actually mainly want to express a concept that is...

484
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The decision boundary of this judgment is actually not that accurate.

485
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And this is why I want to go...

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Uh...

487
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Uh...

488
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Start my second part of the research.

489
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
What about this part of the research?

490
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I...

491
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
In fact, I just want to answer this question.

492
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That is, if...

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If a machine can comprehensively see all galaxies,

494
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
How would he categorize them?

495
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The basic idea is that I hope to use machine classification to replace the classification of human eyes.

496
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because now our galaxy morphology is basically based on this Hubble sequence.

497
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This Hubble sequence has been used for more than 100 years.

498
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not more than 100 years.

499
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's almost 100 years.

500
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So...

501
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It is a good time for them to change.

502
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
To revolutionize an idea.

503
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So...

504
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
There are two parts of this problem that you have to deal with.

505
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
One is how to make the machine comprehensively see.

506
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The second part is how to do the categorization.

507
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What about the first part?

508
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I...

509
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Uh...

510
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I thought of...

511
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Uh...

512
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Of course there are many different approaches.

513
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Because in fact, apart from me,

514
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There is another team doing it.

515
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So...

516
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Before I wrote this paper,

517
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
In fact, there are two other papers.

518
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Of course, the methods we use are different.

519
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
What I choose to use here is Autoencoder.

520
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm not sure if you're familiar with Autoencoder.

521
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Autoencoder itself is a self-supervised machine learning algorithm.

522
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So...

523
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Self-supervised means that its input and output are actually the same data.

524
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
When you're in the training machine,

525
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Your input and output are exactly the same thing.

526
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The idea is to say...

527
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Uh...

528
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
When you, for example, like this image today.

529
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You input an image.

530
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That goes through the convolutional layers.

531
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You try to extract some features.

532
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And then you can represent this input image.

533
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then you use these extracted latent features.

534
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And then you want to rebuild your image.

535
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Become your output.

536
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Ideally, your output and your input should be better and better.

537
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
If it's well rebuilt,

538
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
That means your latent features have caught the point.

539
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That's one of the reasons I use Autoencoder.

540
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And then use it to do feature extraction.

541
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Find some better features.

542
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Next, unsupervised machine learning.

543
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It's a representation of this picture.

544
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's simple.

545
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We don't tell the machine what these images are.

546
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
We don't tell it what a dog is.

547
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We don't tell it what a fried chicken is.

548
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We just give it this picture.

549
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And then you say, hey, you sort it out.

550
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Sort it out.

551
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So, uh, it's very obvious that you can see a little bit.

552
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Uh, because we didn't give him any prior knowledge.

553
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So, in fact, unsupervised machine learning often encounters a situation.

554
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Uh, machine sorting.

555
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We human scientists want to do is completely different.

556
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's just that it doesn't match at all.

557
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, how do you make it comprehensive?

558
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The idea of ​​comprehension is that the concept of human beings can be more integrated.

559
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
It's more related to the science we want to do.

560
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's going to be a big problem.

561
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

562
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Can I ask a more naive question?

563
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That is to say, when you are in these pictures,

564
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You are.

565
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Will he do it, for example, like CNB?

566
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Make it a fully transformed map to a post.

567
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
On the bed.

568
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And then do it again.

569
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Or just do it directly.

570
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Directly to him.

571
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Uh, for example, the mass distribution of Gauss.

572
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And then do the analysis directly.

573
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Do it directly and apply it to the machine learning model.

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Inside.

575
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Uh, we're just using images directly.

576
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
We don't even do the mass distribution part.

577
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
If it's an image.

578
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because we're doing Gauss morphology.

579
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So, in fact, our focus is only on that.

580
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's like doing an analysis when you look at it with the naked eye.

581
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
We just look at the image itself.

582
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So, I hope that the machine will capture the image.

583
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's it.

584
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Oh, then I want to ask another question.

585
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Because he might be because of your image.

586
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
For example, you might have some white noise or red noise or something.

587
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So why not?

588
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
For example, like CNB, they also have very strong white noise.

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So why don't you know?

590
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Maybe someone did that.

591
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The question is, would you do one?

592
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
For example, do a mapping.

593
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Map it to another one.

594
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
A different one.

595
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Uh, for example.

596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Maybe it would be better to do an analysis.

597
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Because.

598
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Because it's like a picture of a dog or a picture of a fried chicken.

599
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Their white noise is also very strong.

600
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
For example, the fried chicken powder on the fried chicken.

601
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's a white noise.

602
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It will affect your analysis.

603
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So if you just do an analysis of this image, it will be more difficult.

604
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And then it's not just doing this.

605
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
For example, it would be better.

606
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Would anyone do that?

607
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Uh, I haven't heard of it.

608
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But, uh, you mentioned a pretty important point.

609
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We actually have preprocessing.

610
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Just get rid of the noise first.

611
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Uh-huh.

612
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, so getting rid of the noise is actually a pretty important step.

613
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So all of our images have been preprocessed first.

614
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And of course, sometimes.

615
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Uh, for example, I just mentioned the supervised part.

616
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I even use gradient image.

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's not just a pure linear image.

618
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There's a lot of preprocessing processes that need to be done first.

619
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Got it.

620
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Thank you.

621
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah.

622
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay, so, uh.

623
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Uh, this left picture is my main pipeline.

624
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Uh, using the pipeline.

625
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What about the feature learning process?

626
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm actually using a special autoencoder.

627
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And then it's called VectorQuantizedBiorectionalAutoencoder.

628
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And it's Google Demind.

629
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's an algorithm that was made a few years ago.

630
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So the idea is, why use this?

631
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
In fact, it has a big advantage.

632
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Uh, vector quantization.

633
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It can speed up the entire feature learning process.

634
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Because if there's no vector quantization.

635
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Uh, this process.

636
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Uh, my previous research was that I used a general autoencoder.

637
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Convolutional autoencoder.

638
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So it's in, uh, feature learning.

639
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's about 100,000 images.

640
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And in the case of using GPU.

641
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It takes about four to five days.

642
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But, uh.

643
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The use is VectorQuantizedBiorectionalAutoencoder.

644
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It basically only takes a few hours.

645
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So you can find this.

646
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's a very big leap.

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So, uh, that's why I'm using this part of the reason.

648
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So, uh, the process of speeding up this feature learning.

649
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
For the future, if I want to go further.

650
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Uh, extend this research to make it.

651
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Adapt to survey data.

652
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It would also be more helpful.

653
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Because the survey data itself is already very, very huge.

654
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So if it's 100,000, it's going to take four to five days.

655
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Then I might not be able to finish it.

656
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And then, uh, after feature learning.

657
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So now it's every image.

658
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You can, uh.

659
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Every image is represented by a set of.

660
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Extracted features.

661
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That's what you just said.

662
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Lantern features.

663
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So we're going to use this lantern feature.

664
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
To do unsupervised machine learning.

665
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So we're going to, uh, we're going to use hierarchical clustering for this part.

666
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So the concept of hierarchical clustering is actually quite simple.

667
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's every image.

668
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Uh, at the beginning, every image is a group.

669
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So we're just going to merge it little by little.

670
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Uh, according to the similarity of your, uh, lantern feature.

671
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The similarity of the row combination.

672
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
To gradually merge them.

673
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So the advantage of using this algorithm is, uh.

674
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
A lot of, uh, machine learning clustering algorithm.

675
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
He actually needs you to guess.

676
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Is to give a data distribution first.

677
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
For example, Gaussian distribution.

678
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, you might need to guess in advance.

679
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Or know in advance what some of this data is like.

680
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
How is it distributed in the feature space?

681
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But hierarchical clustering doesn't have to do that.

682
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So relatively speaking, there is no bias.

683
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And then in this study, we are.

684
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh, my God, I'm running out of time.

685
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
In this study, there are three very important strategies that we have proposed.

686
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So this part is to make our eyes, uh, to make my, uh, classification skin.

687
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's more.

688
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Uh, it's more sensible.

689
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So the first part is, uh.

690
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
When we're doing feature learning.

691
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
After that, we thought about a quick clustering result.

692
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
What about this quick clustering?

693
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We're going to divide it into two groups.

694
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What about the idea?

695
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Why do you do that?

696
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The idea is to say, uh, we want us to extract it.

697
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Features.

698
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
He can not only rebuild your input image.

699
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
At the same time, you want to capture some features.

700
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It can be well divided into two groups on the feature space.

701
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Groups like this, two groups.

702
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So, uh.

703
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
What about this approach?

704
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's quite effective, which is to stabilize our whole algorithm.

705
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
To divide the initial two groups.

706
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The idea is like this.

707
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This is a simple result.

708
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Uh, after this.

709
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Uh.

710
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
After this design.

711
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Uh, we're always in.

712
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
If we force our class to be divided into two groups.

713
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
What about the time?

714
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We always get one.

715
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's the last feature group and the feature group.

716
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Uh, this part is relatively easy to understand.

717
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Because you know, they're on the back of the virus.

718
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's just.

719
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
How, how different you are.

720
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So there should be less feature group and feature group.

721
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
But, uh.

722
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
After we've designed this, we've added an extra classroom.

723
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What about the process of feature learning?

724
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Our last feature group and feature group.

725
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
They, uh.

726
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Visual class.

727
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Uh.

728
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Visual morphology.

729
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Percentage is different.

730
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Uh.

731
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That's not easy to say.

732
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Um.

733
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's just a different type of human eye.

734
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The ratio in these less feature groups or feature groups.

735
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Is stable.

736
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And that's a pretty important thing.

737
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Because if you don't add this classroom process.

738
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Then he.

739
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He might still be like this.

740
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But there's a difference in proportion.

741
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Then you'll find that, oh, this whole machine, it's actually.

742
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You know, it's kind of like that.

743
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But he's actually not very stable.

744
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, uh.

745
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Involve this strategy becomes very important.

746
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What about the second point?

747
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Uh.

748
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You can find the code on the line.

749
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's basically allowed a single cut.

750
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Single cut means that I'm on this picture.

751
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's a bad one.

752
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Horizontal straight line.

753
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Uh.

754
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
This straight line is the class.

755
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's just.

756
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's just telling you, oh, this is my top.

757
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So, uh.

758
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You figure out how many clusters are how many clusters.

759
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But there's a big problem with that.

760
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Especially on the gas.

761
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It's a big problem.

762
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Uh.

763
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That is to say, um.

764
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
If you're in.

765
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
For example.

766
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Galaxies.

767
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You can imagine that.

768
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's just that they're actually extracted.

769
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's not going to be much different.

770
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's easy to imagine because it's actually the same thing.

771
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It looks like it's on the ground.

772
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
In fact, it doesn't look much different.

773
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Of course, it's not going to go anywhere.

774
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But it's not the same.

775
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's just that his appearance can change a lot.

776
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
For example, your spiral is in a different position.

777
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Ah, or your spiral is closer to you.

778
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Or is it far from you?

779
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The whole thing is going to be a lot worse.

780
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But they're all called Spiral Galaxy.

781
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So, if you're only allowed to be single, you're going to have a situation.

782
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's you.

783
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Your less feature group has too many unnecessary.

784
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Uh, clusters.

785
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But your.

786
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Feature group may not be enough.

787
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's your.

788
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Uh.

789
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Group may not be enough.

790
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So.

791
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So, uh, at this point, we're going to, uh, in this study, we're going to allow it to have different.

792
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Uh, on each line, in different branches, in this merger tree, we allow different distances.

793
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So.

794
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
The next obvious question is where to cut.

795
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So, where are we going to make that line?

796
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So, here, I'm going to jump out and talk about a very important question.

797
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's when you're doing unsupervised machine learning.

798
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And when you're doing gap, uh, when you're doing this research, a very basic question, a fundamental question is how many classes.

799
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We should have.

800
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And this is actually a question of how many classes you're going to have.

801
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And this question is actually a tricky question in every unsupervised machine learning.

802
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Uh, ideally, of course, you can have as many as you want.

803
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But there's always going to be a point where you're going to find that, uh, it doesn't make any sense at all.

804
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If you divide too much.

805
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And I just mentioned that, uh, before I did, there were actually two other.

806
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Paper is related to this.

807
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So, they're in the galaxy morphology classification that they came up with.

808
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's about, uh, let's talk about it.

809
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Harbour is probably divided.

810
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You're strictly, uh.

811
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Strictly speaking, you can say that it's divided into eight categories.

812
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What about the paper before that?

813
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
They divided it into about 160 classifications.

814
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So, you know, it's, uh, 160.

815
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's not that you can't, but you're analyzing it.

816
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
On the scientific research, you'll find that, uh, it doesn't seem to be able to find some.

817
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Uh, similarity or do some, uh, conclude something.

818
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So, how many classes have become very important?

819
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Uh, what kind of numbers are correct?

820
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What about here?

821
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's us.

822
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Uh, we chose to use a very different way from the previous research.

823
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So, our way is that we want to use, uh, the variation of gas orientation.

824
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So, what does that mean?

825
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Basically, you're going to find that some galaxies, especially spiral galaxies.

826
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They actually look pretty much the same.

827
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But they just seem to be turning an angle.

828
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So, this kind of galaxy is what you're going to do if you're using auto-encoder.

829
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
They're just turning an angle.

830
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But because, uh, auto-encoder is going to keep them, uh, it's going to be completely different.

831
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So, auto-encoder.

832
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Uh, after auto-encoder, when you're using classroom, they're going to be divided into different groups.

833
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So, that's not the result we want.

834
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Because if they look pretty much the same, of course, we want them to be in the same group.

835
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So, the idea is that, uh, there's always going to be a point on your merger tree.

836
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Because they're all based on, uh, similarity.

837
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So, at some point, you'll find that there's a cluster.

838
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The reason it's because of this gas orientation.

839
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So, if we can find out where this happened.

840
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
To calculate what is distance of this gas orientation.

841
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So, we can use this to do a distance cut.

842
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So, this way, we can solve our first problem.

843
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Where to cut?

844
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So, this gas orientation can provide the place where to cut in each different branch.

845
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And then, it can also solve a very important problem.

846
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How many branches do we want?

847
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So, it can provide a number of classification that doesn't behave gas orientation.

848
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So, the final result is to give us 27 clusters.

849
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So, this number is definitely much more reasonable than 160.

850
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's a little biased, in my opinion.

851
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But I think most astronomers will agree with me.

852
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So, 27 should be more reasonable than 160 in gas morphology.

853
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So, I'm not going to talk too much about the details.

854
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But we have found that they are basically based on the gas structure and gas shape.

855
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And then there's this kind of classification.

856
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So, this picture is a little bit more difficult to explain.

857
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But the general concept is that we each.

858
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So, a bar here is a group.

859
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So, you can see that there are two groups here.

860
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And then there are three groups here.

861
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
This is a machine-classified group.

862
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So, the general concept here is to say.

863
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
A galaxy with a similar structure.

864
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, they are structurally very similar structures.

865
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Because they are divided into the same group.

866
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It means that they are structurally very similar.

867
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They can be visually classified as multiple different morphology.

868
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
For example, here is the galaxy in this group.

869
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It can be judged by your eyes.

870
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
They will be classified into either elliptical galaxies or lenticular galaxies.

871
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
So, what about the different blue parts here?

872
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
There are different fractions of bar galaxies.

873
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The darker it is, it means that there are more bar galaxies in it.

874
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So, we're going to show you an example today.

875
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So, for example, in this group, there are no significant bar galaxies, bar features.

876
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And then this is a relatively weak bar feature.

877
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And then there's a group that has a relatively strong bar feature.

878
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And then there's another point.

879
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You'll find that it's pretty important.

880
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You'll find that it's visual classification.

881
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Like I just mentioned, galaxies with similar structures can be visually classified as multiple different galaxy morphology.

882
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Especially, for example, lenticular galaxies.

883
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We just mentioned that lenticular galaxies are a very awkward existence.

884
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's between elliptical galaxies and elliptical galaxies.

885
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So, we're going to do some analysis of lenticular galaxies in a group.

886
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We're going to use the search index.

887
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Basically, the smaller the number, the more likely it is to be this galaxy.

888
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And then we mean it's more likely to be a spiral galaxy.

889
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The larger the number, the more likely it is to be a bulge galaxy.

890
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And then there's the elliptical galaxy.

891
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We found that the blue one is group 27.

892
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's a mix of lenticular galaxies and early spirals.

893
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
The red one is a mix of elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies.

894
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Only the yellow one is really full of lenticular galaxies.

895
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So, you can see that in terms of structure, only very moderate structures can be called lenticular galaxies.

896
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Most of the time, the judgment of the naked eye is that lenticular galaxies are actually all mixed up with early spirals and elliptical galaxies.

897
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's not that easy to tell the structure apart.

898
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So, in the end, we're going to take the 27 clusters that we've divided up and we're going to do some physical comparison.

899
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So, you can see that we have color, absolute magnitude, standard mass, and size, physical size.

900
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So, you can see that there's a slight difference between each of our clusters.

901
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It's a slight difference, but it's obvious.

902
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's an obvious change.

903
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's a gradual change.

904
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So, here are two plots.

905
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Basically, these two plots are the plots that we use a lot in our information analysis.

906
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's a color magnitude diagram and a mass size diagram.

907
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The star part is visual classification.

908
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We're going to do a comparison over there.

909
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You can see that our 27 clusters are actually well distributed between different visual morphology.

910
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It means that if you use this machine classification method, you might be able to find some missing morphology.

911
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It actually needs to be identified.

912
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But in visual classification, it's not that obvious.

913
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's just that the eyes can't be so sensitive to find out that there's actually a difference like this.

914
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So, basically, this is the end of my talk.

915
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We still have some continued follow-up plans for this part of the research.

916
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:24,000
My main goal is to use machine learning to build an unbiased and reproducible machine classification scheme.

917
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It can be used by different people and different surfaces.

918
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It can even be applied to different redshifts.

919
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
This is a pretty ambitious project.

920
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
But I think this is a way to revolutionize what we know in current gas morphology.

921
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Because we're now relying too much on visual classification.

922
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I think the main thing I want to share with you today is that machine learning is a growing area.

923
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And in the astronomy world, we're mostly still focused on accuracy and efficiency.

924
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But in fact, machine learning has more potential to be explored.

925
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:20,000
For example, here, we use machine learning to think of ways to change our concepts of astronomy.

926
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I hope it can change some of the concepts we have about astronomy.

927
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That's about it. Thank you.

928
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Please turn on the microphone.

929
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Let's give a warm round of applause to Tim for his wonderful presentation.

930
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Let's start the Q&A.

931
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
But before we start, I'd like to ask a few questions for those of you who are in the chat.

932
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

933
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
The first question is, which of the algorithms is better?

934
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I think this question is a little too general.

935
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So if you want to clarify, you can just open the microphone and say it.

936
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
If not, we'll just ask Tim to answer.

937
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Like I said, this is a little too general.

938
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I think it depends on your science topic.

939
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But in terms of the last part of my presentation,

940
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
in terms of my classification scheme,

941
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I think the algorithms I'm using are the best combination of all the algorithms I've used so far.

942
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Because I think auto-encoder is probably the best explanation for this question.

943
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Some people used self-organized maps in their previous research.

944
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's also a way to unsupervised machine learning.

945
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But I don't think it's as effective as auto-encoder.

946
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
A lot of people want to de-rotate the galaxy orientation first.

947
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
De-rotate the galaxy so that it's all facing the same direction.

948
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That's another algorithm.

949
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's also a form of auto-encoder, but it's a concept of de-rotation.

950
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So there are actually a lot of different algorithms that can be used.

951
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I think the simplest is the best.

952
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
At the moment, I think this pipeline is the best combination I can think of.

953
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't use it.

954
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I hope that answers your question.

955
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
We can chat later if there are any further comments.

956
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
We have another question.

957
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
The next question is from Altha and Herman.

958
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,000
They want to know if you can briefly introduce your other project, Lyman-Alpha-Forest-IgM.

959
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Sure.

960
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I still use supervised machine learning.

961
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I use a convolutional network.

962
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I have some Quasar spectra.

963
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I try to identify Lyman-Alpha-Forest using a convolutional network.

964
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I also predict some physical properties like current density, Doppler width, and the rate shift of these systems.

965
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I'm currently writing a paper.

966
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
This machine has already been developed.

967
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We use this machine.

968
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's a chain with mock spectra.

969
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But it can also predict values for observation spectra.

970
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So we're going to provide this machine with the highest data.

971
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It's a very high resolution from Keck Observatory.

972
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So we're going to use this part and build a catalog.

973
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So this is another catalog paper we're writing right now.

974
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Based on this catalog...

975
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Because we have a lot of...

976
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
In Lyman-Alpha-Forest, there was a 2012 catalog.

977
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So you know, it's a long time ago.

978
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
The author spent three years to analyze 15 spectra.

979
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Now our CNN can reach the same accuracy as him.

980
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But we only need five minutes to analyze a Quasar spectra.

981
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So now we have a lot of data.

982
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Because the highest data actually has hundreds of spectra.

983
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But he could only analyze 15 at the time.

984
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So based on this catalog, we're going to do some IGN or IGN transitional to CGM research.

985
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay, I hope that's the answer.

986
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
If you want to ask further, you can continue to ask.

987
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Then I personally have a question.

988
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
My question is this.

989
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
In addition to using your algorithm to directly put it on the real data.

990
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Have you ever tried to put this on?

991
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You know his underlying physics assumption simulation.

992
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And then see what happens.

993
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
For example, the mass of dark matter is very heavy galaxy.

994
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Will it all fall into one of your classification?

995
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Or will dark metal fall into one of them?

996
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That is, so you can understand that these classes.

997
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Uh, what is the underlying physics?

998
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Have you ever thought about doing that?

999
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Uh, uh, actually, this is one of the projects I'm doing right now.

1000
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
The direction is a little different.

1001
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Because that's what you're talking about.

1002
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's the next step I want to do.

1003
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
What we're doing right now is we're using simulations.

1004
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And then we apply this classification scheme.

1005
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And then we look at the different classifications.

1006
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Uh, different classifications.

1007
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Then he, we respect his history.

1008
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
To see, to see if he has a single history.

1009
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Basically, we want to know that our classification scheme is not.

1010
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Visual classification is more physically meaningful.

1011
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
That's what I'm doing right now with the simulation.

1012
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Because this part is more important.

1013
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
We have to make sure that our classification can be.

1014
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Uh.

1015
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
The next step is what you just mentioned.

1016
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We would like to be able to, if this part of us is confirmed.

1017
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
After this part is strengthened, the next step we will want to know.

1018
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
What kind of physics will influence us to form this kind of gas morphology?

1019
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Whether it's from the simulation or from the observation.

1020
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
This part is going to be very interesting.

1021
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Because if we look at it from the simulation, we can see it directly.

1022
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Uh, you can see that, uh, you can understand it directly.

1023
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Study that today's gas morphology is.

1024
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
According to what kind of physics process to form.

1025
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So, from the observation, you can build something like a family tree.

1026
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Of a galaxy.

1027
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
This idea, or you can add you.

1028
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We have a lot of different terms, which is used to define gas.

1029
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
For example, like slow rotator, or.

1030
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Uh.

1031
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Red, red, red nuggets, blue nuggets, etc.

1032
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
They may actually just be because of their.

1033
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Formation history is different.

1034
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Then we hope that the machine gives a more detailed.

1035
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Classification can help to explain such a question.

1036
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Thank you.

1037
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Okay, so do you have any questions?

1038
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Uh, okay.

1039
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Can I ask a question?

1040
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Um, so I actually have two questions.

1041
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And then the first question is.

1042
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You just said that orientation.

1043
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That is, there is.

1044
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:14,000
What algorithm you can look at a galaxy map and then you can know what its orientation should be.

1045
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So you can.

1046
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Just put it back in the direction you want.

1047
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And then the other question is.

1048
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Uh, you, you use the data, we use it, is the data of the multi-colour.

1049
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Go down and turn together.

1050
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Because it's just the same as the galaxy.

1051
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It should be a very strong correlation.

1052
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It feels like there's more information to use.

1053
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Uh, the first part of the question.

1054
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It's actually just the rotation.

1055
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's a very, very difficult problem.

1056
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Simply put, you can think about it.

1057
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
That's where your reference point is.

1058
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So how do you know that you're going to measure first?

1059
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Uh, where to see the orientation direction is a question mark.

1060
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And then there's your reference point.

1061
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Where is it?

1062
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So, of course, there are people in this part.

1063
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
You can do it because you can actually define where it is.

1064
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You can actually define where it is.

1065
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Where is it?

1066
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Then you might use it.

1067
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's to define where the direction of the rotation is.

1068
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You can probably do that, but.

1069
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Overall, it's just that he's still a little tricky.

1070
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So this part has always been in our.

1071
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Because there were two different studies before.

1072
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So this part is.

1073
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
A lot of people want to deal with this.

1074
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But we're doing this research today.

1075
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
We're doing this part of the research.

1076
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Think about it in a different direction.

1077
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
He might not be a problem.

1078
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
He might be able to help us make more effective decisions.

1079
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
In the end, how many classes do we need to produce?

1080
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
So far, he's not an ideal.

1081
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Ideal solution.

1082
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But, um.

1083
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's him.

1084
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Anyway, the concept of this paper is.

1085
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
A different way to solve the problem.

1086
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
You don't have to think of it as a.

1087
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You have to solve it.

1088
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You have to have a low rotation.

1089
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You can think of it as a.

1090
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Just let you decide.

1091
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Oh, how many classes are we?

1092
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
We are the most reasonable.

1093
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Is that a solution to your question?

1094
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah, I get it.

1095
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Thank you.

1096
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
The second part.

1097
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The second part of the question is.

1098
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The second part is.

1099
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Do you use it?

1100
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh.

1101
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, that's part of it.

1102
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
What I'm doing right now.

1103
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Because when I was doing this project.

1104
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I'm a Ph.D. student.

1105
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I basically don't have that much.

1106
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Uh, memory or space.

1107
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
You can put so much data.

1108
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So I only used it at that time.

1109
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Okay, go ahead.

1110
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yeah.

1111
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
This is a problem that is not enough.

1112
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But it is in this part.

1113
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Uh.

1114
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Multi-color is a very important point.

1115
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But multi-color processing.

1116
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
He has another question.

1117
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We have encountered it so far.

1118
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Just be very careful.

1119
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
One thing is.

1120
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Indeed.

1121
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Galaxy morphology is related to color.

1122
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But he is not.

1123
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Uh.

1124
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Not completely.

1125
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You know.

1126
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
How to say.

1127
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
To say that.

1128
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We know.

1129
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Most of.

1130
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
They are passive.

1131
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
They are red.

1132
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
But.

1133
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
There will be an exception.

1134
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
The so-called exception is.

1135
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
We have red.

1136
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Uh.

1137
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
If you go.

1138
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
That's what we're thinking about today.

1139
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
To say.

1140
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Do you want to use multi-color or single color?

1141
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Because single color can actually.

1142
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Purely let you focus on the galaxy morphology.

1143
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Then you.

1144
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You can know.

1145
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
If today.

1146
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Maybe there are some things.

1147
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
He has some galaxy.

1148
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
He's actually a tree.

1149
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But he is.

1150
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
This kind of.

1151
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
You.

1152
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Just look at his galaxy morphology.

1153
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You have to be accurate.

1154
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But if you involve those colors today.

1155
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Information.

1156
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Then.

1157
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You might be.

1158
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You might be.

1159
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Plus.

1160
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's in there.

1161
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's just that you might make us feel like.

1162
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Oh.

1163
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
He has to be divided like this.

1164
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So this part.

1165
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's actually a bit tricky to deal with.

1166
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So we're still dealing with it.

1167
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
What the hell.

1168
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
The second part of the data.

1169
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Yeah.

1170
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah.

1171
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I see.

1172
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I see.

1173
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Thank you.

1174
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Do you have any questions?

1175
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, if you don't have any questions.

1176
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Let's give it up again.

1177
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Applause.

1178
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Thank you.

1179
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
We'll have another great speech.
