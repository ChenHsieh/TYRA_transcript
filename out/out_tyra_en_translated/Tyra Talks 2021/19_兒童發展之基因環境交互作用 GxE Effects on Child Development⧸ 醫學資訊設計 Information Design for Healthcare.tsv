0	15000	Hello everyone, I'm the host of today's Terra Talk, I'm Hsih-Hui-Ting.
15000	19000	I'm very happy to be here today to participate in this talk with everyone.
19000	22000	Our speaker today is Yao Naijia.
22000	25000	I personally know Naijia, and I've known her for a long time,
25000	28000	because Naijia is my college classmate.
28000	33000	Naijia's college, master's, and doctoral degrees are all in the Department of Physiotherapy at NTU.
33000	40000	Naijia was also the secretary-general of the World Physiotherapy Asia-Pacific Region.
40000	46000	She has now graduated, and is currently working as the director of the World Physiotherapy Asia-Pacific Region.
46000	51000	In today's talk, Naijia will mainly share two parts with us.
51000	54000	The first part is about her doctoral thesis,
54000	57000	Child Development Genetic Environment Interaction.
57000	60000	The second part is about medical information design.
60000	63000	The first topic, Child Development Genetic Environment Interaction,
63000	66000	focuses on early treatment intervention,
66000	69000	as well as the development of genes related to dopamine in children,
69000	72000	including cognitive development, action development, and behavioral development,
72000	75000	as well as the impact of parent-teacher pressure.
75000	78000	We will also discuss the interaction between genes and the environment.
78000	80000	We look forward to the future long-term development,
80000	85000	and we hope to design a more personalized medical plan for these children.
85000	88000	The second topic is about medical information design.
88000	91000	After Naijia graduated from her doctoral degree,
91000	93000	she went to the industry,
93000	96000	focusing on medical information design and science and technology education.
96000	99000	Through community platforms or activities,
99000	102000	she will promote medical knowledge to the general public.
102000	105000	She will also share some of her experience with us.
105000	108000	In today's talk,
108000	111000	Naijia will share common digital marketing content
111000	114000	and discuss more possible developments with our guests.
114000	117000	Naijia will share common digital marketing content
117000	120000	and discuss more possible developments with our guests.
120000	123000	Naijia, please share your PowerPoint.
123000	126000	Naijia, please share your PowerPoint.
126000	129000	Thank you.
129000	132000	Let's give Naijia a round of applause.
132000	134000	Thank you.
134000	137000	Thank you, Naijia.
137000	140000	Let me share my screen.
140000	143000	You should be able to see it now.
143000	146000	Thank you, Naijia, for your presentation.
146000	149000	Thank you, Naijia, for your presentation.
149000	152000	I think that's pretty much it.
152000	155000	My background is a physics teacher
155000	158000	who specializes in children's development.
158000	161000	I was lucky enough to be a part of a new initiative
161000	164000	in 2016.
164000	167000	I was lucky enough to be a part of a new initiative
167000	170000	in 2016.
170000	173000	I'd like to share two main points with you.
173000	176000	The first one is
176000	179000	about my PhD thesis.
179000	182000	about my PhD thesis.
182000	185000	The first one is about my PhD thesis.
185000	188000	The second one is about medical information design.
188000	191000	I know that Project HERA is a research-oriented project.
191000	194000	I know that Project HERA is a research-oriented project.
194000	197000	I'd like to share my work with you
197000	200000	and see how we can share our knowledge
200000	203000	and see how we can share our knowledge
203000	206000	in the future.
206000	209000	We are an intellectual industry.
209000	212000	We are an intellectual industry.
212000	215000	I'd like to make a formal apology.
215000	218000	I'd like to make a formal apology.
218000	221000	My family is at home.
221000	224000	I'm sorry that my audio recorded my talking.
224000	227000	I'm sorry that my audio recorded my talking.
227000	230000	Please forgive my crying.
230000	233000	I'll start my presentation
233000	236000	in the next few minutes.
236000	239000	I'll start my presentation in the next few minutes.
239000	242000	I'll start my presentation in the next few minutes.
242000	245000	I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.
245000	248000	I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.
254000	257000	I'd like to focus on gene-environmental interaction.
257000	261000	We need to understand which causes older than usual development for kids.
261000	266000	We need to understand which causes older than usual development for kids.
266000	269000	We select here oviparous and hormone-related over-time.
275000	278000	And we focus on early pregnancy.
278000	292000	In the past, differential susceptibility theory tells us that the worse the environment, the worse the performance.
292000	297000	The better the environment, the better the performance.
297000	303000	On the contrary, people who don't have this kind of environment may not be affected by the environment.
303000	309000	Another theory is that there is only a negative environment that makes me perform worse.
309000	311000	The positive environment is not bad at all.
311000	319000	Another theory is that there is only a positive environment that makes me perform better.
319000	322000	The negative environment is not bad at all.
322000	330000	In this case, we hope to see the advantageous sensitivity.
330000	337000	This means that the better the environment, the better the performance.
337000	341000	This structure is divided into several areas.
341000	343000	First, the environment.
343000	346000	We want to see if the environment affects the development of children.
346000	350000	Second, the pressure on the parents to have a child.
350000	353000	This is the part of the day after tomorrow.
353000	354000	This is the part of the day before tomorrow.
354000	355000	This is the part of the gene.
355000	359000	In the past research,
359000	365000	we have known that early birth parents will be more stressed.
365000	369000	In the past, the intervention program also told us that
369000	372000	the intervention program can reduce the pressure on the parents.
372000	375000	However, most of it is focused on the mother,
375000	378000	and there is less discussion about the father and mother at the same time.
378000	381000	In this study, we will include the father and mother at the same time,
381000	384000	and it will be a part of the long-term tracking.
384000	388000	In terms of children, the conclusion of the past study is inconsistent.
388000	391000	Some say that the effect can be delayed to 9 years old or later.
391000	396000	However, some say that the intervention period is 1 or 2 years old,
396000	398000	and the effect is almost the same.
398000	400000	In the future, there will be no effect.
400000	403000	So our study is also a large-scale study in Taiwan.
403000	406000	We want to see what effect it will have in the long-term tracking.
406000	409000	Especially in terms of cognition, action, and behavior.
409000	411000	In terms of genes,
411000	414000	we chose the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin.
414000	416000	Because the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin
416000	418000	has been proven in past studies,
418000	421000	it may be related to children's development,
421000	424000	including cognition, ADHD,
424000	427000	which is related to autism and attention deficit disorder.
427000	430000	So there are four parts of this study.
430000	432000	The first is whether our medical intervention
432000	435000	has a positive impact on the development of children.
435000	437000	The second is whether our medical intervention
437000	440000	can help parents to reduce their stress.
440000	443000	The third is whether the gene related to multiple sclerosis and hemoglobin
443000	446000	can be related to the development of children.
446000	449000	Finally, it depends on the interaction effect of the gene environment.
449000	451000	In terms of research,
451000	454000	we use low-fat premature babies.
454000	456000	This research is a bit more complicated.
456000	458000	It will include four studies.
458000	462000	So if you have any questions about our participants,
462000	464000	you can discuss with me.
465000	467000	In terms of procedures,
467000	469000	we will have a hospitalization period,
469000	471000	which is when the baby is still in the nursing room.
471000	473000	We will start to intervene.
473000	474000	After discharge,
474000	477000	there will be medical intervention in 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 months.
477000	478000	As a rule,
478000	481000	we will use a phone interview to care for the baby.
481000	484000	So this intervention will include,
484000	486000	including when the baby is in the hospital,
486000	487000	as we just mentioned,
487000	490000	there will be some suggestions on feeding,
490000	491000	massaging,
491000	494000	and some development stimuli.
494000	496000	After discharge,
496000	498000	there will be some transfer to the hospital.
498000	501000	We will also teach the baby how to adjust the home environment,
501000	503000	and how to interact with the baby in the future.
503000	505000	As we know,
505000	507000	parent-child interaction
507000	510000	has a positive impact on the development of children,
510000	512000	especially children under the age of six.
512000	514000	Because they are basically at home.
514000	517000	Of course, there is also the basic child health check-up.
517000	518000	Basically,
518000	521000	this is what every child needs to do.
521000	524000	As for the measurement,
524000	529000	we use Bayley to measure the development of cognition,
529000	532000	and CBCL to measure the behavior.
532000	534000	As for the action,
534000	537000	we use MoveMVC.
537000	541000	Bayley also includes the action part.
541000	543000	As for parenting stress,
543000	546000	we use PSI.
546000	548000	Let's talk about our four studies.
548000	551000	The first part is for the development of children.
551000	555000	Does our medical intervention have a positive impact on the development of children?
555000	557000	The conclusion is that
557000	560000	it is interesting that we use Bayley-2 and Bayley-3.
560000	565000	These two are because we have been working on the case for a long time.
565000	568000	We used Bayley-2 when there was no Bayley-3.
568000	569000	When Bayley-3 was developed,
569000	571000	we changed it to Bayley-3.
571000	573000	But what we see in Bayley-2 is
573000	577000	that it has a positive impact on the cognitive behavior of children.
577000	580000	The biggest effect was in Bayley-4.
580000	583000	However, in Bayley-3,
583000	587000	we see a significant difference.
587000	590000	It also happened in Bayley-4.
590000	591000	On the left,
591000	593000	we use a more longitudinal analysis,
593000	595000	which is also a mixed-event model.
595000	596000	On the right,
596000	599000	we combine two RCTs together.
599000	604000	We use Bayley-2 and Bayley-4 as a forest plot.
604000	607000	The result tells us that
607000	611000	there may be a difference between Bayley-2 and Bayley-4.
611000	613000	It may be a difference in the era.
613000	618000	Therefore, the normal group has improved.
618000	622000	In other words, our normal care has improved.
622000	625000	This difference will gradually disappear.
625000	626000	On the other hand,
626000	628000	why do we think that our therapeutic effect
628000	631000	seems to be obvious or lasts longer?
631000	633000	It may be that in some past studies,
633000	637000	their therapeutic process only lasted until the age of three.
637000	639000	However, our therapeutic effect only lasted until the age of one.
639000	644000	Therefore, it may extend to such a long time.
644000	647000	For example, at the age of nine or even older,
647000	652000	our frequency and length may not be enough.
652000	653000	On the other hand,
653000	657000	we may not see any therapeutic effect on behavior.
657000	659000	It may be because our content
659000	662000	is not as close to the part of behavioral modification
662000	667000	as some past programs.
667000	669000	The second part is to see
669000	673000	whether our medical research has a positive impact on parental pressure.
673000	675000	The result shows two interesting points.
675000	677000	In the case of mothers,
677000	680000	the pressure of mothers has always been greater than that of fathers.
680000	681000	In general,
681000	684000	the pressure is always greater at any point in time.
684000	685000	On the other hand,
685000	687000	our therapeutic effect mainly occurs on fathers,
687000	688000	but not on mothers.
688000	691000	This difference can only be seen for a long time.
691000	692000	That is to say,
692000	694000	when children reach the age of four,
694000	699000	the pressure of their fathers is significantly reduced.
699000	701000	We have also done some research
701000	704000	on the relationship between parental pressure and children's behavior.
704000	705000	In fact, the relationship is quite high.
705000	706000	That is to say,
706000	707000	if the behavior of children is worse,
707000	709000	the pressure of mothers is greater.
709000	710000	In addition,
710000	712000	we have also done some research on
712000	714000	home activities.
714000	715000	In our program,
715000	717000	some activities are done by parents.
717000	719000	Most of the executors are mothers.
719000	720000	In fact,
720000	722000	more than 90% of the participants are mothers.
722000	725000	This result is quite consistent with past research.
725000	726000	That is to say,
726000	728000	the pressure of mothers is basically quite high.
728000	730000	The reason for this possibility is
730000	731000	interesting.
731000	733000	In the previous large-scale research in Taiwan,
733000	734000	we also found that
734000	737000	most of the main caregivers are mothers.
737000	739000	This is consistent with our research.
739000	740000	In addition,
740000	742000	this past research also mentioned that
742000	745000	regardless of whether the mother is a full-time job
745000	746000	or a part-time job,
746000	747000	in fact,
747000	748000	most of her household chores
748000	751000	are more than that of her father.
751000	754000	As for the intervention effect,
754000	755000	we see that
755000	757000	the effect of the father's part is effectively reduced.
757000	760000	It is particularly high in the 48-month period.
760000	761000	It may be because
761000	762000	there is a demographic effect
762000	763000	that tells us
763000	765000	that it is very similar to the rolling snowball effect.
765000	766000	It may be that
766000	769000	this good effect is getting bigger and bigger later.
769000	772000	So it is particularly obvious in the 48-month period.
772000	774000	Another one is that
774000	777000	the reduction of this part
777000	778000	is actually related to
778000	780000	the better child's action development.
780000	781000	That is to say,
781000	782000	the better the child's action development,
782000	785000	the greater the degree of pressure on the father to reduce.
785000	786000	As for the mother,
786000	788000	we did not see any intervention effect.
788000	789000	It may be because
789000	791000	our intervention program
791000	793000	did not pay much attention
793000	795000	to the mother's part.
795000	796000	But in the past,
796000	798000	the part that helped the mother
798000	800000	may mainly be
800000	803000	the part where they have a lot of behavioral adjustments.
803000	805000	It tells us that
805000	806000	in the future research,
806000	808000	we may be able to focus more
808000	810000	on the part about mental health.
810000	812000	This may help more mothers.
812000	813000	Another one is that
813000	814000	the father and mother's performance
814000	815000	are actually quite different.
815000	816000	In the past research,
816000	817000	it also told us that
817000	820000	in some problem-solving strategies,
820000	822000	if the father gets more information
822000	823000	in this area,
823000	824000	it can actually reduce the pressure.
824000	826000	Mothers may need more
826000	828000	emotional support.
828000	829000	The third one is
829000	830000	to see if the gene
830000	832000	is related to the child's development.
832000	835000	We chose 15 SNPs.
835000	837000	Among these 15 SNPs,
837000	839000	there are 8 special connections.
839000	840000	That is to say,
840000	842000	there are 8 red boxes on the screen.
842000	843000	Basically,
843000	846000	it can be used as one of the representations.
846000	849000	Because the results will be about the same.
849000	851000	What we see is
851000	853000	that the MLA gene
853000	855000	is related to
855000	860000	the preterm child's mental score.
860000	862000	We also chose
862000	865000	an independent copy sample.
865000	867000	It can be used as a verification function.
867000	870000	The results are exactly the same.
870000	872000	It tells us that
872000	875000	the MLA gene is related to
875000	877000	the child's cognitive development,
877000	879000	especially in premature babies.
879000	881000	The results are the same
881000	883000	in the learning sample
883000	886000	and the replication sample.
886000	889000	The results are the same
889000	892000	in the past.
892000	893000	In the past,
893000	895000	the MLA gene was used
895000	896000	in children with
896000	897000	attention deficit hyperactivity
897000	898000	and autism.
898000	900000	The MLA gene is used
900000	903000	in premature babies.
903000	905000	The fourth one is
905000	907000	to see if the gene is related to
907000	908000	the environment.
908000	910000	It's a pity that
910000	912000	the MLA gene is not related to
912000	913000	the environment.
913000	915000	The MLA gene is used in
915000	917000	the SNP sample.
917000	919000	The MLA gene is used in
919000	920000	the VNTR sample.
920000	922000	The VNTR sample is used
922000	924000	to see if the gene is related to
924000	925000	the environment.
925000	926000	For example,
926000	928000	if the gene is related to
928000	929000	the DNA of the parent,
929000	931000	the MLA gene is used.
931000	932000	However,
932000	934000	the MLA gene is not related to
934000	937000	the environment.
937000	939000	The reason is that
939000	941000	the MLA gene is not related to
941000	942000	the environment.
942000	944000	The second reason is that
944000	946000	we don't use
946000	948000	GWAS or NGIS
948000	950000	for genetic information.
950000	952000	The MLA gene is used
952000	954000	to miss a lot of
954000	956000	genetic information.
956000	958000	The MLA gene is used
958000	960000	to miss a lot of
960000	962000	genetic information.
962000	964000	The MLA gene is used
964000	966000	to miss a lot of
966000	968000	genetic information.
968000	970000	So the conclusion is that
970000	972000	the results of the
972000	974000	hopes study show
974000	976000	better genetic
976000	978000	identifications.
978000	980000	In the parents' cases,
980000	982000	the parents' effective
982000	984000	down grade of the
984000	986000	MLA gene is seen.
986000	988000	The MLA gene is related to
988000	990000	the early-childhood development.
990000	992000	So the MLA gene
992000	994000	is related to
994000	996000	the early-childhood development.
996000	998000	If you have any questions,
998000	1000000	please feel free to ask.
1000000	1002000	The second part
1002000	1004000	I want to talk about is
1004000	1006000	the medical information design.
1006000	1008000	This part is
1008000	1010000	mainly because
1010000	1012000	I'm working on the initiative.
1012000	1014000	Why did we start
1014000	1016000	this part?
1016000	1018000	The main intention is to change.
1018000	1020000	What do we want to change?
1020000	1022000	Because we often find
1022000	1024000	a lot of information
1024000	1026000	in the hospital or clinic
1026000	1028000	for the patients.
1028000	1030000	When the patients go back,
1030000	1032000	the family may ask
1032000	1034000	what the doctor
1034000	1036000	told you.
1036000	1038000	The patient may tell
1038000	1040000	his family that
1040000	1042000	he doesn't know much about it.
1042000	1044000	So we hope
1044000	1046000	this kind of case
1046000	1048000	can be more clear
1048000	1050000	in the clinical environment
1050000	1052000	in the future.
1052000	1054000	Many people in the academic world
1054000	1056000	have done a lot of research.
1056000	1058000	But how do you explain
1058000	1060000	such a complex and detailed research
1060000	1062000	to the general public?
1062000	1064000	For example,
1064000	1066000	how do you let the public
1066000	1068000	know why you need
1068000	1070000	or don't need a sample?
1070000	1072000	This is actually a very professional question,
1072000	1074000	but the general public may not know.
1074000	1076000	They can only say
1076000	1078000	don't let me get infected.
1078000	1080000	This is why
1080000	1082000	we want to make
1082000	1084000	such a change,
1084000	1086000	including medical education,
1086000	1088000	medical students, doctors,
1088000	1090000	clinical environment,
1090000	1092000	or preventive medicine for the general public.
1094000	1096000	So we want to start
1096000	1098000	from the information design.
1098000	1100000	I don't know
1100000	1102000	if you have any special ideas
1102000	1104000	about information design,
1104000	1106000	or if you already have a certain
1106000	1108000	understanding of it.
1108000	1110000	In our team,
1110000	1112000	it is a multi-professional cooperation.
1112000	1114000	We may have academic professionals,
1114000	1116000	project managers,
1116000	1118000	designers, and engineers.
1118000	1120000	This is actually a part that needs
1120000	1122000	everyone's cooperation.
1122000	1124000	Sometimes when your team is discussing,
1124000	1126000	you will find that the interesting situation
1126000	1128000	is that the designers are not
1128000	1130000	professional backgrounds,
1130000	1132000	so when they are discussing with you,
1132000	1134000	they may have more interesting
1134000	1136000	opinions,
1136000	1138000	and you may say that
1138000	1140000	I still don't quite understand.
1140000	1142000	Can we think of a better way
1142000	1144000	together?
1144000	1146000	So our main audience
1146000	1148000	will be divided into three main types.
1148000	1150000	The main medical staff
1150000	1152000	is the more professional part.
1152000	1154000	It may be like what we usually
1154000	1156000	do in academic communication.
1156000	1158000	Like what I just said,
1158000	1160000	there will be more professional information
1160000	1162000	in the discussion.
1162000	1164000	The medical staff will definitely
1164000	1166000	know more about their own disease.
1166000	1168000	It's not like the general public,
1168000	1170000	who may just accept the knowledge,
1170000	1172000	scroll to Facebook to take a look,
1172000	1174000	or scroll to Instagram to take a look.
1174000	1176000	But the medical staff must assume,
1176000	1178000	for example, I have cancer today,
1178000	1180000	I will definitely go crazy to check
1180000	1182000	the relevant knowledge of my cancer.
1182000	1184000	So it will be a little deeper.
1184000	1186000	The general public is basically
1186000	1188000	you have to capture their eyes,
1188000	1190000	because they may not have
1190000	1192000	the knowledge to know,
1192000	1194000	or how to attract their interest.
1194000	1196000	That's another different part.
1196000	1198000	In our team,
1198000	1200000	we may do a lot,
1200000	1202000	including interactive animation design,
1202000	1204000	such as animation web games.
1204000	1206000	I will introduce it later.
1206000	1208000	Because I want to say that
1208000	1210000	we may use works to share with you,
1210000	1212000	which is more helpful for discussion.
1212000	1214000	If it's not too commercialized,
1214000	1216000	it may be more interesting
1216000	1218000	to do it this way.
1218000	1220000	For example,
1220000	1222000	we have a great video,
1222000	1224000	which was also submitted
1224000	1226000	to the conference
1226000	1228000	of the World Health Alliance.
1228000	1230000	So the information design
1230000	1232000	is not completely decoupled
1232000	1234000	from academic research.
1234000	1236000	It can also be published.
1236000	1238000	Because of my
1238000	1240000	lack of knowledge,
1240000	1242000	I may not be able to
1242000	1244000	share it with you.
1244000	1246000	So I may not be able to
1246000	1248000	share it with you.
1248000	1250000	I may not be able to
1250000	1252000	play the video,
1252000	1254000	but there is a link,
1254000	1256000	so you can watch it later.
1256000	1258000	I'll show you a simple demo.
1258000	1260000	The picture looks like this.
1260000	1262000	There may be animations,
1262000	1264000	and there may be real shots.
1264000	1266000	The real shots look like this.
1266000	1268000	I hope you can figure out
1268000	1270000	how many red cards there are in the video,
1270000	1272000	and there may be some answers
1272000	1274000	or questions at the end.
1274000	1276000	I think the effect will be much worse.
1278000	1280000	So back to our video,
1280000	1282000	our production process
1282000	1284000	is basically like this.
1284000	1286000	We may have an academic team
1286000	1288000	based on facts,
1288000	1290000	because we are basically medical professionals.
1290000	1292000	The main background of these founders
1292000	1294000	are doctors,
1294000	1296000	or like me, a therapist.
1296000	1298000	So we are all professionals.
1298000	1300000	Of course, we don't want to
1300000	1302000	pass wrong information like an underground radio station.
1302000	1304000	This is our first commitment.
1304000	1306000	The second commitment is to make it clear.
1306000	1308000	So we hope that
1308000	1310000	even your grandma can understand it.
1310000	1312000	These are our two main commitments.
1312000	1314000	Then we make this kind of related video.
1314000	1316000	In this part of the video,
1316000	1318000	our process will be
1318000	1320000	what I just said.
1320000	1322000	First, the academic team will finish
1322000	1324000	our basic search documents,
1324000	1326000	and then there will be some facts.
1326000	1328000	Then it will be transformed into
1328000	1330000	an interesting line,
1330000	1332000	and then we will talk about
1332000	1334000	how to draw the boundary,
1334000	1336000	and then collaborate with the animation designer
1336000	1338000	to produce the final result.
1340000	1342000	In this part,
1342000	1344000	I still have a lot of works left,
1344000	1346000	but I want to talk about
1346000	1348000	some terms first.
1348000	1350000	Some people may already know
1350000	1352000	these terms,
1352000	1354000	but we can still talk about them a little bit.
1354000	1356000	For example, what is social media?
1356000	1358000	Because this is very important
1358000	1360000	now.
1360000	1362000	Of course, everyone will think of
1362000	1364000	Facebook or Instagram.
1364000	1366000	But in fact, a long time ago,
1366000	1368000	in our ancient times,
1368000	1370000	there were already bad cows or PTT.
1370000	1372000	In fact,
1372000	1374000	these are also so-called social media.
1374000	1376000	There may be different styles
1376000	1378000	and different things suitable for each social media.
1378000	1380000	For example, on PTT,
1380000	1382000	it may be very suitable for reading a lot of text.
1382000	1384000	On Facebook and Instagram,
1384000	1386000	it may need some graphic support.
1386000	1388000	On Instagram,
1388000	1390000	it may be mainly based on some beautiful photos.
1390000	1392000	The definition of social media
1392000	1394000	is basically
1394000	1396000	the technology of computer media,
1396000	1398000	which is to use a computer
1398000	1400000	interaction device as a base.
1400000	1402000	As long as you can use this
1402000	1404000	to interact with the community,
1404000	1406000	it basically counts.
1406000	1408000	There are a lot of social media
1408000	1410000	like this.
1410000	1412000	I don't know how many you can recognize,
1412000	1414000	but what we are listing now
1414000	1416000	are all social media,
1416000	1418000	including Facebook, IG, LinkedIn,
1418000	1420000	and even Douyin and Dcard.
1420000	1422000	In addition,
1422000	1424000	when we do this,
1424000	1426000	we also have to consider our target audience.
1426000	1428000	In fact, I think
1428000	1430000	it's the same when I do academic research.
1430000	1432000	If I tell my community
1432000	1434000	and tell the general public,
1434000	1436000	basically what I want to do
1436000	1438000	should be a different form.
1438000	1440000	Of course,
1440000	1442000	as we just quickly talked about
1442000	1444000	, I used a lot of content
1444000	1446000	when I was in Defense.
1446000	1448000	What about the target audience like this?
1448000	1450000	We can see that
1450000	1452000	different age groups
1452000	1454000	are using instant communication software
1454000	1456000	or social network.
1456000	1458000	In fact, what everyone is familiar with is different.
1458000	1460000	For example,
1460000	1462000	Facebook currently has more
1462000	1464000	slightly older age groups,
1464000	1466000	and everyone is more familiar
1466000	1468000	with these two on Line.
1468000	1470000	But most of you are students on Dcard.
1470000	1472000	What kind of presentation do you want to use
1472000	1474000	in front of different audiences?
1474000	1476000	Another point is
1476000	1478000	the part of the legal common sense.
1478000	1480000	Because different laws are easy to violate,
1480000	1482000	so whether it's
1482000	1484000	the Intellectual Property Rights Act
1484000	1486000	or we are doing some
1486000	1488000	introduction,
1488000	1490000	will it step on the line of medical advertising
1490000	1492000	or be related to contract writing?
1492000	1494000	For example,
1494000	1496000	can we just use a picture on the Internet?
1496000	1498000	In fact, this part is also mentioned
1498000	1500000	because it is especially related to
1500000	1502000	our academic world.
1502000	1504000	It is said that in schools or educational institutions,
1504000	1506000	you can broadcast
1506000	1508000	other people's public publications
1508000	1510000	within a reasonable range of education.
1510000	1512000	In other words,
1512000	1514000	many professors
1514000	1516000	may take pictures
1516000	1518000	in this book,
1518000	1520000	but they can't draw
1520000	1522000	all these pictures
1522000	1524000	by themselves.
1524000	1526000	It must be explained to everyone
1526000	1528000	in this way.
1528000	1530000	In addition,
1530000	1532000	we have a mechanism
1532000	1534000	called Creative CC.
1534000	1536000	It will show six pictures
1536000	1538000	as shown here.
1538000	1540000	For example,
1540000	1542000	if you see a person in this picture,
1542000	1544000	it means that as long as you have a name,
1544000	1546000	you can use
1546000	1548000	my work.
1548000	1550000	For example,
1550000	1552000	a picture or some articles
1552000	1554000	in your own PowerPoint.
1554000	1556000	For example, it says NC,
1556000	1558000	non-commercial use.
1558000	1560000	It means that you can only use it
1560000	1562000	if it is not for commercial purposes.
1562000	1564000	Another one is also related to
1564000	1566000	the academic world.
1566000	1568000	Is it necessary to pass the teacher's
1568000	1570000	or the speaker's approval
1570000	1572000	to record in class?
1572000	1574000	Basically,
1574000	1576000	it is said that it is necessary
1576000	1578000	in the Department of Economics and Finance.
1578000	1580000	So if you encounter
1580000	1582000	such a problem in the academic world,
1582000	1584000	you can use it to explain.
1584000	1586000	Since we have some time left,
1586000	1588000	I would like to introduce
1588000	1590000	some of our past works.
1590000	1592000	They may be of different forms
1592000	1594000	and have different characteristics.
1594000	1596000	For example,
1596000	1598000	Professor Chen Zhenhong
1598000	1600000	from Stanford University
1600000	1602000	and Dean Lin Zhaofang
1602000	1604000	from Fudai Medical School
1604000	1606000	often have red faces
1606000	1608000	after drinking.
1608000	1610000	This is because
1610000	1612000	there is a deficiency of ALDH2.
1612000	1614000	So how can we
1614000	1616000	make people understand this?
1616000	1618000	We use animation
1618000	1620000	to quickly introduce this to everyone.
1620000	1622000	How to measure
1622000	1624000	if you have ALDH2 deficiency?
1624000	1626000	It is also introduced in the animation.
1626000	1628000	In addition,
1628000	1630000	this animation also wants to show
1630000	1632000	people in their 50s and 60s.
1632000	1634000	So it actually has a Taiwanese version.
1634000	1636000	Because
1636000	1638000	it also wants to show
1638000	1640000	people in their 50s and 60s.
1640000	1642000	So we also have an English version.
1642000	1644000	That is to say,
1644000	1646000	in different age groups,
1646000	1648000	we may first adjust the language.
1648000	1650000	In addition, we may also adjust the speed of speech.
1650000	1652000	For example, the Taiwanese version
1652000	1654000	may slow it down a little bit.
1654000	1656000	Because our research also found that
1656000	1658000	young people may speak faster.
1658000	1660000	Older people may speak slower.
1660000	1662000	In addition,
1662000	1664000	in addition to the animation
1664000	1666000	for the general public,
1666000	1668000	there is also an animation
1668000	1670000	for medical personnel education.
1670000	1672000	It is a more professional part.
1672000	1674000	Like this animation,
1674000	1676000	it actually talks about
1676000	1678000	a RCT related to breathing.
1678000	1680000	It is introduced in this RCT.
1680000	1682000	It is the kind of feeling
1682000	1684000	I just introduced my own research.
1684000	1686000	That is to say,
1686000	1688000	what is his knowledge background?
1688000	1690000	How did he do it?
1690000	1692000	What is his result?
1692000	1694000	In this way,
1694000	1696000	the animation explains
1696000	1698000	the process of giving medicine
1698000	1700000	to the medical personnel.
1700000	1702000	We also give medicine as a meal.
1702000	1704000	In this way,
1704000	1706000	everyone can understand
1706000	1708000	why we do this whole process.
1708000	1710000	What is the preparation of the front desk?
1710000	1712000	What is the last one?
1712000	1714000	There is another one
1714000	1716000	that is more related to the academic world.
1716000	1718000	Now, in some top journals,
1718000	1720000	they sometimes publish podcasts
1720000	1722000	or video abstracts.
1722000	1724000	He is a dean now.
1724000	1726000	In fact, he has made
1726000	1728000	his video abstracts
1728000	1730000	on the Goethe's journal.
1730000	1732000	You can take a video
1732000	1734000	and add the introduction
1734000	1736000	of PowerPoint next to it
1736000	1738000	to briefly introduce
1738000	1740000	what you are doing.
1740000	1742000	In fact, many new journals
1742000	1744000	like to use this way
1744000	1746000	because it can attract people's attention.
1746000	1748000	I think you may be thinking
1748000	1750000	about how to make some
1750000	1752000	videos that everyone can understand.
1752000	1754000	Otherwise, it is like the ivory tower
1754000	1756000	where everyone is locked inside.
1756000	1758000	It is a pity
1758000	1760000	because a lot of rich resources
1760000	1762000	can be shared.
1762000	1764000	In addition,
1764000	1766000	we also make websites
1766000	1768000	for ordinary people
1768000	1770000	such as the liver test room
1770000	1772000	which cooperates with the foundation.
1772000	1774000	In addition, we also make
1774000	1776000	general medical journals
1776000	1778000	in the form of comics
1778000	1780000	where we talk about
1780000	1782000	liver cancer,
1782000	1784000	which is a non-infectious disease.
1784000	1786000	However, you can't expose other people's children.
1786000	1788000	We use a more dangerous way
1788000	1790000	to introduce liver cancer.
1790000	1792000	We also publish
1792000	1794000	a series of
1794000	1796000	liver-cancer journals.
1796000	1798000	In addition,
1798000	1800000	there are different ways of presentation.
1800000	1802000	For example,
1802000	1804000	this liver-cancer journal
1804000	1806000	introduces a series of comics
1806000	1808000	about what happened
1808000	1810000	to the main character after he grew up.
1810000	1812000	The grandmother died at this time,
1812000	1814000	so she came down to the earth
1814000	1816000	and became an immortal.
1816000	1818000	In addition,
1818000	1820000	there is a part about the cervical cancer.
1820000	1822000	The advantage of this
1822000	1824000	liver-cancer journal
1824000	1826000	is that you can give different pages
1826000	1828000	to different diseases
1828000	1830000	and different groups.
1830000	1832000	In this way, you can draw at any time.
1832000	1834000	If you draw,
1834000	1836000	you can design the information
1836000	1838000	that you want to get.
1838000	1840000	Otherwise, you can't accept it.
1840000	1842000	In addition,
1842000	1844000	we also have a community platform.
1844000	1846000	On this Facebook platform,
1846000	1848000	the community platform is basically
1848000	1850000	all public.
1850000	1852000	There is no commercial part at all,
1852000	1854000	which means that we have no advertising income.
1854000	1856000	We also refuse any commercial
1856000	1858000	introduction.
1858000	1860000	In this part,
1860000	1862000	we actually draw
1862000	1864000	a little bit of our income
1864000	1866000	to make a public response every year.
1866000	1868000	For example,
1868000	1870000	this part of the Cervical Cancer Journal,
1870000	1872000	we designed it
1872000	1874000	like a game card.
1874000	1876000	We want to let everyone know
1876000	1878000	some ways to avoid cancer.
1878000	1880000	In addition,
1880000	1882000	last year,
1882000	1884000	we also designed a character named Wu Wan.
1884000	1886000	He is a little boy.
1886000	1888000	We use this Wu Gu Ji
1888000	1890000	to let everyone know
1890000	1892000	why we can't
1892000	1894000	use alcohol to disinfect
1894000	1896000	or how to wear a mask.
1896000	1898000	Why masks can prevent
1898000	1900000	us from being infected.
1900000	1902000	There is also a more complicated part
1902000	1904000	in the middle on the right.
1904000	1906000	He said why
1906000	1908000	this picture of acute lung damage
1908000	1910000	is more professional for professionals to see.
1912000	1914000	In addition,
1914000	1916000	we also cooperate with the WHO
1916000	1918000	to create a Vietnamese health community platform.
1918000	1920000	We can make knowledge
1920000	1922000	promotion in Vietnam.
1922000	1924000	In addition,
1924000	1926000	there is a micro-hearing interactive web page.
1926000	1928000	This is a cooperation between the foundation.
1928000	1930000	They want to introduce to everyone
1930000	1932000	that children may have micro-hearing.
1932000	1934000	He may not really hear,
1934000	1936000	but he may not hear clearly.
1936000	1938000	What kind of problems
1938000	1940000	may occur if you can't hear clearly?
1940000	1942000	We can take a look at this web page directly.
1942000	1944000	We made this web page.
1944000	1946000	It is a small game.
1946000	1948000	He can introduce the background knowledge
1948000	1950000	to everyone.
1950000	1952000	What is the situation of hearing loss?
1952000	1954000	What is micro-hearing loss?
1954000	1956000	This micro-hearing loss
1956000	1958000	may make children
1958000	1960000	can't hear clearly,
1960000	1962000	but he can still hear a little bit.
1962000	1964000	Because of this problem,
1964000	1966000	they may
1966000	1968000	run around
1968000	1970000	or move their ears
1970000	1972000	to one side.
1972000	1974000	It's not that he doesn't want to talk to you.
1974000	1976000	He may want to hear more clearly.
1976000	1978000	So we will
1978000	1980000	design it into different levels.
1980000	1982000	He will tell you
1982000	1984000	that I have to get closer to hear other people's words.
1984000	1986000	So in this game design,
1986000	1988000	you have to move left and right
1988000	1990000	to receive
1990000	1992000	what these people say.
1992000	1994000	The more you receive,
1994000	1996000	the higher your score will be.
1996000	1998000	He must finish
1998000	2000000	in this ten lines.
2000000	2002000	Finally, it will be divided into score levels.
2002000	2004000	In this way,
2004000	2006000	you can let everyone know that
2006000	2008000	children want to hear
2008000	2010000	what you are saying.
2010000	2012000	They don't want to ignore you
2012000	2014000	or disrespect you.
2014000	2016000	He is not like this.
2016000	2018000	You can let parents,
2018000	2020000	teachers and people around him know more.
2020000	2022000	When the time comes,
2022000	2024000	you can even share your score
2024000	2026000	on your social network.
2026000	2028000	For example, on Facebook.
2028000	2030000	Of course, there are different levels.
2030000	2032000	You can share your score
2032000	2034000	on Facebook.
2034000	2036000	Let's go back to what we just said.
2046000	2048000	Interactive games are one of them.
2048000	2050000	Of course, there are many other forms of interaction.
2050000	2052000	In this game,
2052000	2054000	we want to improve
2054000	2056000	people's interest and connection.
2056000	2058000	In medical education,
2058000	2060000	there is a more professional part.
2060000	2062000	It's called
2062000	2064000	Antibiotics Week.
2064000	2066000	It's for medical students and doctors.
2066000	2068000	The Taiwan Institute of Infectious Diseases
2068000	2070000	has designed a series of
2070000	2072000	challenges.
2072000	2074000	There is a week's challenge.
2074000	2076000	You can go up every day
2076000	2078000	to answer questions.
2078000	2080000	After answering the five-day questions,
2080000	2082000	they will have a radar map
2082000	2084000	to tell you the direction of your score
2084000	2086000	and tell you where your ability is.
2086000	2088000	In the end,
2088000	2090000	they will tell you some professional tips.
2090000	2092000	In this way,
2092000	2094000	you can learn more about
2094000	2096000	the professional part.
2096000	2098000	In the end,
2098000	2100000	there will be some activities
2100000	2102000	like a small lottery
2102000	2104000	to boost your motivation.
2104000	2106000	In addition,
2106000	2108000	there is also a information chart.
2108000	2110000	It shows
2110000	2112000	some bacteria
2112000	2114000	here,
2114000	2116000	medicine,
2116000	2118000	and related symptoms.
2118000	2120000	When you click on the mouse,
2120000	2122000	it will show you
2122000	2124000	the relevant information.
2124000	2126000	In the end,
2126000	2128000	there are some related
2128000	2130000	activities.
2130000	2132000	These activities are not the point.
2132000	2134000	The point is how to
2134000	2136000	attract people's interest
2136000	2138000	and present the knowledge in different ways.
2138000	2140000	That's all for today.
2140000	2142000	I hope
2142000	2144000	we can have more time
2144000	2146000	to interact with you.
2146000	2148000	This way,
2148000	2150000	we can learn more.
2172000	2174000	I have a question.
2174000	2176000	Do you use
2176000	2178000	Intel
2178000	2180000	instead of
2180000	2182000	SNP?
2182000	2184000	Do you use
2184000	2186000	DNA modification
2186000	2188000	such as
2188000	2190000	epigenetics?
2190000	2192000	Do you use
2192000	2194000	SNP
2194000	2196000	instead of
2196000	2198000	SNP?
2198000	2200000	Do you use
2200000	2202000	DNA modification
2202000	2204000	instead of
2204000	2206000	SNP?
2206000	2208000	I don't use
2208000	2210000	DNA modification.
2210000	2212000	However,
2212000	2214000	I know
2214000	2216000	epigenetics
2216000	2218000	is related to
2218000	2220000	pregnant women.
2220000	2222000	In the past,
2222000	2224000	epigenetics is related to
2224000	2226000	pregnant women.
2226000	2228000	In the past,
2228000	2230000	You will be able to see this part.
2230000	2232000	Recently,
2236000	2238000	I have been reading
2238000	2240000	that Intel
2240000	2242000	insertion and deletion
2242000	2244000	and copy number variation
2244000	2246000	affect
2246000	2248000	gene expression.
2250000	2252000	Do these things
2252000	2254000	affect
2254000	2256000	similar connections?
2258000	2260000	Also,
2260000	2262000	is there any other problem
2262000	2264000	with your chosen SNP?
2264000	2266000	I don't know.
2266000	2268000	Because,
2268000	2270000	like GWAS,
2270000	2272000	its design is for common variants.
2272000	2274000	So,
2274000	2276000	in the case of low probability,
2276000	2278000	is it a good way
2278000	2280000	to use common variants?
2280000	2282000	In fact,
2282000	2284000	we have tested
2284000	2286000	the SNP first.
2286000	2288000	Because,
2288000	2290000	there is a determination
2290000	2292000	that the SNP cannot be too low.
2292000	2294000	Like you said,
2294000	2296000	if the SNP is too low,
2296000	2298000	there is no point in testing.
2298000	2300000	But I didn't release it,
2300000	2302000	because there is too much content.
2302000	2304000	So, there is a determination.
2304000	2306000	You just mentioned
2306000	2308000	that copy number variation
2308000	2310000	is related.
2310000	2312000	In the past,
2312000	2314000	many complicated genes are related.
2314000	2316000	But,
2316000	2318000	to be frank,
2318000	2320000	we had limited budget.
2320000	2322000	So, we could only do
2322000	2324000	candidate genes.
2324000	2326000	We did our best to research.
2326000	2328000	We didn't do it on
2328000	2330000	present children.
2330000	2332000	We did it on autism
2332000	2334000	or attention deficit disorder.
2334000	2336000	We did it in a similar way
2336000	2338000	as you mentioned.
2340000	2342000	Another thing I want to ask is,
2342000	2344000	you chose early birth
2344000	2346000	as the sample.
2348000	2350000	In some studies,
2350000	2352000	early birth
2352000	2354000	is not related to genes.
2354000	2356000	It is related
2356000	2358000	to microbiome
2358000	2360000	or environmental impact.
2360000	2362000	Do you think
2362000	2364000	the subjects you chose
2364000	2366000	share similar
2366000	2368000	environmental impact?
2368000	2370000	Or they are highly variable?
2372000	2374000	It is possible.
2374000	2376000	For example,
2376000	2378000	we did analysis on
2378000	2380000	sex,
2380000	2382000	gender,
2382000	2384000	or the education level
2384000	2386000	of parents.
2386000	2388000	We did analysis on these.
2388000	2390000	We found that they are
2390000	2392000	middle-high education.
2392000	2394000	Early birth
2394000	2396000	is more likely to
2396000	2398000	have early birth.
2398000	2400000	So, their education level is higher.
2400000	2402000	We did basic analysis
2402000	2404000	and control
2404000	2406000	on these variables.
2406000	2408000	In addition,
2408000	2410000	we did research on
2410000	2412000	genes first.
2412000	2414000	My research sequence
2414000	2416000	is not the same as my report.
2416000	2418000	We did research on
2418000	2420000	genes first,
2420000	2422000	but I have to admit
2422000	2424000	that in terms of
2424000	2426000	child development,
2426000	2428000	the environmental impact
2428000	2430000	is significant.
2430000	2432000	This is the reason why
2432000	2434000	medical intervention is needed.
2434000	2436000	Thank you.
2442000	2444000	Thank you for the discussion
2444000	2446000	and questions.
2446000	2448000	Any other questions?
2450000	2452000	I would like to add
2452000	2454000	on the previous question.
2454000	2456000	In the past,
2456000	2458000	there were more
2458000	2460000	information collected.
2460000	2462000	For example,
2462000	2464000	at home,
2464000	2466000	they used
2466000	2468000	video recording
2468000	2470000	or tracking.
2470000	2472000	However, there are some
2472000	2474000	income restrictions.
2474000	2476000	Some people don't want to
2476000	2478000	be informed.
2478000	2480000	So,
2480000	2482000	although we know
2482000	2484000	these factors are related,
2484000	2486000	we can only
2486000	2488000	collect information
2488000	2490000	as comprehensively as possible.
2490000	2492000	There are still
2492000	2494000	many missing points.
2494000	2496000	I think this is a problem
2496000	2498000	for any child development research.
2498000	2500000	However,
2500000	2502000	the good thing about the previous question
2502000	2504000	is that it reminds us
2504000	2506000	that there are many factors
2506000	2508000	that need to be considered.
2508000	2510000	This is what I didn't mention
2510000	2512000	in such a short time.
2512000	2514000	I want to tell you
2514000	2516000	what the result is.
2524000	2526000	Thank you.
2526000	2528000	Any other questions?
2532000	2534000	I'm curious
2534000	2536000	about the difference
2536000	2538000	between the intervention
2538000	2540000	in the day after tomorrow
2540000	2542000	and the interaction
2542000	2544000	with the environment.
2546000	2548000	In the day after tomorrow,
2548000	2550000	we will see
2550000	2552000	whether the medical intervention
2552000	2554000	is effective or not.
2554000	2556000	It is a simple
2556000	2558000	intervention.
2558000	2560000	The interaction
2560000	2562000	with the environment
2562000	2564000	depends on the day after tomorrow
2564000	2566000	and the day after tomorrow.
2566000	2568000	However, there are many different
2568000	2570000	statistical models.
2570000	2572000	Some use hierarchical regression,
2572000	2574000	some use mixed-effect model.
2574000	2576000	In short,
2576000	2578000	we need to see the main effect,
2578000	2580000	i.e., the gene
2580000	2582000	and the development,
2582000	2584000	as well as the medical intervention,
2584000	2586000	i.e., the environment.
2586000	2588000	Then, we can put it
2588000	2590000	into the model
2590000	2592000	to see the difference
2592000	2594000	in the statistical model
2594000	2596000	and the complexity.
2596000	2598000	Do you want to ask this?
2600000	2602000	Yes.
2612000	2614000	I have another question.
2614000	2616000	I want to ask
2616000	2618000	how do you
2618000	2620000	evaluate your
2620000	2622000	web pages and
2622000	2624000	interactive games
2624000	2626000	are effective
2626000	2628000	and how to improve them?
2628000	2630000	We think it is good
2630000	2632000	but users
2632000	2634000	don't like it.
2634000	2636000	How can you
2636000	2638000	improve it
2638000	2640000	and make it acceptable?
2640000	2642000	Many people
2642000	2644000	ask this question.
2644000	2646000	Sometimes,
2646000	2648000	it is hard
2648000	2650000	to collect
2650000	2652000	the information.
2652000	2654000	However,
2654000	2656000	we can tell you
2656000	2658000	how to do it.
2658000	2660000	First,
2660000	2662000	if you make your own web pages,
2662000	2664000	you can know
2664000	2666000	the traffic
2666000	2668000	and the links.
2668000	2670000	For example,
2670000	2672000	you connect different links
2672000	2674000	to the same website.
2674000	2676000	For example,
2676000	2678000	I put it on my Facebook
2678000	2680000	or my personal website.
2680000	2682000	It can detect
2682000	2684000	which link you click.
2684000	2686000	Then, you can analyze
2686000	2688000	the user.
2688000	2690000	Also,
2690000	2692000	you can collect
2692000	2694000	the information.
2694000	2696000	If you use
2696000	2698000	Facebook or
2698000	2700000	LINE official account,
2700000	2702000	you will have
2702000	2704000	the information
2704000	2706000	about the user
2706000	2708000	and the time.
2708000	2710000	Also,
2710000	2712000	because
2712000	2714000	Facebook is
2714000	2716000	a public service,
2716000	2718000	we don't advertise.
2718000	2720000	If you want to
2720000	2722000	advertise,
2722000	2724000	you can design
2724000	2726000	different gender, age,
2726000	2728000	or region.
2728000	2730000	You can try
2730000	2732000	different results.
2732000	2734000	For example,
2734000	2736000	if the user is different,
2736000	2738000	the result will be different.
2738000	2740000	For example,
2740000	2742000	the number of clicks,
2742000	2744000	the number of shares,
2744000	2746000	the number of comments.
2746000	2748000	Basically,
2748000	2750000	you can collect the information.
2750000	2752000	For example,
2752000	2754000	we have a website called
2754000	2756000	Weijiao Dangzhang.
2756000	2758000	It's a little bit difficult.
2758000	2760000	Most of the time,
2760000	2762000	you can only ask
2762000	2764000	the user's opinion.
2764000	2766000	If you want to
2766000	2768000	collect data,
2768000	2770000	you can ask the user.
2782000	2784000	Any other questions?
2784000	2786000	We have time
2786000	2788000	for one or two more questions.
2788000	2790000	Please go ahead.
2790000	2792000	Hi, I'm Xie Chen.
2792000	2794000	I'm a PhD student.
2794000	2796000	I want to ask
2796000	2798000	a similar question.
2798000	2800000	I recently
2800000	2802000	wrote a
2802000	2804000	scholarship supplement.
2804000	2806000	I need to make
2806000	2808000	a few videos
2808000	2810000	about my research.
2810000	2812000	I want to
2812000	2814000	ask if you have
2814000	2816000	observed the trend
2816000	2818000	in 2021.
2818000	2820000	Does YouTube still need
2820000	2822000	to make 10-minute videos?
2822000	2824000	Or do you need to
2824000	2826000	put some essence in the first 30 seconds?
2826000	2828000	Is there still this trend?
2828000	2830000	Or has it changed slightly?
2830000	2832000	In addition,
2832000	2834000	10 minutes is a common standard.
2834000	2836000	But if it's a video,
2836000	2838000	they all need to
2838000	2840000	catch up to 20 minutes.
2840000	2842000	Is there any other standard
2842000	2844000	similar to this?
2844000	2846000	Can you share
2846000	2848000	some tips or tips?
2850000	2852000	In terms of science and technology,
2852000	2854000	it's what we do more often.
2854000	2856000	In fact,
2856000	2858000	it's shorter.
2858000	2860000	We usually catch 3 to 5 minutes.
2860000	2862000	Of course, if you say it will reach 20 minutes,
2862000	2864000	it may be
2864000	2866000	a real-time video
2866000	2868000	or a live broadcast.
2868000	2870000	It will be longer.
2870000	2872000	Of course,
2872000	2874000	if it's an animation,
2874000	2876000	like we do a lot of animations,
2876000	2878000	you will find that
2878000	2880000	animation costs a lot.
2880000	2882000	The longer you do it,
2882000	2884000	the higher the cost.
2884000	2886000	If it's a real-time video,
2886000	2888000	I can talk for a long time
2888000	2890000	and it will take a long time.
2890000	2892000	This is the first one.
2892000	2894000	We usually recommend science and technology
2894000	2896000	to not exceed
2896000	2898000	3 to 5 minutes.
2898000	2900000	As I said,
2900000	2902000	there is a platform analysis,
2902000	2904000	like YouTube.
2904000	2906000	It can let you know
2906000	2908000	how many seconds
2908000	2910000	most people watch
2910000	2912000	before leaving the video.
2912000	2914000	We found that
2914000	2916000	if you don't catch
2916000	2918000	everyone's attention
2918000	2920000	in the first 10 seconds,
2920000	2922000	everyone will leave the video.
2922000	2924000	As I said,
2924000	2926000	it's not for normal people
2926000	2928000	who don't like the first 10 seconds.
2928000	2930000	They think it's too hard
2930000	2932000	and they don't want to watch it.
2932000	2934000	They can't listen to it
2934000	2936000	and leave the video.
2936000	2938000	We want to let people know
2938000	2940000	why they need to listen to it.
2940000	2942000	Why?
2942000	2944000	It may be funny
2944000	2946000	or informative
2946000	2948000	or you can share it
2948000	2950000	with your friends.
2950000	2952000	Think about
2952000	2954000	what causes
2954000	2956000	them to watch
2956000	2958000	your video
2958000	2960000	until the end.
2960000	2962000	Another tip is
2962000	2964000	to consider your audience
2964000	2966000	and try to catch
2966000	2968000	their attention in the first 10 seconds.
2970000	2972000	When we make
2972000	2974000	general public videos,
2974000	2976000	we don't know
2976000	2978000	if you want to use real-time video
2978000	2980000	or PowerPoint or animation.
2980000	2982000	If you use animation,
2982000	2984000	you can make animation.
2984000	2986000	It's okay.
2986000	2988000	In the early stage of animation,
2988000	2990000	we tried to use pure PowerPoint
2990000	2992000	to make animation.
2992000	2994000	It's okay.
2994000	2996000	No matter which one you use,
2996000	2998000	I want to remind you
2998000	3000000	that the dubbing
3000000	3002000	sometimes affects
3002000	3004000	whether people can listen to it
3004000	3006000	or not.
3006000	3008000	It's easy to be ignored.
3008000	3010000	Whether it's
3010000	3012000	quality,
3012000	3014000	smoothness,
3014000	3016000	or smoothness,
3016000	3018000	it may affect
3018000	3020000	whether people want to
3020000	3022000	listen to it or not.
3022000	3024000	If you're worried
3024000	3026000	that the speech is too dry,
3026000	3028000	sometimes you can
3028000	3030000	add a little bit of
3030000	3032000	background music
3032000	3034000	that won't affect your speech
3034000	3036000	to make it softer.
3040000	3042000	It's very helpful.
3042000	3044000	Thank you.
3044000	3046000	I have a random question.
3046000	3048000	Recently,
3048000	3050000	the rate of fan-professional
3050000	3052000	is so low that it's hard to describe.
3052000	3054000	Do you plan to
3054000	3056000	make a community
3056000	3058000	or switch to another platform?
3058000	3060000	Or use the coordinate force
3060000	3062000	that they joke about now
3062000	3064000	to open a fan page and interact with others
3064000	3066000	to attract more people?
3066000	3068000	Do you do something like that?
3068000	3070000	Yes.
3070000	3072000	Whether it's Facebook
3072000	3074000	or Google,
3074000	3076000	it's all up to them.
3076000	3078000	It's like raising a shrimp.
3078000	3080000	In the early days,
3080000	3082000	the algorithm wasn't that terrible.
3082000	3084000	But now, it has
3084000	3086000	blocked the fan page to an extreme level.
3086000	3088000	As I just said,
3088000	3090000	some of the things
3090000	3092000	I just shared
3092000	3094000	are more about craftsmanship.
3094000	3096000	Fan pages are also about
3096000	3098000	business.
3098000	3100000	Basically, we don't expect
3100000	3102000	any business feedback.
3102000	3104000	That's why
3104000	3106000	we can't put
3106000	3108000	100% effort
3108000	3110000	on it.
3110000	3112000	Then,
3112000	3114000	the rate of fan-professional
3114000	3116000	will be lower.
3116000	3118000	But if it's better,
3118000	3120000	we hope that
3120000	3122000	we can build our own website
3122000	3124000	or app in the future.
3124000	3126000	We don't want to be affected
3126000	3128000	by the algorithm.
3128000	3130000	Otherwise,
3130000	3132000	you'll never know
3132000	3134000	how to apply the algorithm.
3134000	3136000	You'll never be able to
3136000	3138000	catch up with it.
3138000	3140000	It's also difficult
3140000	3142000	to spread information.
3142000	3144000	But we haven't changed
3144000	3146000	our original intention.
3146000	3148000	We've always hoped
3148000	3150000	to produce high-quality products.
3150000	3152000	We believe that
3152000	3154000	we can still survive
3154000	3156000	as long as we can
3156000	3158000	move the same things to our website
3158000	3160000	or other places.
3160000	3162000	I think
3162000	3164000	it's a good question.
3164000	3166000	We've been thinking about it.
3166000	3168000	The algorithm is bad.
3168000	3170000	It's not today's issue.
3170000	3172000	It's trying to charge you for advertising.
3172000	3174000	But we're craftspeople.
3174000	3176000	We can't spend money on advertising.
3176000	3178000	It's a waste.
3178000	3180000	We'd better produce better products.
3182000	3184000	I think what you're doing
3184000	3186000	is very meaningful.
3186000	3188000	I hope you can
3188000	3190000	keep doing it.
3190000	3192000	I have no more questions.
3192000	3194000	Thank you.
3194000	3196000	We hope we can
3196000	3198000	keep doing it.
3198000	3200000	Otherwise, many people will die.
3202000	3204000	Okay.
3204000	3206000	Now it's time to
3206000	3208000	sign off.
3208000	3210000	You can leave if you have
3210000	3212000	anything to say.
3212000	3214000	If you have time,
3214000	3216000	feel free to stay.
3232000	3234000	If not,
3234000	3236000	I'll stop the recording.
3236000	3238000	Thank you.
