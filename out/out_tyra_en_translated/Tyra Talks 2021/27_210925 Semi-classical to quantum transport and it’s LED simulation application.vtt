00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
We are very happy to welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
He graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2010,

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
and graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering in 2021,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
and received his Master's Degree.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
During his Master's Degree,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
he worked in coding,

00:27.000 --> 00:37.000
and developed the non-equilibrium screen function,

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
which is NEGF.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
This is also in his title.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
If you don't know what NEGF is,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
he will explain it to you later.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
From 2014 to 2020,

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
he went to Purdue University, Indiana,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
and received his Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
His main job there was quantum transport method,

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
which is the method of quantum transmission.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
His main focus was on nanostructure and quantum transmission.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Currently, he works in Intel's TCAP team.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Let's welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
You can start sharing.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Let me share my screen.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Can everyone see my screen?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Yes, but you can't see the slides.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Can you see the slides now?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Yes.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Let's follow the Tyrell tradition.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Please turn on your microphones,

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
and let's welcome Dr. Wang Guan Zhong.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hello, everyone.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I will be speaking in English for the next few slides,

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
because the technical terms may change.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
My target audience this time is...

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
If you're interested in this field,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
whether you want to apply for a Master's Degree,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
or if you want to know more about this field,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
or if you want to use this tool,

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
my target audience is like that.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
If you have any questions,

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
you can send me an email.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
These works were done when I was studying for a Master's Degree at Purdue.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
The funding sources were NSF and NCSA.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I also received funding from the Department of Education.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
So I wanted to acknowledge that.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
I also worked with CELBACO.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
This work was done by Purdue's supercomputer,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
which we call RCAC.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
This is the result of the computation.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
My topic today is optoelectronic simulation,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
and I will go over from the semi-classical

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
to quantum transport,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
my different perspective.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Here is my outline,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
and I will go over the motivation,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and what's the method being used here,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
and I will show some results.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
In the methods, I will go over the semi-classical.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Here's a missing label here,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
and go over to what's NEGF,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
and what is a beautiful probe,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
and the difficulty of including different processes,

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
a recombination and generation process inside the NEGF.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
How do we do that?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I will show some results to show,

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
first, the importance of including these kinds of processes.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Also, I will do a comparison.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
If we use a semi-classical way to do simulation

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
versus using quantum transport way to do it,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
what's the difference?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
And do a summary there.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
So, why are we working on this project?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
It's because what we have achieved so far as mankind,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
because we have solar cell,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and also to harvest energy from sun,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
and also we can efficiently emit light

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
through light-emitting diets,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
which is like a really efficient way

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
to transfer energy from electricity to lighting.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And to push the boundary further,

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
we need to look into what other new materials are out there,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
what different new structures we can optimize

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
like the current efficiency.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
And so, for example, to improve the efficiency of LED,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
we have these quantum wells,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and then you can see that when we have quantum well,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
the carrier will like to stay there more,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
and therefore increase the opportunity

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
to recombine and emit light.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
And also we are looking to the novel new materials,

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
like, for example, different Indian composition,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
or maybe some 2D materials,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
and we're looking into these.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
So, when we are utilizing all these different new materials,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
new structures, and there are lots of quantum effects in it.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
So, therefore, like the current,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
and we know that the non-equilibrium Green's function,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
this method, like it's solving Schrodinger equation

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
with using Green's function,

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
it's a well-accepted method.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
So, I'm going to go over why do we need NEGF to do it.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
So, what is optoelectronics?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And so, I think the best way to understand optoelectronics,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
like it's just a simple PN diet we study in school, right?

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So, it's usually a bipolar device,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
where by bipolar, I mean, like,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
there's electrons and there's holes.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
And also there are carriers,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
like they're in different equilibrium,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
for example, electron,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
and they're usually separated by a band gap.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
That's why we use semiconductors.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
So, having a band gap,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
and we kind of segregate the carriers to two kinds,

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
and the electron is injected by the source, one side.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
One contact, we inject electron here,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
and the other one is like a hole.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
And when they see each other,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
and there's interesting thing can happen, right?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
There are different processes there.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
For example, there's like Shockley-Ree hole,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
where electron and hole, they can recombine.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
And when they recombine,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
they can emit phonon, as known as heat, right?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So, this is like a wasteful energy.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
When they recombine through the defects,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
the heat is generated and nothing gained.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, the heat is gained, but it's not that great.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
And there's also radiative recombination,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
where when the electron and hole, they see each other,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
and they can recombine,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
and therefore, they can emit like a photon,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
or we can see light here.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
And the rate it happens usually is,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
and there's like, because like,

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
for example, first one,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
they need to see through a defect here,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
and therefore, their proportion is like proportional

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
to the n-type or p-type,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
because one carrier can come to the defect here,

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
and to wait for the other person to come,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
and to recombine.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
So, therefore, their rate is proportional to,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
you know, either the carrier,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
either the electrons or the hole concentration here.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
But radiative recombination,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
it's, you need,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
the rate is proportional to the both of them.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
So, you need to have a high electron here,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and high hole concentration here,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
to make it happen.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And there's like also another process,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
which is OJ recombination.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And this is like a three-particle process,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
where the electron and hole,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
they can recombine.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
But instead of like emitting a photon,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
it will kick an electron to a higher energy,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
or the opposite.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
It's either two electron with one hole,

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
or two hole with one electron.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
But the result is like a waste of energy,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
and the chance of doing is something like here.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And, yes.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
If you have any questions,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
you can ask directly,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
or pause the video.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
And the other part is a generation process,

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
where the electron hole,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
at this place,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
at this depletion region,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
we can absorb the photon,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
and like create an electron and hole pair.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
So, all these processes are needed

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
to simulate an optoelectronic device.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
So, that's what we need to cover,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
when we are doing a modeling.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
So, why do we need quantum model?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So, let's take a look at a simulation result.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And this is from this paper I'm co-author with.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
This is like a simulation result

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
from a commercialized 3-5 LED.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And as you can see here,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
this line here means the density of states,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and the color here is the electron density.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
So, the contour line is the density of state, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
And we can see that the electron is coming from the left side,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
and occupying these states here.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And there are holes coming from the other direction.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
This is injected here.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
And they are going to be in here,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
and they will recombine and emit light here.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
So, we can see that,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
if we really do a quantum simulation,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
we can see that there is interference everywhere, right?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
For example, all these pattern means,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
if you treat them as particles,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
it doesn't capture everything, right?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
So, for example,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
electron, they can tunnel through this barrier,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
and through these interference.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
So, we really need to make use of the quantum transport,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
instead of the semi-classical way.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
So, the current state of our tool to do this is to,

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I mean, the current way,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I mean, before I published the paper, right?

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
So, before I was working on this,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
the best way to deal with this quantumly

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
is also from this paper,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
where we cut the domain into different pieces,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
and then we call some of them the red part,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and also the green part.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
So, the green part is like equilibrium.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
And why are they in equilibrium?

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Because usually the source is highly doped,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and then the drain is also highly doped region.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And when you're highly doped,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
there's lots of carrier there,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
and they will scatter a lot,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and the carrier there will be in equilibrium.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So, when you are in equilibrium,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
we can put a Fermi level here,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
saying, oh, this is the Fermi energy in this region,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
and this is the Fermi energy,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
and there's like Fermi level for electron,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Fermi level for holes in this region.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
And there's also the pink part,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
where we do, this is non-equilibrium region.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
So, this is like the previous way of doing it,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
where we do NEGF inside the pink region,

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
and we just put the Fermi level across here.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
So, but this method has some defects,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
where we cannot even calculate a simple p-n diet,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
because a simple p-n diet,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
we cannot really tell which region is non-equilibrium,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
which region is equilibrium.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
So, it's really hard to do quantum transport

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
in a p-n diet,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
when we are trying to include

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
all the recombination or generation processes.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
So, there are different flavor of quantum transport.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
There's like ballistic NEGF,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
there's like the one I mentioned,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
we cut into different domain,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
when we try to do the transport calculation,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
and there's like the super expensive SE4,

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
but none of them can have been,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
are able to deal with the p-n diets,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
like with the recombination processes.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
So, therefore, a new model is needed, right?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
And also we can see that,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
this is from a super old paper,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
why the recombination process is important,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
is because when you measure IV curve,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
there's like different slope here,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
and they are in the results

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
of different recombination process here,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
which later on, I will talk more about that.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
So, what's the available way to do,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
to deal with carrier transport?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
So, here's like a list, a roadmap,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
like where you can pick and choose,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
depending on your needs.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
So, if you are,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
so here, the axis,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
y-axis here is the computational intensity.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
So, I'm going from a super cheap,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
super fast turnaround time,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
computational cost,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
like the semi-classical way,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
and all the way to go quantum,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
where we need to solve Schrodinger equation,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
and using it on any GF methods.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
So, I will first go over,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
what's the Boltzmann transport equation?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And there are different way to solve it,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
like the drift diffusion is the most popular way.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It's the first order,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I think, what is it?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
The first order approximation,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
not approximation,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
but it's a simplification of the BTE,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
the famous BTE thing,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and that's like we solve it drift diffusion,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
and then we can also use Monte Carlo,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
like statistically to gather results

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
for the BTE equation.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
So, what's Boltzmann transport equation?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
It's by saying that,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
oh, there is a distribution function.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
By distribution, we mean,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
with the occupation of a different state,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and what does this mean?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Like, we want to ask,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
what's the possibility of finding a carrier

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
at a particular location,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
at a particular time,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
with a particular momentum?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So, if we can,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
for example, inside a device,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
there's a different location here,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
and for each location,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
there is a,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I'm trying to draw this like a momentum,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
so carrier with low momentum is here,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
and carrier with higher momentum

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
is on the upper here,

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
and we are asking,

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
what's the distribution?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
How many particles are in those states?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So, if we know this information

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
across time, across space,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
and for different time and space

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
and different momentum,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
we know this,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
then the system is solved, right?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
So, and why is this distribution useful?

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Because from this distribution function,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
we can get the carrier density, right?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Because if we want to ask,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
what's the carrier density at this location?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Given the F at this location,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
we can just do a sum

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
and know how much carrier is here.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
And if you want to know,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
oh, for your device you're working on,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
what's the current

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that you just do,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
get their group of velocity

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
from the band structure

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
and you do a sum

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
with this distribution,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
then you can get,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
oh, how much current you are gaining

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
at this location.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
So, it's useful

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
because we can get observable

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
from this distribution function.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
And how do we solve this F?

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
And it's the BTE Boltzmann.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Boltzmann came up with this, right?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Like the Boltzmann transport equation.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
It's the governing equation.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
So, the equation is listed here.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And I will just try to show

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
how we understand different terms.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
For example,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
the first term means,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
oh, if you have carrier

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
coming in, coming out,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
the distribution here

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
will be related to that, right?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Because you have carrier

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
flowing into here or flowing out.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
And the distribution here will be,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
if you have lots of people coming in

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
and a few going out,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
then the distribution here will be higher.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
So, this is what the first term means.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
And the second term means that

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
the F means the electric field,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
the carrier experience in the charge.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And when you are,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
when the carrier is experiencing

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
electric field, it will accelerate.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And it will change its momentum.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So, here we mean like that,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
okay, given the electric field

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
at this location,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
the distribution, you know,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
it's related to

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
the distribution nearby.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
So, distribution with a lower momentum,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
with a higher momentum,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
they can come in and out

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
because of the electric field

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
at this location.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
And the last one is

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
if you have like, oh,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
other collision inside a device,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
for example, a phonon,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
an electron can absorb a phonon

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
or emit a phonon and come to your

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
this place, if there's a possibility

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
like that, then this term is trying

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
to take that into account.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
So, we have all this

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and all combined. And they can be solved

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
really expensively by

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
doing Monte Carlo, by assuming

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
the distribution function and you start to

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
run it, oh, how many carrier coming in,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
coming out from different momentum space,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
then it's super expensive to do that

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Monte Carlo. So, but if it's still

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
too hard, then you can simplify

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
this BT equation

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
to a drift diffusion equation,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
which is saying that the

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
current at this place is proportional

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
to the carrier with the electric

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
field and the diffusion

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
with the density gradient.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
So, this is, and the full derivation

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
is in this paper here.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
People who are interested can go take

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
a look.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
So, I kind of went over like the

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
semi-classical way where

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
the carrier and the device are

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
like particle-like and then

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
they can recombine

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
by solving

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
the drift diffusion equation and the continuity

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
equation. That's how we

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
deal with the

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
semi-classical way.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And now I'm going to step into the

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Schrodinger equation and our

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
non-equilibrium Green's function.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
So, we all know about Schrodinger equation.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
It's like, it's

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
given a Hamiltonian of the system

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
that you can solve it and then to find

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
what's the possible eigenenergies

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
inside the system.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And the Green's function,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I still won't go into details.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I started to disappoint people here.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
But like, I think

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
there are like really useful

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
material here and like really, I think

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Professor Datas did a really good job

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
on explaining what

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
an AEGF method is with his

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
introductory material on

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
nanoHUB. So, it's all the information

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and there's like a

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
famous book. You can reach out to me and I can

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
show you like

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
what's the book you need to read

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
into. But Green's function,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
from our understanding, Green's function

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
is also

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
in an engineering term, it's like the response

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
to an excitation, right?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
So usually, oh,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Poisson equation, the Green's function,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
if you know the Green's function for a Poisson equation,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
then you know, oh,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
if you put a charge here, what's the

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
resulting potential you can get?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So the Schrodinger equation is similar like this.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
So you put the H psi,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
E psi all into one side

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
and then you can solve for the Green's function.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And the Green's function is that

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
if you multiply this

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
by excitation, then you know what's

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
the response you will get

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
inside this device.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
So,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
here, we will

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
first go into the ballistic

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
non-equilibrium Green's function.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So once you, so first you have this

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Hamiltonian, and then you can get the

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
resulting Green's function. And then

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
by, so here

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
it's like the Hamiltonian here, and we can get

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
the Green's function. And using the Green's function,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
there's like some key terms.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
There's like the G lesser, which is the

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
the

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
this is proportional to the carrier

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
density. So it's like

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
here's the excitation you have in the system.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
And you have like, using the Green's

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
function, and there's a Gr

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
and Gr dagger, then you can get the

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
what's the carrier distribution in the device.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
So,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
what the

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
NEGF does is that we are interested

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
in a part,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
only this part of the device. And we are,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
we want to say, oh,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
we only want to focus on this small region.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
And then the left,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
we call it, that's a

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
contact, that's a lead. And we

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
don't want to care about the information.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It's an infinite,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
going left and right.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
They are periodically going left

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and right. But we don't want to simulate

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
the entire universe. We only

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
want to focus on the transistor or the

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
LED we care about.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
So, given this Green's

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
function, and then we can

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
for different contact,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
if you are contact to the left, and then there's

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
like a left self-energy

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and there's like a right side, there's like a

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
self-energy here. And with all this self-energy

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
on the Green's function, you can get what's

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
the carrier distribution in here.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And when they are in contact

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
with the reservoir of

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
a different Fermi level here

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
on the left side and right side here.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So, but the ballistic

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and NEGF, there's no scattering.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
So carrier will not scatter with

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
each other. So how

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
do we do

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
including all these scattering

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
terms in the

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
NEGF is like, there's a

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
popular method

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
that's called Butyprobe method

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
where it's proposed by Marcus

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Butyprobe back in 1980s.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So it's a way to mimic

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
defacing, which means, aka

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
the scattering events.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
So, we

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
will try, when we're

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
injecting the carrier into

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
the device from the left and right

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
side. So we're adding more

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
more these

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
reservoir inside the device.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So we're taking the electron out and

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
put it back in, take it out and put it

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
back in. So in this way, we're

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
mimicking like carrier

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
we can randomize the carrier

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
and the carrier's momentum will go around

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
and like you can see that

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
this is more closer to

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
the real world problem where the

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
device have scattering.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
But this method

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
was only applicable

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
to unit polar device. For example,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
if you only have electron here, it can only

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
simulate electrons

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
scattered inside the device.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
So

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
my work, my PhD

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
was like to ask a question

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
whether we can modify this for

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
bipolar device.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Bipolar

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
means

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
when we have, so

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
can we put like two, when we are

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
we simulate electron and hole

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
separately like before, right?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
We have electron coming in and electron

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
coming out and we also simulate the hole

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
whereas electron coming in, sorry, hole coming

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
in and hole coming out. And we also

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
include this probe here to extract

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
the carrier in, out of

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
the device and put it back in

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
and this

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
way, if we somehow take

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
the carrier out from

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
this electron and hole and that's equivalent

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
to semi-classically

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
how JIP diffusion model

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
the Shockley-Ree hole and different processes.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
So using this

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
method, we can

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
cover

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
the processes I

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
mentioned in the optoelectronic device. We can

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
model Shockley-Ree hole, we can model

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
radiated, we can model OJ,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
we can model all these

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
effects inside the

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
enhanced

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
electrical probe method.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
So here is like all

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
the methodology I've mentioned

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
where from

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
cheap to expensive, we have like

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
JIP diffusion, Monte Carlo's

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
and the NEGF

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
and also

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
in the

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
NEGF we have like the

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
ballistical one and also the

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
what's the time now?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Do we still have time?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Oops.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh 540, sorry.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Let me put it back on.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Yeah, so we have like

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
all the different

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
methodology here and this is the one

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I was mainly working on.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So carriers, they are

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
wave-like.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So for example,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
from before, JIP diffusion and Monte Carlo's

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
each of the carriers, they are particle-like

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
and then we are solving

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
the current continuity equation.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
For each location, there is like a quasi-Fermi

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
level, which means they follow Fermi

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
direct distribution

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
quantum correction with

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
artificial.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
And there are way people

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
when using JIP diffusion, you can

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
couple it with quantum correction like

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
solving Schrodinger equation

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
in a certain region and then couple

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
them with a JIP diffusion and try

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
to mimic it.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You will have artificial boundary

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
condition.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
When do we choose?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Which is the part we want to solve at quantum?

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Where do we solve semi-classically?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
So there's lots of confusion

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
if you are coupling that.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But using NEGF

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
like if it's

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
ballistic, it's not

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
really useful for

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
optoelectronic because there's no

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
recombination scattering processes and

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
there's like the way I mentioned, it's called

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
multi-equilibrium

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
way. So some part of it you

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
simulate, you assume

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
like there's like an equilibrium there.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
But

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
this method, it requires

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
like

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
really, it only

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
works with, for example, quantum well structure

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
and inside here, we can

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
set it to be equilibrium and somehow to

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
have the carrier recombine.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
But in this way, the new

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
proposed beautiful probe way

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
where the carriers are always

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
wavelength and we can have

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
recombination generation everywhere in the

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
device and we also can have scattering

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
consider and

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
you don't need to say

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
this part is equilibrium or the other part

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
is non-equilibrium. So you can simulate

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
the entire device without

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
artificial boundary.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And of course, there's the SC Born method

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
but that's like super expensive and

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
no one has, I would say

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
like no one has done like

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
a simulation like

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
LED kind of simulation

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
like with it.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And so later

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
next one, I will go

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
to talk about the results.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
So first part, I will show that

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
the importance of recombination.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
So here is a picture

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
showing, this is a structure

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
where electrons coming

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
again from the left side here and then

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
there's a band structure. There's a

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
band gap in between

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
this and I crop out in between

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
and the hole is coming to here.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
So

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
there are two paths that electron

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
can, there's

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
a current conducting path, right?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
So one path is the blue path where

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
electron come here and hole come here

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and they will recombine and this

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
current, they can form a current path.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And the other path is the black line

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
where the carrier come in and can

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
jump over the barrier to the other side.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So there are two way that the

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
carrier can

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
that the current can form.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
So here's a comparison with

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
or without this indium

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
gallium nitride. So when we form

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
the quantum well with a lower

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
band gap material here. So on the two sides

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
gallium nitride with a larger band gap.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
With indium gallium nitride, you can shrink

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
the band gap and that's why we see this dip

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
here. And with this, you

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
can see that comparing the two

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
the recombination current is

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
much higher with a quantum well

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
because inside a quantum well, there's a

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
higher chance of

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
carrier here and because

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
we also know that

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
the recombination

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
is proportional to the carrier density

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
there, right? They want to see each other

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
they want to recombine. So the more they have

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
at each location, the more

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
they can recombine with each other.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
So

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
here I'm trying

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
to show that

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
when we do any

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
gift calculation, when we include

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
the recombination here

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
this is a typical

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
IV curve and we can see that

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
this is a log scale

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
current, right? So when we increase

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
when we increase the drain

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
voltage, we are pulling

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
the barrier down

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
so there are more and more current can go

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
through to the other side. So

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
let's focus first on

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
the low Vd

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
side. So on the low Vd side

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
there, you can

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
see that there's still a barrier here. So

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
the black current, so the total

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
current will be, as I said before

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
there's like two parts. There's a recombine

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
the electron hole

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
they can recombine here for a

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
current path. And there's also the

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
thermionic current where the carrier can

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
jump over the barrier to the other side

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
so this is the two part. And when the

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
barrier is still high, we can see that the black line

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
is not in favor because it's hard

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
for the electron to jump out here. There's like

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
few particles here to jump out. So

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
the black part of the current is super

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
small. And

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
at this region

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
the recombination current dominates

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
so we can see that this is

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
the

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
distribution here.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
And when we increase

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
the bias voltage

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
we're pulling the other side, the barrier down

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
so as you can see here

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
right now the black path is easier

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
the electron can zip through the device

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
and form a current path

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
so right now the blue one is

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
it's still large but

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
compared to the black one it's much smaller

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
so this is on off.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
So when we include

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
NEGF, when we do

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
non-equilibrium Green's function

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
transport calculation, when we don't

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
have recombination, which current

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
do we get? We get the

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
we don't have

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
the blue line here so we're only getting

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
the black. And if we

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
using this method we're able

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
to include the recombination process

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
which means we get the red line

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
so we're pushing

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
the boundary of NEGF such that

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
we can simulate the device

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
from a black line to a red line

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
which is a really large difference if you look at

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
here and

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
if you look at the

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
before the threshold voltage there's a

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
huge current difference with or without

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
recombination and it

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
also further impact what's the

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
threshold voltage. The threshold voltage means

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
when is your device on

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
or off. So there's a small shift

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
here although on a

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
linear scale but with more recombination

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
the red and

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
also the black line will have a larger

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
shift and therefore a larger impact.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
So it's really important to

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
include the recombination

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
in your device.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Can I ask a question here?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Yeah, sure.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Can you go back to your previous slide?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Yes.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Maybe

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
this is a bit stupid but I

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
thought

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
recombination

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
means you have

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
electron hole pair recombine

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
and I thought it will

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
lead to the emission

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
of phonon or emission of photon

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
and usually

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I would think

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
recombination is bad

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
for the current but here you are saying

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
when you have

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
smaller bias voltage

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
the VT is smaller you

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
actually have higher recombination

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
energy, recombination

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
current. Why does recombination

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
contribute to a current?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
To a current?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Or a current?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So there are different

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
recombination process, right? There's like

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I mentioned like there's a

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
there's radiative recombination

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
and there's OJ recombination.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
So they are all

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
the consequence of electron hole.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I mean OJ

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
is the radiative

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
in the shock wave hole is one electron one hole

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
and they disappear.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And the shock wave hole is

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
you emit heat.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Yeah, phonons.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
And the radiative is like you emit

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
photon. And OJ

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
is like you kick another carrier

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
to a higher energy, right? So it's useless

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
too, right? So

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
not all. Okay, so wait, your question

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
is, but here

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
is showing the recombination is

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
the blue line here, right? So when

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
your lower VT is lower, when your

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
higher VT it's

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
higher.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
But, sorry, what

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
was your question? My question is

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I, okay, I

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
thought recombination

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
is bad for your, for the current.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Why?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
It's bad because

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
it's

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I think some, well

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
bad is kind of like a subjective, right?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I would call it bad if

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I would call it

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
this is a bad device if most of your

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
recombination happens for

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
happen in the way, the shock wave hole way

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
or OJ, right? So the black

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
and the red is bad because they don't

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
produce photon, you don't

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
produce light, then why are you

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
recombining? So I think

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
bad is, okay, it depends

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
on which process you are

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
looking at, right? I think

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
the blue one is good because

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I see, I see, because you want a photon

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
going, I see. Yeah.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Okay. Yes, yes.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Okay, and the relation between

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
okay, maybe this is

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
a bit specific, like OJ one

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
the radiative one and

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
the phonon one

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
black, blue, and red.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Are they always in this order?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Won't they cross

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
at some point if you have different lengths

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
of the, I think

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
this X means the size of your

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Yeah, because it looks like

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
they always have red, blue, and black.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Do they ever

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
cross at some point?

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I think I was showing

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
the interesting

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
question because I was showing

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
previously

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
they have different

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
relationship, right? So

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
this is an ABC model

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
where the

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
shock wave we hold there is proportional to

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
n plus p, and the radiative

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
is n and p, and then

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the rate is proportional to n

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
squared p. So

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
I think if you engineer it

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
smartly, you can

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
control which one dominates.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
But somehow in this scenario

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
the red one is always larger

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
but if you look at the equation here

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
it's n squared p

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
so if you make the p much

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
smaller, right now it's equally large

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
n and p are super large both in here

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
but the real device

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I think is more complicated

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and maybe in some

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
way, smart way, you can

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
shrink, make the blue

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
dominant and the other two

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
because relatively they are different, right?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
In this case

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
the red are closer to blue

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
but here you can see that

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
the red and blue is farther away

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
or yeah

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I think

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
there's some way

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
we can engineer it to make it

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
some area the blue one

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
will dominate, yeah.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Is there any other questions?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I have a question here.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
So I guess

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
this case is simple enough

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I guess this is probably

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
just your test case

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
but this case is simple enough

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
that you can also use semi-classical

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
way to do a simulation

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
so I'm just wondering

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
how do they compare?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So that's my next topic

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
it's like comparing on

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
this really small structure and then

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
we are using a semi-classical way and also

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
a quantum way to compute

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and then I will show some comparison

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
here so I think that's the

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
that will answer your question.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Okay, great, yeah.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
So the next one as the question has

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
elevated us

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
to this point, so I'm going

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
to talk about the comparison between the two, semi-classical

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and quantum

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
and how do we compare, how do we make a fair comparison

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
yes, that's an important question

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
is that we use the same still

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
the same small, like the structure I was

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
showing here is like 20 nanometer

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
so it's a super tiny structure

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
and then I'm going to apply

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
semi-classical method, a drip

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
diffusion one and also

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
for the quantum way I'm using

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
this new method, the butycoprobe

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
with recombinant generation method

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
which is the tool our lab

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
used to work on in grad school

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
so if you guys are interested in applying for our group

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
email me and I can give

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
you more information

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
so how do we compare this

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
is that in all the transport

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
simulation

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
we're decoupling the transport part

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
with the part, like

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
electrostatic part, so we usually do a

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
self-consistent, we solve for the

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
where's the electron holes and given

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
the electron holes and they have charge

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
and therefore they will form a potential

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
so we will feed back the carrier

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
transport and plug it into Poisson

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
and get a potential and like doing this

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
like a hundred times or whatever

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
it's converging, so it's like self-consistently

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
solving, decouple the two

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and solve the Poisson

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
and just keep on doing until it doesn't

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
change anymore and then we declare

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
this simulation is finished

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
it's converged

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
so to compare

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
it's easy because we can

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
just focus on this part and then for the

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
carrier we can choose to use

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
NEGF or we can choose the

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
semi-classical way of doing it

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
and when doing the semi-classical way

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
we also choose to

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
because Drift Diffusion, to solve these problems

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
they usually have another quantum correction model

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
where they are solving just

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
a confined Schrodinger

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
but NEGF is more like an open boundary

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
open boundary Schrodinger

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
equation, but like

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
for semi-classical

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
people, they usually will

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
couple it with a quantum correction method

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
which is solving Schrodinger

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
inside an infinite

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
quantum

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
so they will have boundary, but solving Schrodinger

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
only in that region and try to couple them

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
together

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
so the question to answer is

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
how do we

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
compare the quantum and semi-classical models

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
and here is

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
more of like showing

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
so the left side is using

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
the NEGF where

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
we will have a band structure, right?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
we will have the band gap of

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I think this is around

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
0.4 to

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
so galenitride is like 3.4

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
electron volts, and inside here

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
there is like a quantum well

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
so the actual

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
will be galenitride

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
and we assume that it is doped with 1E20

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and there is like a region of galenitride

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and that will have a smaller band gap

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
and also the galenitride, and this is like

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the structure we are looking into

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and in NEGF

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
we will provide like a

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
total energy

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
so the y-axis is the energy range

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
so you know

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
here are some states that can be

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
so here the color means like the density

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
of states, means like the carrier

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
can have a possibility to go in

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
there, but there is some portion of it

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
like brighter, which means

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
because of the interference, carrier

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
doesn't have a

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
even if you have carrier, it cannot go in

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
here, so that's what the density of states

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
means

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
the NEGF we can provide

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
is non-equilibrium throughout the entire

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
device, which means the carrier

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
doesn't have to follow Fermi-Dirac

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
distribution everywhere

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
also we can see that the states

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
is broadened, so because

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
you are in contact with the

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
external source, therefore

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
the state is broadened

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
otherwise, if you solve

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
this in the Schrodinger equation

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
it's going to be confined

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
like a

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
the states is like, you know, it's not

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
broadened, but here we can see that

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
for example, quantum well here, it's not a

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
compared to Schrodinger equation

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
it's a fixed energy level, because

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
you are in contact with the surrounding

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
therefore there is a peak here

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and for the drift diffusion

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
we can see that

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
here

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
drift diffusion

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
equation assume that

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
in everywhere there is a Fermi

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
energy, right, and for this Fermi energy

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
follows the Fermi distribution

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
which means the carrier will

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
be Fermi distribution everywhere

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
with different Fermi energy

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
and also

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
we are solving the quantum

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
using this Q-well method

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
in ATLAS, which is solving Schrodinger equation

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
here, so that's why we can have this

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
red wave function

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
square here, so that's the wave function

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
form, and how is it solved? It's by solving

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Schrodinger equation only in this

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
region, so we are defining

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
a region where we want to solve this

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
closed boundary Schrodinger

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
equation, and we are trying to couple this

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
to the drift diffusion methods

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and there is like several parameters

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
for example, in a drift diffusion

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
you have ABC

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
parameters for the recombination

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
like the circularity hole, the phonon

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
the photon, and also the

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
other ones, the OJ, so there is

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
like the parameters for it, and we are using the same ABC

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
in drift diffusion, there is like a mobility

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
term, where for

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
NEGF is called self-energy, which is

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
the scattering rates

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
in the device, and that will, in a

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
semi-classical way, that's called the mobility

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
so we need to find

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
a corresponding, oh given this mu

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
what's the scattering rate in the device

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
and therefore what's the self-energy we are using

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
in NEGF, and

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
for drift diffusion

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
when you are, there is a density of

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
states, and you are assuming

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
you will

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
get a carrier, so there is

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
for different M

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
for different effective mass, you

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
correspond to different density of states, and therefore

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
carrier, for

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
NEGF we are using

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
we can support tight binding

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
different way

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
to describe this EK

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
relationship, so

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
that's the corresponding, right

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
we can also use effective mass, or we can use

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
tight binding method, or KRP, or

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
one-year functions

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
so the basis

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
there is a little bit different, in drift diffusion we can only support

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
so this is how we

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
couple them

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
so

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I'm only going to show that

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
the direct comparison

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
from observable we can see

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
so for example, on the right side

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
this is showing

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
the solid line is the drift diffusion

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
result, and you can see that

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
this is the carrier density across the device

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
we have high electron on one side

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
and we have high hole on the other side

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
and they are penetrating into each

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
into the other side

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
and we can see that the drift diffusion

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
here is much lower

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
this is log scale, so it's like

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
ten to the fifth, the five times

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
smaller than the

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
quantum transports method, right

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
and the reason is

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
understandable, because

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
when you look into here

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
the electron, you know

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
the NEGF, you can

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
what is it like, the

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
when you bounce a ball to the wall, the semi-classical will bounce

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
back, but quantum

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
you can penetrate into the wall, right

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
so you can see that analogy here

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
where you still have some density

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
of states inside the barrier

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
where the semi-classical will just say

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
there's nothing, you bounce

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
into this wall and you will go back directly

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
so this is like the ball analogy

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
so that's why

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
when you're doing quantum transport

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
this carrier inside

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
here is higher, much higher

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
ten to the fifth time higher because of the

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
penetration here

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
but otherwise

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
the potential is pretty

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
matched here, but the carrier

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
difference here will cause you

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
to calculate the

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
recombination rate different, right

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
because you have higher density, therefore your

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
recombination rate will be

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
different, so that's why

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
the potential looks

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
the same between quantum way

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
and semi-classical way, however

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
the recombination rate calculated from

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
which is a post-process

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
using ABC model to predict

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
oh, what's the OJ

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the photon and also the OJ related

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
process, there's a huge difference

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
at lower bias, you can see here

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
the quantum way

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
because you have more penetrated electrons

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
for them to recombine

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
therefore you have a much higher recombination rate

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
and for higher bias

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
they're pretty much similar

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
but small difference here

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
okay

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and this case

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
before I was talking about a HOMO

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
junction where we're using

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
galenitride all across but with

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
different doping, and here is a heterojunction

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
where similar things

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
are done, we're comparing

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
the carrier

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
density and we can see that oh, there's

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
some difference here

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
right, like the semi-classical

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
we have a sharp discontinuity

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
probably because we chose

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
the boundary different but

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
which part should we solve Schrodinger

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
it's pretty subjective

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
so I'm putting

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
all the things here and seeing

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
that there is an impact

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
like with or without

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
diffusion like, or any

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
like what's the impact on carrier density

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
and here

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
trying to show the recombination with

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
in this heterojunction, we can also see that

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
because

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
drift diffusion coupled with

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Schrodinger equation, therefore

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
we can see that the recombination rate after

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
doing this is pretty similar

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
so

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I think this is like a

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
positive side about drift diffusion, it's pretty fast

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
and with coupling to like quantum

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
correction, it's matching

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
GF pretty well, so it's like

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
also kind of giving confidence but also giving

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
saying like oh, drift diffusion is not that bad

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
like you can still

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
quantumly correct it

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
with solving Schrodinger impartial

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
region

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
and here I'm trying

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
to show the I-V difference

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
for a homojunction device

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
so in a homojunction device, if you

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
measure the I-V curve, and here

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
the solid line is the drift diffusion, and the circle

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
is the quantum well, and we can see

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
that

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the off current

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
there's like a larger difference

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
between them, and if you

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
have, if you compare the

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
heterojunction device using the

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
and there's some difference here

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
and there, but just like

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
providing the comparison here

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
and this

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
method, we can further

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
you know, solving, we're

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
enabling any GF to be able to

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
solve like

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
carrier generation, because we are

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
injecting the, we can

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
assume the light come in and

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
producing electron hole and

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
and give them, separate them

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
to generate current here, right?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So here's the simulation results like

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
using any GF, and this is like the

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
the first

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
the first tool that we can cover

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
all processes into, including

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
generation, and then to enable a device

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
simulation

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
So here

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
the summary, I kind of review

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
different carrier transport method

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
from BTE all the way to any

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
GF, and providing the references there

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
if you're interested, or can ask, email me

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
for more information, and this

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
is like, this work is to propose

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
a really generic

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
method for recombination

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
generation process inside the

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
any GF framework, so we're enabling

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
any GF community to

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
approach problem like recombination

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
generation, and we

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
show the importance, oh, for any GF

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
with or without recombination, what's the

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
difference, and why do we need it, and we

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
also benchmark against like GF diffusion

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
based TCAD tool, and to

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
see that, we can see that the charge is different

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
and with or without methods, and

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
also we can show that there's

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
tunneling and wave phenomena here

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and I know

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and lastly, if there's any

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
study group, or

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
want to discuss this, I think

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
it's very helpful to discuss

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
if you have any questions

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
or any questions

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
about this, you can email me

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
yeah, okay

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
is everyone still here?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
okay, still here, so let's

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
first,

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
everyone please turn on the mic

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
to applaud, and thank the audience

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
so now,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
do we have any questions?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
that you want to ask

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
do we have any questions?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
if you have questions,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
just turn on the mic

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
okay

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
okay, I want to ask

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
a question that's not

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
that related

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
I'm curious

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
how long have you been at Intel?

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
about

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
a year

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
so

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
do you need

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
when you're doing these simulations

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
do you need to

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
communicate with the people doing the experiments?

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
some people

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
some people

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
this isn't my Intel work, this is my study group's work

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and Intel

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
yeah, I think

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
they'll communicate with

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
the people doing the experiments

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
for example, they have some data

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
you take this

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
simulation

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
when you're taking these

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
when you're explaining these simulations

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
and communicating with the people doing the experiments

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
do you feel like

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
there's a gap?

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I think there is

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
but I think they'll

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
draw the problem to

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
yeah, it's not

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
if they're looking for you

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
they might think

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
this might be related

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
so for example

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
like

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
when you're doing these simulations

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
when you're discussing with the people doing the experiments

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
can you compare with the people doing the experiments?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
or are there some

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
trends

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
when you're explaining the experiments

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
how do you

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
when you're discussing with the people doing the experiments

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
how do you

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
how do you

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
work with the people doing the experiments?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
it's a bit abstract, I don't know how to explain it

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
for example

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
can you use these tools

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
to explain their data?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
or can you provide

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
based on this data

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
maybe an improved direction

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
is this doable?

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
that kind of feeling

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
sorry, it's a bit abstract

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I think it is

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
let me use Boban as an example

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Boban's project

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
people might say

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
is it because of the recombination

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
causing the current to get smaller or more

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
if you make the defects level

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
bigger or smaller

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
I think it's more of a trend

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
if you increase the defects

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
can you see the curve

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
100% match the experiment data

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
but you might say

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
if this phenomenon

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
more defects, will my recombination rate get bigger or smaller?

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
you can experiment

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
experiment and simulate

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I think a lot of problems

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
are not that

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
you need to model

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
to say it's really this phenomenon

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
you might observe

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
the current getting bigger

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
but you don't know why

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
you might say

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
you can make this adjustment

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
or add stress

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
there are a lot of things you can change

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
in simulation, there are a lot of parameters you can change

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
you might adjust the defects level

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
or adjust

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
all kinds of parameters

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
to confirm

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I think this feedback

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
is quite important

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
to identify

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
if what you said is right

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I think you can verify

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
if it's correct

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
another question

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I know you are talking about

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
what Boban did

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
another question

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
after you joined Intel

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
do you think you are much better than Boban?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I think I'm much better

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I feel

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
much better

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
so actually

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
I think this thing

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
is

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
already

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
considered

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
a simple geometry

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but it can be

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
considered as a real device

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
quantity

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
after you joined

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
you will find

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
there are a lot of differences

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
it's just

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
the research field is different

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I think the form

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
is similar

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
you mostly look at the paper

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
and see what model you can use

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
but I feel

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
in Boban's case

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
the professor tells you

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
what to do

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
it's more specific

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
but in the company

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
it's hard to say

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
I want to say

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I'm also in the TK department

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I'm working at TSMC

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
I actually

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
know a bit about this field

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
but now

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
maybe I shouldn't ask

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
my problem is

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
when I talk to Boban

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
he always says

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
you are right

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
these things

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
need to be discussed

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I feel

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
it's hard

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
I don't know if Intel

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
feels the same

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
different companies

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
might have different

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I won't

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I won't

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
talk to an experimenter

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I might talk to an intermediary

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
it's different

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
any other questions?

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
I want to ask

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
the simulation

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
looks simple

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
and

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
it looks like

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
using Boltzmann's

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
equation can be done

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
even though you need

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
some approximations

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
but

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I'm thinking

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
the advantage of this

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
is it's more effective

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
on more difficult

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
devices

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
but I feel

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
in BTE

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
let's say it's particles

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
if it's particles

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
can you simulate

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
these details?

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
you can't

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
so if it's particles

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
you're missing a lot of details

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
but the result I'm showing

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
is that some drift diffusion

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
is a lot worse

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
some are similar

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
but

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
I mean

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
how do you know your future device

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
when it's particles

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
will you miss

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
some important details

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I think BTE

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
can't be replaced

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
even in this small device

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
you can't say BTE is correct

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
did you say BTE or drift diffusion?

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
drift diffusion

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
you mean

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Monte Carlo solve BTE

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
but even so

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
like interference

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
or tunneling

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
BTE

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
you can't figure it out

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
you need a lot of correction models

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
BTE is how to scatter particles

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
you need to calculate

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
you need to add a lot of calculations

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
but NEG

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
you throw the device in

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
the result is

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
low density of state

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
there's a pattern

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
but BTE can't figure it out

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I see

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
but the pattern you drew

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
is this equilibrium?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
like

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
this is

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
density of state

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
what do you mean?

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
density of state is

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
density of state under equilibrium

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
density of state and

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
is it equilibrium are separate

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
because density of state

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
doesn't have so many states

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
equilibrium means

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
you have a distribution function

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Fermi-Dirac distribution

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
the bottom is 1

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
the top is 0

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
so given this density of state

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
you fill the Fermi-Dirac distribution

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
drift diffusion

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
means any device

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
is Fermi-Dirac

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
let me draw

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
let me see

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
which one is better

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
like this

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
drift diffusion

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
you have a Fermi-Level

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
this is Fermi-Level

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
your distribution is

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
this is 1 and this is 0

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
this is distribution

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
0 to 1

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
any position

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
is bound by Fermi-Level

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Fermi-Level is lower here

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Fermi-Level is lower here

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
my distribution is like this

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
to here

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
there may be some small changes

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
NEG means

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
carrier distribution

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
any place is not necessarily Fermi-Distribution

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
you are very free

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
particle you want to be higher

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
you want to be lower

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
your distribution may be like this

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
not necessarily Fermi-Distribution

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
but now we are bound by contact

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
in the middle of the device

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
is it

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
how much will the distribution change

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
your carrier is from the left

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
your left is Fermi-Distribution

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
right

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
this is Fermi-Distribution

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
but when your carrier

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
travel to here

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
will you change

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
you bounce around

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
bounce here

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
you may not be Fermi-Distribution

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
this is the advantage of NEG

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
you will not be limited by drift diffusion

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
you are bound

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
you have to distribute like this

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
understand

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
ok

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
any more questions

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
if not

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I want to ask the last question

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
you are

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
in the second slide

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
you talked about

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
photon absorption

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
your photon absorption

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
is only in the middle

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
in the middle

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
junction

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
or the whole system

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
is affected by photon

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
this is a toy model

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
so I only hit

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
the green area

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I should be

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
later I will publish another paper

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
but

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I assume

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
only hit a certain area

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
from here to here

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
plus generation rate

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
how do you

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
deal with photon

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
how do you

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
deal with photon

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I didn't simulate photon

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
because of photon

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
the electrons and electrons

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
will run out every second

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
so I didn't simulate photon

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
suppose photon is absorbed

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
one photon

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
you just

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
move it up

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
one photon

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
suppose

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
it moves up

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
so I assume

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
this band gap

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
is 3.2eV

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
or

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I don't know

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
let's say 3eV

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
assume

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
a photon above 3eV

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
comes in

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
you can

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
split carrier hole

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
electron hole pair

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
ok

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
so you assume

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
electron hole pair is split

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
and start

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
simulation

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
ok, got it

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
any questions?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
if not

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
let's thank

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Guan Zhong

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
thank you

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
thank you

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I'll turn off the recording
