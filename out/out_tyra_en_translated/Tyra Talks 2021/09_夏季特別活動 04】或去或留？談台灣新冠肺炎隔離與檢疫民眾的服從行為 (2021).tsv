0	2000	The recording has started.
30000	34000	We even discussed where to go to buy alcohol, masks, etc.
34000	40000	Many of my European friends and classmates laughed at these behaviors.
40000	44000	But to a certain extent, it also shows that Asians, or more specifically,
44000	49000	Taiwanese have a very different response mode to the epidemic than Westerners.
49000	52000	So at Project TIRA's summer event this year,
52000	56000	we specially planned a speech on the COVID-19 epidemic.
56000	61000	We are honored to have Professor Li Xiongwen as our guest speaker.
61000	67000	In 2016, Professor Li graduated from Beka University's School of Mathematics.
67000	71000	He is currently working as an assistant researcher at the Institute of Sociology.
71000	75000	Professor Li's interest spans many different fields.
75000	79000	He is interested in social network analysis,
79000	82000	social conflicts and cooperation in evolution,
82000	85000	and social science quantification.
85000	89000	We can see that Professor Li has a wide range of interests.
89000	97000	We look forward to Professor Li's approach to the COVID-19 issue.
97000	101000	Now I will hand over to Professor Li for his speech.
101000	103000	Thank you, Professor Li.
104000	107000	Thank you for the introduction.
107000	113000	I am very happy to be able to share my research on the TIRA platform.
113000	119000	Let me find my screen.
119000	122000	I don't know if you can see the video.
122000	124000	Can you see it, Professor Li?
124000	126000	Yes, I can see it.
126000	129000	Okay, let's get started.
129000	132000	First of all, I would like to thank Professor Li again for his invitation.
132000	134000	When Professor Li invited me,
134000	141000	he specifically mentioned that he wanted to find the topic of COVID-19 and invited me to give a speech.
141000	144000	Actually, I feel very ashamed.
144000	147000	Although I have done the topic of COVID-19,
147000	151000	I have also collected information related to COVID-19.
151000	153000	I will talk about another topic later.
153000	155000	Today I will talk about the first topic.
155000	157000	I will talk about the second topic later.
157000	161000	However, I am not a disease infectious scientist.
161000	166000	Although Professor Li mentioned that I work in other fields,
166000	169000	this field is not the field I am familiar with.
169000	181000	What we do is more like psychology, public policy, or public health related issues related to disease infection.
181000	183000	This is not the topic I am familiar with.
183000	185000	I am an expert in methodology.
185000	188000	However, this is the first time I have collected data.
188000	192000	This is the first time I have collected data for research since I was a child.
192000	195000	This is data from all over Taiwan.
195000	198000	Of course, the method used is the statistical method.
198000	205000	This is not the method I am familiar with.
205000	211000	This is not the field I am familiar with.
211000	215000	However, since I have collected data, I must have something to say.
215000	223000	I will try my best to present the data I have collected for research.
223000	230000	This is the data from my research team from March to May last year.
230000	232000	If you still have an impression,
232000	238000	At the end of January and February last year, the epidemic of COVID-19 began to break out in Taiwan.
238000	245000	In addition to China, epidemics began to occur around the world in February and March.
245000	251000	The most tense time in Taiwan was from March to May last year.
252000	256000	At that time, we rushed out to collect data.
256000	267000	Our supervisor told us that we should not be locked in our own room and do our own thing.
267000	270000	Because the students of natural science are already very busy.
270000	275000	We also need to go out and collect more data related to COVID-19.
276000	281000	Since the supervisor said, we want to do what our team can do.
281000	284000	We want to do what we can do in this epidemic.
284000	287000	I will introduce what data we rushed out to collect later.
287000	291000	This is the data we collected between March and May last year.
291000	293000	We found some research topics to do.
293000	294000	This is one of them.
294000	296000	What are we studying?
296000	303000	What we are studying is that when the epidemic began, the government of Taiwan will have some corresponding policies.
303000	312000	One of the very special policies is to ask some people who are at risk to stay at home for 14 days for quarantine.
312000	320000	He may not stay at home, but he may be quarantined in a medical institution or a quarantine center or at home for 14 days.
320000	327000	We want to know if he will have the idea of disobedience or resistance during these 14 days.
327000	329000	The idea of wanting to leave quarantine.
329000	334000	What are some of the reasons why these people want to leave quarantine?
334000	337000	This is noncompliance.
337000	340000	This is the focus of the research we want to focus on.
340000	355000	Because we want to say that if we know the reason why he wants to leave the quarantine, we can know which supporting measures the government can provide to make these people more willing to stay in quarantine to help us control the entire epidemic.
356000	359000	This research is done by me and my two assistants.
359000	362000	The first two authors are our two research assistants.
362000	367000	Let's start sharing.
367000	373000	Let's take a look at the latest COVID-19 numbers.
373000	388000	From January last year to August 6 this year, we went to the relevant website of WHO and saw that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world has exceeded 200 million, and the death toll has exceeded more than 4 million.
388000	395000	The number of confirmed cases in Taiwan is 15,000 until August 6 this year, and the death toll is 809.
395000	401000	Taiwan's situation is of course different from other countries around the world.
402000	410000	Between March and May of 2020, the government just mentioned that it was a tense moment.
410000	413000	At that time, the global epidemic began to fever.
413000	420000	Many young people working and studying abroad returned to Taiwan.
420000	424000	At that time, the atmosphere in Taiwan was actually more tense.
424000	429000	At that time, if everyone came back from abroad, would there be a virus?
429000	434000	Because everyone did not do the test, they may come back and there may be some infected people who will explode.
434000	443000	At that time, if you still remember in Taiwan, we were worried about a lot of holidays, such as the annual holiday, and then all kinds of holidays.
443000	446000	I was worried that there would be a large-scale outbreak.
446000	448000	It was at this time last year.
450000	458000	After May, the performance of Taiwan's government began to be very good, and the epidemic was controlled and did not explode.
458000	461000	There have been no local epidemics for 253 consecutive days.
461000	463000	Next, let's look at this graph.
465000	469000	This is a graph of the cumulative confirmed cases and the cumulative death toll in Taiwan.
469000	476000	From January and February of last year to July of this year, the green line is the cumulative confirmed cases.
476000	478000	The cumulative death toll only goes up.
478000	482000	So we see a very small spike.
482000	488000	It was between March and April of last year, and there were still cumulative confirmed cases.
488000	493000	It has been flat since mid-April.
493000	498000	Local confirmed cases began in December of last year.
498000	501000	Taiwan has no local confirmed cases for 253 consecutive days.
501000	505000	There were no local confirmed cases from April of last year to December of last year.
505000	509000	Later, there were local confirmed cases from December of last year to May of this year.
509000	512000	Everyone knows that this is a new wave of epidemic in Taiwan.
512000	517000	However, the outbreak of the new wave of epidemic has also been gradually reduced.
517000	520000	It has now dropped from level 3 to level 2.
520000	524000	In fact, the peak of the outbreak is at the end of May and the beginning of June.
524000	533000	Later, we will also have a new collection of data to share with you.
536000	539000	Let's take a look at the situation in Taiwan.
539000	543000	Taiwan is a very special example that I just shared with you.
543000	546000	Taiwan was very well controlled in the early days.
546000	549000	We are a model god in these countries.
549000	556000	I also saw a lot of articles analyzing the reasons why Taiwan was able to succeed in the early days.
556000	561000	First of all, we have a central government agency that reacts quickly.
561000	564000	This is the Central Epidemic Control Center, CECC.
564000	567000	Of course, we hold press conferences every day to announce timely information.
567000	572000	Then do a lot of effective group distribution, such as mask maps and other materials.
572000	576000	In fact, there is a very fast and transparent information management.
577000	580000	The second is that we have good border control.
580000	587000	No matter who he is, he must be quarantined or quarantined for 14 days before entering Taiwan's borders.
587000	591000	After coming out, you have to track his temperature and see if there is a problem.
591000	595000	If there is no problem, you can go out and exercise freely, and you have to be self-isolated for 7 days.
595000	598000	In fact, this border control is very important.
598000	601000	Another one is to add his later isolation and quarantine.
601000	603000	What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?
603000	608000	Quarantine is if you have been infected, you will be quarantined.
608000	610000	Quarantine conditions are more strict.
610000	617000	If you have the risk of infection, such as your host and the infected person may have met in the same place.
617000	619000	Then you may have to be quarantined.
619000	625000	Quarantine is a lower standard, but it also has to be quarantined for 14 days.
625000	628000	Quarantine is quarantine, and quarantine is isolation.
628000	631000	We also do contact tracing, which is tracking control.
632000	639000	In fact, in many places, we will know how the host of the infected person is going.
639000	644000	You will see the GPS location of his mobile phone, which is to announce his host.
644000	658000	Now we all know that if we go to a public place in Taiwan, we have to send a heavy text message to the central control center to report that we have entered and left that place.
658000	662000	This is a very common example of contact tracing.
662000	667000	Other related measures include social distancing or wearing a mask.
667000	671000	These are all key elements of Taiwan's success.
672000	678000	In this study, we want to focus on two key points.
678000	682000	The first is that we want to look at quarantine and quarantine.
682000	689000	What role did quarantine and quarantine play in the process of controlling the epidemic in Taiwan?
689000	693000	What policy measures are effective?
693000	700000	The second is whether the person who is quarantined or quarantined has the idea of ​​leaving the quarantine area.
700000	705000	What factors make him want to leave this place?
705000	710000	Quarantine is that he has contact with the infected person.
710000	716000	Quarantine is that he may have some contact.
716000	721000	Another quarantine is that if he comes back from abroad, he must quarantine automatically.
724000	727000	As mentioned earlier, Taiwan has done very well in many areas.
727000	729000	The early part has done very well.
729000	734000	One of the things we want to pay attention to is Taiwan's quarantine and quarantine measures.
734000	739000	This measure is actually for those who are at risk.
739000	749000	We want them to stay at home or stay in their designated quarantine place, such as a quarantine hotel, a quarantine hospital, or some quarantine places.
749000	752000	Let him stay there for 14 days.
752000	757000	Of course, these people will have good supplies for 14 days.
757000	765000	The government will know that he is there, and there will be ways to know his location and provide him with sufficient supplies.
765000	780000	From last year, February and March, until now, until July, about 700,000 people have experienced quarantine or quarantine.
780000	785000	Of these, 2,000 cases violated these regulations.
785000	790000	If these regulations are violated, they may be fined up to NT$1 million.
790000	800000	So in fact, in most cases, we see that most Taiwanese people cooperate with this policy.
800000	805000	Of the 700,000 cases, only 2,000 were violated.
805000	808000	But there are still violations. We want to know the reasons for the violations.
808000	818000	Of course, we may not be able to find these violations, but we want to know why the people who have experienced these measures want to leave the quarantine place.
818000	832000	We want to know what role the government plays in this, whether the information it provides is transparent, and whether the supplies it provides to the people in the quarantine place are sufficient.
832000	837000	Will these affect the idea of ​​wanting to stay in the quarantine place or leave the quarantine place?
837000	845000	Next, in fact, all over the world, we face different measures from the government to do different things.
845000	852000	In fact, people in each place will have different levels of obedience and even resistance.
852000	860000	In fact, there are also a lot of large-scale protests abroad that may not obey some of the government's actions.
860000	870000	For example, many countries are protesting that the government should not require the people to wear a mask at any time, or wear a mask when entering the factory.
870000	882000	Or there are even people who think that the government's COVID policy is actually a conspiracy theory, and that the government is trying to suppress the people or restrict the freedom of the people.
882000	889000	So in fact, when the government is doing a lot of relevant measures, it is likely to receive some resistance or rebellion from the people.
889000	898000	We want to know what is the greatest dissatisfaction or greatest pressure on people with the quarantine or quarantine measures alone.
898000	905000	If we want to make these measures more effective, we should pay attention to which aspects.
906000	914000	Of course, this is not the first time that we have done research on isolation or quarantine-related disobedience.
914000	920000	In the past, scholars also did research on different situations.
920000	928000	For example, some different diseases will actually restrict the freedom of residence or action of these infected or at-risk people.
928000	935000	There are different levels. First of all, it is the level of the government. People are concerned about whether the information given by the government is open and transparent.
935000	949000	Since the government restricts me from moving today, the government should let me know whether the government's policy is correct or whether I have the necessity to stay here and whether I have received sufficient information.
950000	957000	Next is the level of the individual. What factors will affect the individual whether he wants to leave the quarantine zone?
957000	969000	In the past, scholars also found that he had financial difficulties. For example, if he can't go out to make money, he may feel difficult to go out after being locked up for 14 days.
969000	980000	Or he thinks he has no social responsibility. After being locked up, he has no benefits. He is only limited to freedom of action, but it is of no help to society.
980000	990000	He may have experienced strong negative emotions, which makes him unable to stay. He feels very bored and uneasy. He must go out and leave this place.
991000	1005000	Or he lacks a lot of opportunities to get in touch with others. He has no interpersonal interaction. Because he may not be able to get in touch with others in the quarantine zone, he can only force others to give him food. He lacks interpersonal interaction and wants to leave.
1005000	1012000	These are the rules that have been found to make people want to stay in a place.
1013000	1026000	During the period of isolation, it will cause some negative emotions to these people. These negative emotions may also lead to him wanting to leave the quarantine zone.
1027000	1036000	Of course, there are many sources of negative emotions. Some of the sources we see in the document are related to leaving the quarantine zone.
1036000	1050000	He may lack some sunshine. Because he is locked up in a place, he may not be able to get sunlight in that place, which may have an impact on his mental health.
1050000	1055000	The next one is the financial difficulties that I just mentioned, which may also have an impact on his negative emotions.
1055000	1064000	Or he may be illiterate. There may be a lot of sources of illiteracy. It may be relatives or very good friends who take care of him.
1064000	1068000	He may think that he is causing trouble to his relatives and friends.
1068000	1077000	Or he may have a bad relationship with his neighbors. For example, if you are quarantined at home and others know that you have come back from abroad to work or study, you may have a different view of your family.
1077000	1079000	This may cause his own pressure.
1079000	1088000	Or a stranger may be illiterate to a group of people. For example, why do these people who work abroad and study abroad have to return to Taiwan within a few days?
1088000	1093000	Or why do these people who work abroad and study abroad have to return to Taiwan within a few days?
1093000	1098000	It may be the illiteracy of strangers that causes his negative emotions.
1098000	1108000	Or some self-evaluation of oneself. I may cause trouble to others. I shouldn't do this. This will also increase negative emotions.
1108000	1117000	Or some information given by the government is incomplete or inconsistent. This may also have an impact on negative emotions.
1117000	1126000	We will see if this negative emotion is an intermediary variable, that is, whether a person wants to leave the quarantine area.
1126000	1132000	Because it is related to other variables, the negative emotion itself is a big variable.
1132000	1141000	We want to analyze a set of systems to see if the negative emotion project is an intermediary variable for a person who wants to leave the quarantine area.
1141000	1147000	Of course, the intermediary variable is the statistics. You have to see that a lot of things are X that affect Y.
1148000	1152000	The negative emotion is an intermediary variable, let's call it M.
1152000	1157000	A lot of things are directly affected from X to Y, and then X will affect M to Y.
1157000	1163000	We want to see how much M, the intermediary variable of this negative emotion, accounts for.
1164000	1169000	Next, let's talk about how we collect information.
1169000	1188000	In March and May of last year, when the epidemic in Taiwan was relatively tense, when students and young people from overseas returned to Taiwan, we began to set up a website called epidemic prevention diary.
1188000	1193000	We collect several types of information from everyone.
1193000	1199000	The first one is that they want to tell us who they are in contact with every day.
1199000	1206000	This information lasts for more than a month, from March to May.
1206000	1209000	They want to tell us who they are in contact with every day.
1209000	1212000	Next, he will let us know how he feels every day.
1212000	1216000	We recruit people on the Internet. There are two types of people.
1217000	1219000	Here is the timetable.
1219000	1220000	There are two types.
1220000	1225000	The first one is quarantine or quarantine.
1225000	1229000	How do we know if he is in quarantine or quarantine?
1229000	1234000	The government will give him a home quarantine or home quarantine notice.
1234000	1241000	If you are a person who has been diagnosed or you are a person who has returned from abroad, the government will give you a home quarantine notice.
1242000	1245000	Participants have to take this notice and send it to us.
1245000	1248000	Then our people will check it manually and see if there is no problem.
1248000	1249000	It is not fake.
1249000	1251000	We will let him come in and join our quarantine group.
1251000	1255000	The quarantine group is the first day he is in quarantine or quarantine.
1255000	1257000	He is in quarantine or quarantine.
1257000	1261000	We will let him participate in our research as a quarantiner.
1261000	1267000	The other group is the people who have not experienced quarantine or quarantine.
1267000	1271000	When he participates, he does not have the identity of quarantine or quarantine.
1271000	1274000	He can also sign up for our survey.
1274000	1276000	The survey is very similar.
1276000	1280000	At the beginning, when he joined our research, he had a pre-survey.
1280000	1287000	He said that he was at this time, March 30 or April 2, his current state.
1287000	1290000	The person in quarantine is currently in quarantine.
1290000	1292000	This is where he is different.
1293000	1300000	The next 30 days, he will let us know who he contacted and who he contacted every day.
1300000	1306000	Then there are some moods in his daily life or how much time he spends doing what.
1306000	1309000	How is the time allocation of daily life?
1309000	1311000	You will see some related questions later.
1311000	1315000	We will give him a follow-up when the investigation is over.
1316000	1320000	When the quarantine is over, we will give him a questionnaire.
1320000	1322000	This is the questionnaire after the quarantine.
1322000	1331000	If he participated in this research on the 7th, he will fill out a questionnaire on the 14th.
1331000	1336000	This is a screenshot of our website.
1336000	1339000	This part is what I just said.
1339000	1344000	We want these participants to record who they interact with every day.
1344000	1348000	He has to establish the interaction between me and Zhang Yanping.
1348000	1351000	Our interaction is on the Internet.
1351000	1355000	I have to write down who initiated it and how long it took.
1355000	1356000	Did I get it?
1356000	1358000	How do I feel?
1358000	1360000	Did we get specific emotions?
1360000	1362000	Get information, etc.
1362000	1364000	We call this contact.
1364000	1366000	You can think of it as an interaction.
1366000	1369000	The daily interaction should be recorded on this platform.
1369000	1373000	The other part is the part of life that I just talked about.
1373000	1375000	Is there a cool body temperature?
1375000	1376000	Did you let the sun bask into the house?
1376000	1377000	Do you feel lonely?
1377000	1382000	How long does it take to work, study, have fun, socialize, etc.
1382000	1385000	Some daily life-related questions.
1385000	1390000	Of course, we also give some subsidies or rewards.
1391000	1394000	They can participate in this study.
1394000	1397000	If it meets our standards, we will send him a gift certificate.
1397000	1399000	Let them draw.
1399000	1402000	They are willing to participate in this activity.
1402000	1405000	It is worth noting that we are recruited on the Internet.
1405000	1409000	We are recruited on Facebook, LINE, and some websites.
1410000	1421000	We can see that the people we recruit are relatively young.
1421000	1428000	You can see that the group on the left who has not experienced isolation is on average 33 years old.
1428000	1433000	The group that is undergoing isolation is on average 28.3 years old.
1433000	1436000	It is a relatively young group.
1437000	1440000	But this is also the result we expect.
1440000	1446000	In fact, this group of people, especially those who are isolated, are mostly from abroad.
1446000	1448000	Like studying abroad or working abroad.
1448000	1450000	This group of people is relatively young.
1450000	1452000	We also expect this situation.
1452000	1456000	And young people use the Internet more.
1456000	1459000	So the people we recruit on the Internet are mostly young people.
1459000	1463000	This group of people are mostly women.
1463000	1465000	The women accounted for about 70%.
1465000	1467000	The men accounted for more than 20%.
1467000	1471000	Since they are young, most of them are unmarried.
1471000	1474000	And the group of people who are undergoing isolation.
1474000	1477000	Because they are younger and more unmarried.
1477000	1480000	Most of them live in big cities.
1480000	1483000	There are a total of 158 people who have not been isolated.
1483000	1487000	There are about 140 people who are undergoing isolation.
1487000	1491000	The information we are sharing now is the group of people who are undergoing isolation.
1491000	1497000	That is to say, the first day of his study, he is in isolation.
1497000	1500000	He may be isolated after 7 days or 5 days.
1500000	1505000	Then he has to do the remaining 25 days or the remaining 21 days of this questionnaire.
1505000	1507000	He will do another questionnaire after the end.
1507000	1512000	What we are discussing is the group of people who are undergoing isolation on the first day.
1512000	1514000	This is a total of 140 people.
1515000	1519000	What are some of the changes that we care about?
1519000	1524000	Is it related to his idea of ​​leaving the isolation area?
1524000	1532000	First of all, he thinks that his own isolation or isolation restrictions are helpful to society.
1532000	1535000	Does he think his social responsibility is high?
1535000	1537000	Does he think he is helpful?
1537000	1541000	Next is whether the government's relevant information is sufficient.
1541000	1543000	This is what we measure every day.
1543000	1545000	Repeat means measuring every day.
1545000	1549000	We will measure the number of contacts or interactions with him every day.
1549000	1553000	Of course, our interaction does not necessarily refer to face-to-face interaction.
1553000	1556000	It may be network interaction, it may be voice, it may be text.
1556000	1558000	He can record it all.
1558000	1561000	We record whether he blames himself.
1561000	1566000	We also investigate their quality of life.
1566000	1573000	Here we use the WHO's quality of life, which is a simplified version of the 26-point version.
1573000	1576000	It is divided into four aspects in total.
1576000	1580000	We put it all into physiology, psychology, society and the environment.
1580000	1583000	Next, we measure his negative emotions.
1583000	1585000	Ask if you are in a good mood today.
1585000	1587000	Did you feel negative emotions?
1587000	1588000	How strong?
1588000	1591000	Next, did you let the sun shine into your home?
1591000	1597000	Or ask him how many people are quarantined every day.
1597000	1600000	How many people want to leave the quarantine area every day?
1600000	1602000	We will see how to ask this question later.
1602000	1610000	It depends on the negative evaluation of oneself, the degree of anonymity, and the degree of financial difficulties he has experienced.
1610000	1614000	Next is some preliminary analysis.
1615000	1629000	We can see that among the 140 people who are quarantined, their quality of life is compared to the long-term model.
1629000	1633000	The long-term model is that we use the same questionnaire to measure other people in Taiwan.
1633000	1635000	This is called the long-term model.
1635000	1642000	Is there any difference between these people and those who are quarantined or quarantined when we found this group?
1643000	1650000	This group of people who are being quarantined or quarantined may be in a bad situation on the first day.
1650000	1654000	Maybe just got off the plane or just came back from abroad, everything is in a hurry.
1654000	1658000	His physiological quality is relatively low.
1658000	1660000	We see that he is prominent.
1660000	1663000	His P is very small, less than 10 to the negative 4.
1663000	1664000	He is negative.
1664000	1666000	He is lower than the long-term model.
1666000	1670000	The psychological aspect is also lower than the long-term model.
1671000	1673000	This is also prominent.
1673000	1676000	In terms of the quality of life in the environment, this is not prominent.
1676000	1681000	They are prominent in social relations.
1681000	1683000	Because his P is also less than 10 to the negative 4.
1683000	1685000	He is higher than the long-term model.
1685000	1694000	So this group of people, on the first day of the study, their physiology and psychology are worse than the long-term model.
1694000	1698000	But they have better social relations.
1700000	1703000	We have asked three questions.
1703000	1711000	The first day of the study, the end of the quarantine, and the end of the study.
1711000	1713000	The end of the study is the 31st day.
1713000	1714000	We want to see his changes.
1714000	1721000	What we are looking at now is the first day of the study and the day of the end of the study.
1721000	1725000	Which of his various changes is significantly different?
1726000	1728000	This group of people is the isolation group.
1728000	1734000	They believe that their isolation is helpful to society.
1734000	1737000	They are significantly reduced in social responsibility.
1737000	1739000	What we put here is significant.
1739000	1740000	He is significantly reduced.
1740000	1747000	This group of people believes that their isolation is not helpful to society.
1748000	1750000	The second group of people is significant.
1750000	1755000	They believe that the transparency of government information has increased.
1755000	1757000	This is significant.
1757000	1761000	They believe that the transparency of government information is high.
1761000	1766000	This group of people is significantly reduced from the beginning to the end.
1766000	1769000	The third group of people is significant.
1769000	1775000	The number of people in contact every day from the beginning to the end is relatively low.
1776000	1777000	Sorry.
1777000	1780000	It was relatively low at the beginning, but it was higher at the end.
1780000	1787000	At the beginning of the study, the number of people in contact with him was less.
1787000	1792000	At the end, after the 30th day, he was free to socialize outside.
1792000	1796000	So the number of people in contact at that time was significantly higher.
1798000	1800000	Let's look at some of the issues we are concerned about.
1800000	1804000	First of all, what variables will affect the behavior of these people who do not obey?
1804000	1807000	Next is the negative emotion.
1807000	1810000	Does it play a role as an intermediary variable?
1810000	1814000	Will it also affect the behavior of those who do not obey?
1817000	1822000	First of all, let's look at what our self-variable and one-variable are.
1822000	1828000	The dependent variable we want to look at is how much he wants to leave the isolation.
1828000	1831000	These people are asked every day.
1831000	1835000	He is asked every day during the isolation period that if you want to leave the isolation today.
1835000	1837000	If there is, how strong is the degree?
1837000	1838000	We ask every day.
1838000	1842000	So we have a total of 734 pieces of information.
1842000	1846000	Because not everyone has 14 days in our research.
1846000	1848000	He may be the 8th day to join the study.
1848000	1852000	He only has 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 days of information.
1852000	1854000	We ask every day of isolation.
1854000	1857000	If it is the first day to join, there will be 14 days of information.
1857000	1861000	So we have a total of 734 pieces of information.
1861000	1868000	Of these 734 pieces of information, there are 278 pieces that say they don't want to leave the isolation at all.
1868000	1871000	278 is a little bit.
1871000	1873000	77 is normal.
1873000	1875000	Next is very strong.
1875000	1877000	Next is very strong.
1877000	1878000	Next is very strong.
1878000	1879000	Very strong is 18.
1879000	1882000	So we do different things for this.
1882000	1886000	We know that he is not very strong.
1886000	1888000	There is no majority at all.
1888000	1891000	There is no majority at all.
1891000	1893000	There is no majority at all.
1893000	1897000	Then we will analyze which reasons make him want to leave the isolation.
1897000	1901000	Then we use the Multi-Level Ordinal Logistic Regression Model.
1901000	1903000	In fact, it is Multi-Level.
1903000	1906000	Multi-Level is that our first layer is every day.
1906000	1908000	The second layer is everyone.
1908000	1909000	This is Multi-Level.
1909000	1912000	The variance of his normal model is 8.5.
1912000	1914000	Then we use the Random Intercept Model.
1914000	1919000	Ordinal is because his Y is a sequence.
1919000	1921000	It is from very small to very small.
1921000	1924000	We use this return model.
1924000	1928000	Ok, let's see which variables are for this.
1928000	1929000	Want to leave the isolation.
1929000	1934000	First of all, we see that the conclusion is that there is no male.
1934000	1937000	His attitude, his coefficient is negative.
1937000	1939000	Then he shows that we only put it today.
1939000	1942000	He is showing that he does not want to leave the isolation.
1942000	1947000	In this study, the male is more obedient.
1947000	1950000	That is, his idea of ​​leaving the isolation is smaller than that of women.
1950000	1954000	Next is Negative Emotion.
1954000	1955000	This is also a high value.
1955000	1960000	The higher the negative emotion he experiences, the more he wants to leave the isolation.
1960000	1964000	Next is how many days he is in isolation.
1964000	1966000	This is N-State, which is how many days.
1966000	1971000	The higher the number of days, the closer he leaves.
1971000	1973000	The closer he wants to leave, the more he wants to leave.
1973000	1976000	The 13th and 14th days are the most wanted to leave.
1976000	1981000	The more time he is in isolation, the more he wants to leave.
1981000	1983000	This is positive.
1983000	1987000	The higher the level of dehumanization he experiences, the more he wants to leave.
1987000	1989000	This dehumanization is positive.
1989000	1993000	Next is social responsibility decline.
1993000	1997000	He thinks that his isolation is more and more unhelpful to society.
1997000	1999000	The more he wants to leave.
1999000	2001000	Daily contact is negative.
2001000	2005000	The more the daily contact declines, the more he wants to leave the isolation.
2005000	2009000	This is where we put all the variables at the beginning of the model.
2009000	2015000	We got some information from the Multi-Level Ordinological Regression.
2015000	2018000	Next is Mediation Analysis.
2018000	2020000	We look at negative emotions.
2020000	2025000	How many variables will it absorb?
2025000	2033000	We put all these variables into the model to see how much negative emotions can be absorbed.
2033000	2038000	Of course, we use the Perl model.
2038000	2042000	We can see that it will divide the variables into several effects.
2042000	2044000	Direct Effect and Indirect Effect.
2044000	2050000	Which will pass directly from X to Y, not through the intermediate variable M.
2050000	2053000	The intermediate variable here is negative emotion M.
2053000	2060000	Indirect will pass through negative emotion from X to Y.
2060000	2063000	We did some analysis.
2063000	2065000	Here are some conclusions.
2065000	2067000	Let me give you an example.
2067000	2069000	Dehumanization.
2069000	2071000	Dehumanization can be divided into three groups.
2071000	2073000	Weak, medium and strong.
2073000	2075000	Let's look at one of them.
2075000	2077000	Strong.
2077000	2079000	Total effect is positive.
2079000	2081000	Positive 4.71.
2081000	2088000	The stronger the dehumanized emotion, the more it wants to leave the quarantine.
2088000	2090000	The intermediate variable is direct.
2090000	2093000	Direct is 83.9%.
2093000	2095000	From X to Y.
2095000	2099000	From strong dehumanization to Y wanting to leave the quarantine.
2099000	2101000	The direct effect is 83%.
2101000	2109000	The indirect effect is that these strong dehumanized emotions to negative emotions are about 13%.
2109000	2112000	So we can look at the path in this way.
2112000	2116000	How many variables will pass through the intermediate variable negative emotion?
2116000	2120000	Which will directly affect from X to Y?
2120000	2122000	We have discussed the following.
2122000	2128000	Let's summarize the discovery of this topic.
2128000	2131000	What factors will affect these people?
2131000	2133000	Want to leave the quarantine?
2133000	2137000	Like dehumanization or people you meet every day.
2137000	2140000	The fewer people you meet, the more you want to leave the quarantine.
2140000	2142000	The more people like this, the more you want to leave the quarantine.
2142000	2147000	As the number of quarantine days increases, the more you want to leave the quarantine.
2147000	2149000	Maybe it's because you can't stand it anymore.
2149000	2151000	I've been quarantined for too long.
2151000	2153000	The more you want to leave, the more you want to leave.
2153000	2159000	He feels that his own isolation has no effect on the community.
2159000	2163000	The more he wants to leave, the more negative emotions he experiences, the more he wants to leave.
2163000	2168000	What are the factors that cause negative emotions?
2168000	2173000	Self-accusation or negative evaluation
2173000	2177000	Dehumanization of the outside world
2177000	2181000	We found that the dehumanization from strangers is the most serious.
2181000	2184000	Or he experienced some financial difficulties.
2184000	2186000	It will cause more negative emotions.
2186000	2190000	Negative emotions indirectly affect this.
2191000	2195000	The idea of wanting to leave the quarantine
2195000	2198000	We also have some extended conclusions.
2198000	2202000	Some aspects that the government can consider
2202000	2206000	First of all, the government should pay more attention to these people.
2206000	2209000	He was quarantined or disinfected.
2209000	2213000	How is his psychological state?
2213000	2217000	We care about whether he is short of supplies.
2217000	2222000	Is there anyone who cares enough about him?
2222000	2228000	We want to let him know that his psychological state is something that the government should know and care about.
2228000	2232000	Public health personnel should know every day whether he has experienced a lot of pressure.
2232000	2242000	Try to eliminate the possibility of dehumanization in society.
2242000	2251000	Dehumanization from relatives, friends, and strangers
2251000	2253000	This is very serious for them.
2253000	2255000	They may want to leave the quarantine.
2255000	2257000	Therefore, there will be a lot of negative emotions.
2258000	2263000	Next, we should strengthen the social responsibility of these people.
2263000	2272000	He can protect more people from the harm of the disease.
2272000	2282000	The stronger the social responsibility, the easier it is for these people to stay in quarantine or quarantine.
2282000	2286000	The more he doesn't want to leave, the stronger the sense of social responsibility.
2286000	2291000	What are the restrictions on this study?
2291000	2295000	The first restriction is the way we recruit.
2295000	2301000	These people are recruited by social media, such as Facebook and LINE.
2301000	2306000	In fact, their information is relatively sufficient.
2306000	2308000	He is a relatively online user.
2308000	2310000	He is a young group.
2310000	2315000	They are also a very equal group.
2315000	2321000	They are young and about 90% of them came back from abroad.
2321000	2324000	They are a very equal group.
2324000	2329000	Most of the people they participate in are women.
2329000	2333000	This is a very special part of our sample.
2334000	2339000	The main topic we want to introduce just finished.
2339000	2345000	I want to spend a little time to introduce the other information we received.
2345000	2352000	This is an article I wrote on my website.
2352000	2354000	It's more like a science journal article.
2354000	2357000	He said that the social impact of COVID-19 is cross-national analysis and comparison.
2358000	2367000	This is a global cross-national survey we did from September 2020 to the end of May this year.
2367000	2371000	It is different from the Taiwan survey from March to May.
2371000	2375000	The Taiwan survey from March to May is a one-month research.
2375000	2379000	He is looking for two groups of people, people who are isolated and people who are not isolated.
2379000	2381000	We asked him to write a one-month journal separately.
2381000	2388000	This cross-national study is a global survey.
2388000	2395000	There are 12 languages ​​in this survey.
2395000	2399000	We want participants to be able to do three surveys.
2399000	2401000	One survey will take 90 days.
2401000	2407000	In other words, if a person wrote in September last year, he received an email in December last year.
2407000	2411000	In April this year, he received an email and filled out three surveys.
2411000	2415000	The questions we ask are very similar.
2415000	2420000	We also ask about contact, mood, and whether or not we have contacted the patient.
2420000	2423000	We also ask about their quality of life and their political attitude.
2423000	2428000	If you are interested, you can look at the science journal article on my website.
2429000	2437000	The organizer invited me to talk about some issues related to COVID-19.
2437000	2441000	I will share the latest research here.
2441000	2444000	However, we have not sorted it out yet, so we can only talk about it.
2444000	2448000	We were very lucky during the collection period.
2448000	2452000	From September last year to the end of May this year,
2453000	2460000	In fact, in Taiwan, there is a very good research topic.
2460000	2467000	From September last year to May this year, Taiwan did not have any local cases from September last year to December.
2467000	2470000	Local cases began in December.
2470000	2477000	However, in mid-May this year, the local epidemic began to break out.
2477000	2484000	As you can see in this picture, after Mother's Day in May, the national level 2 alert was issued.
2484000	2486000	On May 15, the level 3 alert was issued.
2486000	2489000	On May 19, the national level 3 alert was issued.
2489000	2492000	The peak was probably at the end of May.
2492000	2494000	That is, at the beginning of June at the end of May.
2494000	2500000	Our data in Taiwan is actually very satisfactory to the government.
2500000	2505000	There was no epidemic until the end of May.
2505000	2509000	At the end of May, everyone was actually very nervous.
2509000	2513000	We felt that the epidemic was about to break out, and we did not know how dangerous it was.
2513000	2519000	We only knew that there were hundreds of people every day, and the number of deaths was constantly increasing.
2519000	2523000	We have a question that can be shared today.
2523000	2529000	If you can get the vaccine, will you get the vaccine?
2529000	2533000	There are more than 1,700 people in Taiwan who answer this question.
2533000	2536000	There are three options for more than 1,700 people to answer.
2536000	2538000	The first is that I will not get the vaccine.
2538000	2540000	The second is that I may or may not.
2540000	2542000	The third is that I will definitely get the vaccine.
2542000	2547000	In fact, we asked this question from March to May.
2547000	2550000	We can see a very obvious change.
2550000	2556000	That is, before mid-May, before the level 3 alert began, everyone did not want to get the vaccine.
2556000	2564000	Even though the Delta virus was already very serious at that time, it was already very serious in India and other countries.
2564000	2568000	But in Taiwan, you can't see the will of people who want to get the vaccine.
2568000	2578000	In addition, this model also shows that Taiwan does not particularly want to get the vaccine, at least in Shuangbei.
2578000	2582000	We know that this virus spread from Shuangbei.
2583000	2587000	But people in Shuangbei don't want to get the vaccine.
2587000	2588000	What does it tell us?
2588000	2590000	It tells us that you are in the same island.
2590000	2593000	You are in Taidong and Taipei.
2593000	2595000	In fact, the will of people who want to get the vaccine is the same.
2595000	2600000	What factors will affect the will of people who want to get the vaccine?
2600000	2602000	We can take a look here.
2602000	2612000	For example, if you often go to crowded places, or if you are sick, you will let the public health personnel know your situation.
2612000	2616000	This means that people with a high awareness of public health will want to get the vaccine.
2616000	2623000	It is believed that the government can use information technology to track people's whereabouts.
2623000	2626000	The stronger the government's control, the more people will want to get the vaccine.
2627000	2633000	It is believed that the government can use information technology to track people's whereabouts.
2633000	2637000	People who use information technology to track people's whereabouts because of the epidemic will not want to get the vaccine.
2637000	2642000	This may be more against the government.
2642000	2647000	The more people you think the government gives you enough support, the more you want to get the vaccine.
2647000	2649000	The more you believe the government will want to get the vaccine.
2649000	2658000	The more you worry that fake news related to vaccines will cause harm, the more you want to get the vaccine.
2658000	2664000	O is openness, which is the openness of the personality test in psychology.
2664000	2668000	The more open your personality is, the more you want to get the vaccine.
2668000	2671000	This is also related to quality of life.
2671000	2677000	The higher your physical health, the more you want to get the vaccine.
2678000	2681000	This is also related to quality of life.
2681000	2685000	The higher your physical health, the more you want to get the vaccine.
2685000	2687000	Social relationships are negative.
2687000	2689000	We observe that this is a repressive phenomenon.
2689000	2693000	It is not so related to Y.
2693000	2695000	So it may be a model performance.
2695000	2701000	The more you worry about the physiological effect of the vaccine, the less you want to get the vaccine.
2701000	2705000	The more you think the vaccine is troublesome, the less you want to get the vaccine.
2706000	2708000	These are what we think are more reasonable.
2708000	2714000	Another study related to literature is that men want to get the vaccine more.
2714000	2718000	This may be a study we did in March and May.
2718000	2722000	At that time, Taiwan had a lot of information.
2722000	2726000	Because most of the vaccine discussion at that time was AZ.
2726000	2729000	AZ may have more side effects on young women.
2729000	2733000	Our source is young people.
2733000	2735000	So I found that men want to get the vaccine more.
2735000	2737000	This may be one of the possible reasons.
2737000	2741000	People over the age of 30 will want to get the vaccine more.
2741000	2743000	This is also reasonable.
2743000	2749000	The more you want to get the vaccine, the more you want to get the vaccine.
2749000	2751000	This is what we found.
2751000	2753000	What factors make people want to get the vaccine?
2753000	2757000	This is the result we found in the past 1-2 weeks.
2757000	2760000	Because we have been collecting and organizing data until now.
2760000	2762000	Start doing some analysis.
2762000	2767000	This is a small conclusion I want to share with you.
2767000	2768000	A small result.
2768000	2771000	It has nothing to do with the topic of today's speech.
2771000	2774000	This is another COVID-19-related survey we did.
2774000	2777000	I will share it here for the time being.
2777000	2778000	Thank you all.
2778000	2780000	See if you have any further questions.
2780000	2781000	We can all discuss here.
2781000	2782000	Thank you.
2782000	2786000	Thank you for the wonderful speech.
2786000	2789000	Now we are in Q&A time.
2790000	2795000	I saw a question on the chat room.
2795000	2799000	William, can you turn on your microphone and ask a question?
2799000	2800000	If you are still here.
2808000	2811000	Okay, he may not be here for the time being.
2811000	2813000	Let me repeat his question.
2814000	2824000	William asked how to avoid survivorship virus in this way.
2824000	2830000	People who can resist the distance may avoid traveling at the beginning.
2830000	2834000	This may be a participant's question.
2835000	2839000	Can you repeat the second question?
2839000	2842000	What kind of people will avoid traveling?
2842000	2845000	He may be the first question.
2845000	2849000	He is just talking about whether this participant is possible.
2849000	2852000	Some people are more resistant to isolation.
2852000	2859000	It is easier for him to avoid traveling.
2860000	2864000	Thank you for your question.
2864000	2872000	Of course, we have a lot of limitations in this study.
2872000	2878000	He mentioned the survival bias.
2878000	2884000	Of course, I don't think we have a lot of evidence.
2885000	2891000	I don't think we can avoid it.
2891000	2895000	It depends on whether you can avoid it or not.
2895000	2903000	We recruited this group of people because they are interested in this.
2903000	2905000	He is willing to participate.
2905000	2910000	These people have also experienced traveling.
2910000	2915000	Because we are looking for Taiwanese people.
2915000	2918000	He must be Taiwanese.
2918000	2920000	He can't be a foreigner.
2920000	2924000	Some people are afraid of COVID-19.
2924000	2929000	If isolation or quarantine affects him, he will not return to Taiwan.
2929000	2933000	This group of people were not in the range of our survivors at the beginning.
2933000	2938000	He must return to Taiwan to participate in this survey.
2938000	2942000	If he returns to Taiwan, he will be quarantined or quarantined before he can participate in the survey.
2942000	2945000	So we don't have this information.
2945000	2950000	If he wants to avoid traveling, what will he do?
2950000	2955000	If he wants to avoid traveling, he will not enter our survey subjects.
2955000	2961000	Of course, he will not face 14 days of isolation or quarantine.
2961000	2963000	Because they wanted to avoid traveling at the beginning.
2963000	2965000	He will not experience 14 days of isolation or quarantine.
2966000	2972000	So this is a bit out of our scope.
2972000	2974000	We can't handle it, we can't know.
2974000	2978000	We can only know which factors will affect him.
2978000	2981000	Because he was quarantined and quarantined, he wanted to leave.
2981000	2985000	So those who want to avoid this matter are not in our research range.
2996000	3001000	Yes, I also think this question is actually quite difficult to answer.
3001000	3004000	I don't know if William's answer just now
3004000	3007000	is in line with the information William wants to get.
3007000	3011000	If you want to continue to explain, you can look at the microphone
3011000	3013000	and ask these questions in depth.
3013000	3017000	I don't know if there are any other audience members who want to ask questions.
3019000	3021000	Hello, I'm Yiting.
3021000	3026000	I'm doing a post-doctoral research at the University of Taiwan.
3026000	3031000	We are also doing research related to COVID-19.
3031000	3035000	Our source of data is a safe zone in Taiwan.
3035000	3039000	We also saw some people who were quarantined
3039000	3043000	and called this safe zone for psychological support.
3043000	3049000	But because our sample wanted to get a group of people who were at higher risk of suicide.
3049000	3054000	Later, we did not include too many people in the group of people at higher risk of suicide.
3054000	3059000	But this group of people often mentioned financial stress.
3059000	3063000	I just saw that in your presentation, you also mentioned that
3063000	3069000	one of the factors that will lead to negative emotions is financial difficulties.
3069000	3071000	I would like to ask about the details.
3071000	3074000	In this project, usually in quarantine,
3074000	3077000	because it sounds like they are a group of younger people who came back from abroad.
3077000	3079000	They may be students or workers.
3079000	3084000	What kind of financial difficulties are they facing?
3084000	3086000	Or how do you ask this question?
3086000	3089000	This is my question. Thank you.
3089000	3091000	Thank you for Yiting's question.
3091000	3096000	Our question is, do you feel any pressure on finance?
3096000	3100000	Will finance give you any pressure?
3100000	3103000	From very little to very much.
3103000	3106000	We usually ask for a five-point chart.
3106000	3110000	Of course, we did not go into the details of what financial pressure is.
3110000	3114000	We think that since financial pressure will affect negative emotions,
3114000	3118000	it may be that he is working overseas,
3118000	3120000	he may leave his job,
3120000	3123000	or he knows that he is coming to Taiwan,
3123000	3126000	it will be difficult for him to continue his original job.
3126000	3131000	This kind of pressure affects his negative emotions and makes him want to leave.
3131000	3134000	Because we found that negative emotions are a big influence,
3134000	3136000	it makes him want to leave the idea of quarantine.
3136000	3141000	This anxiety and uneasiness can directly contribute to this negative emotion,
3141000	3144000	and it will affect him to want to leave the idea of quarantine.
3144000	3146000	We did not ask,
3146000	3151000	but the situation you can imagine should be that it will affect his work.
3151000	3153000	Because it should be okay to stay as a student.
3153000	3156000	Of course, we did not cross-compare.
3156000	3158000	Because of the restrictions on information,
3158000	3162000	we are not sure if he is a student or not.
3162000	3164000	He is still a working person.
3164000	3166000	We do not know.
3166000	3169000	But we know that the people who came back at that time were these two kinds of people.
3169000	3171000	Working overseas or studying abroad.
3171000	3176000	We found that this is one of the factors.
3176000	3180000	It may be similar to your research.
3180000	3187000	We are sure that these people are in quarantine or quarantine when researching and investigating.
3187000	3193000	Because some of our samples are completely in line with what I just described.
3193000	3195000	He is working abroad.
3195000	3198000	Because we are the information that comes to the store,
3198000	3201000	so it is a more straightforward organization analysis.
3201000	3203000	There are more specific mentions in it.
3203000	3206000	For example, his original job development,
3206000	3211000	Or maybe he used to do business in China or other countries.
3211000	3213000	After he suddenly returned to Taiwan,
3213000	3216000	he said that his dental development seemed to be interrupted.
3216000	3220000	Or the business is really bad.
3220000	3221000	So it doesn't matter.
3221000	3226000	It sounds like he subjectively believes that he has some economic pressure.
3226000	3228000	But in this questionnaire,
3228000	3232000	there may not be a more detailed part to understand his deep situation.
3232000	3235000	I think this is a good comment.
3235000	3239000	In fact, this is also limited to the source of our information.
3239000	3246000	We know that many people who are quarantined or quarantined do not necessarily come back from abroad.
3246000	3254000	After that, many people have been in contact with the confirmed person or have been in contact with the confirmed person.
3254000	3256000	He went to some places.
3256000	3259000	He may be locally, but he did not go abroad.
3259000	3261000	He may be affected by his work.
3261000	3263000	He can't go out to work.
3264000	3267000	There are no such people in the information we receive.
3267000	3269000	This is a pity.
3269000	3273000	Most of these people came back from abroad in their 90s.
3273000	3276000	So it may not be the same as yours.
3276000	3282000	However, the common point is that financial pressure is a big reason for negative emotions.
3284000	3286000	Sorry, I'll share it at the end.
3286000	3288000	It's about stigmatization.
3288000	3291000	We also have a very specific view of those who are really quarantined from abroad.
3291000	3295000	He complained that his neighbor put a label on him.
3295000	3297000	His family did not support him.
3297000	3301000	This really caused him a lot of anxiety and anger.
3301000	3303000	Some sense of hopelessness.
3303000	3306000	So I think from what the teacher just shared,
3306000	3309000	I think there are a lot of things that we see in another research.
3309000	3311000	We can echo each other.
3311000	3313000	Thank you very much for your presentation today.
3313000	3315000	Thank you.
3316000	3320000	In fact, if this can be done,
3320000	3324000	In fact, we can also do some direct and quantitative research.
3324000	3329000	My colleagues are also doing related research.
3329000	3332000	For example, Mr. Zenfanzi on hand.
3332000	3334000	He does medical sociology.
3334000	3338000	He may visit some people who are quarantined or quarantined.
3338000	3341000	Will he experience some stigmatization?
3341000	3344000	Or do you need any related resources?
3344000	3347000	If we can identify on quantification,
3347000	3351000	What are the reasons for the negative emotions of these people?
3351000	3353000	Or the reason for wanting to leave the quarantine.
3353000	3357000	The interview on quantification will be able to ask questions about these reasons.
3357000	3363000	This can supplement a lot of aspects that we can't see in the data.
3363000	3366000	So I think it should be possible to do more complete research.
3366000	3368000	That is to look at the follow-up.
3368000	3370000	This may be just the beginning.
3371000	3375000	I just mentioned that we
3375000	3378000	Sorry, I don't need to look for that information.
3378000	3383000	From January and February last year to July this year,
3383000	3388000	There are already 700,000 people who have experienced quarantine or quarantine.
3388000	3391000	In fact, there are 23 million people in Taiwan.
3391000	3393000	In fact, 700,000 people are already a lot.
3393000	3397000	About 3% of people have experienced 14 days of quarantine or quarantine.
3397000	3400000	A lot of people have experienced this.
3400000	3404000	Our research also hopes to find out what kind of pressure these people experience.
3404000	3406000	What kind of help can the government give?
3406000	3408000	What kind of help can the society give?
3408000	3410000	Stigmatization is definitely a big one.
3410000	3414000	Because the stigmatization he experienced is significantly higher.
3414000	3417000	We also found that the most people came from strangers.
3417000	3420000	Compared to relatives and friends, compared to acquaintances,
3420000	3423000	The stigmatization of strangers is the highest.
3424000	3426000	Got it. Thank you.
3426000	3428000	Thank you.
3429000	3431000	Thank you, teachers and audience.
3431000	3434000	I don't know if I can take 5 to 10 more minutes from you.
3434000	3437000	Because our voting time was originally around 11 o'clock.
3437000	3439000	But I don't know if I can take 5 to 10 more minutes from the teacher.
3439000	3446000	Because I see that the audience seems to have a problem with Pan Haoren and Yanping.
3447000	3450000	No problem. We don't have a time limit.
3450000	3452000	Thank you, teacher.
3452000	3454000	No problem.
3455000	3461000	Let me invite Pan Haoren to ask the question first.
3461000	3462000	Thank you.
3462000	3464000	Can you hear me?
3464000	3465000	Yes.
3465000	3466000	Thank you.
3466000	3467000	Thank you, teacher.
3467000	3469000	My question is this.
3469000	3475000	Because most of this research was conducted last year.
3475000	3479000	This year, after the outbreak of the epidemic in Taiwan,
3479000	3485000	Now, in terms of double-digit, it is about 1 to 2 digits per day.
3485000	3498000	After this outbreak, the public sentiment in Taiwan may be a little different from last year.
3498000	3503000	For example, last year, everyone thought that there could not be a single N5.
3503000	3506000	As long as there is a single N5, it is a very bad situation.
3507000	3514000	But this year, until today, there are still some new cases in double-digit.
3514000	3519000	But people may not feel that panic.
3519000	3521000	I would like to ask the teacher,
3521000	3528000	In this different time and space between last year and this year,
3528000	3537000	What impact will it have on the non-compliance behavior of home isolationists or their source of pressure?
3537000	3540000	Thank you.
3540000	3542000	Is this the question?
3542000	3544000	Yes, thank you.
3544000	3547000	I want to think about it.
3547000	3550000	In fact, what I am doing now is a prediction.
3550000	3552000	Because I don't have this information.
3552000	3555000	Thank you Haoren for your question.
3555000	3559000	We only have information from March to May of last year.
3559000	3563000	Then quarantine or quarantine people.
3563000	3566000	Because this information is from May of last year.
3566000	3569000	Then we did another wave of research is the world.
3569000	3576000	Then we may have this information, but we have not analyzed it yet.
3576000	3582000	Because in the second piece of information I just mentioned, we actually asked if he was in isolation.
3583000	3586000	He has some people in isolation, but very few.
3586000	3589000	At that time, we just found very few people.
3589000	3592000	We found very few people in isolation.
3592000	3594000	I remember only a few.
3594000	3598000	So can you analyze a good conclusion?
3598000	3599000	I don't know.
3599000	3600000	I don't know about my information.
3600000	3602000	Unless there is a relevant study.
3603000	3608000	Looking for people who are in isolation or quarantine from May to July this year.
3608000	3612000	His negative mood or he wants to leave the idea of isolation.
3612000	3616000	Otherwise, we actually can't know this thing.
3616000	3619000	Then I want to turn around and ask what you think will be different.
3619000	3622000	Because in fact, I also need to think about it.
3622000	3624000	Because I can only say that we don't have this information.
3624000	3626000	I only have information from March to May of last year.
3626000	3629000	I only have a few people in this year's information.
3629000	3632000	We haven't actually analyzed the data of these people.
3632000	3634000	And what conclusions can a few people come up with?
3634000	3636000	We are also very conservative.
3636000	3640000	Do you think there will be any different results?
3640000	3644000	Is it just for these people who want to leave the isolation or the negative emotions of these people?
3644000	3652000	My personal guess is because the teacher just mentioned that there was a lot of isolation in the survey last year.
3653000	3657000	The source of the isolation may come from relatives and friends around them.
3657000	3659000	Or even some unknown neighbors.
3659000	3661000	Some pressure.
3661000	3667000	For example, the situation in Shuangbei or some more serious situations before the epidemic.
3667000	3671000	From a situation that has broken out.
3671000	3679000	So far, it has been slowed down to a phenomenon that should be controlled.
3679000	3691000	I'm wondering if people are more afraid of being isolated at home.
3691000	3702000	If so, the pressure from external public opinion may be reduced.
3702000	3707000	But I'm not sure if there will be such a situation.
3707000	3724000	After all, from last year's situation, I feel that as long as there is any local case, everyone will put the alert to the highest level.
3724000	3730000	I don't think there will be such a strong reaction now.
3730000	3734000	Thank you for your comment.
3734000	3736000	I think it makes sense.
3736000	3741000	If it is July or August, the degree of isolation may be smaller.
3741000	3749000	For example, many department stores or public transportation may not be able to work or work together.
3749000	3759000	At that time, if there is a collective diagnosis, it should be said that the diagnosis in the workplace should be smaller.
3759000	3761000	Because it's not voluntary.
3762000	3767000	But another type may be at the beginning of May or the middle of May.
3767000	3780000	For example, those who were found in some entertainment venues in Wanhua District may be highly insensitive to isolation or quarantine.
3780000	3786000	It may be different now, but we also have to think about the impact of other factors.
3786000	3791000	For example, the degree of satisfaction with the government in other aspects.
3791000	3793000	For example, there is no way to get a vaccine.
3793000	3795000	Because at that time, the vaccine was not a topic.
3795000	3804000	Now we can say that the number of vaccines and the proportion of vaccines is the key to this disease.
3804000	3806000	The key to fighting this disease.
3806000	3808000	There may be another issue now.
3809000	3814000	The two data are very different.
3814000	3817000	Last year's government satisfaction was very high.
3817000	3823000	When we received this group of people from March to May last year, their government satisfaction was very high.
3823000	3827000	They think that the information given by the government is very transparent and they support the government.
3827000	3833000	But this year, in May, the government satisfaction was not so high because of the sudden outbreak.
3833000	3837000	I believe that the government satisfaction should have dropped from May to July.
3837000	3842000	At that time, we don't know how much it will affect their emotions.
3842000	3847000	But this is very complicated.
3847000	3853000	I hope there will be related research on the isolation or quarantine from May to July.
3853000	3855000	But I don't know if there is.
3855000	3859000	Thank you.
3860000	3862000	Thank you.
3862000	3864000	I will ask Yen-Ping to ask the last question.
3864000	3867000	After Yen-Ping asks the question, I will stop recording.
3867000	3869000	Then everyone can ask questions more freely.
3869000	3871000	So I will give it to Yen-Ping first.
3871000	3876000	My question is as short as the conversation window above.
3876000	3884000	I want to ask what kind of negative emotions do you distinguish when you talk about negative emotions?
3884000	3886000	Like depression, anxiety, anger, sadness.
3886000	3888000	These should be different emotions.
3889000	3891000	Thank you.
3891000	3897000	I know that Yen-Ping is studying emotions, so I can't talk nonsense.
3897000	3901000	We have given him a list of depression.
3901000	3906000	They made a list of depression at the end of the isolation.
3906000	3912000	We asked him why he wanted to leave the isolation.
3912000	3914000	There are two reasons.
3914000	3916000	One is anxiety.
3916000	3918000	The other is negative emotions.
3918000	3920000	We don't distinguish too much.
3920000	3922000	Anxiety is there.
3922000	3924000	We have a list of depression.
3924000	3928000	But the list of depression is not in this list.
3928000	3933000	Of course it's all negative emotions.
3933000	3939000	But the list of depression was made after the isolation.
3939000	3943000	So there is a distinction, but there is no depression in its variables.
3943000	3951000	So in summary, the negative emotions are not so detailed.
3951000	3955000	But we have the degree of depression, but it is not in this model.
3955000	3964000	We think of it as a negative emotion of the acute stress syndrome.
3964000	3968000	This result is there, but not in this model.
3968000	3972000	Since Yen-Ping has raised a question, he should thank Yen-Ping.
3972000	3976000	Because the question of sunshine was raised by Yen-Ping.
3976000	3979000	Did these people experience sunshine?
3979000	3982000	Of course, whether or not you have experienced sunshine may affect negative emotions.
3982000	3984000	We found this later.
3984000	3988000	In another survey, I also found that sunshine is a very important variable.
3988000	3995000	For the sense of time, do these people know the current situation?
3995000	3997000	It also has a lot of decisive impact.
3997000	4004000	Sorry, I can only say that negative emotions are not so different.
4004000	4007000	But we have information, but it is not used in this model.
4008000	4013000	When I asked this question, I wanted to answer it after Yen-Ping.
4013000	4016000	Because I think that without Yen-Ping,
4016000	4026000	Yen-Ping's data may have this part of the analysis.
4026000	4028000	I don't know if you can communicate.
4028000	4032000	Although Yen-Ping's data is closer to real-life data,
4032000	4034000	because it is a secure brick line,
4034000	4036000	but it can do some coding.
4036000	4039000	The reason why I ask this question is because
4039000	4043000	sometimes people who are depressed lose their energy.
4043000	4046000	So he doesn't want to run away.
4046000	4049000	He thinks he should just die in his room.
4049000	4050000	But he won't run away.
4050000	4052000	What kind of person will run away?
4052000	4055000	If you have been in contact with me before, don't be scared.
4055000	4061000	There was a person in our community who was supposed to be quarantined at home.
4062000	4064000	He shouted in the hall, saying,
4064000	4066000	why is it me? I can't run away.
4066000	4068000	He was very angry and wanted to go out.
4068000	4070000	The police came.
4070000	4073000	It seems that people who are angry are easier to run away.
4073000	4074000	But people who are depressed don't seem to be.
4074000	4078000	So there seems to be a little difference between negative emotions.
4078000	4079000	My feeling is like this.
4079000	4082000	Some people even feel that they are invisible.
4082000	4084000	Even positive emotions.
4084000	4086000	But this kind of person will run away.
4086000	4088000	But if you are a very peaceful person,
4088000	4091000	I don't feel like I'm quarantining at home.
4091000	4092000	Then this kind of person won't run away.
4092000	4096000	So it doesn't seem to be just positive and negative.
4096000	4099000	It seems to have a lot to do with what kind of emotion.
4099000	4102000	I don't know my intuition.
4102000	4105000	Okay, I think it's a very good suggestion.
4105000	4108000	Let's go back and analyze this more.
4108000	4110000	I totally agree.
4110000	4113000	Because we also asked
4113000	4117000	In fact, there are also these questions in the depression table.
4117000	4119000	Do you think existence is meaningless?
4119000	4121000	I believe most of those people
4121000	4123000	I don't think I want to do anything.
4123000	4124000	Leave this matter
4124000	4126000	I just want to end my life.
4126000	4129000	There are indeed many different negative emotions.
4129000	4132000	Then we will explain it again.
4132000	4135000	But if we only talk about negative emotions,
4135000	4140000	It seems a bit too big.
4140000	4143000	Maybe I need to explain more.
4143000	4146000	Sorry, I can add here.
4146000	4147000	Are you Yiting?
4147000	4148000	Yes, I am Yiting.
4148000	4151000	I am now
4151000	4154000	My current mentor is doing suicide research.
4154000	4156000	So all of our data analysis
4156000	4158000	He is all focused on
4158000	4162000	He may be informed by some suicide-related theories.
4162000	4163000	So we are indeed
4163000	4166000	Psychological response related to suicide
4166000	4168000	Even in the process of coding
4168000	4170000	Can find six
4170000	4173000	Especially it will trigger the idea of ​​suicide
4173000	4176000	For example, he wants to feel hopeless.
4176000	4178000	He wants to feel insolvent.
4178000	4180000	Then his low mood may be just one of them.
4180000	4183000	I think it's just that we don't particularly
4183000	4185000	Because the purpose of the time when we were fishing
4185000	4187000	It's not to become a quarantiner or a non-quarantiner.
4187000	4189000	But that is to say, we don't have
4189000	4191000	We don't have this kind of analysis at the moment.
4191000	4193000	But like what Yanping mentioned just now
4193000	4194000	I think
4194000	4197000	In fact, in the data we have obtained
4197000	4201000	In fact, it is possible to put a group of us
4201000	4204000	We mark it on the identity label
4204000	4207000	Is it a quarantine or a quarantiner?
4207000	4210000	Then go to understand that the content of their call
4210000	4212000	Usually ask some of that
4212000	4214000	Just treat it as a 1922 question
4214000	4216000	In addition to that kind of question
4216000	4219000	In fact, there will be quite a lot of emotional parts.
4219000	4221000	We have mentioned that we have
4221000	4223000	We have seen that it is
4223000	4226000	It's not a very systematic analysis now.
4226000	4228000	It's just that when I read these diaries
4228000	4229000	I will hear that kind of
4229000	4232000	He may not be satisfied with his health needs.
4232000	4234000	For example, he needs to see a doctor.
4234000	4236000	He needs to get the medicine.
4236000	4238000	Then he may think
4238000	4239000	Or I think I am pregnant.
4239000	4241000	Then I want to find my current doctor to check.
4241000	4243000	Then these things may cause them to want to
4243000	4245000	Make a call
4245000	4247000	Is to release their heart
4247000	4249000	This feeling of wanting to leave but not leaving
4249000	4251000	This feeling of being trapped
4251000	4253000	But we haven't done a very systematic analysis yet.
4253000	4255000	So maybe this thing is quite interesting.
4255000	4258000	I can go back and discuss it with my mentor.
4258000	4260000	I think maybe it's an interesting topic.
4260000	4263000	In the psychological health part of the quarantine interpreter
4265000	4267000	I also want to ask Yiting
4267000	4269000	Is this information of Anxin special line
4269000	4271000	Are you still collecting?
4271000	4272000	What we currently have
4272000	4274000	In fact, it is also a bit similar.
4274000	4275000	Is that we are
4275000	4277000	What we are analyzing now is last year.
4277000	4280000	Uh, from the end of January to the end of May
4280000	4282000	Because Taiwan's first confirmed case
4282000	4284000	It seems to be January 23rd or 22nd.
4284000	4286000	Then our information is from that day
4286000	4287000	After a day
4287000	4288000	Start
4288000	4289000	Uh, until the end of May
4289000	4290000	Because in May
4290000	4291000	In fact, Taiwan was almost
4291000	4292000	There is no confirmed case.
4292000	4294000	Then this year we have
4294000	4296000	Consider that this wave of this year
4296000	4298000	Do we want to get it again?
4298000	4299000	But this is not yet
4299000	4300000	There is no conclusion like this.
4300000	4302000	But we have this question now.
4302000	4303000	Indeed, it is limited to last year.
4303000	4305000	When the first wave of Taiwan broke out
4305000	4307000	understand
4307000	4310000	Did they mention that contact?
4310000	4313000	Because we found that the more people we contact
4313000	4315000	The more people we contact
4315000	4317000	The more people he wants to leave
4317000	4319000	I don't know this
4319000	4321000	Because the nature of the security line is
4321000	4323000	Yes, because it is a bit like a
4323000	4325000	Secondary data analysis
4325000	4327000	Because we can't take the initiative to ask
4327000	4328000	Hey, which of our anti-corruption
4328000	4330000	Take the initiative to understand what the problems are
4330000	4332000	He is more of a messenger
4332000	4334000	He is willing to follow this
4334000	4335000	Uh, counselor
4335000	4337000	What is the content of this volunteer?
4337000	4338000	What can we hear
4338000	4339000	So this is a use
4339000	4341000	A restriction on the security line
4341000	4343000	Of course it is
4343000	4344000	Uh, yes, so he can't
4344000	4346000	As long as this person did not take the initiative to mention
4346000	4347000	We can't ask
4347000	4349000	There are quite a few people in it
4349000	4351000	Uh, say
4351000	4352000	His
4352000	4353000	I think
4353000	4355000	Hey, his social support is reduced
4355000	4356000	Even if we now
4356000	4358000	Analyze these 60 people
4358000	4359000	They have a higher suicide rate
4359000	4360000	They are
4360000	4361000	Uh, no
4361000	4363000	None of them are quarantined
4363000	4365000	But everyone generally still feels
4365000	4367000	From the end of January to the end of May last year
4367000	4368000	During this period
4368000	4370000	Even in Taiwan
4370000	4371000	Not very, very serious
4371000	4373000	But everyone has some anxiety
4373000	4374000	Everyone still thinks
4374000	4375000	Oh, at that time
4375000	4377000	Uh, social support seems to be reduced
4377000	4379000	Then I also feel some of my own
4379000	4380000	Uh, freedom of life
4380000	4382000	It seems to have some restrictions
4382000	4384000	Um, but we can't go
4384000	4386000	Analyze in detail
4386000	4388000	How many people are he in contact with
4388000	4390000	Thank you
4390000	4391000	That one
4391000	4393000	I know your analysis
4393000	4394000	Please say
4394000	4396000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry
4396000	4398000	I just wanted to respond to the issue
4398000	4400000	That is to say, I know your
4400000	4402000	Uh, the way of analysis may be
4402000	4404000	Then read first
4404000	4405000	Then do coding
4405000	4407000	Then, but there is a way
4407000	4409000	Uh, you can also refer to it
4409000	4411000	There is nothing to do
4411000	4413000	I put it on the dialogue box
4413000	4415000	It is a more like
4415000	4417000	Like uh
4417000	4419000	Is natural language processing
4419000	4421000	You just let the city scan these
4421000	4423000	If you have a text
4423000	4425000	Then he will give these text
4425000	4427000	Make some labels
4427000	4429000	Oh, then I put this thing on
4429000	4431000	It is quite common in psychology
4431000	4433000	Then I know this thing
4433000	4435000	This thing is called look
4435000	4437000	Then I know in the eyes of computer science
4437000	4439000	This is very
4439000	4441000	Basically the same as the tools of primitive people
4441000	4443000	They are newer
4443000	4445000	But what I mean is
4445000	4447000	Maybe in this way
4447000	4449000	You can explore it first
4449000	4451000	Because we
4451000	4453000	Uh, because I actually
4453000	4455000	We have a lot of other cooperators
4455000	4457000	Then we also have some
4457000	4459000	As far as I know, there are some
4459000	4461000	Researchers, they also use
4461000	4463000	For example, computer science
4463000	4465000	In the field of computer science
4465000	4467000	Then explain to us some
4467000	4469000	What is it like
4469000	4471000	Natural language learning and so on
4471000	4473000	To analyze the content of this teacher
4473000	4475000	Then we do have some
4475000	4477000	But for the epidemic
4477000	4479000	It doesn't seem to have accumulated so much
4479000	4481000	Is that we
4481000	4483000	After all, he has a lot of power
4483000	4485000	He may have tens of thousands of power in the next few months
4485000	4487000	So we have to start with this power
4487000	4489000	To have a meaningful analysis
4489000	4491000	Also in line with our research
4491000	4493000	Then we go back to the main text
4493000	4495000	So if it's during the epidemic
4495000	4497000	Our main text seems not to be able to do
4497000	4499000	This thing or I don't know
4499000	4501000	Maybe this thing you just put on
4501000	4503000	L I W C this thing
4503000	4505000	Uh, we can do it in 60 minutes
4505000	4507000	I don't know his
4507000	4509000	How much information does it take
4509000	4511000	To do this
4511000	4513000	60 minutes I think you can try
4513000	4515000	Um, but
4515000	4517000	It doesn't matter if it's long or short
4517000	4519000	It doesn't matter
4519000	4521000	You can try it
4521000	4523000	At most it is not
4523000	4525000	Hahaha
4525000	4527000	Because I know our other
4527000	4529000	Other members of the other team
4529000	4531000	They are just analyzing other things
4531000	4533000	Then they did
4533000	4535000	This kind of natural language learning
4535000	4537000	In general this way
4537000	4539000	For example, uh, the instructor
4539000	4541000	With the user
4541000	4543000	The analysis of the user
4543000	4545000	And there should have been some before
4545000	4547000	For example, oh, maybe it's for people with depression
4547000	4549000	Which words are they more likely to use
4549000	4551000	That's what they use
4551000	4553000	For example, people with schizophrenia
4553000	4555000	Which words are more likely to use
4555000	4557000	These studies seem to be ongoing
4557000	4559000	It's just that I'm with this one
4559000	4561000	I learned it this year
4561000	4563000	It's just a very preliminary exposure
4563000	4565000	So I'm not very familiar with it
4565000	4567000	But I can imagine maybe we have something now
4567000	4569000	It seems
4569000	4571000	Also
4571000	4573000	Uh, just use this method to analyze
4573000	4575000	Take a look, but we're stuck right now
4575000	4577000	It's not particularly stuck in the analysis
4577000	4579000	Because it's actually fast to read the text
4579000	4581000	It's the process of erasing the text
4581000	4583000	It's more time-consuming
4583000	4585000	Ok
4585000	4587000	Hey, I'm done
4587000	4589000	Hey, I'll leave it to you
4589000	4591000	In fact, we also have these people
4591000	4593000	The narrative of the text is that we
4593000	4595000	At the end of the collection of data
4595000	4597000	That day we have
4597000	4599000	Let these people review
4599000	4601000	Just this month
4601000	4603000	Related to the epidemic
4603000	4605000	What he wants to say to us
4605000	4607000	Some of the things he's been through
4607000	4609000	Or something that impressed him
4609000	4611000	We actually have one
4611000	4613000	Uh, if you just talked about this
4613000	4615000	Liwc
4615000	4617000	If this thing can be done
4617000	4619000	We don't have a system to look at
4619000	4621000	Because there are no experts in text processing
4621000	4623000	But maybe I think it's classification
4623000	4625000	Just
4625000	4627000	One question is
4627000	4629000	In my eyes
4629000	4631000	Did he experience isolation or isolation
4631000	4633000	This may be possible
4633000	4635000	He mentioned this thing
4635000	4637000	I think the judgment rate may be quite high
4637000	4639000	Maybe the next step is to ask
4639000	4641000	Uh, how high is his negative emotion
4641000	4643000	Because these are also
4643000	4645000	There are sets that can be used to see how negative the words he uses
4645000	4647000	Does he have any risks
4647000	4649000	These may all be done
4649000	4651000	But I think it's a pretty good direction
4651000	4653000	It's just that I don't have the data
4653000	4655000	But maybe I need to think about it
4655000	4657000	If psychology already has these
4657000	4659000	Tools
4659000	4661000	Then we should try
4661000	4663000	Ok
4663000	4665000	I don't know if there are any more
4665000	4667000	Thank you, Yanping
4667000	4669000	If I suggest
4669000	4671000	I'll stop recording first
4671000	4673000	Then let everyone ask
4673000	4675000	Okay, then I'll pause
4675000	4677000	To record
