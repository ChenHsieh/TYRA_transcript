00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Welcome everyone to today's Taira Talk. Today is December 11th.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
We are very welcome to invite today's speaker, Chen Junjia.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Junjia is a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
He has a Ph.D. in atoms and molecules.

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
He is currently working on a Ph.D. in light spectroscopy.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
Junjia, if I interrupt you and ask you a question, is that okay?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
No problem.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay, let's get started.

00:55.000 --> 01:06.000
First of all, let's welcome Junjia with a round of applause.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Junjia, we'll give you the microphone.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, no problem.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Thank you Jason. Hello everyone, I'm Chen Junjia.

01:14.000 --> 01:25.000
What I'm going to talk about today is an experiment that was carried out in the experiment team of Florian Schreck in the Netherlands.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
We carried out the first series of Bose-Einstein condensation.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
You can think of it as the first so-called series of radio waves.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
In today's talk, first of all, I would like to introduce our experiment team.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
My laser pointer is my PI.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
One of our experiments is the Atom Laser Project.

01:54.000 --> 02:05.000
In addition, we also have the Molecule Cooling Experiment and the Tweezer Experiment.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
This is my outline.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
First of all, I would like to briefly introduce what is Bose-Einstein Condensation.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Why is this thing interesting?

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Where is the interesting part?

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
And why do we want to make it a series?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Next, I will introduce our experiment team.

02:28.000 --> 02:39.000
The two main points are that we take different experiments in our experiment method.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
To find a way to achieve the so-called series of some cooling systems.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Finally, achieve a series of Bose-Einstein condensation.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
In effect, it is a material wave laser.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Next, I will give some future outlook.

02:56.000 --> 03:08.000
Bose-Einstein condensation is a theory proposed by Einstein based on Bose.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Identical bosons will undergo a phase change under very low temperature conditions.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
In the end, you can understand it.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
Once I have reached very low temperature conditions in the experiment.

03:29.000 --> 03:38.000
All my atoms will start to behave like waves.

03:38.000 --> 03:48.000
In the end, all my atoms will behave like waves.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It is coherent.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
You can think of it as a material wave condition.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
The conditions for material waves are contrasted with temperature.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
The lower the temperature, the longer the wave length.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
In the end, a huge material wave will form.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
This is an animation.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I stole it from the Internet.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
As you can see, in the process of cooling.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
The uniform material wave length of a single atom is getting bigger and bigger.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
In the end, after reaching the condition of condensation.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
It enters the process of phase change.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
All the condensation of the population of atoms is suddenly transferred to the ground state.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It is a bit like this behavior.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Because it is a material wave.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
In the experiment, we can also demonstrate that two groups of material waves interfere.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
This is an interference experiment in 1997.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Two groups of atoms interact or interfere.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
You can see some interference.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Why is it interesting?

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Because of the so-called huge material wave in the experiment.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
You can think of it as the wave function written in quantum mechanics.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
There is a group of atoms today.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The function is the wave function.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
You can take this group of atoms to do simulation.

05:28.000 --> 05:39.000
You can write down some interesting Hamiltonian models.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Then you can use BEC or Einstein's integral to simulate these models.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Then observe some corresponding physics.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
There is also the use of BEC in the experiment to do the experiment of atomic interference.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
For quantum information researchers, there is an interesting practice.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
In the experiment, you first realize BEC.

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
Then let it do a phase change process.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
In the optical lattice, the process of phase change.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
You can realize single-site occupation in the optical lattice.

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
That is to say, each of the optical lattice populates an atom.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
You can do it through BEC.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
Of course, this is just one of the methods.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
The conditions for reaching BEC are relative.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
The temperature is actually quite important.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
The reason is that you have to meet the corresponding phase space density.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
That is to say, the density of the atomic group is almost the same as the wave length of the atom.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
In the experiment, you have to reach a very low temperature.

07:06.000 --> 07:15.000
Many substances have already formed molecules under low temperature conditions.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
In the experiment, you have to reach it in a thin atomic gas.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The thin atomic gas has a corresponding atomic density.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
The atomic density is to prevent the formation of molecules.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
That is to say, there is a time constant of molecule decay.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
You want to realize it in the thin gas.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
The corresponding temperature is relatively low.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
In the BEC experiment, the corresponding temperature is usually hundreds to tens of nano Kelvin.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
Since the 1980s, people have been interested in BEC.

07:55.000 --> 08:04.000
The first proposal is to see the state of BEC in the thin atom.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
At first, the thin atom is more suitable for such experiments.

08:08.000 --> 08:19.000
But later, other experimental teams used the method of laser cooling to form the Bose-Einstein condensation on the EA group elements.

08:19.000 --> 08:26.000
In 1995, the Bose-Einstein condensation was formed on the EA group elements.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Gradually, many atoms also achieved Bose-Einstein condensation.

08:30.000 --> 08:43.000
In 2009, our experimental team realized the Bose-Einstein condensation of the thin atom.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
In 2013, we realized a technology called laser cooling to BEC.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
I will introduce it in the next video.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
Since it has the corresponding experimental difficulty, it was realized in 1995.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
Six years later, three physicists won the Nobel Prize.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
The interesting thing about it is that it is a material wave.

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
You can understand that it has a corresponding one-to-one relationship with the laser.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
First of all, you can know that there is a cavity in the laser.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
After pumping the laser light into the GaN medium in the middle,

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
a stimulated emission is generated and the light is outcoupled.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
In fact, it corresponds to a similar physical condition in BEC.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
My trap is an atom cavity.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
Pumping means that I need a new atom to come in.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.000
Once the density reaches the conditions of the space density I just mentioned,

09:55.000 --> 10:04.000
my Bose-Einstein scattering will cause my atoms to have a tendency towards ground-state populate.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
It is a material wave version of the equivalent laser.

10:11.000 --> 10:21.000
If my laser light can be outcoupled from the cavity, it is a laser.

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
My ultimate goal is to mix this BEC material in the cavity and form a so-called atomic laser.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
How to make this thing work with the laser light?

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
In other words, the ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous material wave laser.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
All the corresponding physical mechanisms,

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
such as pumping and stimulated emission,

10:53.000 --> 11:01.000
must be able to achieve a continuous mechanism in the experiment.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
So our ultimate goal is to achieve a continuous atomic laser.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
The continuous Bose-Einstein condensation is just a temporary goal.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
But its effect is already completed.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
If my laser light is not outcoupled from the cavity,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
it is the continuous Bose-Einstein condensation that we have achieved so far.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
As long as the atom is not outcoupled from the cavity,

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
our claim is that we have achieved a continuous material wave laser.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
But we did not outcouple this material wave from the cavity.

11:41.000 --> 11:51.000
The interesting thing is that the laser version has been realized in the same year.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
But the material wave laser has not been made since it was realized in 1995.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What are the benefits of continuous?

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
First of all, its brightness is relatively high.

12:05.000 --> 12:15.000
Because it is continuous, the divergence of the laser is relatively small.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
This is mainly due to the continuous relationship of the laser.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
The continuous laser light has a stable phase.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
If you are outcoupling the laser,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
because you are outcoupling the laser,

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
your phase may be interrupted.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
In other words, it does not have a continuous phase.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
However, the continuous laser light provides a stable phase.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.000
Therefore, in terms of experiments, we also hope to achieve a continuous material wave laser.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Let's look back at the laser.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
The first thing we need to satisfy is population inversion and stimulated emission.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
These two physical conditions provide you a magnification plus coherence.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
In other words, your phase is satisfied by the stimulated emission mechanism.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
In the magnification process, your phase is copied.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
Therefore, the phase before magnification is a coherent condition.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
In the material wave version, the phase space density must be high enough.

13:29.000 --> 13:38.000
First, I must rely on a mechanism similar to the stimulated scattering to achieve a magnification process.

13:39.000 --> 13:46.000
In terms of experiments, the development process is to do the laser cooling first,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
then do the stimulated emission cooling, and then achieve the stimulated scattering.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
The laser cooling first provides you a high enough phase space density.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Then, after the stimulated emission cooling,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
because the phase space density is high enough,

14:00.000 --> 14:15.000
the laser cooling mechanism will heat up the atoms.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
At the next stage, I will do the stimulated emission cooling to achieve the stimulated scattering.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
In the end, all the atoms will populate the ground state to achieve the wave 33.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
In the experiment, when doing the stimulated emission cooling,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
we usually turn off the laser cooling,

14:33.000 --> 14:50.000
so that all the atoms will not be stimulated by the near-detuned light.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Therefore, we turn off the laser cooling.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
In the experiment, after the first stage of laser cooling,

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
the stimulated emission cooling will turn off the laser cooling,

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
and then further achieve the wave 33.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
If you think about it carefully,

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
the laser cooling and the stimulated emission cooling are two things that cannot be done at the same time.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
Because the laser cooling still has a way to stimulate the atoms,

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
so I have to do the stimulated emission cooling after the laser cooling.

15:27.000 --> 15:41.000
Next, I will introduce how to achieve the wave 33 in the experiment.

15:41.000 --> 15:48.000
In the experiment, there are two stages of laser cooling.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
The first point is the laser cooling in the second stage.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
The width of the wire is very narrow.

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
In the experiment, we can achieve the temperature of 1 microKelvin in the second stage of laser cooling.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
We invented a mechanism called transparency.

16:10.000 --> 16:20.000
We can use this transparency to prevent the atoms from seeing the laser cooling light.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
How do we do it in the experiment?

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
First of all, after the atoms have finished the laser cooling,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
they will be trapped in a microwave.

16:31.000 --> 16:40.000
In principle, the laser cooling light can achieve the laser cooling in the microwave.

16:40.000 --> 16:50.000
However, the atoms can still see the laser light.

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
However, today I introduced a light to address the excited state

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
and a higher excited state.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
The mechanism introduces a so-called stark shift,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
which may affect the connection of the excited state.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
In space, it's like letting the atoms in the middle

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
because of the transparency beam,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
the excited state is moved.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
You can imagine that there is a light in the middle,

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
but because the excited state has a stark shift,

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
it shifts far away.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
In principle, the atoms in the middle can't see the light on the beam.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
In the experiment, you can think about the two photos I took here.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
The one in the middle is the one without the transparency beam.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
I used this light to absorb the image.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
In principle, the atoms can see this light,

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
so I can calculate the atom distribution on the corresponding equation.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Once I hit the transparency beam,

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
the atoms in the middle can't see this light.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
When I analyze it, it can't see the light,

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
so it doesn't absorb my light.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
So it feels like there is no atom there.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
In fact, what happened was that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
because of the transparency beam,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
my excited state's energy shifted,

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
and the atoms in the middle couldn't see my light.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
By doing this, we found that

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
we can achieve BC conditions in the experiment.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
So we combined three experimental advantages.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
The first advantage is that there are two stages of laser cooling.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Interestingly, the temperature of the second stage of laser cooling

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
can reach very low temperatures.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
In the experiment, we added a very deep microscope

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
with a dipole trap in the middle

19:02.000 --> 19:07.000
to increase the density in the middle to a very high level.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
In the experiment, we added this transparency beam

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
to make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser cooling light.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
In the experiment,

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
we added a reservoir next to it

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
where I can continue to do my laser cooling.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
But in the middle,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I can make the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
The atoms interact with the surrounding laser cooling conditions,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
so the temperature can continue to reach very low.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
But in the middle,

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
because of the transparency beam,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
the atoms in the middle can't see my laser light.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
They can experience the process of image transformation

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
without being affected by the laser cooling mechanism.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
In the experiment,

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
we can skip the step of evaporation and cooling.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Okay, please go ahead.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Can I ask a question?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Can I go back to the page?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Okay.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Is Dimple Trick the same as the Transparent Beam?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
No.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Dimple Trick is a different beam.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
For example,

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
the wavelength is 1064 nanometers.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
The high power to form this Dimple Trap

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
is called the dimple trap.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Dimple Trap is formed by light.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
For example,

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
this part of the reservoir is a parallel focused light.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
The dimple in the middle is focused in a vertical direction.

20:45.000 --> 20:54.000
The dimple trap is formed in the intersection of the two.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
Dimple Trap is the laser light added in a vertical direction.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
The laser light makes the dimple trap deeper.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
The corresponding effect is that

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
the density of the atom is increased in that position.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
What about Transparent Beam?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm sorry.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
What is the intersection of 1064?

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
It doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
The reason is that

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
it doesn't correspond to the intersection transition.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Its function is not to drive a transition.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Its function is to

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
through this

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
dimple trap.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Because it doesn't correspond to any transition,

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
the high power is similar to the mechanism of light.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
It induces the dimple trap

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
in the space where the laser is focused.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
It induces the dimple trap

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
in the space where the laser is focused.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
The point is that you need high power.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
The laser light does not correspond to any

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
atoms' intersection transition.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
So, in practice,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
it is like a mechanism of

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
the dimple trap.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I see.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
The reason why Transparent Beam exists is that

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
it corresponds to

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
the condition of light

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
from one excited state to another.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
So, in practice, it can

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
make my original excited state

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
produce a star shift.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
In practice, we can now

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
omit the phase of evaporating cooling.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Next, we need to

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
find a way to

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
produce these cooling mechanisms

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
simultaneously in practice.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
As you can see,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
my Transparent Beam looks like this.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
The left side is the oven heated to 600°C.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
The atoms will come out.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
The first phase is Zeeman Slower.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
The next phase is Blue Motte.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
After Blue Motte,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
the atoms will fall down

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
to the chamber below

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
to produce Red Motte.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
In practice, the chamber design

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
looks like this.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
So, all the steps of laser cooling

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
are essentially

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
realized simultaneously

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
in different positions in space.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
So, the atoms go through

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
my laser cooling

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
using this wave length.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Then, they will go downstairs

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
to see the second phase of laser cooling.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So, this is the concept of the experiment.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Next, we will

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
make a concept map

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
for the experiment.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
The highlight here is

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
the experiment chamber below.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
All the laser cooling

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
using the narrow line width

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
is realized in this chamber.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
In the first phase,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
I can use

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
the wide line width laser beam

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
to produce 2D Motte.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
The atoms will continue

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
to go down to the chamber below

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
to produce the second phase

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
of wide line width Motte.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
After Motte,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Motte will be loaded into Dipole Trap.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Then, we will

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
measure the corresponding

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
properties of the atoms

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
after they are loaded into Dipole Trap.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Or their conditions.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
So, in principle,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
the conditions of the atoms

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
in Dipole Trap are very low.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
The speed is also very low.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
So, in principle,

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
the speed of the atoms

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
in Dipole Trap

25:51.000 --> 25:58.000
is about 10 cm per second.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
I have a question.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
What is it?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
It may be related to the picture you are talking about.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
I just went to the last page.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I have a question.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Why is your system

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
physically so huge?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Is it because the distance between each station

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
is sufficiently separated?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Is the scale

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
determined by the picture

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
sufficient?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Good question.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
First of all,

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
how big is the physical scale?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Of course,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
the first phase is very large.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
But in fact,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
we want to make it smaller later.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
But of course,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
how far is the physical scale?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
This 2D Motte,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
this blue light,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
because the width of the line is wide,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
so in the end,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
you have to achieve the Bose-Einstein condensation.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
You can't have any

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
blue light conditions directly.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Because the width of the line is wide,

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
it actually heats your atom very effectively.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Let's put it this way.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Not only heats your atom,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
but also heats your BC.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
So for BC,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
once there is any light,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
it is in the near resonant condition

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and can drive your transition,

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
your BC is basically excited,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
and then your BC is gone.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
So in practice,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
we hope to achieve a continuous cooling stage.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
Blue light is necessary for blue Motte,

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
because it effectively decelerates and cools

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
the atoms coming out of the atom oven.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
You can think of it as a speed distribution

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
from 600 meters per second.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
You have to go through this blue Motte,

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
that is to say,

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
make a blue Motte

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
to reduce it to a speed distribution

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
of about 6 meters per second.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Then from the speed distribution of 6 meters per second,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
through another stage of Motte

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
to further decelerate it.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
So in practice,

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
physically, we need to have enough space,

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
mainly because we want to make sure

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
that we finally achieve

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
the cooling of the BC.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
In this space,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
my corresponding temperature distribution

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
is in the tens to hundreds of nanocelvin level.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
But at the beginning,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
for example,

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
the temperature of the atomic group here

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
is in the one-minicelvin level.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Then the light here,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
in principle,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
as long as your BC is condensed,

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
when you see this light,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
in principle, it will be activated immediately,

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
and your BC will be destroyed immediately.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
So in practice,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
our design is to ensure that

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
the laser cooling mechanism of the first stage

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
will not affect

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
the experimental conditions

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
to achieve the condensation of the BC.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
So physically,

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
it seems that the chamber design is very large.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
But this in itself is a problem of engineering.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
For example,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
in principle,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
these attenuators and filters in the middle

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
are designed to reduce these scattering lights

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to be able to affect

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
the condensation of the BC produced later.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I don't know if I have answered the question.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yes, yes, yes.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
I understand.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Thank you.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
Next is the following chamber.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
In principle,

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
after the second stage of the red mod,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
we still show up in the dipole guide.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
We have a deceleration mechanism.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
In other words,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
I just said that

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I have just measured

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
the speed distribution of the axis in the dipole guide.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
It is a speed distribution of 10 cm per second.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Then I have a deceleration mechanism.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
In principle,

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
it also applies some physics related to the mod.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
In other words,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
I have a mod here.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
It has a magnetic field distribution in space.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
So I can use this magnetic field distribution

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
to do something like

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Zeeman Decelerator,

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
a mechanism of Zeeman Slower

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
to do a deceleration process

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
corresponding to the laser cooling light.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
In principle,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
here you can see that

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
my original value is indeed decelerated.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
Then,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
after deceleration,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
in our experiment,

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
we did a microscope here again.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
It's a bit like

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
letting the atom be decelerated in the dipole guide.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
It's like a turning process.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Then hide in this new microscope.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Then in this microscope,

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
we have to realize

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
and add the Transparency Beam introduced earlier.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Then I hope that

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
in this space,

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
I can realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Assuming that

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I zoom out now.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
The last microscope

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
looks like this in the experiment.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Here is the atom in the ground state.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Then I have a dipole

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
to deepen my microscope.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Let my atomic group

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
have a higher density here.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Then in the same position,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I have added a beam

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
to let my excited state

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
be shifted away.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
So my laser cooling

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
only occurs around.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
So the temperature of the atom here

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
can be very low.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
But these beams

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
are mainly used for laser cooling

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
to reduce the temperature.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Then the middle part,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
I want to realize my Bose-Einstein cluster.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
The interaction in the middle

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
is basically through

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
my Elastic Collision

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
to do the heat transfer.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
You can understand that

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
in the Reservoir part,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I try to reduce the temperature

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
by laser cooling.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
But the light of my laser cooling

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
will not affect

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
my Bose-Einstein cluster

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
in the middle part.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Because in the middle atom,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
I can't see the light of my laser cooling.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
The heat transfer between them

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
is through the Elastic Collision

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
to do the heat transfer.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
In the experiment,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
the final result of all laser cooling

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
is to have a continuous

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
atom influx in the final Reservoir.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
The temperature is very low,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
the density is very high,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and it reaches a condition

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
where my phase space density is high enough.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
In the middle part,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
because I can't see the light of my laser cooling,

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
and the phase space density is high enough,

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
under such conditions,

33:57.000 --> 34:02.000
I can start Bose-Enhanced Gathering.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Finally, I can achieve

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
in the middle part.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Now, let me tell you

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
that I have achieved a continuous Bose-Einstein cluster.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Of course, in the experiment,

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
we have to prove that it is a Bose-Einstein cluster.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Now, let me show you

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
what they observed in the experiment

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
when they first made

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
the Bose-Einstein cluster in 1995.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
What you see now is the space distribution of the atom group.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
When their temperature drops lower and lower,

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
you can see that the density suddenly appears in the middle.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Bose-Enhanced Scattering occurs,

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
resulting in Bose-Einstein clustering.

34:51.000 --> 34:57.000
It corresponds to the sudden increase in density in the middle.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
This is what they observed in the experiment.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
Of course, we also tried to observe in the experiment.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I want to ask a question.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Please go ahead.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
In the previous experiment,

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
I thought it was in the speed space.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I saw it condensate.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
So, in the time and space...

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
You mean...

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
For example, these pictures are basically...

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Yes.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Condensate in the speed space.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
That's right.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
In the speed space.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
That's right.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
So, actually...

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You can think of it as...

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
In the speed space,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
they did an experiment called Time-of-Flight.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
In other words, if you turn off your condensate,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
your atom group will start...

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
That is to say,

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
convert your speed space distribution into actual space distribution.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Then you look at the distribution of the atom group

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
to correspond to the original speed space distribution.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
After they did the so-called Time-of-Flight,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
let the atom group fly in space.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Because it doesn't have a condensate.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
So, let the atom group

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
convert its speed space distribution

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
into a map out

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
to your space space distribution.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Convert the speed space distribution

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
into space space distribution.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
You can see it in the experiment.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Because once you have...

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
That is to say,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
the speed space distribution is indeed in the middle.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
You have a large part of the atom group

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
distributed at that speed.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
After converting it into space space distribution,

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
you can see this.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
They call it Bimodal Distribution.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
It's a bit like what I'm going to talk about next.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
That is to say,

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
here you can see...

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
In the experiment,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
at the beginning,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
you can imagine that

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
the time has started.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Then wait for 2.2 seconds.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Then my atom group in space...

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Finally, I did this Time-of-Flight.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
I went to see the space distribution of my atom group.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
In principle,

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
it meets the Boltzmann Distribution

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
given by some Thermal Distribution.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
So, when you do fitting,

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
it actually meets your Gauss Distribution.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Let's put it this way.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Once you convert your speed space

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
through the Time-of-Flight mechanism I just mentioned,

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
and I'm doing 18 ms Time-of-Flight here,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
and look at its speed distribution,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
it does meet my Gauss Distribution.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Why is the right side higher?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
It's space distribution.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Because this is position.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
This is space distribution.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
You turn off the laser.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Then I have a follow-up question.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
For example, if you look at Time-of-Flight,

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
do you turn off the laser in one direction?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Or do you turn it all off?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
If you turn it all off,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I guess it will diffuse

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and spread to all directions.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
If you look at it in one direction,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
do you turn it off in one direction?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
We turn it all off in the experiment.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
It does diffuse in all directions in space.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
But what we're looking at now

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
is a bit like taking a picture in space.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
Of course, we do it in a certain direction.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
It's a concept of a interface.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
You can imagine it as

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I take a picture,

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
and I do a point on the axis of the picture.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
So it corresponds to

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
the speed distribution on the plane I'm looking at.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Space distribution.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Space distribution.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Because of Time-of-Flight,

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
it corresponds to a speed distribution.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Got it.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
OK.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
First of all,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
when I look at it in the experiment,

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
my atomic group distribution looks like this.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Do you think this is Gaussian?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Actually, I have to say that

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
we have a landscape here.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
As I just said,

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
the atomic group is basically

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
cooled in space all the way,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
and then it turns around and finally enters

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
my final space landscape.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So here,

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
in principle, when we're fitting here,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
let's say,

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
OK, I know what the space landscape looks like.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Because I know how my Dipole Trap is designed.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
That is, how is the space landscape designed in space?

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
The atomic group's spatial distribution

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
is actually satisfied

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
under the conditions of such a space landscape.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
In principle, it is a high-speed distribution.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
This is what I want to say.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
In today's experiment,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
if I wait a little longer today,

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
it's a bit like saying,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
when I turn it on,

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
at the end,

39:59.000 --> 40:07.000
once my laser starts lacing,

40:07.000 --> 40:11.000
I'll wait another 3.2 seconds,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and it's already lacing.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
If I turn off all the lights,

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
and look at the spatial distribution,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
the spatial distribution,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
and the spatial distribution.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
You can see that

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
it's a bit like BC's proof.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
It's a bimodal distribution.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
So in the first step,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I'll prove that

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
I've seen BC in the experiment.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Is it continuous?

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
In the experiment,

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
of course, we started doing it.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
The longer I wait,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
from the beginning,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
0 seconds, it's gone.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Then at about 3.2 seconds,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
it's almost there.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Then I waited all the way.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
In principle,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
the state of BC

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
is to continue.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
In my experiment,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I measured up to 5 minutes.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
That is to say, 5 minutes,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
this state

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
has been there.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
You say I can measure longer.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
I can.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
So in the experiment,

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
in principle,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
we only measured up to 5 minutes.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
But in principle,

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
this state is

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
that is to say,

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
in principle,

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
it has been maintained there.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
It's a continuous state.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
That's it.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Of course,

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
let's take a closer look

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
at the conditions of my

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Boltzmann's condensation.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
For example,

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
how much Boltzmann's condensation

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
did I achieve?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Here it is.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
OK,

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
at about 3.2 seconds,

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
you can see that

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
the number of BCs

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
has started to increase.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Next,

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
we will maintain

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
a condition here.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Of course,

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
let's draw it out a little bit.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
That is to say,

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
this is a detection

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
limit.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
That is to say,

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
did I observe

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
my Boltzmann's condensation

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
above my imprecision?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
In principle,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
we did.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
In principle,

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
the condition of this BC

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
has been maintained

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
here for 2 to 60 seconds.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
I have a question.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Go ahead.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
How did you get

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
the blue data

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
error bar?

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
The blue data error bar

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
is basically

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
that we measured

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
at least 5 times

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
in the same condition.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
OK.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
To make an error bar.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
OK.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
So,

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
the size of the error bar

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
is not only related to

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
the number of BCs,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
but also related to

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
how many times you measured.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
That's right.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
OK.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
So,

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
actually,

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
some numbers,

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
numbers,

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
that is,

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
the central value

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
is very close,

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
but the error bar is not the same size.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Is it because of the difference in this part?

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Yes.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Oh,

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
I see.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
OK.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
OK.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
Thank you.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
OK.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Then,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
let's actually look at

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
our BC.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Question.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Oh.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
You can say it.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Look at

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
the previous picture.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Its

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
BC at a number

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
is up and down.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Does it have an oscillation?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Or is it already stable?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
OK.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Good question.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
In the experiment,

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
of course,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
we have to say

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
that

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
our data

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
is not enough

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
to have enough confidence

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
to claim that

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
this is an

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
interesting

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
physical oscillation.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Because

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
it is possible

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
that

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
you don't see

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
a very obvious cycle

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
behavior.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
On the other hand,

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
when the experiment was just done,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
it was not particularly stable.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
So,

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
the error bar is not small.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Then,

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
we can only say

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
that

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
we have observed

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
that the wave function is very clear.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It is indeed distributed

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
from the speed space.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
That's just

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
that

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
these numbers

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
are from

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
fitting

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
BC

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
obtained

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
by the experiment.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
So,

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
this fitting

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
is actually

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
how to say

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
In fact,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
this fitting

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
gives

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
the uncertainty

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
is actually

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
not small.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
In the experiment,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
they are indeed

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Bose-Einstein connection.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
That's just that

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
in the

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
fluctuation

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
of shot-to-shot,

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
there will be

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
the first

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
stability of

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
the experiment itself

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
to what extent

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
plus

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
my fitting

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
corresponds to

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
this

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
uncertainty.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
So,

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
it will give

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
what Yan-Yong just said.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
My error bar

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
is actually

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
is

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
we

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
give a reasonable

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
error bar.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
That

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
but that is to say

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
BC's

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
feature

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
is

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
there

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
is

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
exist.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
So,

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
BC

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
this thing

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
is confirmed.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
But that is to say

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
the number part

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
we are now

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
our experiment

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
above

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
the

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
stability

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
is not enough

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
for us to

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
claim that

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
we have seen

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
any

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
effective oscillation.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
But

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
oscillation

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
is actually

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
interesting.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Because

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
laser itself

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
is

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
because

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
your analogy

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
just now

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I really like

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
the

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
laser and

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
the

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
matter wave

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
to compare

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
that

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
is

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
we also know

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
that

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
CW laser

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
if you

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
design

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
oscillation

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
I just want to ask

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
that is

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
in this

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
in your system

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
there may be

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
similar mechanism?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Yes.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
There will be.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
In fact, there is paper

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
also written.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
In fact,

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
we also want to

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
try to measure it.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Because

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
that is to say

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
just like you said

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
that is to say

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
this is a

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
with laser

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
some

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
comparative

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
physical system.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
In fact,

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
the difference

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
is only

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
my origin

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
is quality.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
My light

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
but

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
they themselves

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
follow some

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
laser

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
some

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
type of

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
mechanism.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
So

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
you talk about those

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
oscillation

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
or

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
relaxation

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
that is to say

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
will

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
we expect

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
in

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
this

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
system

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
there is a way

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
to observe

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
but we

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
have this idea

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
want to go

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
measure

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
no data

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
have not measured

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
can only say

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
no

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
that

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
ok

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
that

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
on the experiment

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
I am now

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
to correspond to some

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
data after fitting

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
on the experiment

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
we achieved

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
almost

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
in such a

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
continuous

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
physical

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
or

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
laser

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
experiment

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
system

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
we have a way

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
to produce

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
every second

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
loading rate

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
I did not give

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
but

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
in fact

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
in

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
once

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
into

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
stable

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
stable conditions

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
after

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
my

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Bose-Einstein connection

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
is almost

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
in this

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
number

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
7 x 10

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
3

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
7000

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
and

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
then

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
around

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
the

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
origin

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
for example

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
around

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
the reservoir

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
part

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
almost

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
the number

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
is in

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
700

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
K

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
when

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Jason

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
said

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
we

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
want to see

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
some

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
for example

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
BEC

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
his

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
oscillation

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
behavior

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
because these

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
correspond to

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
the

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
laser-related

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
some

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
physical

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
mechanism

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
that

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
we hope

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
to be in the

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
experiment system

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
in the

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
BEC

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
we now

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
do it

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
to see

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
similar behavior

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
because

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
we can

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
explain

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
our

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
data

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
why

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
there seems to be

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
some

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
oscillation

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
behavior

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
like

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
I just

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
said

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
the stability of

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
our experiment

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
is not enough

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
to make us

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
say

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
that

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
this

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
corresponds

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
to

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
the

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
oscillation

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
claimed

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
by

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
the

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
laser

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
but

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
theoretically

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
now

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
we are

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
also

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
interested in

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
trying to

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
measure it

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
here

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
is a

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
from

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
the

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
original

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
1980s

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
we

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
really

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
started

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
to find

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
BEC

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
in hydrogen

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
in the

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
original

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
19 years

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
we

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
even

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
tried to

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
make

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
so-called

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
continuous

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Bose-Einstein

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
connection

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
to produce

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
this

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
very low-temperature

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
atomic

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
beam

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
like this

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
and it

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
so-called

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
in the dark

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
means that

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
it is in

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
my

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
microscope

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
guide

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
that is

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
in a

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
dipole

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
guide

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
microscope

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
and

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
it

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
around

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
there is

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
no

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
near-resonant

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
light

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
that is

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
there is

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
almost

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
no

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
laser light

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
to heat it

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
to very hot

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
so that

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
the experiment is that

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
I am satisfied with the

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
experiment system

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
to achieve a

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
very cold

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
atomic number

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
like this

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
that

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
experiment

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
we of course

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
also achieved

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
continuous

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Bose-Einstein

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
connection

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
that

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
next

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
to do

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
what research

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
is interesting

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
that of course

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
for example

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
continuous

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
super-cold

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
atomic number

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
is very interesting

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
that is

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
you put this

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
very cold

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
atomic number

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
through a

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
cavity

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
when

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
you may

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
let the atom

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
in the cavity

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
it has this

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
we call

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
collective

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
emission

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
of

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
behavior

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
that is

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
it

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
that

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
private atom

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
it is actually

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
the first stage of

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
light

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
in fact

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
one of the

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
candidates

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
that it

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
has a

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
very low

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
emission rate

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
that

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
can be used

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
to define

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
the time

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
in this

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
experiment

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
mechanism

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
or

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
in this

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
experiment

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
we hope

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
to take this

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
very cold

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
atomic number

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
through a

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
cavity

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
after

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
the

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
cavity

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
direction

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
to

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
have some

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
collective

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
that is

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
it has

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
some

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
corresponding

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
effect

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
and

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
then

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
in this

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
very

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
narrow

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
light

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
very

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
narrow

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
emission rate

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
to

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
do

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
emission

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
and

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
in principle

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
it can be

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
a very

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
accurate

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
light

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
that is

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
or

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
very

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
accurate

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
laser

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
because it is

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
directly from the

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
atomic number

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
itself

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
and then

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
it can

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
be

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
a new

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
technology of

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
light

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
that

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
on the other hand

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
of course

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
we have now realized

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
continuous wave

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
of course

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
we want to

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
further

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
put the

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
atomic number

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
from this

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
cavity

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
inside

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
cover out

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
that we

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
can be

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
called

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
we realized

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
true

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
continuous

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
atomic

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
laser

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
because

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
now

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
but today

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
I want to do

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
is that

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
there is a

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
mechanism

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
is also put

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
these atoms

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
from the

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
cavity inside

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
cover out

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
after

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
the realization

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
of this

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
atomic

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
laser

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
that

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
just

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Jason

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
also talked

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
about

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
is that

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
the new

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
matter

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
wave

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
it

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
in principle

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
we have a

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
lot of

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
things

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
that we

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
can measure

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
the

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
gain dynamics

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
look like

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
its

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
oscillation

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
behavior

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
we have

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
no way to

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
measure

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
these

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
heat balance

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
heat imbalance

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
that is

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
non-equilibrium

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
some

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
corresponding

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
laser

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
physics

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
we also

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
hope to

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
observe

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
in this

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
experiment

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
to see

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
that another

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
course

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
is that

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
actually

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
new

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
for example

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
tweezers

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
atomic array

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
qubit

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
they

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
for example

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
this new

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
paper

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
they

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
say

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
they can

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
tweezers

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
inside

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
to realize

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
in one

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
of the

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
positions

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
to do

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
qubit

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
register

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
preparation

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
then

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
they

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
these

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
qubit

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
operations

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
in

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
the

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
concept

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
I can

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
provide

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
a

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
quantum

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
to

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
continuous

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
fill

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
them

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
in this

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
area

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
tweezers

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
that

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
you can

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
imagine

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
that

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
it

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
becomes

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
a bit

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
like

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
his

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
quantum

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
computer

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
in

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
this

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
tweezers

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
is a

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
continuous

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
quantum

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
operation

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
because I can

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
continuously

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
use my

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
super quantum

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
to fill

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
them

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
this

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
buffer

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
then

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
they

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
after

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
the operation

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
to do

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
what to do

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
but

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
I

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
follow

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
these

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
buffers

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
I can

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
fill

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
it

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
this

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
is a

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
concept

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
that

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
I

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
can

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
implement

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
in

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
our

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
new

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
experiment

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
so

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
this is

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
my

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
report

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
today

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
thank

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
you

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
let's

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
applaud

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
now

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
if

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
you have

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
any

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
questions

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
please

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
ask

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
I

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
have

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
a

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
question

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
that

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
if

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
you can

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
make the

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
system

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
smaller

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
do you

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
think

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
there is

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
a limit

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
that

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
you can't

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
make it

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
smaller

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
like

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
it can't

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
be smaller

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
than

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
some

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
absolute

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
scale

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
so it

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
is this

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
small

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
or

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
do you

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
think

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
there is

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
no

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
limit

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
if

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
it

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
is

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
small

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
think

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
iphone is

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
the limit

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
but

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
this is a

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
very big

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
limit

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
that is

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
the size

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
of the

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
iphone

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
the

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
main

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
reason is

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
because

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
some

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
physical

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
restrictions

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
such as

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
how good

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
my

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
experiment

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
is

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
to

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
produce

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
these

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
atoms

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
and then

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
do further

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
laser cooling

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
this

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
oven

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
depends on

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
the

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
atom steam

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
so you

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
actually have

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
to heat

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
your

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
atom

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
for

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
the

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
private

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
atom

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
,

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
its

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
heating

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
temperature

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
is actually

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
quite high

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
to 600

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
K

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
so

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
the

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
different

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
cooling

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
corresponding

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
to the

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
different

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
laser

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
width

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
gives you

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
different

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
temperature

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
conditions

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
so

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
you can

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
achieve

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
this

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
different

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
of a

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
cooling

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
atom

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
itself

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
because

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
you

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
don't

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
have to

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
