00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Hello, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Lin Yuwei from UC Irvine.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
Our guest for today's TerraTalk is Lu Kefan, a Ph.D. student at Fairbanks University of Alaska.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
His field of research is very interesting. It's about Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

00:36.000 --> 00:48.000
He also worked as an intern at the Department of R&D at Fairbanks University of Alaska.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
He also taught for 3 and a half years.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
He is expected to graduate next spring.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
You can visit his defense course and watch the aurora.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Let's welcome Lu Kefan.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I don't want to bore you.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Plus, no one knows about this field.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
So, I'll introduce the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

01:25.000 --> 01:39.000
I'll talk about my field of research.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
I'll also talk about my field of research.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
I'll also talk about my field of research.

01:51.000 --> 02:07.000
At the beginning, we saw a video.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
It's a popular video on social media.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
It tells us how to reduce this year's sea ice.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
It's about how to save the Arctic, the Earth, and the environment.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It's a similar title.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
For me, the video's demand is correct.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
But every time I see a similar video, I have to be careful.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
What does the color in the video represent?

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
You may think that the white part is the size of the ice.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
But in fact, this video is from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
It calculates the age of the ice.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
That is, the length of time the ice stays in the ocean.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
Why do we look at the age of the ice?

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
Generally speaking, we will divide the ice into one-year ice or multi-year ice.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
One-year ice is the gray part.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
You can see that it fluctuates a lot every year.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Because it melts in summer.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
When the sea water reaches the freezing point, it freezes again.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
In fact, the thickness of the sea ice has nothing to do with its age.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
The average thickness of one-year ice is about 2 to 3 meters.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Multi-year ice is the ice that has not completely melted in summer for more than a year.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Its thickness is actually about 3 meters.

03:59.000 --> 04:11.000
The thickness of one-year ice or multi-year ice may be more than 5 meters.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
So when you see a video like this, especially a large-scale video,

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Because the thickness of the sea ice is very difficult to measure in the air.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
So if you see such a large-scale video,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
It is usually not discussing the thickness of the sea ice or its size or volume.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Next, let's look at the winter of 2016.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Take a closer look at the gray part.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
For example, as I just said,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
One-year ice is also 3 meters.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Multi-year ice is also 3 meters.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
Then you will see that the whole piece is white.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Even the east coast of the United States still has sea ice.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Then visually, you will not feel so deeply that our sea ice is declining.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
You will not feel that terrible.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
But NASA made this video is not to intimidate everyone.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
This video has several points.

05:07.000 --> 05:19.000
The first is that we can see that most of the sea ice will flow out of the Atlantic coast.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
This is the first point.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
The second point is that if we look closely at the gray area,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Or look at the statistics next to it,

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
In the summer, the gray area is the part of one-year ice.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Indeed, there is a gradual decrease in the trend.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I will say that it is a decrease in the trend,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
It's not that it's really decreasing every year.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
It's because it's really decreasing every summer.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
But overall, it has been gradually decreasing in the past 40 years.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
The countries that are concerned about the research of the Arctic Ocean

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
There are mainly neighboring eight countries, including the United States, Greenland, Iceland,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Then the Nordic countries and Russia.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
In addition to these neighboring eight countries,

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
There are some countries such as Europe, Germany, France, East Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
The reason why they are so concerned about the research of the Arctic Ocean is because

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Everyone wants to take advantage of the summer when there is no ice.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Take advantage of the fishing rights and navigation rights in the Arctic Ocean.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
So these distant East Asian countries,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Once they can use this red line,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
This red line is the Arctic Ocean's North East Line.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
It is now being used.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
If East Asian countries use the North East Line to travel by sea,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
If you send something to Europe,

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Its navigation will be about one-third of the way to the south.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
So for them, the melting of the summer ice,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Or the gradual decrease in the area of ​​ice,

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
For some countries, it's not entirely a disaster or a bad thing.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Or something you want to avoid.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Not to mention the United States, Norway, and Russia.

07:13.000 --> 07:21.000
There are very large drilling projects along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
Or mining natural resources.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
It's not like what you see.

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
Greenpeace has tried to ban drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And then they won.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
It's not like that.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The reason why Shell stopped drilling in the Arctic Ocean

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
It's because they hired a lot of scientists to do research.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And then they found out that if they were to deal with the subsequent oil and gas problems,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And to strengthen the ecological balance,

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
They didn't lose any profits.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
That's why they decided to withdraw.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But in addition to Shell,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
There are a lot of oil companies in the United States.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Like ConocoFlips or BP.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
They continue to drill along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Not to mention that the entire north coast of Norway is a drilling platform.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What about these countries?

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
Their attitude towards the reduction of sea ice is

08:21.000 --> 08:31.000
Treat it as a natural phenomenon that is already happening and is almost impossible to reverse.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Their research focuses on how to deal with what has already happened.

08:37.000 --> 08:51.000
For example, researchers from Alaska and Norway are now working on improving the shape of the oil platform.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Because we see that if there is less sea ice, the flow of the sea will be strengthened.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
But there will still be some floating ice stuck on the coast.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
These floating ice will be affected by the strong flow of the sea.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
And then it will hit the oil platform.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And then it could cause a public safety accident.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
So they want to improve the oil platform to reduce the slowdown of floating ice collision.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Or like the East Asian countries I just mentioned,

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
They are constantly studying when to enter the Arctic Ocean.

09:19.000 --> 09:27.000
Which route to take to avoid aftershocks and shipwrecks.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
For example, Alaska's King Crab is very famous.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
As the sea ice retreats, the water temperature will change.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
So we find that the King Crab is gradually moving north.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
At this time, they have to consider whether to change the target species or change the area and timing of the King Crab.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
These are all countries that are now working on Arctic research.

09:57.000 --> 10:11.000
They are not completely treating it as a disaster to avoid.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Or try to recover to the original sea ice situation.

10:17.000 --> 10:27.000
From this animation, we can get a lot of information.

10:27.000 --> 10:41.000
A lot of sea ice is flowing out of the Atlantic Ocean.

10:41.000 --> 10:51.000
This can be seen from the ocean flow cycle of the Arctic Ocean.

10:51.000 --> 11:01.000
There is a lot of Atlantic Ocean water flowing from the Atlantic Ocean of the Arctic Ocean.

11:01.000 --> 11:09.000
Because of the force of gravity, the King Crab will move along the right bank of the Arctic Ocean.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
The Atlantic Ocean has an opening, and the Pacific Ocean also has an opening.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Why didn't the King Crab flow out of the Pacific Ocean?

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
This is because the opening of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
The width of the opening is about 100 to 200 kilometers.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
The depth of the opening is about 30 to 50 meters.

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
The depth of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is about 200 to 300 meters.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
So once the Atlantic Ocean enters the Arctic Ocean, it is difficult to flow out of the Pacific Ocean again.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
At the same time, there is also water flowing from the Pacific Ocean.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
So the King Crab will continue to move along the right bank of the Atlantic Ocean.

12:01.000 --> 12:11.000
The King Crab will continue to move along the right bank of the Atlantic Ocean.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
This is the first reason.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
The second reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
The second reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
The first reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
Continue to the third reason.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
The third reason is that the King Crab became very wet from the air.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
Continue to the fourth reason.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Continue to the fifth reason.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000

The bottom of the ice water is a large layer of ice with a very high salinity of about 33 degrees.

27:29.000 --> 27:36.000
The reason why it is called winter water is because when the sea water freezes, it releases a lot of salt.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
After the salt has melted, it enters the sea water, which makes the sea water very heavy.

27:42.000 --> 27:48.000
After the sea water freezes, it sinks to the bottom, leaving a large amount of high salinity and very cold water.
