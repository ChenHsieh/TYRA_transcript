00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Mengchang, and I am a student at Mata University.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What I want to talk about today is about 4-way mixing and squeeze light.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you have any questions at any time, you can ask, just turn on your microphone.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My field is in the field of atomic physics, which is relatively low-energy physics.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Our research unit is JQI, which is the United States Department of State.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It is a rather special institution, which is under the Department of Commerce in the United States.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Although they don't sound like they are doing this kind of specialized research,

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
they have actually won four Nobel Prizes in atomic physics.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So it's a pretty special national standard.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My instructor is Paul Leitz.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Our main source of research funding is from the Air Force in the United States.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
At the beginning, I want to let everyone know what squeezing means.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We want to compress all the information into a better measurement.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
After watching the video, let's get down to business.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The experiment we are doing now is using laser light.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The characteristic of laser light is that it is a coherent state.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What is a coherent state?

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know if you've heard of it.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sure you've heard of the non-coherent principle.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The non-coherent principle tells us that we can't...

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We used to think that the results of delta x and delta t must be greater than h-bar.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We can imagine that our laser light has a so-called non-coherent property.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Non-coherent property means that it has its government amplitude and its horizontal axis.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Both of these can't be measured very accurately in practice.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That is to say, it has its limits.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can see that when our laser light is in coherent state,

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Basically, it's always in coherent state.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When it's in coherent state, you'll see its...

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Its FN or phase fluctuation is actually...

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Its result is in...

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That is to say, the curve on the left represents the line that meets the non-coherent principle.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mathematically, we know that when your delta...

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My y-axis is delta e, and my x-axis is delta phi.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If these two variables are in the minimum value,

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When the two are equal, they are actually in their so-called minimum value.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Laser light is when these two values are equal.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Then it presents such a coherent state.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So what is Squeeze state?

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Squeeze state means that you can...

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That is to say, we don't need to measure all the information of laser light very accurately.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We can say that we just need to measure the phase very accurately.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or we can measure our government very accurately.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When you see that your phase is measured very accurately,

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In fact, it still meets its non-coherent principle.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then it will lead to the inaccuracy of your government.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It will become very large.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then your phase can be measured very accurately.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So a while ago, probably the year before last,

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Isn't there a gravity wave measurement experiment?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It is to use this Squeeze light to throw away your impurities.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will talk about quantum impurities.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because you are in coherent state.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then go to the limits of quantum mechanics.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then push it to compress it so that you can measure the phase very accurately.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then they may have a so-called interferer.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then the interferer can measure the phase of something.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If the gravity wave passes over the earth,

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then you can measure the phase of this gravity wave.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There will be some changes.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As long as you have a way to enter this Squeeze state,

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can let a certain frequency of the phase be able to measure it very accurately.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because the gravity wave passes through like this,

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So its frequency will be very weak.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you are very weak, your impurities will be very strong.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You need to have a way to get rid of this impurity.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then measure to the phase you want.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But what we did in the experiment,

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We did another one.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We are so-called Two-Mode Squeezing.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Two-Mode Squeezing is to say,

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm producing two intangles of light.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That is to say, I now have some special light and non-linear effects.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then produce two intangles.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What about these two intangles?

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Some of their signals are exactly the same.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So if I input a light,

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That light is called Probe.

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then it will produce its oscillation.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It uses a Twin Beam.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
These two lights have each other.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For example, there is quantum co-relative.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That is, quantum co-relative.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Quantum co-relative.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So when I can put these two lights together,

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can get another one called Intensity Difference.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That is to say, I can let my Intensity Difference,

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to measure the noise of this two-mode intensity is the lowest.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This may be a bit abstract.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll show you some data later.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you don't quite understand, you can ask me again.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The preliminary introduction is,

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I spent 20 minutes to introduce what happened.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have introduced the background knowledge needed at the beginning.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If no one has any questions, I will continue.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OK.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How do we make this?

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Excuse me.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You just said that the intangles,

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How is it produced?

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is it also produced by something?

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is it produced by intangles?

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We don't use intangles.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We use Rubidium Vapor.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Rubidium is a 2A group.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Rubinium Nitrate.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Rubinium Nitrate.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We will hit a very strong laser beam.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This strong laser beam will have a non-linear interaction with a very weak beam.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then produce another conjugate,

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
another intangle beam.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How are they produced?

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will introduce a little later.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How do they produce this twin beam?

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to talk about 4-Way Missing.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
4-Way Missing.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Total is 4 beams.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But we only put 2 beams in.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then 3 beams will be produced.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There will be a more detailed explanation of the pattern later.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How is this produced?

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can I ask a question?

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What is 4WM?

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
4 is 4.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
W is 4-Way Missing.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or translated into Chinese,

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it is 4-Way Missing.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
4-Way Missing.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I should say that it is the abbreviation of this.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My standard abbreviation.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Does it mean that 4 waves are mixed together?

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But you only have 2 beams.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will show you a picture of the conjugate later.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then everyone will be confused.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you just say that these 2 beams are added or subtracted?

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Added.

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because they are...

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Actually, they said that the intensity of the beam is 1.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then the intensity of the beam will have a magnification ratio.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The magnification ratio is G.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So the light coming out is G.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then the other conjugate beam is G-1.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So they even put that...

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Originally it was Coherent State.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If it has a magnification effect,

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it will become Thermal State.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That is to say, it is no longer the original laser beam.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It is a very messy light.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
After the two conjugates are subtracted,

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you will see the effect of the twin.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They become very messy together.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But when they are subtracted,

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
they will see that they are actually very beautiful and become messy together.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OK, thank you.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
May I ask a question?

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So what is the power of these laser beams?

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My pump power is about 750mW.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's quite big.

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Of course, it can't be compared to super fast light.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We are continuous wave.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OK, you also answered my second question.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry, let's continue.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The result we did is...

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There is a relatively influential improvement.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When you want to look at the magnification compression,

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the lower the frequency,

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
the greater the interference in other environments.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
For example, you walk over there.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Or you have a call coming in.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
These may have some interference in your system.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then it will cause you to be unable to see the so-called squeeze light at a very low frequency.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That is, the compression of the magnification.

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Even if there is a car driving on the main road,

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it will have a great impact.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So our lab is doing experiments in such a deep basement.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Our result is...

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Anyway, our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In recent years, we have broken through the following three orders.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
From Kilohertz down to about 1,000 times to a few Hertz.

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can see the effect of the magnification compression.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Especially like the gravitational wave measurement I introduced at the beginning.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It must be seen at a very low frequency.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because theoretical mathematicians have calculated the magnitude of the gravitational wave.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So if you can only see the squeeze light of Kilohertz,

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you can't use it to do these gravitational wave measurements.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So in the past ten years,

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
this squeeze light has been developed in such a way that it can still have this effect at a very low frequency.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In the future, it will be possible to measure the gravitational wave.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In the result of our experiment,

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
there will be some applications in image processing.

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because you want to see if you can pass the image through a very weak light.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then maybe you can do some biological experiments.

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A lot of low light hits your sample.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Then you can get rid of these impurities.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Then you can see the signal very clearly.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So it has some applications in biology.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then it can even do some correction.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's a quantum correction.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then I will continue to introduce it later.

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is our 4-way missing.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So on the right, we are.

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is our wafer cell.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I drew the picture like this.

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The length of this wafer cell is about two centimeters long.

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then the diameter is about an inch.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Anyway, it's a very small cell.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Then you put a very strong pump beam in.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then the strength of this pump beam is about 450 mW.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Then it will interact with the other very weak beam.

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then you look at the link map on the left.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There are a lot of links in it.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But we only care about the link that we will call.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This lambda type link.

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It should be quite common to do quantum computing.

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There may be something very famous in quantum computing.

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's called EIT.

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Slow light storage technology.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Basically, it's quite similar to that.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
For example, you hit a very strong pump beam.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Very strong pump beam.

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Then it will interact with your probe beam.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then this very strong pump beam.

225
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It also interacts with the ground state on the other side.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then because of energy conservation.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So it releases the fourth conjugate beam.

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So you only hit two beams in.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But in a continuous operation.

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It actually acts like there are four waves interacting with each other.

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Two of the four waves are the same pump beam.

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So this pump beam is at the same time as these two ground states.

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What you want to see is that.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In addition to energy conservation.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It actually has to meet the other momentum conservation.

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then we usually don't talk about momentum conservation.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We also talk about phase matching.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In other words, this wave pump beam.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In addition to interacting with the probe beam.

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The momentum inside.

241
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That is to say, the pump beam and the probe beam have a very small angle.

242
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
About 0.3, 0.4 degrees.

243
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then we have four waves.

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So the total momentum of this pump beam.

245
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There will be two.

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then it will produce another conjugate beam.

247
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So it's in the other direction.

248
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then you see.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When you have any phase fluctuation.

250
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Or any frequency fluctuation.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It has to meet this.

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Momentum energy conservation rate.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So any fluctuation has to make it consistent.

254
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So this is a bit.

255
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This is a more general way to explain.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because they have to be energy conservative.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Momentum conservation.

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So any fluctuation.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The fluctuations must be consistent.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
In order to meet this condition at the same time.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's how it produces the twin beam.

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is some of our experimental conditions.

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then you will see this delta.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Big delta.

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This big delta is about 1.3GHz.

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a pretty far detune.

267
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because of our experiment.

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
In fact, our entire group is called.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Laser cooling and tracking.

270
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Our group is called.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Laser cooling and tracking team.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Research team is like this.

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
One of us.

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Our big boss is.

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We have a big boss.

276
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then there are four teachers below.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then I did this.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The only thing is to do it with heat source.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This heat source is about 120°C.

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We have to heat it up.

281
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Then let it become a vapor.

282
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So at the beginning, someone just asked.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Are we using crystal or what?

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We are not using crystal.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you use crystal.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There are other.

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Also doing.

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Or doing that kind of twin beam.

289
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
In fact, they are doing single mode.

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Anyway, crystal can also be used to do that.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Squeeze line.

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But.

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Anyway, some principles are still a bit different.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We might use.

295
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
K3 is the third stage.

296
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If it is crystal, it may be K2.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There are some differences in nature.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's right.

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Then the next one is.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We are several.

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This one is about ten years ago.

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Experimental results.

303
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You will see that.

305
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ten years ago.

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We actually used TESAFA laser.

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
To do this experiment.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
TESAFA laser is.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Its feature is that it is very expensive.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's about.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One or two decades ago.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We.

314
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Buy a TESAFA.

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
About.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
More than 200,000 dollars.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Then now it is more than 200,000.

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Or its.

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Power becomes stronger.

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's right.

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You see.

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The company is doing this experiment.

323
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You need to have one.

324
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Very expensive.

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
TESAFA laser.

326
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
More than 200,000 dollars.

327
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This.

328
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is not practical at all.

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So.

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We started to develop.

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Cheaper.

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then again.

333
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It is a dilutable.

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Laser light source.

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's it.

336
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What about the TESAFA laser we used at the beginning?

337
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Go again.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When doing this low-frequency quantization.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There is a.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ah.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Should I talk about this first?

342
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Experimental map.

343
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What does it mean?

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That is.

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Here you will see the blue line here.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The blue line here is the so-called shot noise.

347
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then I just started.

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Not to say.

349
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Laser light.

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It is coherent state.

351
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What about coherent state?

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
In fact.

353
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
One of its features is that.

354
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Its impurities.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Will not change.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That is to say.

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You are measuring.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You are now inserting a light.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This.

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This picture has pink.

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This light.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Insert.

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then you use this photodial.

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
To detect this.

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Then send it in.

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Spectrum analyzer.

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That is.

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Spectrum.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Spectrum analyzer.

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This spectrum analyzer will tell you.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This.

374
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
How much is the impurity of the frequency of this light?

375
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you insert this light.

376
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a laser.

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's a coherent state.

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Its impurities.

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Its impurities.

380
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Will not change.

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Just like this blue light.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The blue.

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The curve is like this.

385
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We insert a light.

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Then use a beam splitter.

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Divide this light into half.

388
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then divide it into half.

389
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Then subtract these two.

390
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then do the measurement of this impurity.

391
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Then why do these two subtract?

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because.

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You can also.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You can only measure one light.

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That is.

396
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You can also get a similar answer.

397
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's just the impurity power.

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you measure one light.

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The impurity power will be halved.

400
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If you measure two lights.

401
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The impurity power will be doubled.

402
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's it.

403
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There is another one.

404
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The reason we want to divide it into two lights.

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That is.

406
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In fact, although the laser light is a coherent state.

407
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But it's in the low frequency.

408
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
There are all kinds of impurities.

409
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Will come in.

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If you don't use two lights.

411
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If you don't use two lights.

412
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You can't put those.

413
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The so-called classical impurity.

414
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Or the technical impurity.

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Eliminate it.

416
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So you have to use.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Use one light.

418
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Divide it into two.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then do the subtraction.

420
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Then measure the impurity.

421
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is the so-called.

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I will talk about it later.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It is the so-called shot noise.

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's called the mega shot.

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Its frequency.

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It should always be flat.

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is a.

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Our field is a very.

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Ah.

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I didn't know this was a common thing before I came in.

431
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Then now.

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, this is the coherent state.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The impurity must be.

434
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The so-called.

435
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The so-called two-color frequency has changed.

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So it's the so-called shot noise.

437
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What about the red light?

438
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is what I just produced.

439
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Glow beam.

440
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I am not.

441
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I am now.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
To be more specific.

443
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The setting of our experiment is to say.

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I hit a pump beam.

445
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Then.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Hit another glow beam.

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Then these two.

448
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Intensity.

449
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The pump beam.

450
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Its intensity is about 10,000 times as strong as the glow beam.

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes.

452
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Then it goes through this non-linear.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Element.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The element plus.

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
After the effect.

456
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It will produce this glow beam.

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This glow beam is amplified.

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes.

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Then it will also produce another one.

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Conjugate beam.

461
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So they are a twin.

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then after these two lights are cut off.

463
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I call it.

464
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Intensity.

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Difference.

466
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Squeezing.

467
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Or in other words, it is squeeze.

468
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In other words, it is squeeze light.

469
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Then these two lights.

470
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That is to say.

471
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We will.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
To control the light of this input.

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Then let the power of the output light.

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
With these two lights.

475
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The power of these two shot noise lights is exactly the same.

476
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then you will see.

477
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
When we.

478
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If I have the so-called.

479
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Squeeze light.

480
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Squeeze light.

481
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My two intensity.

482
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Difference.

483
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is weaker than my shot noise.

484
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Sorry.

485
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let me ask.

486
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So the frequency of your four lights should be.

487
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What is the range?

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Because.

489
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So the frequency below you should be.

490
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The frequency of the big noise.

491
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Right?

492
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Ah.

493
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It should not be called big noise.

494
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because these two.

495
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The frequency of these two lights is different.

496
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes.

497
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You look at the left picture.

498
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Have you seen this cross-section?

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes.

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So you have two pink lights.

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is it a wave of visible light?

502
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He.

503
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
In fact, he is a distant infrared light.

504
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Light of 795nm.

505
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Ah.

506
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

507
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So that.

508
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That is also right.

509
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
A few hundred terahertz.

510
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Right?

511
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes.

512
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So you.

513
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So you just.

514
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The next page.

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That one.

516
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Um.

517
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The following frequency is kilohertz.

518
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Is it the difference between the two?

519
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
My.

520
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The problem is.

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Is.

522
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The frequency on both sides.

523
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You.

524
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You want to see.

525
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You.

526
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You have a side wave now.

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Correct.

528
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Then this side wave has a side wave frequency.

529
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Right?

530
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But I.

531
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I am now.

532
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I.

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm talking about.

534
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
These noise.

535
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
To do.

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Negative analysis.

537
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Of.

538
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Noise frequency.

539
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Not to say.

540
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
My whole side wave.

541
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What is the frequency?

542
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Not this frequency.

543
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But this noise.

544
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He has his own frequency.

545
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He has.

546
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So.

547
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So you just.

548
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Your next page.

549
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The noise.

550
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Your next page.

551
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Spectrum is.

552
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
These noise.

553
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Spectrum.

554
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Not the light itself.

555
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Spectrum.

556
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes.

557
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That is.

558
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
His noise.

559
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Just make sure.

560
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Um.

561
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Good.

562
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Thank you.

563
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Continue.

564
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because like.

565
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Light.

566
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Light has his.

567
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
His distribution.

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So.

569
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Anyway, he.

570
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He actually.

571
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Anyway, he.

572
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He.

573
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
There will be a.

574
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Distribution of noise.

575
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That.

576
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
If it is.

577
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
His distribution of noise.

578
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That is to say.

579
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
His frequency.

580
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The noise.

581
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The power should be the same.

582
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This.

583
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That.

584
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Uh.

585
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Here.

586
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For missing noise.

587
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That is.

588
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I.

589
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I do.

590
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Intensity difference.

591
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
When.

592
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The noise.

593
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That.

594
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh.

595
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Db to.

596
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Units.

597
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Every three db is.

598
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Cut in half.

599
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That is.

600
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So that means.

601
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You look at this.

602
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Red.

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This.

604
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Blue.

605
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The 8db that is.

606
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Every three db is cut in half.

607
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
These 3db is half.

608
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Another half.

609
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So, the rest of the 8th.

610
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is.

611
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
About.

612
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
10 percent.

613
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The noise only.

614
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That is.

615
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
If i originally had.

616
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
This.

617
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This.

618
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The noise of the laser beam.

619
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
If i was 1.

620
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That red.

621
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
The noise of this kernel.

622
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Only left.

623
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Original.

624
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Only 17%.

625
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That is.

626
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Its noise is.

627
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
In fact, it is very weak.

628
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's right.

629
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The focus here.

630
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Is to say.

631
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You can see that.

632
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hey.

633
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
At low frequency.

634
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
There are some small peaks here.

635
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
In fact, this small peak is.

636
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
This.

637
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Very expensive.

638
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
There is a very stupid.

639
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The disadvantages of the TESLA-5 laser.

640
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because it has cavities inside.

641
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That this cavity will.

642
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Causing it to have these resonance.

643
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The noise comes out.

644
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So.

645
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
When you are at low frequency.

646
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Will be affected by these cavities.

647
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You can't see it.

648
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Very low frequency.

649
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The compression of quantum noise.

650
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's right.

651
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's say.

652
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Ah.

653
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We are.

654
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
When doing experiments.

655
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Sometimes put the laser.

656
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Will lock the laser.

657
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What does it mean to lock the laser?

658
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Is to make its frequency fixed.

659
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Will not float around.

660
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Or.

661
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Is to make its bandwidth narrow.

662
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The meaning of narrow bandwidth.

663
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That is to say.

664
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I have a sine now.

665
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is your sine a very simple sine?

666
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Or is your sine.

667
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Sine or.

668
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There is a flat sine.

669
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
That is to say.

670
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This flat.

671
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's what I'm talking about.

672
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Right.

673
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This is flat.

674
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Correct.

675
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Ah.

676
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Ah.

677
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Probably like this.

678
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So.

679
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So.

680
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There is a picture here.

681
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
That is to say.

682
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Let's measure the TESLA-5.

683
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
More than 200,000 dollars.

684
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
TESLA-5 laser.

685
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When the line width.

686
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You will find that.

687
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
This blue dash 9.

688
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Is.

689
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That is.

690
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
When we do experiments.

691
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
We just.

692
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Anyway, just hit the light.

693
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Hit in.

694
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Fiber.

695
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Then go.

696
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
To measure its.

697
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Line width.

698
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Correct.

699
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You will see that it is probably.

700
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Maybe a few.

701
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Hundreds or dozens of kHz.

702
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Ah.

703
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The blue dash 9.

704
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Its width is probably.

705
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Maybe dozens of kHz.

706
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So.

707
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So narrow.

708
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's pretty beautiful.

709
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But.

710
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
When we lock up the laser.

711
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It becomes.

712
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
More noisy.

713
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This is.

714
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The disadvantage of TESLA-5 laser is.

715
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You lock up.

716
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
In fact.

717
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Your.

718
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Your frequency is fixed.

719
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But.

720
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The quality of your laser.

721
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Is getting worse.

722
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Correct.

723
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Then you have to put it.

724
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Line width becomes narrower.

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
In fact.

726
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It will be quite complicated.

727
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then we look at another.

728
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Red curve.

729
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
This red curve is.

730
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The red line is.

731
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
2G TESLA.

732
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Then you haven't locked up.

733
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's like this.

734
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's dash 9.

735
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Red dash 9.

736
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Is.

737
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
About a few.

738
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Megahertz.

739
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So wide.

740
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But when we lock up.

741
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
After.

742
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This is the red line.

743
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It becomes very narrow.

744
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's probably a few.

745
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Probably.

746
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Even less than.

747
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
A kHz.

748
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So narrow.

749
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Line width.

750
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So.

751
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
For 2G TESLA.

752
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It may be.

753
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Our TESLA.

754
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
2G TESLA.

755
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Probably.

756
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So.

757
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Relative to.

758
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Compared with TESLA.

759
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's a lot cheaper.

760
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Probably.

761
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
One TESLA.

762
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You can buy.

763
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
About nine.

764
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
2G TESLA.

765
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Like this.

766
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But 2G TESLA.

767
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's actually.

768
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Its.

769
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Light is weaker.

770
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Correct.

771
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Then this is another team.

772
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
In.

773
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Australian.

774
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Experimental research.

775
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Then he is.

776
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I just forgot who asked.

777
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is.

778
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
They are using.

779
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Crystal.

780
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
To do.

781
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then their method.

782
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Not called.

783
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
O.

784
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
P.

785
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
O.

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
O.

787
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
P.

788
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
O.

789
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
What is it?

790
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Important.

791
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Correct.

792
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This is.

793
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Another way to use.

794
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
To do.

795
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Squeeze line.

796
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Then they.

797
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This.

798
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This picture on the left.

799
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You see this black.

800
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This.

801
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This straight line.

802
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The so-called.

803
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Shot noise.

804
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Shot noise.

805
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I just said.

806
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Laser light noise.

807
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Then you see.

808
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There are other.

809
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Very messy line.

810
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There are red lines.

811
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Blue line.

812
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Red line.

813
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Black line.

814
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Blue line.

815
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then you see.

816
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There is a power here.

817
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That is to say.

818
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
His power.

819
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
From 6.

820
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
From 6.

821
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Microwave.

822
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Down to.

823
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
0.7.

824
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Microwave.

825
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Down to a few.

826
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Power.

827
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
When.

828
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You see.

829
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
His.

830
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Miscellaneous.

831
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Low frequency.

832
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
When.

833
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Getting weaker and weaker.

834
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Correct.

835
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That.

836
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
In fact, this piece of paper.

837
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He.

838
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't know.

839
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Why.

840
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Will be like this.

841
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
They are.

842
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
A record.

843
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That is to say.

844
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
They can.

845
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Do.

846
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Squeeze line.

847
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Then.

848
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's under 280 Hz.

849
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That.

850
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That.

851
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
In fact.

852
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We already know.

853
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Why.

854
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Correct.

855
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Then he.

856
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Here because.

857
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It's also his own problem.

858
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So there will be some.

859
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Some.

860
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Peak.

861
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Noise.

862
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Is particularly strong.

863
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Of course.

864
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
These are not important.

865
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The point is.

866
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
He can be very low.

867
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Very low frequency.

868
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
More than 200 Hz.

869
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Can still.

870
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
There is.

871
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The effect of compression.

872
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That.

873
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Blue line.

874
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
With.

875
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Not.

876
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The red line and the black line.

877
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Is.

878
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
At low frequency.

879
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because there are a lot of.

880
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Classic noise.

881
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Basic noise.

882
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's hard to see.

883
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Noise compression.

884
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Effect.

885
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Especially.

886
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
When he.

887
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
When the bubble is very strong.

888
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Correct.

889
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That.

890
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This.

891
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Next.

892
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
These are.

893
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That.

894
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Is.

895
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Go.

896
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
To.

897
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Next weekend.

898
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
To go to California.

899
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The meeting.

900
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The main content of the report.

901
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Correct.

902
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That.

903
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Is.

904
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Our.

905
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
For missing.

906
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Setup.

907
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Is.

908
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
The device of time.

909
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We have a.

910
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Second-level thunderstorm.

911
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That.

912
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Second-level thunderstorm.

913
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Is very cheap.

914
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Not very cheap.

915
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Is about.

916
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
$20,000 to $30,000.

917
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Then we put.

918
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Part of the light.

919
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Out.

920
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Then.

921
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Double pass LN.

922
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Then.

923
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Why.

924
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Double pass LN.

925
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because.

926
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
This LN.

927
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Is.

928
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
About 1.5GHz.

929
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
He will put.

930
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Light frequency.

931
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Shift.

932
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
1.5GHz.

933
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That.

934
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You put it.

935
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Reflect it again.

936
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
After coming back.

937
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You will get.

938
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
About.

939
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
3GHz.

940
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Shift.

941
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That.

942
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
3GHz.

943
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Shift.

944
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
With me.

945
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The front.

946
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This connection.

947
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You see.

948
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Pink.

949
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
This is my original light.

950
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Pump beam.

951
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Pump beam.

952
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That.

953
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I double pass LN.

954
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Then I got.

955
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Pump beam.

956
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Then.

957
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
We can start.

958
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Experiment.

959
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But.

960
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is just my.

961
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In fact.

962
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Pump beam.

963
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Generate.

964
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The way.

965
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Then we put.

966
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Part of the light.

967
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Out.

968
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That.

969
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Part of the light.

970
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Is.

971
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
To lock the laser.

972
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That.

973
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
This is.

974
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Variation.

975
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Spectroscopy.

976
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
One.

977
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Locking the laser.

978
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Light wave.

979
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The way.

980
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That.

981
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You may.

982
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
More often.

983
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But.

984
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's another way.

985
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But.

986
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
In fact, this way.

987
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Variation.

988
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Spectroscopy.

989
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Is.

990
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Very easy.

991
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That.

992
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's very simple.

993
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You can go.

994
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Your laser beam.

995
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That.

996
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Light wave.

997
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Make it.

998
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Very low.

999
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Low to.

1000
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Hundreds of.

1001
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Hundred hertz.

1002
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Right.

1003
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That.

1004
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's pretty good.

1005
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The way.

1006
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That.

1007
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If you have any questions.

1008
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You can.

1009
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You can continue to ask.

1010
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Anyway.

1011
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We put this.

1012
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Locking.

1013
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Signal.

1014
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Send it back.

1015
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Secondary laser.

1016
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Control current.

1017
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Then you can.

1018
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Its.

1019
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The thread of the laser.

1020
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Shorten it.

1021
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
That.

1022
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
In fact.

1023
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
These are not difficult.

1024
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
This experiment.

1025
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Probably.

1026
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If you want to set it up.

1027
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Probably.

1028
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
As long as.

1029
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
One.

1030
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Month.

1031
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You can set it all up.

1032
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Right.

1033
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That.

1034
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Like our group.

1035
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
A lot.

1036
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Doing PTC.

1037
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That.

1038
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Probably.

1039
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
More than three or four years.

1040
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Not necessarily.

1041
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Right.

1042
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So this experiment.

1043
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Relatively.

1044
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Very.

1045
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Very.

1046
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Very simple.

1047
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Then we.

1048
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
After the laser is locked.

1049
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We're going to take.

1050
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Another one.

1051
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Light.

1052
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
There are about 30.

1053
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Minimum.

1054
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Light.

1055
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Put it in.

1056
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Amplifier.

1057
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This amplifier.

1058
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Also.

1059
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Relatively.

1060
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Very cheap.

1061
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This amplifier.

1062
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Only.

1063
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
$3,000.

1064
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Right.

1065
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So.

1066
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The whole laser system.

1067
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Less.

1068
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Less than $30,000.

1069
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Right.

1070
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So.

1071
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
For.

1072
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Taiwan.

1073
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Want to do this experiment.

1074
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Actually.

1075
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Is.

1076
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's very likely.

1077
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That is to say.

1078
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You don't have to.

1079
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Spend $270,000.

1080
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
To send.

1081
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
One.

1082
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
One.

1083
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You can do this experiment.

1084
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Right.

1085
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Then you usually have to do.

1086
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Non-linear.

1087
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Light-emitting experiments.

1088
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You usually need.

1089
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Very strong laser light.

1090
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Of course.

1091
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Very strong laser light.

1092
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then the light source is good.

1093
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Then you will use.

1094
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Laser.

1095
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But.

1096
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We don't need it now.

1097
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We just need a.

1098
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Diode laser.

1099
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This magnifier.

1100
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
This magnifier is called.

1101
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Tap Amplify.

1102
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You can get it.

1103
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Like.

1104
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Like the old TESLA.

1105
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The same strong light.

1106
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Is.

1107
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The light of 2W.

1108
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Right.

1109
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Then we put.

1110
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Just now.

1111
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The light of our double-paste LED.

1112
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
This is called.

1113
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Probe.

1114
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hit in.

1115
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Our.

1116
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Lubidium cell.

1117
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Then there is.

1118
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
120 degrees C.

1119
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So high temperature.

1120
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Then combine.

1121
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This magnifier.

1122
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Tap Amplify.

1123
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This magnifier.

1124
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The light released.

1125
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Then actually.

1126
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I just said.

1127
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
This magnifier.

1128
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
This magnifier.

1129
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It is.

1130
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
2W.

1131
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Output.

1132
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
But.

1133
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
In fact.

1134
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We really send in.

1135
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Only 750 mW.

1136
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
0.75W.

1137
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Light.

1138
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
0.75W light.

1139
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
In fact.

1140
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's enough for us to do experiments.

1141
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Then why.

1142
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Will lose so much.

1143
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
In fact.

1144
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
In fact.

1145
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We.

1146
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Is.

1147
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Most of them.

1148
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Their difficulty is.

1149
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
This magnifier.

1150
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Although.

1151
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Only 3000.

1152
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But.

1153
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The light coming out.

1154
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Is a square light.

1155
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You can't.

1156
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Take it to do experiments.

1157
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Then you.

1158
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You have to.

1159
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Do some shaping.

1160
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
These shapes.

1161
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Is.

1162
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
From our high school.

1163
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Those light.

1164
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Is.

1165
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
One-third.

1166
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Plus one-third of Q.

1167
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Plus one-third of F.

1168
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This light.

1169
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Concept.

1170
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You know.

1171
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
How to put this.

1172
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Square light.

1173
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Form it.

1174
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Into.

1175
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
A.

1176
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
High-spin.

1177
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Correct.

1178
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So.

1179
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
After the formation.

1180
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We.

1181
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Put the light into Fiber.

1182
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Like this.

1183
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Then come out.

1184
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Only about 750 mW.

1185
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Then these two lights.

1186
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Pump.

1187
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Plus pull.

1188
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Then there will be pull.

1189
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Conjugate.

1190
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That is.

1191
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This is our tradition.

1192
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Do.

1193
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That.

1194
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Pull and missing.

1195
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Then do.

1196
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Their.

1197
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Intensity difference.

1198
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Correct.

1199
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
That.

1200
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
The point is.

1201
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The point is.

1202
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
How to do it.

1203
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Very low quality.

1204
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Magnifier.

1205
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Magnifier.

1206
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Then you will see.

1207
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This way.

1208
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Same.

1209
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This.

1210
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Dash 9.

1211
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Red Dash 9.

1212
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Is.

1213
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Shot noise.

1214
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Blue Dash 9.

1215
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Also shot noise.

1216
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But these two lights.

1217
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The.

1218
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Power.

1219
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Is different.

1220
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Red Dash 9.

1221
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
This total power.

1222
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Is.

1223
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
About.

1224
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
130.

1225
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That.

1226
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
About 130 mW.

1227
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That.

1228
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Blue.

1229
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Dash 9.

1230
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Its light.

1231
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
About.

1232
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Only 17 mW.

1233
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That.

1234
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
These two lights.

1235
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Why.

1236
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I want to do this comparison.

1237
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That is to say.

1238
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You see.

1239
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
When its high frequency.

1240
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
When dozens of TOS.

1241
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You see.

1242
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The quantum noise you see.

1243
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
To say.

1244
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Is.

1245
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Quite consistent.

1246
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
But when it's low frequency.

1247
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's different.

1248
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Why.

1249
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Because.

1250
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You think about it.

1251
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That is to say.

1252
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
When your light.

1253
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Getting weaker and weaker.

1254
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
In fact.

1255
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It is.

1256
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
When it's low frequency.

1257
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It will have a lot of.

1258
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
classical.

1259
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Noise.

1260
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Or some.

1261
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Technical noise.

1262
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That.

1263
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You think about it.

1264
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Ah.

1265
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I just didn't say.

1266
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
One thing.

1267
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Is.

1268
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What is vacuum.

1269
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Vacuum.

1270
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It is.

1271
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Powerful.

1272
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That.

1273
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Remember.

1274
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That is.

1275
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Simple harmonic.

1276
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Oscillation.

1277
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Didn't I tell you.

1278
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
What.

1279
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
N plus.

1280
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
One-half.

1281
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
H8.

1282
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Omega.

1283
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That is.

1284
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That.

1285
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SHM.

1286
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The energy.

1287
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
That.

1288
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
When N is equal to 0.

1289
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
When vacuum.

1290
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
There is still a power.

1291
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That.

1292
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
When there is this energy.

1293
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It has its noise.

1294
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And.

1295
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Especially.

1296
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It is also a coherent state.

1297
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So.

1298
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
When.

1299
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You don't have any light.

1300
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It is also a coherent state.

1301
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Because it is a very pure.

1302
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Very pure.

1303
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Coherent state.

1304
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Otherwise.

1305
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You just think about it.

1306
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
When your power is getting weaker.

1307
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
When it gets weaker.

1308
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Is it.

1309
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
When it comes to the end.

1310
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Is it to be confined to vacuum.

1311
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
When.

1312
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It.

1313
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There can't be any other noise.

1314
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Hello.

1315
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I have a question.

1316
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay.

1317
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You ask.

1318
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Um.

1319
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That is.

1320
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Although these four lines are different.

1321
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But he actually has a complete.

1322
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That is.

1323
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
His four lines.

1324
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
In the end at that.

1325
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Low frequency.

1326
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
All over again.

1327
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
That.

1328
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It looks a bit like.

1329
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That is.

1330
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You can still excite a lot.

1331
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Vacuum.

1332
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The mold is there.

1333
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That.

1334
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I have always had a question from the beginning.

1335
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Because I was just thinking.

1336
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Listen to see if you will speak.

1337
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But I really want to ask now.

1338
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
That is.

1339
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Why do you use high temperature.

1340
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That is.

1341
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Not high temperature cavity.

1342
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Just use high temperature.

1343
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
That.

1344
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That.

1345
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Medium gas.

1346
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
If you make it.

1347
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Cloud.

1348
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Will it be suppressed?

1349
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
This.

1350
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This.

1351
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
This.

1352
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
This.

1353
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This.

1354
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
This.

1355
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
This.

1356
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
This.

1357
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
This.

1358
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Listen to sure to that.

1359
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I think.

1360
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That is, ah.

1361
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The one.

1362
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Pro memory element.

1363
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Is there one easy way.

1364
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Erm.

1365
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The sensor you.

1366
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Sense...

1367
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Essence...

1368
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's the sensor lightning.

1369
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It can hold thepot.

1370
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It can hold pot.

1371
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I.

1372
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah.

1373
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The projector.

1374
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
To the power to the power.

1375
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
To the light source.

1376
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The crow.

1377
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The camera, the night...

1378
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You kinda.

1379
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The lighting, right.

1380
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Camera and настро the light.

1381
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The lighting and the smoke.

1382
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So.

1383
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The light sources.

1384
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The destination.

1385
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And the plus.

1386
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Is also the usual Three...

1387
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The.

1388
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Resolution.

1389
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Is your.

1390
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Resolution.

1391
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The bandwidth.

1392
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Low.

1393
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
This will move backwards.

1394
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Keep moving backwards.

1395
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Keep moving backwards.

1396
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So if I can adjust it to a few hertz.

1397
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
When.

1398
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Then you'll be in.

1399
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
In.

1400
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
About one or two hertz.

1401
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You'll see this.

1402
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
One over F.

1403
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
The noise.

1404
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So.

1405
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So.

1406
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So this.

1407
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It doesn't really matter.

1408
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That.

1409
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's your resolution.

1410
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Is related.

1411
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Oh.

1412
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
With your resolution.

1413
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
With your resolution.

1414
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The bandwidth.

1415
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Is related.

1416
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay.

1417
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay.

1418
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

1419
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Okay.

1420
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Okay.

1421
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Okay.

1422
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Okay.

1423
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So.

1424
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So you can see.

1425
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The red line.

1426
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
At low frequency.

1427
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Its value.

1428
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
The noise.

1429
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Is only up to.

1430
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
One point.

1431
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
One point five kilohertz.

1432
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
When the blue line.

1433
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
This.

1434
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
This.

1435
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
This will be.

1436
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
One kilohertz.

1437
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That's the one.

1438
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That.

1439
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
That.

1440
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The Australian.

1441
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The Australian.

1442
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Paper.

1443
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That paper.

1444
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Is.

1445
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Is the same effect.

1446
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That is to say.

1447
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
When your.

1448
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Your light source.

1449
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Getting weaker and weaker.

1450
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
When your seed light is getting weaker and weaker.

1451
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's getting closer and closer to your.

1452
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Coherent state.

1453
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It is.

1454
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Shut noise limit.

1455
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But.

1456
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Is.

1457
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Coherent state.

1458
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The real coherent state light.

1459
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
No other.

1460
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Other classical noise.

1461
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Because any classical noise.

1462
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Will.

1463
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Disturb your.

1464
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The.

1465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Squeeze light.

1466
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yes.

1467
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So when our light is getting weaker and weaker.

1468
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We can see.

1469
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
More.

1470
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Better.

1471
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Low frequency.

1472
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The.

1473
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The light is getting weaker and weaker.

1474
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That.

1475
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That.

1476
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
This.

1477
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
This looks like nothing.

1478
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Because.

1479
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Because only.

1480
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Only.

1481
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
One kilohertz.

1482
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Only.

1483
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Then we.

1484
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's look at another way.

1485
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That is to say.

1486
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We.

1487
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This.

1488
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is.

1489
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The.

1490
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The.

1491
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The.

1492
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The.

1493
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The.

1494
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The.

1495
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
The.

1496
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The.

1497
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The.

1498
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The.

1499
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So its.

1500
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The more its coherent effect is.

1501
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's.

1502
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
The amplification efficiency is.

1503
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
What you hit a.

1504
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
You.

1505
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You've got a probion.

1506
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
In.

1507
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This.

1508
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Atomic substance.

1509
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It will produce 25 atomic.

1510
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
The 25 light particles.

1511
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That is to say, its magnification ratio is 25 times.

1512
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yes.

1513
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Then you want to see.

1514
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That is to say.

1515
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
When my.

1516
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
My game.

1517
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
The bigger it is.

1518
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That means.

1519
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The seed I need is getting weaker.

1520
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's what I need.

1521
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
When the seed is getting weaker.

1522
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I can see it.

1523
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Even lower and lower and lower.

1524
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
A few hundred hertz.

1525
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I can.

1526
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I can see the effect of the light particle.

1527
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yes.

1528
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That.

1529
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That this.

1530
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This is already us.

1531
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
About two or three years ago.

1532
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
The result of the cause.

1533
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But our boss insisted at that time.

1534
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Is.

1535
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
No.

1536
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There's nothing to publish.

1537
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yes.

1538
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
That.

1539
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Recently.

1540
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
China has a.

1541
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The research result is that they have.

1542
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Down to 700 hertz.

1543
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
About.

1544
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
700 hertz.

1545
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Then.

1546
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Send it out.

1547
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But then.

1548
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Our result.

1549
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The result we want to publish is.

1550
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
We have.

1551
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Down to about.

1552
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
About.

1553
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The result is 10 hertz or so.

1554
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That is.

1555
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
We.

1556
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We have.

1557
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
One order.

1558
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Another order.

1559
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Another order.

1560
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Going down.

1561
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That.

1562
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
That is.

1563
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Here is what I want to share.

1564
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That is.

1565
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Actually.

1566
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Sometimes, there is.

1567
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It takes some luck.

1568
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yes.

1569
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Some ideas are very sudden.

1570
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yes.

1571
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So.

1572
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Was.

1573
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
One day last year.

1574
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I went to my boss's office and said.

1575
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Why don't we add the second one?

1576
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Come in.

1577
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That is.

1578
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
There was only one light coming in.

1579
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Then.

1580
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Pro 1.

1581
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Country 1.

1582
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Then.

1583
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Why don't we add the second one?

1584
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yes.

1585
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
The boss said.

1586
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Because the second one is added.

1587
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It will become.

1588
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It's like doing another experiment.

1589
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That is.

1590
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Our lab is not just doing this.

1591
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Do another experiment.

1592
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Is.

1593
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Take.

1594
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Two.

1595
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Pumping.

1596
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Then.

1597
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Form a.

1598
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So-called single mode.

1599
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Squeeze.

1600
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That is.

1601
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Anyway, it's another experiment.

1602
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It's a bit.

1603
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
A little comparison.

1604
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It seems to become that kind of experiment.

1605
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But.

1606
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
After the boss finished explaining.

1607
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Anyway.

1608
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Just try it.

1609
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
No difference.

1610
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That is.

1611
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Take a.

1612
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
This.

1613
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Maybe a few minutes or a few hours.

1614
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
To try it.

1615
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Then.

1616
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I saw that.

1617
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
A different result came out.

1618
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That is.

1619
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Our record is like this.

1620
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Pushed down another order.

1621
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
To.

1622
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Nearly 10 Hz.

1623
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That is.

1624
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So.

1625
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Good.

1626
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Hey.

1627
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
This video should be the last one.

1628
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That is.

1629
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Anyway, we are now.

1630
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Which one is your latest result?

1631
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Ah.

1632
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
All.

1633
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
All.

1634
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That is.

1635
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
This result is used.

1636
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We hit two lights.

1637
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Go in.

1638
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That is.

1639
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I just.

1640
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I only showed.

1641
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The experiment in the front.

1642
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Only.

1643
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The first light.

1644
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Pumping.

1645
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
With pumping.

1646
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Do.

1647
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Interaction only.

1648
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
That.

1649
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
All the following data.

1650
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Are two lights.

1651
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
That is.

1652
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Most of the data.

1653
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Are two lights.

1654
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I.

1655
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Use a beam splitter.

1656
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You all.

1657
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Can you all see my shoulder?

1658
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That is.

1659
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Oh, yes.

1660
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This is the beam splitter.

1661
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Divide it.

1662
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Will divide.

1663
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Half of the light.

1664
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Finished.

1665
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes.

1666
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You have the second probing.

1667
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
After the second probing comes in.

1668
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It will produce another.

1669
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Conjugate.

1670
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That is.

1671
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That.

1672
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Then you will see.

1673
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Hey.

1674
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Our experiment result is.

1675
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
When your.

1676
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Ah.

1677
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This red line.

1678
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Are all shot noise.

1679
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
But I am from.

1680
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
100 kHz.

1681
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Draw to.

1682
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
1 Hz.

1683
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That is.

1684
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That red line.

1685
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Is shot noise.

1686
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That.

1687
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Blue line.

1688
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Is.

1689
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
That.

1690
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh.

1691
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I will talk about it later.

1692
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That is.

1693
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Anyway.

1694
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Blue.

1695
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
These blue lines and black lines.

1696
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Are our new.

1697
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Our new experiment result.

1698
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That.

1699
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This picture.

1700
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Just want to tell you.

1701
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
A phenomenon.

1702
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That is.

1703
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
We.

1704
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
In practice.

1705
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
That is.

1706
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
We.

1707
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We.

1708
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Before.

1709
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Break through to a few hundred Hz.

1710
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That.

1711
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Break through to a few hundred Hz.

1712
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The main.

1713
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The limit is.

1714
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It has a background noise.

1715
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
That.

1716
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Where did the background noise come from?

1717
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
From this pump.

1718
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
After this pump is hit.

1719
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
We are using.

1720
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A beam splitter.

1721
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Filter it.

1722
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But it still has.

1723
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Its.

1724
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Correlation.

1725
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Not so pure.

1726
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So it will have.

1727
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So-called leakage.

1728
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That leakage.

1729
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Will.

1730
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Will pollute your.

1731
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Probe and.

1732
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Conjugate.

1733
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Will cause.

1734
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You will see this green line.

1735
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The green line is.

1736
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
We put.

1737
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Probe in.

1738
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Blocked.

1739
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So we only have.

1740
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We.

1741
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
We can't measure anything.

1742
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But wrong.

1743
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You still have to measure.

1744
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
This.

1745
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Green line.

1746
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
What is this green line?

1747
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's your pump.

1748
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The leakage.

1749
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Run to your probe.

1750
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And.

1751
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Conjugate in.

1752
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So.

1753
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So.

1754
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So this.

1755
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Limits us.

1756
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Our technology.

1757
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That is to say.

1758
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We could.

1759
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Our original technology is.

1760
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
From a few kHz.

1761
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Then.

1762
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Compressed to a few hundred kHz.

1763
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
That.

1764
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Why can't.

1765
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Compressed down.

1766
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Because.

1767
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We have a background here.

1768
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Pump.

1769
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Flash.

1770
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Pump.

1771
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Light.

1772
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Will pollute.

1773
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Your.

1774
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Green beam.

1775
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That.

1776
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Of course.

1777
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The story is not like this.

1778
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But anyway.

1779
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
We just go.

1780
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Just.

1781
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't know why.

1782
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I just put that.

1783
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Adjusting that light.

1784
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't know why.

1785
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Then.

1786
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Adjusting.

1787
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
That pump.

1788
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It becomes weak.

1789
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And then.

1790
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
To measure this.

1791
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It turned out to be.

1792
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I made the angle bigger.

1793
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Just like this.

1794
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Make the angle bigger.

1795
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That.

1796
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Pump's leakage.

1797
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Will become.

1798
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Gray line.

1799
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So beautiful.

1800
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So low.

1801
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So.

1802
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
We.

1803
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Just like this.

1804
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
As long as we make the angle bigger.

1805
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Then.

1806
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You will see the black line.

1807
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Then.

1808
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That squeeze light.

1809
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Will.

1810
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Drop to about 10 kHz.

1811
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That.

1812
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Anyway.

1813
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This.

1814
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
This.

1815
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
This.

1816
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
This.

1817
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
This.

1818
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
This.

1819
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
This.

1820
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
This.

1821
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
This.

1822
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
This.

1823
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
This.

1824
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
This.

1825
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
This.

1826
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So.

1827
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean.

1828
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This.

1829
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This experiment.

1830
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That is.

1831
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Blue.

1832
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Red.

1833
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
This blue line is all.

1834
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Shot noise.

1835
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That red line is to say.

1836
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We only hit one light.

1837
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Then.

1838
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
We.

1839
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
We put Probeam.

1840
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Put.

1841
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Put it.

1842
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
A little lower.

1843
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Let Probeam and Country Creeper.

1844
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
The pump is the same.

1845
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Then.

1846
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
To measure the squeeze light.

1847
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Then.

1848
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's so scary.

1849
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Right.

1850
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Then if we hit two lights in.

1851
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
After.

1852
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
This.

1853
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
This.

1854
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
This.

1855
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You don't have to lock the laser at all.

1856
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The laser is not locked at all.

1857
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But you can also lock the laser.

1858
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
After you lock the laser.

1859
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Your laser line.

1860
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
From a few megahertz to.

1861
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
About a few hundred hertz.

1862
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Or kilohertz.

1863
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Then you will see.

1864
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Just that one.

1865
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
One light.

1866
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Will become.

1867
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You.

1868
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You can see.

1869
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Better.

1870
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Magnetic field effect.

1871
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But.

1872
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Two lights.

1873
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Still more.

1874
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
More perfect.

1875
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Then we can even do it.

1876
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
About.

1877
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Six hertz.

1878
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
This is our current.

1879
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Then.

1880
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Then this is of course.

1881
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We still have some.

1882
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Dust in the air.

1883
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Fall into your.

1884
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Light path.

1885
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Will interfere.

1886
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Your beam.

1887
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So we will.

1888
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Do some.

1889
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Cover it.

1890
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Then you can.

1891
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Make it beautiful.

1892
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I don't know.

1893
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You can make it very low.

1894
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like this.

1895
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah.

1896
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That.

1897
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
This is.

1898
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Can go back to the next one.

1899
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The next one.

1900
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Hey.

1901
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Method 1.

1902
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Method 2.

1903
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
In fact.

1904
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I just saw you.

1905
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Because you are.

1906
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There's an ice.

1907
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Split.

1908
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So.

1909
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
For example.

1910
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Your method 1.

1911
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
With method 2.

1912
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Probe.

1913
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The total energy is the same.

1914
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I think so.

1915
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Is it right?

1916
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Yes.

1917
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yes.

1918
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
That is to say.

1919
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Your method 1.

1920
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Your terminal.

1921
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Maybe.

1922
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
The terminal is.

1923
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
10 microwatt.

1924
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That method 2 is.

1925
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Five.

1926
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Five microwatt.

1927
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yeah.

1928
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah.

1929
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
What's that?

1930
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Physics.

1931
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Principles.

1932
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Physics.

1933
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Principles.

1934
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Can you explain.

1935
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's in.

1936
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Let him.

1937
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This.

1938
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Is it so different?

1939
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Why?

1940
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Because I think.

1941
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Method 1.

1942
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Method 2.

1943
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
His.

1944
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
This.

1945
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Angle.

1946
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It should be harder.

1947
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The same.

1948
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I.

1949
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I mean.

1950
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That is to say.

1951
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Why can he.

1952
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That is to say.

1953
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Causing.

1954
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Such a big difference now.

1955
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

1956
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Do you know?

1957
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This method 1.

1958
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That is.

1959
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I hit the light.

1960
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The terminal.

1961
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
The terminal is 1.

1962
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And then after this magnification.

1963
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
After the ring.

1964
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The light coming out is G.

1965
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Right?

1966
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's my country.

1967
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
This curve.

1968
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's G minus 1.

1969
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Because he doesn't have a terminal.

1970
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So his power is G minus 1.

1971
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
For him.

1972
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
There has always been a power difference.

1973
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's the E.

1974
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The difference of that terminal.

1975
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But.

1976
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Your frequency.

1977
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
If Zhang Yuan.

1978
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Piao.

1979
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Piao.

1980
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That is to say.

1981
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
If you don't fix its frequency in the laser.

1982
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Your.

1983
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
When your frequency is floating.

1984
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Your game.

1985
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Your magnification.

1986
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The magnification ratio is always floating there.

1987
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So you will get a different magnification ratio.

1988
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
At different times.

1989
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
As a result.

1990
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You will have additional noise.

1991
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah.

1992
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
But method 2.

1993
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
That is to say.

1994
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You hit.

1995
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
0.5 in.

1996
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
He came out G times 0.5.

1997
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
That.

1998
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
His country can be 0.5 times.

1999
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
G minus 1.

2000
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Right?

2001
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But.

2002
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Your other light.

2003
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's also the opposite.

2004
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
There is also a G generation.

2005
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
That you originally here.

2006
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
G minus 1.

2007
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
With your G.

2008
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Add up like this.

2009
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The power difference on both sides.

2010
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's zero.

2011
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
No matter how your frequency floats.

2012
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Your.

2013
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Total.

2014
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Power difference.

2015
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
All the same.

2016
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You.

2017
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You have.

2018
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You have understood.

2019
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'm not talking about this point.

2020
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
There is.

2021
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But I'm thinking.

2022
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That is.

2023
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You do this experiment today.

2024
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
The main purpose.

2025
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Is to get.

2026
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You.

2027
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
The last.

2028
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
This is produced.

2029
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Conjugate.

2030
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
This is a perfect.

2031
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Conjugate.

2032
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Not.

2033
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Ah.

2034
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Not.

2035
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I just.

2036
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Let me.

2037
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because.

2038
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We.

2039
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We here.

2040
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
This.

2041
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Conjugate.

2042
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
There will be a power difference.

2043
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Then.

2044
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I just want to put this.

2045
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The power difference.

2046
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Eliminate it.

2047
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Then you can see.

2048
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
At.

2049
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Very low frequency.

2050
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I can still see.

2051
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That is.

2052
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You.

2053
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Also.

2054
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
At the time of input.

2055
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Already.

2056
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The so-called classical noise.

2057
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Already.

2058
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Eliminate it.

2059
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
This classical.

2060
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Or the mechanical noise.

2061
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because it will be.

2062
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You.

2063
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You two.

2064
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Pro beam.

2065
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Pro 1 and Pro 2.

2066
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Both.

2067
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The same classical noise.

2068
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Then you.

2069
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The same.

2070
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
As soon as you go in.

2071
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Already.

2072
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Already.

2073
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Eliminated.

2074
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So you come out.

2075
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Also very clean.

2076
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
There are two.

2077
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Enlarged.

2078
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Total power.

2079
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's exactly the same.

2080
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Even your frequency.

2081
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Your laser light.

2082
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Did not shrink.

2083
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
His.

2084
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
His.

2085
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Total power.

2086
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Always fixed.

2087
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Correct.

2088
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It's a bit hard to imagine.

2089
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But.

2090
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Oh.

2091
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Can.

2092
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
This.

2093
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Continue.

2094
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
No, it's.

2095
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Okay.

2096
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You.

2097
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You continue to finish.

2098
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
No.

2099
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Actually.

2100
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I'm almost done.

2101
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That is to say.

2102
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
We.

2103
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
This time is.

2104
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
There is no.

2105
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Capacity inside.

2106
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Like I just said.

2107
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Some.

2108
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Opio.

2109
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Capacity.

2110
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So the light they emit.

2111
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Not.

2112
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Multi-spatial mode.

2113
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So it can't be used.

2114
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Image processing.

2115
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Correct.

2116
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Then.

2117
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
We are almost ready now.

2118
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We are even.

2119
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Below 10 Hz.

2120
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
We can all see this.

2121
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Volume noise reduction.

2122
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
What is this?

2123
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What is the importance of this?

2124
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'll tell you later.

2125
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Correct.

2126
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Then.

2127
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
We will now.

2128
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That is.

2129
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Low frequency noise reduction.

2130
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Can only do.

2131
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
About 6 Hz.

2132
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The main reason is.

2133
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
We still have other.

2134
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Laboratory.

2135
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Light.

2136
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Light table.

2137
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Or what.

2138
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Stability.

2139
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The problem.

2140
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Correct.

2141
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Then we have this laser.

2142
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
For missing.

2143
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Squeeze line.

2144
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It is.

2145
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Portable.

2146
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It is.

2147
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's not a big one.

2148
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
It's a diode laser.

2149
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Then again.

2150
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Compared to.

2151
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's a lot cheaper.

2152
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Correct.

2153
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You can do it for $30,000.

2154
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Then.

2155
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We.

2156
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
We will use it later.

2157
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Do.

2158
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Image experiment.

2159
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Then this image experiment.

2160
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
That is to say.

2161
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
We will have a mask.

2162
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
This.

2163
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
A mask.

2164
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Will put a laser beam.

2165
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Use a.

2166
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
A mask.

2167
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Block it.

2168
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Then.

2169
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It will produce.

2170
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
A.

2171
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Totoro.

2172
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Conjugate Totoro.

2173
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Then this is.

2174
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Conjugate.

2175
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So they.

2176
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Go.

2177
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Turn it.

2178
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
About 180 degrees.

2179
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Something like that.

2180
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Then they cut each other.

2181
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
You can see this.

2182
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Image.

2183
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
The.

2184
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
This.

2185
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
This is called imaging.

2186
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
That is.

2187
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Quantum quality imaging.

2188
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That.

2189
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Because.

2190
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You.

2191
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
If you can't.

2192
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
In all frequencies.

2193
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
When you see this quantum noise.

2194
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That is to say.

2195
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
If you are in low frequency.

2196
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
When.

2197
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
If there is a lot of physical noise.

2198
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Then you.

2199
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
When you are doing.

2200
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Image experiment.

2201
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You are.

2202
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Open the shutter.

2203
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So open the camera shutter.

2204
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It is to put all.

2205
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Frequency.

2206
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Noise.

2207
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Collect it all.

2208
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So you are in low frequency.

2209
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
If you can't see the quantum noise.

2210
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It will destroy your whole image.

2211
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So.

2212
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Our previous.

2213
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
The.

2214
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Can't do it.

2215
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
This.

2216
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
This imaging.

2217
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The main difficulty is that.

2218
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We can't do it in low frequency.

2219
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
This.

2220
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
The quantum noise.

2221
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
That is to say.

2222
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
That.

2223
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Another application is.

2224
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Absolute correction.

2225
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That.

2226
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That is to say.

2227
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
If this.

2228
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
The light.

2229
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Is coming in one by one.

2230
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That.

2231
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It.

2232
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Once enlarged.

2233
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Double.

2234
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Ten times the light.

2235
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
That.

2236
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You will see probing.

2237
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
That.

2238
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The same.

2239
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Also.

2240
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
The same.

2241
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
The same number of.

2242
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The light comes out.

2243
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So you.

2244
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
This.

2245
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Dictator A.

2246
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And the following dictator.

2247
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They must.

2248
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The same light.

2249
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And so.

2250
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
The time.

2251
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The position must be the same.

2252
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So when.

2253
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
The above.

2254
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
The dictator.

2255
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Receive my.

2256
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
When the light.

2257
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It will tell you the following.

2258
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I received one.

2259
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Did you receive one?

2260
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Correct.

2261
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
If I received.

2262
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
100.

2263
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I told the other party.

2264
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I received 100.

2265
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You.

2266
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
If you only received.

2267
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
97.

2268
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's when.

2269
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Your quantum efficiency.

2270
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's only 97%.

2271
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Correct.

2272
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So.

2273
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
That is to say.

2274
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The traditional quantum.

2275
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The traditional.

2276
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Calibration.

2277
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The proof is.

2278
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I have.

2279
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
In addition.

2280
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Another.

2281
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Dictator.

2282
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
That this dictator.

2283
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I already know.

2284
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
What is its efficiency.

2285
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Then I compare the two.

2286
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I can compare.

2287
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
What is my relative efficiency.

2288
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
What is the relative quantum conversion efficiency.

2289
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So.

2290
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
If you have one.

2291
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Already know.

2292
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And then know the relative.

2293
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Then you know.

2294
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
This.

2295
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Calibration after.

2296
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
What is the result.

2297
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
But.

2298
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
This.

2299
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The way is to say.

2300
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I don't have to know the above.

2301
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Or the following.

2302
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Quantum efficiency.

2303
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I can all.

2304
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Get.

2305
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Absolute.

2306
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Calibration.

2307
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
That quantum efficiency.

2308
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Correct.

2309
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
That is.

2310
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
We can use.

2311
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
To do.

2312
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
To make up.

2313
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So.

2314
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's about it.

2315
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Thank you all.

2316
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If.

2317
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Any questions.

2318
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Welcome to ask.

2319
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Does anyone have a question?

2320
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Hello.

2321
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Hi.

2322
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Do you want to ask first?

2323
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You ask first.

2324
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You ask first.

2325
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I actually.

2326
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Because you just mentioned that.

2327
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Gravitational wave.

2328
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Is this LIGO?

2329
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yes.

2330
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
But I think this thing.

2331
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Than.

2332
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's a hundred times better than LIGO.

2333
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I think.

2334
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Okay, I'll say it like this.

2335
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
In fact, there is no.

2336
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
LIGO.

2337
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
They are an international.

2338
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Many countries' plan.

2339
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So I think.

2340
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
We use a very simple way.

2341
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I immediately thought of one.

2342
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Application.

2343
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
That's it.

2344
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
LIGO.

2345
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Its frequency.

2346
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
In fact, it is much higher than here.

2347
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That's a lot higher.

2348
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The reason is that he can only do that.

2349
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Ah.

2350
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
If you do that.

2351
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
He can only measure.

2352
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's close to the earth.

2353
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's also the red.

2354
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Reddish.

2355
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Smaller.

2356
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Gravitational wave.

2357
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So he can only measure.

2358
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
The so-called contemporary universe.

2359
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The occurrence of phenomena.

2360
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
For example.

2361
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Planet collision.

2362
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Black hole collision.

2363
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Those.

2364
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
For cosmology.

2365
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Or high-energy physics.

2366
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Very interesting.

2367
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Is the ancient gravitational wave.

2368
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Then they happened a long time ago.

2369
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Then it has been.

2370
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Very big.

2371
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Very big.

2372
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Redshifted.

2373
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
To.

2374
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Very low frequency.

2375
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Yes.

2376
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Then this thing can be used.

2377
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Yes.

2378
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That is to say.

2379
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Now.

2380
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I know China.

2381
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Japan.

2382
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
India.

2383
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
They are all developing.

2384
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Just like LIGO.

2385
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Of.

2386
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This kind of interference.

2387
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Ah.

2388
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We.

2389
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This method is.

2390
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Twin beam.

2391
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Of course.

2392
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
LIGO.

2393
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
They hope to be single mode.

2394
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Just a single light.

2395
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Um.

2396
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But we can also do that experiment.

2397
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
No problem.

2398
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yes.

2399
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But the other point is.

2400
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
LIGO.

2401
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
They only want your wave.

2402
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Not.

2403
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Ah.

2404
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
1024.

2405
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
No meter.

2406
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It seems that as long as you are not that wave.

2407
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They.

2408
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They don't want it.

2409
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Anyway.

2410
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
You.

2411
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
All their devices are for.

2412
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
1024.

2413
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
That wave.

2414
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So.

2415
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Our 795 wave.

2416
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It's far from them.

2417
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So they don't want it.

2418
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
But actually.

2419
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Basically physics.

2420
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There is no difficulty.

2421
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So you can only.

2422
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
As long as you find.

2423
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That frequency.

2424
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
The light source.

2425
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's OK.

2426
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I tell you.

2427
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You can check an experiment.

2428
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
There is an experiment called LISA.

2429
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
L.I.S.A.

2430
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
That is a.

2431
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
LIGO in space.

2432
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I think that thing.

2433
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
May be for this.

2434
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's very.

2435
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Is.

2436
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's suitable for use.

2437
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
But.

2438
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
This.

2439
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I think I.

2440
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's more important to do it first.

2441
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So.

2442
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Of course.

2443
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Of course.

2444
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
They.

2445
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
They care.

2446
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I don't care.

2447
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh.

2448
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
OK.

2449
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I think it's very good.

2450
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Thank you.

2451
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Thank you.

2452
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Hey.

2453
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I want to ask.

2454
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's your last one.

2455
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Uh.

2456
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
In the next one.

2457
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So.

2458
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Do you want to do it?

2459
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Like a single-ray experiment?

2460
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So.

2461
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You like this.

2462
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The setup is very similar to that.

2463
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Red capital.

2464
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
H.O.M.

2465
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
The experiment.

2466
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Do you want to do that?

2467
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Or you.

2468
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Actually.

2469
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
This is just a demo.

2470
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I want to tell you.

2471
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
How did he.

2472
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
His.

2473
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
His.

2474
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
His.

2475
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
His.

2476
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
His.

2477
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
His idea is to make it.

2478
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
With respect to.

2479
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That is to say.

2480
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It.

2481
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
The two are unknown.

2482
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
The two emitted efficiency are indecisive.

2483
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So.

2484
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It's like I give you a ball.

2485
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I said at the same time.

2486
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Give one ball to another person.

2487
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Then you two can interact with each other.

2488
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Do some coexistence cornets.

2489
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
The co-efficient of yourselves.

2490
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
This.

2491
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
This is a demo.

2492
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
But the real garbage has grown this way.

2493
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
He gave it to the patient.

2494
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Then test its co-efficient relationship.

2495
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Get.

2496
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The so-called quantum quantum.

2497
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
That one.

2498
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Dictator's quantum efficiency.

2499
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Then we.

2500
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
This experiment should.

2501
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
To get a.

2502
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Very.

2503
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The reason to use low-quality quantum compression is because.

2504
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
We.

2505
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
To be with.

2506
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The national standard group.

2507
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
The already known co-efficient should be compared.

2508
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Then.

2509
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Then I.

2510
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
The boss gave me the goal.

2511
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That is.

2512
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
As long as we can get.

2513
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Below 1 kilohertz.

2514
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That.

2515
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
1 kilohertz is about the same as 200 hertz.

2516
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
But we keep doing it like this.

2517
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Keep doing it to 10 hertz.

2518
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So.

2519
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We will become.

2520
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Any.

2521
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Almost any frequency.

2522
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
We can.

2523
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Just do the quantum correction.

2524
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Correct.

2525
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That question is.

2526
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Is.

2527
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Maybe it has nothing to do with what I did.

2528
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Hello.

2529
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I didn't understand.

2530
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Say it again.

2531
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh, that's your question.

2532
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Ah, actually, I don't understand it either.

2533
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Because.

2534
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Because we.

2535
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We are just very simple.

2536
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
To measure his.

2537
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Co-efficient.

2538
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Then go to his.

2539
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That.

2540
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Dictator's quantum efficiency.

2541
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That's it.

2542
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
No.

2543
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Nothing else to do.

2544
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Oh, no.

2545
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Because of that.

2546
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Hey.

2547
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You just said this.

2548
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
This experiment.

2549
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Then.

2550
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
From this.

2551
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
With.

2552
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
This has nothing to do with China.

2553
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
There is an experiment called Hong.

2554
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I know you said that Hong.

2555
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Right.

2556
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
HOM.

2557
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yes.

2558
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
That.

2559
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I look like.

2560
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Is.

2561
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Should be.

2562
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Conceptually very similar to that.

2563
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Right.

2564
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yes.

2565
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
But we.

2566
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Mainly to measure his quantum.

2567
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Is.

2568
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Not.

2569
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Measure his.

2570
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Yes.

2571
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I understand.

2572
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yes.

2573
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Hello.

2574
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Hey.

2575
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I want to ask a question.

2576
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Uh.

2577
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Is.

2578
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You produce here.

2579
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Uh.

2580
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
This is your program here.

2581
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
This.

2582
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Conjugate disease.

2583
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
They.

2584
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
After production.

2585
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
They are still.

2586
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
They are coherent.

2587
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Uh.

2588
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
No.

2589
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
They are thermal.

2590
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
This is a coherent disease.

2591
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Still.

2592
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Squeeze.

2593
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Uh.

2594
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Just.

2595
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Only.

2596
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Proceed.

2597
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Is.

2598
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Coherent disease.

2599
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It produces.

2600
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Is.

2601
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Thermal disease.

2602
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Is.

2603
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
The noise.

2604
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Is.

2605
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Coherent disease.

2606
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Hundreds of times.

2607
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Is.

2608
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It is.

2609
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Very.

2610
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
A.

2611
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Thermal noise.

2612
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Is.

2613
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That is.

2614
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
He.

2615
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
He.

2616
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Than the original.

2617
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Coherent.

2618
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Coherent disease.

2619
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
About.

2620
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
About.

2621
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
15.

2622
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
TB.

2623
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Is.

2624
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
2.

2625
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
5.

2626
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Square.

2627
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So.

2628
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
So.

2629
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Big.

2630
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So.

2631
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Probing.

2632
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
These two lights.

2633
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Reduce.

2634
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
That is to say.

2635
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
They are magnified at the same time.

2636
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
They are.

2637
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Quantum.

2638
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Co-related.

2639
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Then.

2640
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
When I.

2641
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Although it is 2.

2642
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
5.

2643
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Square.

2644
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
More.

2645
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Magnification.

2646
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But when the two.

2647
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
After reduction.

2648
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
We are.

2649
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Get a.

2650
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Very.

2651
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Clean.

2652
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Intensity.

2653
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Difference.

2654
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Squeeze light.

2655
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
This is.

2656
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Coherent.

2657
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Still.

2658
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Magnification.

2659
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Light.

2660
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Is.

2661
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Also.

2662
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Thermal.

2663
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
OK.

2664
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Then.

2665
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The reason is because.

2666
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
You are using.

2667
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Atom.

2668
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
That is.

2669
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It has a lot of.

2670
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
3D scattering.

2671
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Just.

2672
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Because.

2673
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
As long as you magnify.

2674
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Should say.

2675
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Any.

2676
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
This non-linear magnification.

2677
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
After magnification.

2678
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Is.

2679
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Thermal disease.

2680
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
OK.

2681
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That is.

2682
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But.

2683
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Second harmonic.

2684
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Or.

2685
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
General.

2686
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Forward mixing.

2687
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Is it?

2688
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I actually don't know.

2689
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Their.

2690
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
OK.

2691
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Second harmonic.

2692
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Is it?

2693
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I don't think so.

2694
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Maybe.

2695
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Because they are.

2696
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Second harmonic.

2697
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Can also be used.

2698
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Just like.

2699
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Some.

2700
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Do.

2701
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
They are.

2702
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
What frequency.

2703
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
To use.

2704
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Second harmonic.

2705
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
To.

2706
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Create the next frequency.

2707
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Higher frequency.

2708
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That.

2709
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Is.

2710
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It must be.

2711
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Laser beam.

2712
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
To do some experiments.

2713
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
If it is not.

2714
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Laser beam.

2715
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Then.

2716
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's useless.

2717
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So.

2718
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Second harmonic.

2719
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I think it should be.

2720
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Coherent beam.

2721
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yes.

2722
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It should be.

2723
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Your probe and conjugate.

2724
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Is thermal.

2725
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yes.

2726
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But I.

2727
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
This is.

2728
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Power magnification.

2729
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I guess.

2730
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Second harmonic.

2731
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It.

2732
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Its power is still.

2733
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Conservation.

2734
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Still forward.

2735
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But.

2736
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You put.

2737
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Probe and conjugate.

2738
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You will.

2739
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Get one.

2740
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Is amplitude.

2741
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Squeeze the light.

2742
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Is it?

2743
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Is.

2744
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You can't.

2745
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Conjugate.

2746
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Is.

2747
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You can't.

2748
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Amplitude.

2749
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Is.

2750
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Its intensity.

2751
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Difference.

2752
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
OK.

2753
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes.

2754
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Then.

2755
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I have a question.

2756
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Is.

2757
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Your.

2758
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Weak.

2759
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Is.

2760
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
There is an experiment.

2761
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Is.

2762
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
You put.

2763
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Probe.

2764
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Seed.

2765
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Seed.

2766
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Intensity.

2767
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Strengthening.

2768
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And.

2769
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Angle.

2770
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yes.

2771
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Then.

2772
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
You said there.

2773
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Will.

2774
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Is.

2775
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
The frequency.

2776
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Will.

2777
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Go down.

2778
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Why.

2779
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Because.

2780
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Because.

2781
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I.

2782
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I have to have a seed.

2783
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I.

2784
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I need to have a seed.

2785
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Come in.

2786
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That is.

2787
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You.

2788
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You see.

2789
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Method 1.

2790
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
After I come in.

2791
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Then.

2792
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
If I have a seed.

2793
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Not.

2794
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Cohesive state.

2795
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Low frequency.

2796
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Not.

2797
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Cohesive state.

2798
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Because.

2799
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
You.

2800
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Your laser is low frequency.

2801
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
In fact.

2802
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
There are many.

2803
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Other impurities come in.

2804
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Do.

2805
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The effect of low frequency.

2806
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
When the effect.

2807
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
My AOM has given him another impurity.

2808
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And.

2809
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
There are more.

2810
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
More.

2811
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Very scary impurities.

2812
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Like this.

2813
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
But.

2814
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
More than 10 dB.

2815
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yes.

2816
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So.

2817
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
When you.

2818
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You.

2819
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
You hit this light.

2820
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Getting weaker and weaker.

2821
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
When.

2822
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
These ancient.

2823
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Impurities.

2824
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Will be.

2825
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Non-linear.

2826
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Take it.

2827
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Take it.

2828
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Take it.

2829
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Cut off.

2830
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
That is.

2831
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
These ancient impurities.

2832
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Not with you.

2833
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The power is.

2834
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It's a.

2835
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It's a non-linear way.

2836
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Cut off.

2837
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Cut off.

2838
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
When vacuuming.

2839
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You don't have any impurities.

2840
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Because vacuuming is.

2841
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Cohesive state.

2842
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So.

2843
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It has a non-linear.

2844
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Take it.

2845
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Into a.

2846
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
A.

2847
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Cohesive state.

2848
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Effect.

2849
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Oh.

2850
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I mean.

2851
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Just.

2852
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Ancient impurities.

2853
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Will not be.

2854
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Will not be magnified.

2855
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Then.

2856
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Quantum impurities.

2857
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Will be magnified.

2858
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Ah.

2859
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I mean.

2860
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Ancient impurities.

2861
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You can use.

2862
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Reduce the power.

2863
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Green it off.

2864
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
OK.

2865
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes.

2866
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That.

2867
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Quantum way.

2868
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You can't.

2869
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Green it off.

2870
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
OK.

2871
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yes.

2872
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Then.

2873
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Uh.

2874
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
The last question.

2875
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It's.

2876
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's.

2877
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Now these.

2878
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
This.

2879
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Dicephyl laser.

2880
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
With.

2881
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Dial laser.

2882
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
To compare.

2883
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It's.

2884
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It's.

2885
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Who is it?

2886
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Uh.

2887
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
It's.

2888
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I'm.

2889
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Is.

2890
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It'

2891
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Is.

2892
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Is.

2893
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Still.

2894
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Still.

2895
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Net.

2896
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
You.

2897
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Still.

2898
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Still.

2899
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It's.

2900
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It's.

2901
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It's.

2902
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Still.

2903
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Too.

2904
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Still.

2905
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Not just now.

2906
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So yes.

2907

2909
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It's.

2910
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Quite.

2911
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's.

2912
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
It's.

2913
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Iya.

2914
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Time.

2915
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Better.

2916
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Speed telekinesis better.

2917
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,020
Do you know?

2918
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,020
It's.

2919
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,020
Deal.

2920
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,020
Why?

2921
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,020
Is.

2922
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,020
Questions.

2923
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:53,020
Are.

2924
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,020
You.

2925
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,020
Your corners.

2926
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,020
Girl.

2927
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:57,020
Yet.

2928
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,020
Don't assume it.

2929
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,380
Because that's partner.

2930
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:00,380
Web-site.

2931
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,380
Okay.

2932
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,380
Don't assume.

2933
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,380
Right?

2934
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,380
See a second.

2935
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,380
There's.

2936
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,380
The coordination.

2937
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,380
Right.

2938
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,380
I'm.

2939
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,380
It's.

2940
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,380
It's.

2941
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,380
It's.

2942
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,380
Tight.

2943
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,380
So.

2944
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,380
plus or minus.

2945
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,380

2946
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
Okay.

2947
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,800
Oh.

2948
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Good.

2949
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Oh.

2950
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
Hello.

2951
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,800
How are you?

2952
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,800
My name is peter.

2953
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,680
When will you start the team.

2954
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,680
Yes.

2955
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,680
Uh.

2956
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,680
So I.

2957
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,680
My mood.

2958
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,680
Uh.

2959
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,680
Yeah.

2960
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,680
Uh.

2961
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Time is expensive.

2962
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
Yeah.

2963
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,680
Uh uh.

2964
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,680
And.

2965
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,680
Uh.

2966
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:38,620
Uh.

2967
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,960
You can ask me or I'll be in California next week.

2968
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,580
I'll be in California next week for a meeting for a week.

2969
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,380
And I'll be reporting the results.

2970
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:52,260
If there's any place you'd like to recommend, you can tell me.

2971
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,260
Thank you.

2972
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,380
Are you going to Clio?

2973
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,660
Yeah, I'm going to Clio.

2974
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,580
Oh, okay.

2975
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:01,780
Are you going too?

2976
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,220
Yeah, I'm going too.

2977
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,660
Oh, we'll see each other on Saturday.

2978
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,960
I'll be reporting on Sunday afternoon.

2979
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh, okay. I haven't seen when I'll be reporting.

2980
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,120
Oh, really?

2981
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:17,500
Actually, our idea of two lights

2982
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,800
also solves another problem with Dialazer.

2983
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,000
If I keep talking, I won't be able to finish.

2984
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,060
So, it's also in Clio.

2985
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,960
We'll be doing the same experiment on Sundays.

2986
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,360
I'll be reporting on Sundays.

2987
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,860
I'll see if I have time to listen.

2988
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,060
Okay, welcome.

2989
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,260
Thank you.

2990
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,260
You're welcome.

2991
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,060
So, that's it.

2992
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,260
Thank you, everyone.

2993
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,060
Thank you.
