0	9000	Hello, everyone.
9000	15000	I am honored to be able to introduce Dr. Sun today.
15000	23000	Dr. Sun completed her bachelor's degree from 1999 to 2013
23000	28000	in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Taiwan University.
28000	35000	After completing her bachelor's degree from 2003 to 2005,
35000	43000	she completed her master's degree in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the same university in Taiwan.
43000	51000	She then completed her Ph.D. degree from 2005 to 2010 at Purdue University.
51000	54000	Her major is Chemical Biology.
54000	58000	After completing her Ph.D. degree, she went to MIT to do her postdoc.
58000	68000	After four years, she went to UCSF to do her second postdoc and assistant researcher.
68000	75000	This year, she started her new job as a Senior Scientific Researcher at Genentech.
76000	80000	Today, Dr. Sun is going to talk about
80000	85000	Use Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Tackle Complex Biology.
85000	89000	Now, let's welcome Dr. Sun to give her presentation.
94000	97000	Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Sun.
97000	104000	Sorry, my voice is a bit hoarse due to my cold.
104000	111000	Today, I am going to talk in a simple and easy-to-understand way.
111000	115000	Just in case, some of you may not have a background in biology.
115000	121000	I hope you can at least learn about Single-Cell RNA-Seq.
122000	128000	Here is my personal email and LinkedIn account.
128000	132000	Although my LinkedIn account is not up to date,
132000	135000	please feel free to connect with me.
138000	143000	I will be speaking in Chinese today,
143000	148000	but I am not sure what the term is in Chinese.
149000	157000	If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
159000	165000	I don't want to make it too complicated.
165000	168000	I will be focusing on technology.
168000	171000	I am currently working at a company,
171000	176000	so I can't really talk about research projects here.
176000	182000	I will try my best to talk about the applications of this technology,
182000	184000	and the principles behind it.
184000	189000	I hope this will be helpful to those who are interested.
190000	193000	Before we get into the technology,
193000	197000	I will briefly review the biology of NTU.
199000	203000	As you may already know, our body is made up of cells.
204000	207000	Many cells form organs,
207000	211000	and eventually form organs in our body,
211000	214000	becoming a functional human body.
214000	224000	An interesting fact is that our body is composed of over 20 different types of cells.
224000	229000	You can see that their forms and functions are very different.
230000	235000	For example, there are nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells,
235000	241000	and even different types of cells in different organs.
241000	246000	Their functions and forms are very different.
248000	251000	Let's take a deeper look.
251000	255000	As you can see, our body is made up of cells.
255000	259000	Each cell has a nucleus,
259000	261000	which is a red dot.
261000	263000	In English, it's called a nucleus.
263000	265000	In Chinese, it's called a cell nucleus.
265000	269000	In this cell nucleus, there is a chromosome.
269000	274000	This chromosome is made up of our genes.
274000	278000	I think everyone has a concept of genes.
278000	281000	Genes are our genetic material.
281000	284000	Genes are our genetic material.
284000	287000	They are our genetic material.
287000	290000	Genes are our genetic material.
290000	293000	Genes are our genetic material.
293000	299000	In this definition, genes are a DNA segment.
299000	304000	They can be converted into a useful molecule.
304000	309000	They can perform the functions and functions that they need.
309000	322000	The reason for the general description of gene code is that DNA is a so-called ATCG.
322000	327000	DNA is a so-called ATCG.
327000	330000	So, if we talk about genes,
330000	338000	the sequence obtained may be composed of these four ATCGs.
338000	342000	This is our so-called gene code.
342000	351000	In molecular biology, there is a so-called central dogma.
351000	357000	The principle is that we have this genetic material.
357000	359000	Its main structure is DNA.
359000	363000	It will be transcribed into RNA.
363000	367000	RNA will be further transcribed into protein.
367000	373000	This protein can perform various biological functions.
373000	382000	As time goes by, the central dogma is gradually extended to more different forms.
382000	392000	We can even find more different directions from the virus or other systems.
392000	397000	Today's technology involves a discovery.
397000	402000	In the past, we thought that DNA was transcribed into RNA.
402000	411000	But later, scientists found another enzyme that can reverse transcribe RNA back to DNA.
412000	423000	With the help of this enzyme, many related extension technologies can be built on this basis.
423000	429000	Today, we will mainly talk about RNA-seq.
429000	439000	Another way to talk about it is transcriptional analysis or gene expression profiling.
439000	446000	Basically, we can use gene expression to understand human physiology.
446000	457000	This picture shows a major timeline and milestone in molecular biology and sequencing technology.
457000	463000	As many of you know, the first discovery was in 1953.
463000	469000	In 1977, Sanger's DNA sequencing was developed.
469000	473000	Later, PCR technology was also developed.
473000	480000	PCR technology allows us to rapidly increase our DNA in the laboratory.
480000	488000	Many related technologies can be built on this basis.
488000	492000	In 1990, the Human Genome Project was launched.
492000	497000	After 13 years, the Human Genome Project was established.
497000	505000	At this stage, sequencing costs are still very high.
505000	513000	It is difficult to operate a sequencing project in a lab.
513000	529000	In 2005, the next-generation sequencing technology was introduced.
529000	535000	This technology has greatly reduced the cost of sequencing.
535000	547000	The next-generation sequencing technology is still widely used.
547000	556000	In recent years, the third-generation sequencing technology was introduced.
556000	562000	When was single-cell RNA-seq developed?
562000	570000	The first report on single-cell RNA-seq was made in 2009.
570000	575000	Because of the gradual maturation of the technology,
575000	579000	especially the rapid reduction of sequencing costs,
579000	583000	single-cell RNA-seq can be operated more widely.
583000	592000	Now, many extended protocols, technologies, and companies continue to develop rapidly in this field.
592000	600000	Why do we need to do single-cell RNA-seq?
600000	608000	Before single-cell RNA-seq, we can look at gene profiling.
609000	621000	For example, what is the difference between a cancer cell and a normal cell?
621000	629000	For example, we have a healthy sample and a diseased sample.
629000	645000	After sequencing, we can compare the gene profiling of these two cells.
645000	648000	Then we can find out the disease gene.
648000	657000	Or we can find out which signaling pathway is further activated or inhibited.
658000	662000	But there is a problem.
662000	670000	For example, a tumor may contain a variety of different cells.
670000	676000	There may be immune cells, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and so on.
677000	683000	If the tumor is broken down and the RNA-seq is obtained,
683000	688000	the result is a variety of different cells.
688000	691000	From this heat map,
691000	701000	we can still see that some genes are inhibited or activated in the diseased sample.
701000	716000	It is difficult to determine if the disease is caused by immune cells, fibroblasts, or unknown gene cells.
716000	725000	At this time, if we can do transcriptome profiling at single-cell resolution,
725000	737000	we can have a deeper understanding of each cell in a tumor tissue.
738000	744000	Here are some interesting graphs that I saw on the Internet.
744000	752000	It can give you an idea of why the so-called Bok analysis may cause some misjudgment.
752000	755000	For example, in this graph,
755000	760000	each point here has the so-called x-value and y-value.
760000	762000	Then you can do various calculations.
762000	765000	For example, the x-value is like this,
765000	767000	the y-value is like this,
767000	769000	the x-deviation is like this,
769000	771000	and the y-deviation is like this.
771000	774000	But even if you calculate all these values,
774000	776000	what about the relationship between x and y?
776000	779000	So if you just do a Bok analysis,
779000	786000	you may not be able to express the so-called structure behind it.
787000	790000	Another interesting graph is that
790000	793000	sometimes if you do a Bok analysis,
793000	798000	you may get a conclusion that leads you to a wrong direction.
798000	801000	For example, suppose this is your sample.
801000	805000	So your sample contains a lot of different animals.
805000	809000	Then you do a Bok analysis to see what this creature might look like.
809000	814000	Then you may come to a conclusion that this is what this creature should look like.
814000	819000	Then you will find that it is very different from the so-called real state.
819000	823000	The so-called single-celled analysis basically has different methods.
823000	826000	That is to say, under this technology,
826000	830000	you can analyze each animal separately
830000	833000	and find a lot of different features.
833000	836000	Then based on the features you find,
836000	839000	you start to do the so-called clustering.
839000	841000	For example, this graph shows that
841000	843000	you have already found two features.
843000	845000	One is Firm and the other is Venom.
845000	848000	Then even if you just add two features like this,
848000	854000	you can already cluster a lot of animals into at least two subsets.
854000	858000	One big subset will be the snakes,
858000	861000	which has the Venom but doesn't have Firm.
861000	865000	Then the other big subset may be the so-called
865000	868000	it doesn't have Venom, but it has Firm.
868000	871000	When you can add more and more features,
871000	874000	hopefully, finally, you will be able to
874000	878000	one individual item will be clustered into one group.
878000	884000	So this is the whole idea about why you need to do profiling at a single-cell level.
886000	889000	Then generally in this single-cell field,
889000	892000	one of their favorite metaphors is
892000	897000	the so-called fruit smoothie and the so-called fruit salad.
897000	900000	When you make a Borg RNC asset,
900000	904000	it's very similar to the so-called fruit smoothie.
904000	908000	Basically, you put all kinds of fruit and vegetables together.
908000	910000	The taste you drink is basically
910000	914000	an average taste of all ingredients.
914000	918000	So you may not be able to know
918000	921000	what ingredients are in this.
921000	924000	Then maybe the ingredients you taste
924000	927000	are some special strong ingredients.
927000	930000	Maybe it's an apple, maybe it's a strawberry.
930000	932000	But you can't know that
932000	936000	maybe there's some cabbage in it or something else.
936000	942000	Single-cell is like you're eating a fruit salad.
942000	950000	Basically, you can taste each individual piece of the fruit.
950000	952000	So somehow you'll know
952000	956000	what kind of composition the fruit should be made of.
957000	963000	So this so-called fruit smoothie to the fruit salad,
963000	969000	basically what single-cell RNC wants to achieve
969000	973000	is that you can show the individual cell type
973000	976000	that causes the biological response or disease.
977000	984000	Then this summary is a more scientific statement.
984000	987000	So basically, the so-called Borg RNC
987000	991000	measures the so-called average expression level
991000	994000	for each cell across a population of cells.
994000	996000	Basically, like I just said,
996000	998000	if you're doing a cancer study,
998000	1000000	you have two samples.
1000000	1002000	One is from healthy tissue,
1002000	1004000	the other is from diseased tissue.
1004000	1008000	Then you grind it up and compare the two samples.
1008000	1011000	Its limitation is basically that
1011000	1017000	if you want to study a more complex system today,
1017000	1020000	for example, you want to study people's brains
1020000	1023000	or some more complex organs,
1023000	1025000	then this technology
1025000	1028000	I'm afraid I can't give you a very clear result.
1029000	1031000	Basically, what single-cell does,
1031000	1034000	it measures the distribution of expression level
1034000	1038000	for each gene across a population of the cells.
1038000	1040000	So using this technology,
1040000	1043000	every cell has a specific change
1043000	1047000	that can be shown.
1048000	1052000	Basically, now there are already a lot of
1052000	1057000	so-called commercially available single-cell platforms on the market.
1057000	1060000	Of course, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages.
1060000	1063000	From my personal experience,
1063000	1065000	I have two platforms of experience.
1065000	1067000	One is the so-called Fluidigm C1.
1067000	1072000	The other is called 10x Genomics.
1074000	1078000	Now I'm going to quickly introduce
1078000	1083000	the two single-cell platforms I've used before.
1084000	1086000	Basically, in general,
1086000	1088000	the so-called workflow of the single cell,
1088000	1090000	its concept is basically the same.
1090000	1094000	First of all, you have the so-called tissue of interest,
1094000	1097000	either patient tissue or cells,
1097000	1100000	which are some of the cells that you are interested in.
1100000	1105000	Then, before doing single-cell RIC,
1105000	1108000	the most important step is that you have to
1108000	1110000	prepare in your own way
1110000	1114000	the so-called single-cell suspension.
1115000	1118000	Each person may have different approaches.
1118000	1120000	For example,
1120000	1123000	the so-called FACS to do the single-cell selection,
1123000	1128000	or to do some so-called micro-dissection,
1128000	1133000	to sort out the cells one by one.
1133000	1137000	Then, when you can successfully complete
1137000	1139000	your single-cell suspension,
1139000	1141000	you basically inject it
1141000	1144000	into either single-cell platform.
1144000	1146000	Then, in the single-cell platform,
1146000	1148000	what it does is basically
1148000	1150000	to lyse the cell
1150000	1152000	and extract the RNA in it.
1152000	1154000	Then, this RNA is
1154000	1156000	reverse transcribed
1156000	1160000	into the cDNA.
1160000	1163000	Then, this cDNA can be amplified
1163000	1165000	through PCR.
1165000	1167000	After the amplification,
1168000	1171000	we build a library.
1171000	1174000	Then, these libraries can be sent for sequencing.
1174000	1176000	Like I said,
1176000	1179000	this is the so-called sequencing result.
1179000	1183000	You get the so-called sequence.
1183000	1185000	This sequence is basically
1185000	1187000	the sequence of A, T, C, and G.
1187000	1189000	Then, you may be mapping.
1189000	1193000	Because now many genes have been decoded,
1193000	1195000	including human, mouse,
1195000	1197000	and some species.
1197000	1201000	So, according to the source of your sample,
1201000	1204000	you can map it to the reference genome.
1204000	1207000	Then, you can know
1207000	1212000	what the expression of each gene is.
1212000	1214000	Then, the last step is
1214000	1217000	the so-called computational analysis.
1217000	1219000	Because this single-cell RNAC technology
1219000	1221000	is relatively new,
1221000	1224000	the computational analysis
1224000	1228000	is still under development.
1228000	1232000	This is basically the same concept.
1232000	1235000	You have a tissue that you are interested in.
1235000	1237000	First, you have to be able to
1237000	1240000	dissociate it into the so-called single-cell suspend.
1240000	1244000	Then, there are all kinds of different systems
1244000	1247000	that can make the single-cell suspension
1247000	1249000	that you need.
1249000	1251000	Then, you can further
1251000	1255000	dissociate it into the single-cell platform.
1255000	1262000	This picture is from a recent review paper.
1262000	1265000	So, what you can see here is that
1265000	1267000	the single-cell RNAC technology
1267000	1270000	has developed very rapidly in recent years.
1270000	1273000	It started with the first single-cell paper
1273000	1275000	around 2009.
1275000	1277000	At that time, the single-cell technology
1277000	1279000	was still a very difficult technology.
1279000	1281000	It was not possible to operate smoothly
1281000	1283000	at every level.
1283000	1287000	Then, the number of times you do it
1287000	1293000	may be accumulated from dozens of times.
1293000	1295000	However, as time goes by,
1295000	1297000	there are more and more different types of
1297000	1299000	different technologies,
1299000	1303000	including the droplet method.
1303000	1305000	There are also some
1305000	1308000	random capture technologies,
1308000	1311000	such as in-tube barcoding,
1311000	1315000	and so on.
1315000	1318000	Now, you can see that
1318000	1320000	basically,
1320000	1323000	the single-cell technology
1323000	1327000	can already get a lot of cells
1327000	1331000	in one experiment.
1331000	1335000	Of course, there are many technologies
1336000	1339000	that continue to develop
1339000	1345000	to get more and more cells.
1345000	1349000	Now, I would like to introduce
1349000	1351000	two single-cell platforms
1351000	1354000	that I have had hands-on experience with.
1354000	1356000	The first one is FluDyn.
1356000	1360000	FluDyn is probably the first single-cell
1360000	1366000	RNA-seq technology in the market.
1366000	1370000	Its basic process is very similar to what I just said.
1370000	1373000	First, you need to be able to successfully
1373000	1375000	dissociate your tissue.
1375000	1378000	Basically, this technology
1378000	1381000	captures cells to 96 well plate.
1381000	1387000	Basically, all the so-called cell lysing,
1387000	1390000	RT, and cDNA amplification
1390000	1393000	happen in this machine.
1393000	1396000	Its output is basically
1396000	1401000	the cDNA after the amplification.
1401000	1407000	Then you can make a barcode library
1407000	1410000	and send for sequencing.
1411000	1419000	This is the real situation of the C1 chip.
1419000	1423000	This is an image under the microscope.
1423000	1425000	You can see that
1425000	1428000	this cell basically has a fluorescent label.
1428000	1431000	So you can see that
1431000	1434000	after running this chip,
1434000	1440000	this cell is basically captured in this chip.
1440000	1443000	Then all the reactions
1443000	1448000	will happen in this reaction.
1448000	1452000	Finally, when this reaction is completed,
1452000	1456000	you get the cDNA after the amplification.
1456000	1459000	Then you can further build your library
1459000	1460000	and send for sequencing.
1460000	1463000	Then you will get your data.
1463000	1466000	According to my personal experience,
1466000	1469000	the C1 chip has some advantages
1469000	1471000	but also some disadvantages.
1471000	1475000	Its advantages are...
1475000	1478000	Oh, I may have made a mistake here.
1478000	1481000	The first one is relatively long prep time.
1481000	1482000	This should be its disadvantage.
1482000	1485000	Its prep time is actually very long.
1485000	1489000	Of course, if you let your sample
1489000	1492000	sit on the ice all the time,
1492000	1494000	you may worry that
1494000	1496000	its gene expression profile
1496000	1498000	may change during that time.
1498000	1501000	So basically, we hope that
1501000	1505000	before we get the so-called
1505000	1507000	light cell,
1507000	1513000	the prep time can be as short as possible.
1513000	1515000	But this C1 chip
1515000	1517000	still has some very good advantages.
1517000	1520000	For example, this set of technologies
1520000	1524000	allows you to capture single cells
1524000	1527000	under the microscope
1527000	1529000	one by one.
1529000	1531000	For example, this picture shows
1531000	1533000	a very beautiful single cell.
1533000	1536000	Some wells may not have single cells at all.
1536000	1540000	Some wells may have multiple samples.
1540000	1541000	Maybe later on,
1541000	1543000	when you are building your library,
1543000	1546000	you may ignore such samples.
1546000	1548000	Because in the subsequent data analysis,
1548000	1552000	you may not be able to judge
1552000	1554000	whether the data you get is from one cell
1554000	1556000	or multiple cells.
1556000	1560000	Basically, its biggest disadvantage
1560000	1564000	is the so-called throughput.
1564000	1565000	Because basically,
1565000	1566000	in the most primitive C1 chip,
1566000	1569000	it can only capture 96 cells at a time.
1569000	1571000	In the later version,
1571000	1573000	it may be able to capture 800 at a time.
1573000	1576000	But in fact, in reality,
1576000	1578000	its efficiency is very poor.
1578000	1582000	Maybe only 60% to 70% of the wells
1582000	1584000	can capture single cells.
1584000	1585000	So in fact,
1585000	1588000	the number of cells you can get every time is extremely small.
1588000	1591000	So this is the biggest problem with C1.
1591000	1592000	And later on,
1592000	1594000	a lot of research found that
1594000	1597000	even some data that had already been published,
1597000	1599000	they found that
1599000	1601000	some of the results they got
1601000	1605000	were quite related to batch.
1605000	1607000	So this technology basically,
1607000	1609000	in the current single cell field,
1609000	1613000	a lot of people have turned to other better
1613000	1617000	better technology choices.
1617000	1618000	At present,
1618000	1621000	the vast majority of single cell RNA-seq platforms,
1621000	1623000	you will probably see,
1623000	1625000	is from this company.
1625000	1627000	This company is called 10X Genomics.
1627000	1630000	Its core technology
1630000	1633000	is basically called Gems.
1633000	1636000	Gen Bits in Emulsion.
1636000	1638000	So its idea is basically
1638000	1640000	that it has a lot of these bits.
1640000	1643000	And then these bits are basically
1643000	1646000	I'm thinking the simplest way to do this is
1646000	1651000	I'm going to show you a YouTube video.
1651000	1654000	You should be able to quickly understand
1654000	1657000	how this technology works.
1663000	1667000	Okay.
1689000	1690000	Oh, Dr. Sun,
1690000	1692000	I'd like to ask if there's any sound in this video?
1692000	1694000	Eh...
1694000	1697000	It's music, so you can't hear the sound, right?
1697000	1698000	Okay.
1698000	1699000	But it's okay.
1699000	1701000	It's not talking.
1701000	1702000	It's not talking.
1702000	1703000	Okay.
1703000	1704000	Yeah, so...
1704000	1706000	It's just background music.
1722000	1743000	It's just background music.
1743000	1771000	It's just background music.
1771000	1800000	It's just background music.
1800000	1808000	I think it's easier to use the video.
1808000	1810000	Wait a minute.
1810000	1816000	Sorry, I'll turn this off.
1816000	1822000	So basically, you can see that this is the set of techniques.
1822000	1825000	It's probably like this.
1826000	1830000	If you compare these two sets of techniques,
1830000	1837000	Of course, the biggest advantage of 10X Genomics is that its throughput is very high.
1837000	1843000	We can capture more than 10,000 cells in each round.
1843000	1851000	If you compare it to 96 or 800 cells, 10X is much better than C1.
1851000	1866000	In addition, the advantage of the UMI set of techniques is that it involves some PCR processes.
1866000	1870000	This process may also cause some experimental biases.
1870000	1878000	The UMI set of techniques can basically help correct these biases.
1879000	1885000	In addition, the process of generating Gems is extremely fast.
1885000	1889000	It only takes 7 minutes to generate all the Gems.
1889000	1897000	So basically, you can make sure that your cells are in a relatively intact state.
1897000	1900000	Of course, there are some disadvantages.
1900000	1909000	For example, 10X Genomics does not sequence all the transcripts.
1909000	1921000	It only does a small part of 3'N.
1921000	1927000	So if your research is looking at variants of Gems,
1927000	1931000	You basically can't use 10X Genomics.
1931000	1941000	On the other hand, many data analysis tools are designed for 10X Genomics.
1941000	1945000	So if you use this set of systems,
1945000	1951000	You may get more help in subsequent analysis.
1952000	1964000	Next, let's talk about some real-world operations.
1964000	1968000	In the real world,
1968000	1974000	Before injecting into the 10X system,
1974000	1977000	We have our tissue of interest.
1977000	1981000	Then we may have different sample prep strategies.
1981000	1985000	To control our single-cell suspension.
1985000	1990000	Before injecting into the 10X chip,
1990000	1993000	We basically need to do a cell quality control.
1993000	1999000	We need to look at several parameters.
1999000	2003000	For example, its viability.
2003000	2007000	And basically, this cell looks like a single cell.
2007000	2011000	And then there's the cell size.
2011000	2018000	Let you know that your protocol is basically able to target the cells you're interested in.
2018000	2021000	So the take-home message here will be that
2021000	2026000	The sample prep protocol optimization is very important.
2026000	2030000	For you to get high-quality single-cell data in the future.
2030000	2034000	In the first step, it basically determines most of it.
2034000	2039000	After your cell QC pass,
2039000	2043000	You make sure that your single-cell suspension is a very good prep.
2043000	2047000	Then you can basically inject into the 10X system.
2047000	2053000	Then all these steps are basically like a kit.
2053000	2057000	And then you can just run it through.
2057000	2063000	And now Genome has developed its own computational tool.
2063000	2067000	I can do the initial data processing.
2067000	2071000	And then you get a so-called gene barcode matrix.
2071000	2076000	And then you can use this matrix to do the follow-up analysis.
2077000	2083000	For the whole workflow of single-cell data analysis,
2083000	2087000	It's basically divided into two stages.
2087000	2093000	The first stage, the yellow one, is basically the so-called sequencing QC.
2093000	2098000	That is to say, you have to see if your sequencing data is good or bad.
2098000	2102000	In this part, it's basically quite mature.
2102000	2108000	Because I mentioned before that this technique has been used for many years.
2108000	2112000	That set of techniques is basically the so-called sequencing QC.
2112000	2116000	It can almost move the whole set to the single-cell RNAC part.
2116000	2119000	So at this stage of sequencing QC,
2119000	2124000	It's basically looking at the so-called read QC, alignment QC, and mapping QC.
2124000	2131000	And now Genome has a set of its own software that can help you finish this thing.
2131000	2134000	Finally, you can get a gene barcode matrix.
2134000	2137000	And then when you get the gene barcode matrix,
2137000	2143000	The red part here is basically the so-called further data processing.
2143000	2148000	I'm going to take a little bit of time to talk about it.
2148000	2151000	The so-called further data processing here.
2151000	2155000	In the first step, I call it matrix LQC.
2155000	2159000	What it means is that basically the most important point of this step is to say
2159000	2164000	You have to get rid of some of the so-called low-quality cells first.
2164000	2168000	Because if you keep these low-quality cells in your dataset,
2168000	2171000	A big problem, it might cause a lot of noise.
2171000	2176000	And then it might make your subsequent data analysis very difficult.
2176000	2181000	So basically, after you remove some of the bad cells,
2181000	2184000	You can take your data to further normalization.
2185000	2192000	After normalization, you may need to face another problem.
2192000	2199000	After all, single cell technology is based on single cell.
2199000	2206000	So it will have a lot of unwanted variation.
2206000	2208000	For example, it may be a batch effect.
2208000	2211000	Then all the cells may be in different cell cycle status.
2212000	2216000	These may be information that you are not interested in.
2216000	2221000	Then you may need to use some computational methods to either regress it out.
2221000	2224000	Or maybe give it a score.
2224000	2227000	This may be a more detailed data analysis.
2227000	2232000	Then, in short, when you clean up these data through this step,
2232000	2237000	Then your dataset can do a lot of downstream data analysis.
2238000	2244000	It includes clustering, cell type identification,
2244000	2248000	And then you can do the so-called differential gene expression analysis.
2248000	2255000	That is to say, you can compare the gene profiling between cell type A and cell type B.
2255000	2259000	Which one is the same? Which one is different?
2259000	2262000	Or maybe you have a very interested cell population.
2262000	2266000	Then you can see what are the cell service markers.
2266000	2269000	Or you can compare two situations.
2269000	2273000	Then see which single-only pathway is being activated or inhibited.
2273000	2280000	These things are very useful information for both basic biology and disease research.
2280000	2283000	Then you can also do some network analysis.
2283000	2288000	Then some people will even take this single cell to do some so-called pseudo-time analysis.
2289000	2292000	The so-called pseudo-time is that we
2292000	2296000	Because in a lot of research, such as developmental biology,
2296000	2300000	It may look at a bit like a time course.
2300000	2307000	That is, how does this cell change from one state to another state with the eyes of time?
2307000	2311000	In the past, you may have to take samples at different times.
2311000	2313000	Then do the analysis.
2313000	2318000	The concept of single cell may be that you may not need to take so many time points.
2318000	2323000	You may take one or two time points.
2323000	2327000	Because every cell will give you some information.
2327000	2331000	Not all cells are in the same state at the same time.
2331000	2334000	So you can basically go through every cell.
2334000	2339000	It may be at a certain stage in the process of transformation.
2340000	2343000	Then it may be in this set of data.
2343000	2346000	It will give you a so-called pseudo-time.
2346000	2349000	Such information.
2349000	2357000	So this is also a very powerful place for single cell.
2357000	2362000	Let's talk about the so-called metric cell quality control.
2362000	2368000	What is it like in a real state?
2368000	2374000	How do you filter out the so-called unhealthy cells or cells you don't want?
2374000	2377000	Of course, everyone may have their own criteria.
2377000	2380000	Here are some of the most general ways.
2380000	2385000	This set of data sets is basically published.
2385000	2392000	It uses the so-called human blood cells to make a demo data.
2392000	2402000	This scatter plot is the percentage of the mitochondrion versus the UMI number.
2402000	2408000	This UMI number can be regarded as how many molecules have been detected.
2408000	2411000	So-called how many transcripts have been detected.
2411000	2415000	Then every point here basically represents a cell.
2416000	2422000	You can see that the majority of the cells are in this position.
2422000	2429000	In terms of biology, you will know that the vast majority of the cells are in this position.
2429000	2435000	So these cells have a very high UMI number.
2435000	2438000	It means that there are a lot of transcripts being detected.
2438000	2443000	So it is possible that these signals are not coming from one single cell.
2443000	2447000	These may be cell aggregation or multiplex.
2447000	2450000	These may be the cells you want to get rid of.
2450000	2454000	Because basically this signal is not coming from one single cell.
2454000	2459000	Then some other cells you may want to get rid of are the so-called cells.
2459000	2464000	So you can see that there are very few UMI that can be detected.
2464000	2469000	But it has a very high percentage of mitochondrion.
2470000	2476000	Usually when a cell is in an extremely unhealthy state, its mitochondrion will be very high.
2476000	2488000	So this is also a general criterion that many people will set to filter out some cells that they think are not worth doing downstream analysis.
2488000	2495000	The last cell that may be used for downstream analysis is this one.
2496000	2501000	So what does this analysis look like?
2501000	2507000	This is basically a result of unbiased clustering.
2507000	2514000	So you can see that the sample here is from a human pbmc cell.
2514000	2519000	Here, each point represents a cell.
2519000	2522000	This type of clustering is called t-SNE clustering.
2522000	2525000	Basically, it is a clustering algorithm.
2525000	2537000	Basically, what you can understand is that the closer the cells are, the more similar their properties are.
2538000	2549000	Basically, they look at, for example, which genes are expressed in this clustering cell, and which genes are expressed in this clustering cell.
2549000	2555000	Then they can identify what kind of cells these may be.
2555000	2567000	So in a single-cell RNAC experiment, you can quickly identify all kinds of different immune cells.
2567000	2571000	For example, this clustering is basically a B-cell.
2571000	2581000	The gene expression plotting here further confirms that when you see here, it becomes more purplish, which means that this particular gene is expressed in large quantities.
2581000	2584000	This gene is basically a B-cell mutagen.
2584000	2589000	So it further confirms that these cells do have B-cell properties.
2589000	2593000	For example, this CD3E is basically a T-cell marker.
2593000	2597000	It is also expressed in large quantities in this T-cell population.
2598000	2618000	Once you get a result like this, you can further study and compare which cells are the same and which cells are different.
2618000	2625000	Or you can compare two B-cells in a different sample.
2625000	2629000	Then you can compare the gene profiling of the two B-cells to see what is different.
2629000	2640000	In this way, the result you get will be a signal that only B-cells give you, rather than a result where all cells are averaged.
2640000	2643000	This is roughly the concept of a single-cell.
2644000	2648000	Due to time constraints, I will skip the last part.
2648000	2657000	This is just an example of what a single-cell can do.
2657000	2665000	To summarize, there are some things you may need to consider before conducting a single-cell experiment.
2666000	2677000	In my current job, I have to support many single-cell projects on campus.
2677000	2691000	Based on my experience with many different projects, I can see that data analysis is still the biggest bottleneck in this technology.
2691000	2696000	In terms of generating the data, it is not that difficult.
2696000	2705000	However, every time you generate a library of data, it may be over 1,000 cells.
2705000	2711000	To be honest, it is not that easy to analyze the data.
2711000	2728000	Even though we have a single-cell working group in our company, we still have to figure out what is the best normalization method and what is the best batch correction method.
2728000	2740000	In terms of differential gene expression analysis, which method is the best for single-cell analysis?
2741000	2761000	Basically, if you know exactly what you want to ask, your single-cell data will be more meaningful.
2761000	2781000	However, if you are not sure what you want to see, your data will be lost.
2781000	2800000	In my experience, it is very important to optimize the sample prep protocol before going into the single-cell platform.
2800000	2812000	If you don't optimize your sample prep properly, you may not get the cells you need.
2812000	2822000	Finally, I want to touch on the single-cell genomics.
2822000	2827000	The single-cell genomics development is very fast.
2827000	2832000	There are many new technologies for different biological problems.
2833000	2843000	For example, the single-cell RAC we just talked about is a single-cell suspension.
2844000	2852000	However, in some research, you may not be able to get the so-called living tissue.
2852000	2862000	For example, if you want to study the brain, you may only get the tissue after a person's death.
2862000	2866000	Or you may only get the frozen tissue.
2866000	2871000	Basically, you can't get the tissue from a living cell.
2871000	2874000	Therefore, there is a so-called single-cell RAC.
2874000	2890000	The single-cell RAC takes the tissue from a dead cell and extracts the RNA from it.
2890000	2893000	There are also other versions.
2893000	2905000	For example, if you are interested in the recombination of T-cells and B-cells, there is also a single-cell RAC like this.
2905000	2916000	If you are studying cancer T-cell therapy, it will be very useful.
2917000	2931000	If you are studying the chromatin regulation, there is also a single-cell attack C protocol.
2931000	2940000	You can see which part of the chromatin is open and which part is closed.
2940000	2944000	There is also a new technology called CyC.
2944000	2951000	CyC adds a DNA barcoding to the antibody.
2951000	2957000	CyC turns it into another RNA molecule.
2957000	2960000	CyC turns it into a pseudogene.
2960000	2969000	When you run the single-cell platform, CyC becomes an additional signal.
2969000	2984000	In addition to obtaining the RNA expression profile, you can also detect the cell service protein signal.
2984000	2992000	This technology can also help you with cell type identification.
2993000	3007000	Overall, CyC is still developing rapidly in the field of sample processing and data analysis.
3008000	3014000	This is a brief introduction to CyC.
3014000	3024000	If you are interested in CyC, you can learn more about it.
3024000	3039000	Thank you Dr. Sun for giving us a presentation today.
3039000	3047000	We will now open the Q&A section.
3047000	3055000	I hope everyone can actively discuss or ask questions about what Dr. Sun just said.
3055000	3056000	Thank you.
3056000	3063000	I just saw a person in the chat asking,
3063000	3069000	Do you mind sharing your presentation slides?
3093000	3101000	Let's see if Dr. Sun can send the slides to you.
3101000	3103000	Okay.
3104000	3108000	Another person asked,
3108000	3116000	Hi Dr. Sun, for in vivo study, would you suggest to do the qPCR on intracellular organ first,
3116000	3122000	then based on the qPCR result to design the experimental for RNA-Seq?
3123000	3137000	Do you have any suggestions for the qPCR and RNA-Seq?
3137000	3145000	For qPCR,
3145000	3150000	if there is a new project coming in,
3150000	3156000	we will not go for single cell RNA-Seq.
3157000	3166000	We will first look at the existing technology,
3166000	3171000	such as qPCR or Bulk RNA-Seq.
3171000	3176000	If you want to compare healthy and diseased,
3176000	3181000	or knockout or wild-type mice,
3181000	3191000	you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.
3191000	3196000	If your qPCR can already answer your question,
3196000	3204000	we usually prefer to ask them to use a relatively cheap and simple technology to confirm.
3204000	3209000	If you want to compare healthy and diseased,
3209000	3217000	you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

3242000	3247000	If you want to compare healthy and diseased,
3247000	3254000	you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.
3254000	3259000	If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

3279000	3284000	If you want to compare healthy and diseased,
3284000	3291000	you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.
3291000	3296000	If you want to compare healthy and diseased,
3296000	3304000	you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.
3305000	3311000	What software do you use to do batch correction for single-cell RNA-Seq?
3311000	3317000	Are you asking about rPackage?
3317000	3322000	Hello?
3322000	3326000	Oh, rPackage.
3326000	3331000	I can answer that.
