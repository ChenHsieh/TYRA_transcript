0	5000	Hi everyone, welcome to this week's TARA Talk.
5000	7000	The title of today's talk is
7000	11000	The Evaluation of Alternative Exposure Metrics
11000	14000	for Traffic-Related Air Pollutant Exposure
14000	16000	in North Carolina.
16000	18000	Let's welcome our speaker today,
18000	21000	Zhang Shiying, or you can call her Zhang-C.
21000	25000	Let's briefly introduce the speaker's information.
25000	30000	She's currently working at Sonoma Technology,
30000	34000	a company that specializes in this area.
34000	41000	She did her Ph.D. at UNC-North Carolina-Champaign Hill.
41000	44000	Before coming to the United States,
44000	46000	she was a master's student at the University of Texas,
46000	48000	then a master's student at the University of Texas,
48000	50000	then a master's student at the University of Texas.
50000	55000	She's currently working on a topic that's closely related to her research.
55000	59000	Let's welcome our speaker, Zhang Shiying.
62000	64000	Hi everyone.
64000	66000	Before I start, I want to show you my T-shirt.
66000	68000	I won last year.
68000	71000	My name is Zhang Shiying.
71000	73000	You can call me Zhang-C.
73000	77000	Today's topic is
77000	81000	how to use air quality models or model-based methods
81000	85000	to assess human exposure to air pollution.
85000	88000	I'm going to focus on the traffic pollutants.
88000	92000	A few days ago, the host asked me to talk about
92000	95000	the related issues of air pollution.
95000	98000	But because our company has a strict process
98000	103000	of reviewing things and publications,
103000	105000	I didn't have time to make a new video.
105000	108000	So I'm going to talk about my last year's video.
108000	113000	This photo was taken in the United States in 1948.
113000	115000	Why is air pollution important?
115000	120000	This photo was taken in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1948
120000	122000	called Donora.
122000	125000	The photo on the right was taken at noon.
125000	129000	You can see that it wasn't bad weather or raining that day.
129000	132000	No, it was a normal noon.
132000	135000	The streetlights were all on and the sky looked dark.
135000	138000	Air pollution was very serious at that time.
138000	140000	After that incident,
140000	142000	40 people died in the town.
142000	147000	50% of the residents suffered from
147000	152000	serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
152000	156000	People said that it was very difficult to breathe at that time.
156000	161000	This incident caused a lot of resonance in the United States.
161000	164000	People said that air pollution was very serious.
164000	166000	After that incident,
166000	168000	there were a lot of social movements,
168000	171000	protests, and government measures.
171000	173000	Finally, in 1967,
173000	177000	the United States passed the Clean Air Act,
177000	182000	which is the most important law in the United States.
182000	185000	The Clean Air Act was finally passed,
185000	187000	and control began.
187000	189000	Was it useful?
190000	192000	The answer is yes.
192000	194000	Let's take a look at this picture.
194000	196000	The word may be too small to see clearly,
196000	197000	but it doesn't matter.
197000	201000	This is basically the annual air pollution concentration.
201000	204000	This is a measured situation.
204000	206000	I remember I took this.
206000	209000	It should be LA.
209000	215000	Each line represents a different city or county.
215000	216000	You can see this trend.
216000	220000	Every year, air pollution is decreasing.
220000	222000	So it's actually useful.
222000	224000	Since air pollution has decreased,
224000	227000	what are we doing to study air pollution?
227000	229000	It's already so low.
229000	231000	What are we doing here?
231000	233000	The two most important things now
233000	236000	are not only in the United States,
236000	237000	but also in the world.
237000	239000	The two most important air pollutants are
239000	241000	1. Smelly sheep
241000	243000	2. PM2.5
243000	246000	PM2.5 is called a particulate matter
246000	249000	with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.
252000	254000	I won't go into detail.
254000	255000	But basically,
255000	259000	smelly sheep is not directly released.
259000	262000	You won't have something that says it's smelly sheep.
262000	263000	It won't be like that.
263000	265000	The formation of smelly sheep is secondary.
265000	267000	In other words, it's not a smelly sheep gas.
267000	269000	These gases become smelly sheep
269000	272000	after chemical reactions in the air.
272000	275000	These gases that are released
275000	280000	may not be so harmful to the human body.
280000	281000	But after it's released,
281000	284000	it becomes smelly sheep
284000	287000	and is very harmful to the human body.
287000	291000	PM2.5 is simply a very, very small particle.
291000	293000	This is a strand of hair.
293000	295000	We all love to use this picture.
295000	297000	This is a strand of hair.
297000	301000	PM10 is a diameter smaller than 10 micrograms.
301000	302000	It's about this big.
302000	304000	It's a blue circle.
304000	306000	PM2.5 is this small.
306000	309000	What does being small have to do with it?
309000	312000	Being small means that it's easy to pass through your respiratory tract.
312000	314000	It can go deeper.
314000	315000	It can go into the lungs.
315000	317000	It will cause respiratory diseases
317000	319000	and even cardiovascular diseases.
319000	321000	Let's skip this one first.
321000	323000	This is a study
323000	325000	that has been very active in recent years
325000	328000	called Global Burden of Disease.
328000	330000	They publish every year
330000	335000	the current ranking of causes of death
335000	337000	and how many people die.
337000	339000	Why is air pollution important?
339000	342000	After the Clean Air Act,
342000	345000	the concentration of pollutants decreased every year.
345000	347000	But if you look at the whole world,
347000	350000	the cause of death from air pollution
350000	356000	is ranked fourth in the world.
357000	363000	Air pollution is very, very, very important.
363000	372000	This is a paper from Nature in 2015.
372000	376000	They divided the world into countries
376000	380000	and gave the most serious air pollution
381000	389000	emission sector.
389000	391000	They predicted how many emission sectors
391000	392000	would cause death.
392000	394000	So if you look at this table,
394000	396000	there are different pollutants in the horizontal axis.
396000	398000	For example, we have residential energy.
398000	402000	Air pollution caused by using energy.
402000	406000	Agriculture causes air pollution.
406000	411000	Land traffic causes air pollution.
411000	413000	You can see the two red boxes,
413000	415000	USA and Germany.
415000	417000	These two countries
417000	419000	cause the most death
419000	425000	in the traffic sector.
425000	429000	These are some introductions.
429000	433000	What am I going to talk about today?
433000	438000	This paper was published in 2015.
438000	451000	In terms of environmental epidemiology,
451000	454000	it is important to look at the relationship
454000	458000	between diseases and air pollution.
458000	460000	You want to use air pollution variability
460000	462000	to explain whether there is a disease
462000	464000	or whether there is a disease.
464000	467000	In this case,
467000	470000	if there are 10 people today,
470000	473000	5 people have respiratory diseases,
473000	474000	5 people do not.
474000	477000	I wonder if this is related to air pollution.
477000	482000	When I was doing this statistical model,
482000	484000	I found that these 10 people
484000	488000	were exposed to the same amount of air pollution.
488000	490000	For example, they were all exposed to
490000	493000	5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5.
493000	494000	At this time,
494000	496000	the model can't see anything.
496000	497000	5 people are sick, 5 people are not sick,
497000	499000	but everyone is exposed to the same amount of air pollution.
499000	502000	This means that you can't do anything.
502000	505000	This paper talks about
505000	508000	the past epidemiological studies,
508000	513000	the past studies that link diseases
513000	515000	and air pollution.
515000	519000	What can be improved?
519000	521000	This slide has a lot of words.
521000	523000	Basically, the most important thing is
523000	525000	the Health Effect Institute.
525000	527000	This is a 2009 paper.
527000	528000	The Health Effect Institute
528000	531000	is a very famous institution
531000	534000	that studies health effects.
534000	540000	They use data from the American Cancer Society
540000	545000	to re-analyze and link
545000	550000	the relationship between air pollution and death.
550000	552000	As I said before,
552000	553000	when you do this,
553000	555000	you need to have all the information
555000	557000	about whether you are sick or not.
557000	558000	Secondly, you need to have data
558000	560000	about the exposure of air pollution.
560000	563000	How do they do the air pollution exposure data?
563000	569000	Basically, they do it in this area.
569000	571000	Let me translate it for you.
571000	574000	They have a monitoring station
574000	576000	set up by the U.S. Department of Environment
576000	578000	in the United States.
578000	580000	They have a station on both sides,
580000	582000	an air pollution station.
582000	584000	Their approach is
584000	586000	for example,
586000	588000	in San Francisco,
588000	590000	I have 10 stations.
590000	593000	I collect the data of these 10 stations
593000	595000	and calculate the average.
595000	598000	I say that everyone living in San Francisco
598000	603000	has the same air pollution exposure.
603000	605000	That is to say,
605000	607000	everyone living in San Francisco
607000	609000	has the same air pollution exposure.
609000	612000	This is the same as what I just said.
612000	613000	For example,
613000	615000	everyone lives in San Francisco.
615000	616000	Some people are sick.
616000	617000	Some people are not sick.
617000	622000	When I do this epidemiological analysis,
622000	624000	I tell my models that
624000	626000	whether they are sick or not,
626000	627000	as long as they live in San Francisco,
627000	630000	their exposure is this high.
630000	632000	At this time,
632000	633000	you can see that
633000	635000	there seems to be a problem.
638000	640000	Another question is
640000	643000	that the U.S. Department of Environment
643000	646000	set up these stations in the United States
646000	648000	to measure air pollution.
648000	649000	However,
649000	652000	many air pollution is not regional.
652000	654000	It does not mean that
654000	655000	a station can represent
655000	658000	the concentration of pollutants in the entire area.
658000	660000	The table I listed here
660000	663000	is the distance from the road.
663000	665000	The unit is meters.
665000	668000	The axis is normalized to roadside.
668000	669000	That is to say,
669000	671000	the concentration of air pollution
671000	673000	is standardized,
673000	676000	which is the concentration of two roads on the roadside.
676000	679000	On the left side of the table,
679000	680000	you can see that
680000	681000	so many pollutants
681000	684000	actually have a very steep gradient.
684000	685000	That is to say,
685000	688000	between 100 and 150 meters,
688000	691000	the concentration has dropped by almost 60%.
693000	694000	That is to say,
694000	697000	the road distance is only a few meters.
697000	698000	There is such a difference in concentration
698000	700000	within 100 meters.
700000	702000	Can you see such a difference
702000	703000	in concentration
703000	704000	in a station
704000	707000	in a certain corner of the city?
707000	708000	You can't see it.
709000	710000	The first one,
710000	711000	you use that kind of station
711000	714000	to represent exposure,
714000	716000	the exposure of human body to pollution.
716000	718000	You may not be able to catch
718000	721000	the hot spot in the urban.
721000	722000	Hello, I have a question.
722000	723000	Please go ahead.
723000	725000	The first one,
725000	726000	the horizontal axis is the distance,
726000	728000	and the vertical axis is the concentration.
728000	730000	In the first few meters,
730000	734000	their gradient looks almost the same.
734000	736000	But you have,
736000	739000	for example, CO, CON,
739000	745000	and NO, NO, and N.
745000	747000	Don't they have a lot of difference in their atomic mass?
747000	748000	If I take one,
748000	750000	I think it's just an expansion.
750000	752000	Shouldn't the gradient be a lot different?
752000	754000	Because there is still a chemical reaction.
754000	756000	CO may not have much reaction.
756000	759000	NO and NOX may have chemical reactions.
759000	760000	It will generate other things.
760000	761000	So it may laugh faster,
761000	763000	laugh slower, not necessarily.
763000	764000	OK, OK.
764000	765000	Maybe it's all gas.
765000	766000	Even particles are different.
766000	767000	Particles may have
767000	769000	some different characteristics.
769000	770000	I want to add that
770000	772000	you have to consider the gradient.
772000	773000	So,
773000	775000	there is a physical problem.
775000	778000	So there is a chemical process.
778000	779000	That's right.
779000	780000	OK.
782000	783000	OK.
783000	784000	We just talked about outdoor.
784000	785000	For example,
785000	786000	you use outdoor,
786000	789000	you use the concentration of the side station beam
789000	790000	to represent the pollution source.
790000	791000	First, you can't catch the hot spot.
791000	792000	Like this kind of traffic pollution source.
792000	793000	If someone lives,
793000	795000	if someone's house is close to the road,
795000	796000	you can't catch it.
796000	797000	But if it's far away,
797000	798000	you can't catch it.
798000	799000	Second,
799000	800000	in fact,
800000	801000	most people
801000	803000	spend more time indoors
803000	806000	than they spend outdoors.
806000	808000	This is a...
808000	810000	It should be a Canadian study.
810000	811000	They looked at
811000	812000	how much time
812000	813000	children spend
813000	815000	indoors or outdoors.
815000	818000	I used the two red boxes.
818000	819000	You can see
819000	821000	one is in winter,
821000	822000	one is in summer.
822000	823000	In indoor time,
824000	826000	67% in winter,
826000	828000	72% in summer.
828000	829000	It means that
829000	830000	most people
830000	832000	spend more time indoors
832000	834000	than they spend outdoors.
834000	835000	At this time,
835000	837000	you use outdoor pollutants
837000	838000	to represent...
838000	841000	The concentration of the beam
841000	843000	to represent human exposure
843000	844000	may also be a problem
844000	846000	because everyone is indoors.
846000	847000	Right?
847000	849000	So that's why
849000	850000	there is this paper.
850000	851000	The first one is
851000	852000	Central Sites.
852000	853000	Central Sites
853000	854000	means
854000	855000	those
855000	857000	U.S. environmental protection agencies.
857000	858000	They can't catch
858000	860000	these local sources.
860000	861000	Local sources can be
861000	862000	traffic
862000	863000	or any
863000	864000	small sources
864000	866000	next to your house.
866000	868000	They may not be able to...
868000	870000	The second one is
870000	872000	using outdoor air pollution
872000	873000	to represent exposure
873000	875000	may not be very representative
875000	877000	because most people are indoors.
877000	878000	In theory,
878000	880000	you should use indoor air pollution
880000	883000	to represent exposure.
883000	886000	The goal of this paper
886000	888000	is to use model-based...
888000	889000	That is to say,
889000	891000	use model-based methods
891000	894000	to predict...
894000	895000	to estimate
895000	897000	the intensity of indoor and outdoor
897000	898000	and use them
898000	900000	to represent human exposure
900000	901000	to see
901000	903000	how different they are.
903000	905000	We can quantify
905000	909000	these potential exposure errors
910000	912000	This is the model I used.
912000	915000	The three yellow boxes
915000	918000	are STOKE, STOK, R-Line,
918000	920000	and LBL AR models.
920000	923000	These three are models.
923000	924000	STOKE stands for
924000	926000	Spacetime Ordinary Crating.
926000	927000	It represents...
927000	928000	It's actually
928000	930000	an internal and external
930000	931000	technology.
931000	932000	That technology
932000	933000	uses...
933000	934000	Its input data
934000	935000	is the data
935000	938000	from these environmental protection agencies.
938000	940000	We use that data
940000	942000	to push it inwards and outwards
942000	943000	to the census block level.
943000	945000	Census block is...
945000	946000	Imagine...
946000	947000	It's a block.
947000	948000	When you're walking,
948000	950000	there's a block on the road.
950000	951000	It could be a block.
951000	953000	So we push those intensities
953000	954000	inwards and outwards
954000	956000	to these block levels.
956000	958000	This represents
958000	960000	a background level.
960000	961000	I use the data
961000	964000	from the Central Monitoring Site
964000	965000	to push it inwards and outwards
965000	966000	to these places.
966000	967000	But it could miss
967000	968000	these local sources,
968000	970000	such as traffic.
970000	972000	R-Line is a line source
972000	974000	dispersion model.
974000	975000	It's used to predict
975000	977000	traffic-related pollution.
977000	978000	It basically
978000	979000	takes all roads
979000	982000	as a line.
982000	983000	It uses
983000	984000	a simple
984000	985000	high-definition
985000	987000	method
987000	988000	to model
988000	990000	traffic pollution.
990000	992000	It represents local source.
992000	993000	We define local source
993000	995000	as traffic pollution.
995000	997000	The last LVL-AR model
997000	1000000	is Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
1000000	1002000	Air Exchange Rate Model.
1002000	1004000	It's used to
1004000	1006000	predict air exchange rate,
1006000	1008000	which is the air exchange rate
1008000	1011000	for each household.
1011000	1012000	For example,
1012000	1013000	how long
1013000	1014000	will the air
1014000	1015000	in your house
1015000	1016000	be exchanged
1016000	1018000	with the air outside?
1018000	1020000	Using these three models
1020000	1022000	and combining them,
1023000	1025000	we can calculate
1025000	1027000	the six blue boxes.
1027000	1029000	These six boxes
1029000	1031000	represent
1031000	1033000	exposure.
1033000	1034000	We call it
1034000	1035000	exposure metric.
1035000	1036000	We use these six boxes
1036000	1037000	to represent
1037000	1039000	air exposure.
1039000	1040000	What are they?
1040000	1041000	The first one is
1041000	1042000	outdoor stoke,
1042000	1043000	which is
1043000	1045000	outdoor air exposure.
1045000	1047000	It's called stoke.
1047000	1048000	It represents background.
1048000	1049000	Remember,
1049000	1050000	the source of this thing
1050000	1051000	is Central Monitoring Site,
1051000	1052000	which is
1052000	1054000	the U.S. Department of Environment.
1054000	1055000	The second one is
1055000	1056000	outdoor on-road.
1056000	1057000	It represents
1057000	1059000	air pollution
1059000	1061000	caused by
1061000	1063000	traffic.
1063000	1065000	It's modeled
1065000	1067000	by R-Line.
1067000	1069000	Combining these two things,
1069000	1070000	outdoor stoke
1070000	1071000	represents background
1071000	1072000	because it can't
1072000	1074000	capture local source.
1074000	1076000	If you add these two things,
1076000	1078000	you get total exposure.
1078000	1079000	We call it
1079000	1080000	outdoor hybrid,
1080000	1081000	which is hybrid between
1081000	1083000	R-Line and stoke.
1083000	1084000	These three things
1084000	1085000	represent
1085000	1087000	outdoor concentration.
1087000	1088000	Using these three
1088000	1089000	outdoor concentrations
1089000	1090000	as a base,
1090000	1091000	we can combine
1091000	1092000	the air exchange rate.
1092000	1093000	The air exchange rate
1093000	1094000	from the LBL
1094000	1095000	air exchange rate model
1095000	1096000	on the left
1096000	1097000	can be used
1097000	1098000	to calculate
1098000	1099000	the corresponding
1099000	1101000	indoor concentration.
1101000	1102000	We use outdoor concentration
1102000	1103000	to calculate
1103000	1104000	indoor concentration.
1104000	1105000	We have
1105000	1107000	three other metrics,
1107000	1108000	indoor on-road,
1108000	1109000	indoor stoke,
1109000	1110000	and indoor hybrid.
1110000	1112000	There are six metrics in total.
1112000	1114000	I have a question.
1114000	1116000	Go ahead.
1116000	1118000	Do you consider
1118000	1120000	opening and closing
1120000	1121000	the window
1121000	1123000	or just
1123000	1124000	looking at
1124000	1126000	the exchange rate
1126000	1127000	under the air condition?
1127000	1129000	You'll see it later.
1129000	1131000	We'll talk about it later.
1131000	1133000	We'll talk about it later.
1133000	1135000	This slide
1135000	1137000	is about R-Line.
1137000	1139000	R-Line is a dispersion model.
1139000	1141000	You have to use R-Line.
1141000	1143000	In any air pollution model,
1143000	1145000	the most important thing
1145000	1147000	is emission.
1147000	1148000	This slide talks about
1148000	1150000	how emission is calculated
1150000	1152000	and where the data comes from.
1152000	1154000	This is not
1154000	1155000	too important
1155000	1156000	to everyone.
1156000	1157000	Let's not talk about it.
1157000	1158000	This is stoke.
1158000	1160000	It's the same as what I just said.
1160000	1161000	It is an
1161000	1162000	internal and external
1162000	1164000	critting technology.
1164000	1165000	It uses
1165000	1167000	the U.S. Environmental Protection
1167000	1169000	Air Quality System,
1169000	1170000	or AQS,
1170000	1172000	which is
1172000	1174000	the big test stations.
1174000	1175000	Finally,
1175000	1177000	these two things are added up.
1177000	1179000	This is
1179000	1181000	how to calculate
1181000	1183000	the corresponding
1183000	1185000	indoor concentration
1185000	1186000	of the outdoor concentration.
1186000	1188000	This is a very simple
1188000	1190000	mass balance model.
1190000	1192000	The internal
1192000	1194000	concentration
1194000	1196000	and time change
1196000	1198000	are determined by these terms.
1198000	1200000	The first is
1200000	1202000	the outdoor concentration
1202000	1204000	brought in by the
1204000	1206000	air exchange
1206000	1208000	and the
1208000	1210000	internal concentration
1210000	1212000	of the outdoor pollution.
1212000	1214000	This includes
1214000	1216000	deposition,
1216000	1218000	which is the rate
1218000	1220000	of indoor air
1220000	1222000	being excreted.
1222000	1224000	Here are some factors.
1224000	1226000	The penetration factor
1226000	1228000	is the rate of
1228000	1230000	incoming air.
1230000	1232000	The deposition rate
1232000	1234000	is the rate of
1234000	1236000	incoming air.
1236000	1238000	The penetration rate
1238000	1240000	is 1.
1240000	1242000	The deposition rate
1242000	1244000	is 0.5 per hour.
1248000	1250000	The PEM
1250000	1252000	has lower
1252000	1254000	penetration factor
1254000	1256000	and slower deposition rate.
1258000	1260000	The next question
1260000	1262000	is
1262000	1264000	what does
1264000	1266000	the AERM
1266000	1268000	consider?
1268000	1270000	The answer is no.
1270000	1272000	There are
1272000	1274000	three counties
1274000	1276000	in North Carolina.
1276000	1278000	The results
1278000	1280000	are based on
1280000	1282000	census block level.
1282000	1284000	There are
1284000	1286000	330,000 houses
1286000	1288000	in the area.
1288000	1290000	In theory,
1290000	1292000	the model
1292000	1294000	includes
1294000	1296000	windows and air-conditioning.
1296000	1298000	There is such a model,
1298000	1300000	but there is no data.
1300000	1302000	I cannot go to each
1302000	1304000	of the 330,000 houses
1304000	1306000	and tell them
1306000	1308000	what the
1308000	1310000	air-conditioning rate
1310000	1312000	is.
1312000	1314000	So we have to
1314000	1316000	consider
1316000	1318000	the house
1318000	1320000	and the air-conditioning rate.
1320000	1322000	I will not
1322000	1324000	go into details of
1324000	1326000	this model,
1326000	1328000	but basically
1328000	1330000	all the parameters
1330000	1332000	such as
1332000	1334000	the building
1334000	1336000	and the air-conditioning rate
1336000	1338000	have been used in the past.
1338000	1340000	For example,
1340000	1342000	if I want to look at
1342000	1344000	10 or 15 houses,
1344000	1346000	there is no problem.
1346000	1348000	But if I want to look at
1348000	1350000	330,000 houses,
1350000	1352000	I cannot do that.
1352000	1354000	So I have to
1354000	1356000	look for the data.
1356000	1358000	I use the county property
1358000	1360000	assessment record
1360000	1362000	to have the data
1362000	1364000	collected.
1364000	1366000	I will not go into
1366000	1368000	details of other data,
1368000	1370000	but basically
1370000	1372000	they are all public
1372000	1374000	available data.
1374000	1376000	For each census block,
1376000	1378000	I sample
1378000	1380000	about 10 houses
1380000	1382000	and use
1382000	1384000	these 10 houses
1384000	1386000	to represent the census block.
1386000	1388000	I do not make
1388000	1390000	330,000 houses
1390000	1392000	because my modeling domain
1392000	1394000	is the three counties in North Carolina.
1394000	1396000	Orange County is
1396000	1398000	where UNC is located.
1398000	1400000	Durham is
1400000	1402000	where Duke University is located.
1402000	1404000	So
1404000	1406000	don't go there.
1408000	1410000	This is
1410000	1412000	a snapshot.
1412000	1414000	I use the six
1414000	1416000	exposure metrics
1416000	1418000	and calculate them.
1418000	1420000	Then I draw
1420000	1422000	the map
1422000	1424000	and show it here.
1424000	1426000	A is the outdoor
1426000	1428000	stoke data.
1428000	1430000	It is the result of
1430000	1432000	internal and external
1432000	1434000	measurements.
1434000	1436000	B is the
1436000	1438000	outdoor hybrid data.
1438000	1440000	It is the result of
1440000	1442000	R-line traffic source
1442000	1444000	and background
1444000	1446000	interpolation.
1446000	1448000	Then I use
1448000	1450000	these two
1450000	1452000	air quality fields
1452000	1454000	to calculate the
1454000	1456000	indoor concentration
1456000	1458000	using the
1458000	1460000	simple mass balance model.
1460000	1462000	Let's look at
1462000	1464000	the outdoor stoke data.
1464000	1466000	Most of the concentration
1466000	1468000	is between 24 and 27.
1468000	1470000	There is no
1470000	1472000	spatial variation.
1472000	1474000	That's it.
1474000	1476000	If I remember
1476000	1478000	correctly,
1478000	1480000	there are only two or three
1480000	1482000	stokes.
1482000	1484000	If there are two or three
1484000	1486000	stokes with
1486000	1488000	interpolation,
1488000	1490000	you can only get
1490000	1492000	this result.
1492000	1494000	However,
1494000	1496000	if you add the local
1496000	1498000	source data,
1498000	1500000	you can see
1500000	1502000	the map
1502000	1504000	is different.
1506000	1508000	Let's look at
1508000	1510000	C, the indoor stoke.
1510000	1512000	The station
1512000	1514000	is a transportation source.
1514000	1516000	There are various types of stations.
1516000	1518000	Some are in the background,
1518000	1520000	such as National Park.
1520000	1522000	Some are near the traffic.
1522000	1524000	That's right.
1524000	1526000	We use the background
1526000	1528000	station.
1528000	1530000	It is close to the road.
1530000	1532000	Have you
1532000	1534000	used the
1534000	1536000	R-Line transportation model?
1536000	1538000	Yes,
1538000	1540000	I used it in the
1540000	1542000	last talk.
1542000	1544000	Thank you.
1548000	1550000	Let's look at
1550000	1552000	indoor stoke.
1552000	1554000	A is the input of C.
1554000	1556000	C and A
1556000	1558000	are compared.
1558000	1560000	First,
1560000	1562000	the color scale is reduced.
1562000	1564000	Second,
1564000	1566000	the spatial variation is increased.
1566000	1568000	The concentration
1568000	1570000	of C is between
1570000	1572000	7 and 14.
1572000	1574000	Compared to
1574000	1576000	the outdoor stoke above,
1576000	1578000	it is between 24 and 27.
1578000	1580000	Where do these spatial variations
1580000	1582000	come from?
1582000	1584000	They come from
1584000	1586000	the air exchange rate
1586000	1588000	above.
1588000	1590000	What does this mean?
1590000	1592000	If you only use the outdoor stoke above,
1592000	1594000	which is what they did,
1594000	1596000	they used that method
1596000	1598000	to predict
1598000	1600000	exposure.
1600000	1602000	If you look
1602000	1604000	to the right,
1604000	1606000	you can see
1606000	1608000	the concentration
1608000	1610000	of the local source.
1610000	1612000	If you look down,
1612000	1614000	you can see
1614000	1616000	the map of the
1616000	1618000	indoor concentration.
1618000	1620000	If you only look at the map,
1620000	1622000	you can see the difference.
1622000	1624000	The last one,
1624000	1626000	D, is the indoor hybrid.
1626000	1628000	The input source is B.
1628000	1630000	You can see
1630000	1632000	that the variation
1632000	1634000	is still the same.
1634000	1636000	You can see the high concentration
1636000	1638000	near the road,
1638000	1640000	and the low concentration
1640000	1642000	near the road.
1642000	1644000	If you look at the map above,
1644000	1646000	you can see
1646000	1648000	the difference between 90 and 100.
1648000	1650000	If you look at the map below,
1650000	1652000	you can't see the difference.
1652000	1654000	When you go indoor,
1654000	1656000	the absolute concentration
1656000	1658000	will decrease.
1662000	1664000	I have a question
1664000	1666000	about the front page.
1666000	1668000	This is a 2D model,
1668000	1670000	right?
1670000	1672000	You can also
1672000	1674000	make it vertical.
1676000	1678000	But this is
1678000	1680000	2 meters away from the ground.
1680000	1682000	I'm just curious.
1682000	1684000	Is the terrain around here
1684000	1686000	flat?
1686000	1688000	This area is quite flat.
1688000	1690000	This area is quite flat.
1690000	1692000	This area is quite flat.
1692000	1694000	It's a mountain to the west.
1694000	1696000	It's quite flat here.
1696000	1698000	I'm using a box plot
1698000	1700000	to show
1700000	1702000	the average concentration.
1702000	1704000	I'm using a box plot
1704000	1706000	to show the average concentration.
1706000	1708000	The concentration is distributed by
1708000	1710000	the pollutants.
1710000	1712000	I forgot what I was going to say.
1712000	1714000	I forgot what I was going to say.
1714000	1716000	Let's start with CO.
1716000	1718000	Let's start with CO.
1718000	1720000	If you only look at
1720000	1722000	the black and white boxes,
1722000	1724000	the black represents
1724000	1726000	the outdoor concentration.
1726000	1728000	The white represents
1728000	1730000	the indoor concentration.
1730000	1732000	You can see that
1732000	1734000	CO is about the same.
1734000	1736000	Look at Stokes.
1736000	1738000	Outdoor and indoor are about the same.
1738000	1740000	On-road is about the same.
1740000	1742000	Hybrid is about the same.
1742000	1744000	Why is that?
1744000	1746000	It's because of the
1746000	1748000	penetration factor and
1748000	1750000	deposition factor.
1750000	1752000	CO penetration factor is 1.
1752000	1754000	Deposition rate is 0.
1754000	1756000	So the indoor and outdoor concentration
1756000	1758000	are about the same.
1758000	1760000	On NOX, the penetration factor is 1.
1760000	1762000	Deposition rate is 0.5.
1762000	1764000	You can see that
1764000	1766000	the indoor concentration is lower
1766000	1768000	than the outdoor concentration.
1768000	1770000	It's about half of the indoor concentration.
1772000	1774000	On PM, the particulate matter,
1774000	1776000	PM and EC,
1776000	1778000	the indoor concentration is about the same.
1778000	1780000	The outdoor concentration is half of the indoor concentration.
1780000	1782000	If you use the outdoor concentration
1782000	1784000	to represent the deposition rate,
1784000	1786000	you may overestimate the deposition rate.
1790000	1792000	Now let's compare
1792000	1794000	Stokes and On-Road.
1794000	1796000	Stokes and On-Road.
1796000	1798000	The two black and white boxes
1798000	1800000	on the left
1800000	1802000	and the two black and white boxes
1802000	1804000	in the middle.
1804000	1806000	Let's look at
1806000	1808000	CO and NOX.
1808000	1810000	CO and NOX.
1810000	1812000	You can see that
1812000	1814000	Stokes is much higher than
1814000	1816000	On-Road in terms of CO.
1816000	1818000	But NOX is closer.
1818000	1820000	Why is that?
1820000	1822000	Because of traffic pollution,
1822000	1824000	NOX emitted by
1824000	1826000	cars and
1826000	1828000	cars is very high.
1828000	1830000	I don't have the table here,
1830000	1832000	but I remember that
1832000	1834000	some NOX emissions
1834000	1836000	may be up to 40%,
1836000	1838000	which means
1838000	1840000	these cars emit a lot of pollution.
1840000	1842000	So you can see that
1842000	1844000	Stokes is higher than On-Road.
1844000	1846000	In particular,
1846000	1848000	On-Road is very low
1848000	1850000	in terms of PM2.
1850000	1852000	In terms of
1852000	1854000	primary PM2,
1854000	1856000	its total emissions
1856000	1858000	may only reach
1858000	1860000	about 5%.
1860000	1862000	But in terms of EC,
1862000	1864000	the smaller PM2
1864000	1866000	in terms of
1866000	1868000	PM2.5,
1868000	1870000	its combustion
1870000	1872000	may be higher.
1872000	1874000	OK.
1874000	1876000	What I'm looking at here is
1876000	1878000	the ratio of density.
1878000	1880000	What I want to look at
1880000	1882000	is spatial variation.
1882000	1884000	I calculated a value
1884000	1886000	called spatial coefficient
1886000	1888000	of variation.
1888000	1890000	The higher the value,
1890000	1892000	the higher the spatial variation.
1892000	1894000	The higher the value,
1894000	1896000	the higher the spatial variation.
1896000	1898000	OK.
1898000	1900000	What we want to look at now is
1900000	1902000	whether these things
1902000	1904000	represent exposure or not.
1904000	1906000	Most people use
1906000	1908000	Stokes' Outdoor Concentration,
1908000	1910000	which means
1910000	1912000	the side station
1912000	1914000	represents exposure.
1914000	1916000	The black box on the left
1916000	1918000	represents Stokes'
1918000	1920000	Outdoor Stokes.
1920000	1922000	You can see that
1922000	1924000	there's a big difference.
1924000	1926000	For example,
1926000	1928000	Stokes' spatial variation
1928000	1930000	is very low.
1930000	1932000	The white box on the left
1932000	1934000	represents Stokes'
1934000	1936000	Outdoor Stokes.
1936000	1938000	Why?
1938000	1940000	Because I added
1940000	1942000	the spatial variation
1942000	1944000	of air exchange rate.
1944000	1946000	If you use the box on the left
1946000	1948000	to represent exposure,
1948000	1950000	you will get
1950000	1952000	the spatial variation.
1956000	1958000	In epidemiology,
1958000	1960000	there's a way
1960000	1962000	to classify exposure.
1962000	1964000	Sometimes we don't use
1964000	1966000	absolute concentration.
1966000	1968000	For example,
1968000	1970000	50 micrograms per cubic meter
1970000	1972000	represents exposure.
1972000	1974000	Sometimes we just use it
1974000	1976000	to classify.
1976000	1978000	For example,
1978000	1980000	low concentration
1980000	1982000	represents 0-2 micrograms.
1982000	1984000	Medium concentration
1984000	1986000	represents 2-4 micrograms.
1986000	1988000	High concentration
1988000	1990000	represents 4-8 micrograms.
1990000	1992000	Let's do something similar.
1992000	1994000	Let's divide
1994000	1996000	6 exposure metrics
1996000	1998000	into 5 groups,
1998000	2000000	0-20%, 20-40%,
2000000	2002000	40-60%, and so on.
2002000	2004000	Now I need an answer.
2004000	2006000	Let's assume
2006000	2008000	the real exposure
2008000	2010000	is the hybrid-based
2010000	2012000	indoor concentration.
2012000	2014000	It represents the real exposure.
2014000	2016000	First, it considers local source.
2016000	2018000	Second, it considers
2018000	2020000	indoor concentration.
2020000	2022000	That is,
2022000	2024000	the hybrid-based indoor
2024000	2026000	is the answer.
2026000	2028000	Let's divide it
2028000	2030000	into 5 groups.
2030000	2032000	On the left,
2032000	2034000	we are going to compare
2034000	2036000	the remaining 5 exposure metrics.
2038000	2040000	First,
2040000	2042000	let's compare
2042000	2044000	outdoor hybrid and
2044000	2046000	hybrid-based indoor.
2046000	2048000	The red numbers
2048000	2050000	represent
2050000	2052000	the agreement.
2052000	2054000	The higher the number,
2054000	2056000	if it is 100%,
2056000	2058000	it means
2058000	2060000	100% agree with each other.
2060000	2062000	For example,
2062000	2064000	the 0-20% group
2064000	2066000	is the hybrid-based
2066000	2068000	indoor group.
2068000	2070000	When you use
2070000	2072000	outdoor hybrid
2072000	2074000	to represent exposure,
2074000	2076000	only 50%,
2076000	2078000	49.22% of the sensors
2078000	2080000	will fall in the same group.
2080000	2082000	When you use
2082000	2084000	these 5 criteria
2084000	2086000	to divide the exposure
2086000	2088000	from high to low,
2088000	2090000	only 50% of the sensors
2090000	2092000	will fall in the same group.
2096000	2098000	The highest group
2098000	2100000	is the NOx group,
2100000	2102000	with 73% of the sensors
2102000	2104000	falling in the same group.
2104000	2106000	The NOx group
2106000	2108000	mainly
2108000	2110000	considers on-road source.
2110000	2112000	The NOx group
2112000	2114000	also considers
2114000	2116000	on-road source.
2116000	2118000	If you can capture the local source,
2118000	2120000	you can capture
2120000	2122000	most of the pollution.
2126000	2128000	Your analysis unit
2128000	2130000	is the sensor's track, right?
2130000	2132000	No, sensor's block.
2132000	2134000	What about spatial resolution?
2134000	2136000	Your model can run hourly, right?
2136000	2138000	Yes, hourly.
2140000	2142000	You have a sensor's track
2142000	2144000	and hourly data.
2144000	2146000	Did you match
2146000	2148000	the contingency
2148000	2150000	to the group?
2150000	2152000	No.
2152000	2154000	I used the annual average.
2154000	2156000	This should be only the annual average.
2158000	2160000	This is not the hourly level.
2160000	2162000	I used the sensor's block,
2162000	2164000	not the sensor's track.
2168000	2170000	Let's look at
2170000	2172000	the worst case.
2172000	2174000	The outdoor stock
2174000	2176000	is the most widely used
2176000	2178000	in the research
2178000	2180000	on viral diseases.
2184000	2186000	Compared with the hybrid-based
2186000	2188000	indoor,
2188000	2190000	the red line
2190000	2192000	is 25.54% lower
2192000	2194000	than the red line.
2194000	2196000	What does it mean?
2196000	2198000	It means you may have
2198000	2200000	such a big exposure error.
2200000	2202000	Why?
2202000	2204000	First, you did not consider
2204000	2206000	the local source.
2206000	2208000	Second, you did not consider
2208000	2210000	the indoor concentration.
2212000	2214000	The surprising thing
2214000	2216000	is that
2216000	2218000	the performance
2218000	2220000	of the on-road concentration
2220000	2222000	is very good.
2222000	2224000	The on-road concentration
2224000	2226000	is only the on-road part.
2226000	2228000	It does not consider the background level.
2228000	2230000	Why?
2230000	2232000	The reason is the same as before.
2232000	2234000	A large part of the NOx
2234000	2236000	comes from the gas engine.
2236000	2238000	It also controls
2238000	2240000	the spatially.
2240000	2242000	When you only use this,
2242000	2244000	you can clearly see
2244000	2246000	the higher the concentration
2246000	2248000	on the on-road,
2248000	2250000	the lower the concentration
2250000	2252000	on the off-road.
2252000	2254000	As long as you can capture this,
2254000	2256000	you can capture
2256000	2258000	the difference.
2258000	2260000	It also considers
2260000	2262000	the indoor concentration.
2262000	2264000	It uses the air exchange rate
2264000	2266000	to reflect the air exchange rate
2266000	2268000	between each house.
2268000	2270000	The performance is good.
2270000	2272000	The highest group
2272000	2274000	can reach 89%.
2274000	2276000	Here,
2276000	2278000	I am showing
2278000	2280000	a similar situation.
2280000	2282000	You can see
2282000	2284000	there is no hybrid indoor.
2284000	2286000	This is the answer.
2286000	2288000	Other things
2288000	2290000	are cut out.
2290000	2292000	Then,
2292000	2294000	it becomes a box plot.
2296000	2298000	Each box
2298000	2300000	represents
2300000	2302000	when you use
2302000	2304000	the specific exposure metric
2304000	2306000	to represent the exposure,
2306000	2308000	what is the difference?
2308000	2310000	Let's look at
2310000	2312000	the most widely used
2312000	2314000	exposure metric,
2314000	2316000	Stoke Outdoor Concentration.
2316000	2318000	You can see
2318000	2320000	the normalized difference
2320000	2322000	is very high.
2322000	2324000	The average of NOx
2324000	2326000	is about 80-90%.
2332000	2334000	The conclusion is
2334000	2336000	that
2336000	2338000	it is very complicated.
2338000	2340000	There are many
2340000	2342000	different analysis and pollution.
2342000	2344000	The pollution
2344000	2346000	and the traffic
2346000	2348000	are different.
2348000	2350000	Bear with me.
2350000	2352000	Basically,
2352000	2354000	CO and PN2.5
2354000	2356000	traffic
2358000	2360000	is lower.
2360000	2362000	14% and 6%.
2362000	2364000	NOx and ECO
2364000	2366000	are higher.
2366000	2368000	40% and 44%.
2370000	2372000	When you use
2372000	2374000	the indoor infiltration model,
2374000	2376000	the indoor concentration
2376000	2378000	is about 60%
2378000	2380000	of the outdoor concentration.
2380000	2382000	It will be reduced by 40%.
2382000	2384000	When you use the outdoor concentration
2384000	2386000	to represent the exposure,
2386000	2388000	it is not right.
2388000	2390000	The concentration is not that high.
2390000	2392000	The exposure is not that high.
2392000	2394000	Okay.
2404000	2406000	It is too complicated.
2406000	2408000	This is my
2408000	2410000	acknowledgment.
2410000	2412000	I used to work at UNC.
2412000	2414000	The funding source is
2414000	2416000	the EPA contract.
2416000	2418000	The EPA provides emission
2418000	2420000	and meteorological data.
2420000	2422000	The EPA has not joined us yet.
2422000	2424000	This is a reference.
2426000	2428000	That's it.
2428000	2430000	Thank you.
2434000	2436000	Thank you.
2436000	2438000	Do the audience
2438000	2440000	have any questions?
2450000	2452000	I don't think so.
2452000	2454000	Yay!
2454000	2456000	You can join us
2456000	2458000	on Saturday afternoon.
2458000	2460000	Don't be so academic.
2460000	2462000	This is interesting.
2462000	2464000	You can see it with R-Line.
2464000	2466000	For example,
2466000	2468000	why is there a basketball court next to the bridge?
2468000	2470000	When I started
2470000	2472000	doing this,
2472000	2474000	especially after I moved here,
2474000	2476000	the Golden Gate Bridge
2476000	2478000	next to San Francisco
2478000	2480000	is a place
2480000	2482000	for jogging and cycling.
2482000	2484000	There are six lanes.
2484000	2486000	There are three lanes
2486000	2488000	on each side of the bridge.
2488000	2490000	Normally, cars drive very slowly on the bridge.
2490000	2492000	In terms of emissions,
2492000	2494000	the slower the car drives,
2494000	2496000	the higher the emissions.
2496000	2498000	People jogging and cycling
2498000	2500000	next to the bridge
2500000	2502000	breathe in the air very happily.
2504000	2506000	My idea is that
2506000	2508000	if you move the basketball court
2508000	2510000	to the middle of the bridge,
2510000	2512000	you can save a lot of
2512000	2514000	motority.
2514000	2516000	Just move it a few feet.
2516000	2518000	Taiwan is small.
2518000	2520000	Is there a way?
2524000	2526000	I have a question.
2526000	2528000	Please go ahead.
2528000	2530000	The question is
2530000	2532000	if you look at
2532000	2534000	the road emission data
2534000	2536000	on the road,
2538000	2540000	you won't stand next to the road
2540000	2542000	to check if every car
2542000	2544000	is a Tesla
2544000	2546000	or a diesel car.
2546000	2548000	But
2548000	2550000	there is a free parameter
2550000	2552000	here.
2552000	2554000	If all the cars driving today
2554000	2556000	are Tesla, half Tesla, half pickup,
2556000	2558000	and all big trucks,
2558000	2560000	how much improvement can there be?
2560000	2562000	Is it possible
2562000	2564000	to justify
2564000	2566000	how much
2566000	2568000	public sector
2568000	2570000	resources should be invested
2570000	2572000	to promote
2572000	2574000	a policy that seems to
2574000	2576000	change the quality of air?
2576000	2578000	This is also a very important point.
2578000	2580000	Fleet distribution.
2580000	2582000	When talking about traffic pollutants,
2582000	2584000	a very important parameter is
2584000	2586000	fleet distribution.
2586000	2588000	Is there a difference in the composition
2588000	2590000	of each place's car?
2590000	2592000	We use MOVES
2592000	2594000	to deal with this.
2596000	2598000	Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator
2598000	2600000	is used to deal with this
2600000	2602000	in terms of models.
2602000	2604000	In terms of models,
2604000	2606000	you can tell MOVES
2606000	2608000	that half of the fleet distribution
2608000	2610000	is electric vehicles
2610000	2612000	and the other half is diesel vehicles.
2612000	2614000	You can make these adjustments
2614000	2616000	and see how much these things change.
2616000	2618000	But
2618000	2620000	in terms of models,
2620000	2622000	I think you can do this.
2622000	2624000	But if you want to
2624000	2626000	seal off a street
2626000	2628000	and make the entire fleet
2628000	2630000	50% Tesla,
2630000	2632000	it's a bit difficult.
2632000	2634000	But what you said is a very good point.
2634000	2636000	I don't remember
2636000	2638000	having seen
2638000	2640000	a similar study
2640000	2642000	on fleet distribution.
2642000	2644000	Coach, have you seen a similar study?
2644000	2646000	He's probably taking care of the kids.
2646000	2648000	I don't remember
2648000	2650000	having seen a similar study
2650000	2652000	on changing the fleet distribution
2652000	2654000	and changing it to electric vehicles.
2654000	2656000	I haven't seen such a study.
2660000	2662000	Thank you.
2664000	2666000	I have a question.
2666000	2668000	I'm a bit curious.
2668000	2670000	When I first saw this topic,
2670000	2672000	I thought it was interesting
2672000	2674000	and I wanted to know more about it.
2674000	2676000	So I looked it up online
2676000	2678000	and it seems like
2678000	2680000	North Carolina's air pollution
2680000	2682000	is more serious.
2682000	2684000	This area is
2684000	2686000	the NC Piedmont region.
2686000	2688000	North Carolina is divided into four areas.
2688000	2690000	Coastline,
2690000	2692000	Piedmont,
2692000	2694000	and Mountain.
2694000	2696000	Piedmont is a bit like a triangle.
2696000	2698000	This area is an RTP area,
2698000	2700000	so the air pollution
2700000	2702000	is a bit more serious.
2702000	2704000	The other reason
2704000	2706000	why I did these three counties
2706000	2708000	is because we had a plan
2708000	2710000	with EPA.
2710000	2712000	They wanted to use
2712000	2714000	the metrics I just mentioned
2714000	2716000	to do their epidemiological studies.
2716000	2718000	They had a study
2718000	2720000	on heart disease.
2720000	2722000	They wanted to use
2722000	2724000	air pollution data.
2724000	2726000	We had a contract
2726000	2728000	with EPA
2728000	2730000	to do this study.
2730000	2732000	When I talked to them last time,
2732000	2734000	they said they were already
2734000	2736000	writing a paper.
2736000	2738000	I don't know where it went.
2738000	2740000	So the research
2740000	2742000	done in this area
2742000	2744000	is quite valuable.
2744000	2746000	Because the EPA
2746000	2748000	is located there.
2748000	2750000	The EPA's R&D office
2750000	2752000	is located there.
2752000	2754000	A lot of research
2754000	2756000	is done there.
2756000	2758000	Yesterday,
2758000	2760000	a few people from UNC
2760000	2762000	came to our lab.
2762000	2764000	I asked them,
2764000	2766000	I heard the air pollution
2766000	2768000	in UNC is very serious.
2768000	2770000	They were surprised.
2770000	2772000	I said, really?
2772000	2774000	The air there is much better than California.
2774000	2776000	I said it was serious
2776000	2778000	compared to
2778000	2780000	North Carolina.
2780000	2782000	Even in Piedmont,
2782000	2784000	although it's a serious area,
2784000	2786000	it's still very low.
2786000	2788000	Okay.
2788000	2790000	North Carolina is a very clean area.
2790000	2792000	The population of North Carolina
2792000	2794000	should be four times that of Taiwan.
2794000	2796000	The population is only 9 million.
2796000	2798000	In South California,
2798000	2800000	the population of
2800000	2802000	one county is 20 million.
2802000	2804000	Yes.
2804000	2806000	I believe
2806000	2808000	air pollution is more serious.
2808000	2810000	The more people,
2810000	2812000	the more air pollution.
2812000	2814000	Near Road Study
2814000	2816000	and
2816000	2818000	Children's Health Study
2818000	2820000	are all done by
2820000	2822000	senior scientists
2822000	2824000	in our company.
2824000	2826000	Many of them
2826000	2828000	are in LA.
2828000	2830000	The first project
2830000	2832000	I joined was
2832000	2834000	to use R-Line
2834000	2836000	to predict the air flow
2836000	2838000	of children
2838000	2840000	due to air pollution.
2840000	2842000	The system
2842000	2844000	is also for
2844000	2846000	the entire
2846000	2848000	South Coast area.
2848000	2850000	The entire
2850000	2852000	South Coast area.
2852000	2854000	That area should be
2854000	2856000	well-known
2856000	2858000	for air pollution.
2858000	2860000	Actually,
2860000	2862000	in Joe's
2864000	2866000	presentation,
2866000	2868000	I think
2868000	2870000	it was
2870000	2872000	in the 1970s.
2872000	2874000	It was
2874000	2876000	Los Angeles Times.
2876000	2878000	It was
2878000	2880000	in the 1970s.
2880000	2882000	It was
2882000	2884000	LA Times.
2884000	2886000	It was
2886000	2888000	talking about
2888000	2890000	air pollution.
2890000	2892000	I remember
2892000	2894000	it was
2894000	2896000	700 ppb.
2896000	2898000	700 ppb
2898000	2900000	is not a big deal.
2900000	2902000	The standard in Europe
2902000	2904000	is 70 ppb.
2904000	2906000	It's quite high.
2906000	2908000	700 ppb in that era.
2908000	2910000	Some of the senior
2910000	2912000	people in our company
2912000	2914000	lived in LA when they were young.
2914000	2916000	Standing outside
2916000	2918000	would make you cry.
2918000	2920000	It's an older magnitude.
2920000	2922000	It's very, very
2922000	2924000	exaggerated.
2924000	2926000	Air basing.
2926000	2928000	The air
2928000	2930000	is relatively stable.
2930000	2932000	Air pollution can't escape.
2936000	2938000	Thank you for your answer.
2938000	2940000	I want to ask
2940000	2942000	if there are any other questions.
2942000	2944000	If not,
2944000	2946000	let me promote Tyra.
2946000	2948000	Got it?
2948000	2950000	OK.
2950000	2952000	I want to
2952000	2954000	ask you a question.
2954000	2956000	Yes.
2956000	2958000	Do you have a question?
2958000	2960000	No.
2960000	2962000	OK.
2962000	2964000	You know what I'm doing,
2964000	2966000	right?
2966000	2968000	Let me
2968000	2970000	talk about it.
2970000	2972000	Basically,
2972000	2974000	a lot of
2974000	2976000	epidemiologists
2976000	2978000	and epidemiologists
2978000	2980000	have underestimated
2980000	2982000	the impact of air pollution.
2982000	2984000	The main reason is
2984000	2986000	from an economic perspective,
2986000	2988000	when you know the air quality is bad,
2988000	2990000	you will optimize your behavior.
2990000	2992000	So your hospital,
2992000	2994000	acute hospital admission,
2994000	2996000	or all the end points
2996000	2998000	are the results
2998000	3000000	after people optimize their behavior.
3000000	3002000	So some things,
3002000	3004000	like ozone,
3004000	3006000	CO,
3006000	3008000	you may not see anything
3008000	3010000	because when you realize
3010000	3012000	the air quality is bad,
3012000	3014000	you don't go out.
3014000	3016000	So I think
3016000	3018000	from an economic perspective
3018000	3020000	and epidemiological perspective,
3020000	3022000	it's a big difference.
3024000	3026000	When the air quality is bad,
3026000	3028000	you can choose a different transportation mode.
3028000	3030000	For example, in Taiwan,
3030000	3032000	you ride a scooter,
3032000	3034000	but when the air quality is bad,
3034000	3036000	you ride a bus.
3036000	3038000	If people don't optimize
3038000	3040000	their behavior,
3040000	3042000	the effect may be worse.
3042000	3044000	This has nothing to do
3044000	3046000	with today's topic.
3046000	3048000	It's interesting.
3048000	3050000	What's your name?
3050000	3052000	Yishu.
3052000	3054000	Yishu, right?
3054000	3056000	I want to ask,
3056000	3058000	do you work on energy policy?
3058000	3060000	Yes, I do.
3060000	3062000	I have an article
3062000	3064000	about Taipei Metro and air pollution.
3064000	3066000	For example,
3066000	3068000	in the US,
3068000	3070000	the government,
3070000	3072000	for example,
3072000	3074000	when they want to change
3074000	3076000	their policy,
3076000	3078000	do they refer to the research
3078000	3080000	or the company?
3080000	3082000	Or do they get an average?
3082000	3084000	The policy setup
3084000	3086000	is basically a political negotiation process.
3086000	3088000	For example,
3088000	3090000	in California,
3090000	3092000	I want to push 50% of energy
3092000	3094000	to renewable sources.
3094000	3096000	The government's policy
3096000	3098000	comes out like this.
3098000	3100000	The next step is
3100000	3102000	to hand it over to California
3102000	3104000	Air Resources Board
3104000	3106000	or other government agencies
3106000	3108000	to implement it.
3108000	3110000	Under my overall policy target,
3110000	3112000	how do I use
3112000	3114000	what they call
3114000	3116000	economic instruments?
3116000	3118000	For example,
3118000	3120000	I do a lot of electricity markets.
3120000	3122000	It's basically a competitive market.
3122000	3124000	Now, you can't force
3124000	3126000	these companies
3126000	3128000	to use renewable energy.
3128000	3130000	Many times,
3130000	3132000	our target is to
3132000	3134000	come out with the way
3134000	3136000	to use market instruments.
3136000	3138000	For example,
3138000	3140000	I can cross-subsidy renewable energy
3140000	3142000	from the fossil fuel
3142000	3144000	or dirty energy.
3144000	3146000	I can use this method
3146000	3148000	to let those firms
3148000	3150000	have a policy goal
3150000	3152000	and use the market
3152000	3154000	to achieve that result.
3154000	3156000	I think policy is
3156000	3158000	important for researchers.
3158000	3160000	For example,
3160000	3162000	what I'm doing here
3162000	3164000	is CO2 reduction.
3164000	3166000	Basically,
3166000	3168000	our funding source
3168000	3170000	is based on government policy.
3170000	3172000	Trump said
3172000	3174000	he doesn't support
3174000	3176000	energy.
3176000	3178000	Do you worry about
3178000	3180000	the next five years?
3180000	3182000	I don't think so.
3182000	3184000	But others are worried
3184000	3186000	about the Institute.
3186000	3188000	Our Institute is
3188000	3190000	not only in Caltech,
3190000	3192000	but also in Stanford
3192000	3194000	and Berkeley.
3194000	3196000	Everyone is worried about it.
3196000	3198000	Now, it seems like
3198000	3200000	it has been guaranteed
3200000	3202000	to be implemented in 2020.
3202000	3204000	Except Trump,
3204000	3206000	I don't think it's possible
3206000	3208000	to implement it in California.
3208000	3210000	California is a pioneer
3210000	3212000	in environmental policy.
3212000	3214000	Even though
3214000	3216000	the federal funding
3216000	3218000	is not enough,
3218000	3220000	we have a lot of state-funded funding.
3220000	3222000	Thank you for your comment.
3222000	3224000	I think it's interesting.
3224000	3226000	I'll send you an email.
3226000	3228000	I think we can work together.
3228000	3230000	Okay.
3232000	3234000	Let me interrupt.
3234000	3236000	You mentioned
3236000	3238000	policy design.
3238000	3240000	If I'm not mistaken,
3240000	3242000	next week's talk
3242000	3244000	is about economics.
3244000	3246000	It's about
3246000	3248000	mechanism design.
3248000	3250000	It's not
3250000	3252000	specific to
3252000	3254000	energy policy design.
3254000	3256000	It's about
3256000	3258000	mechanism design itself.
3258000	3260000	I just realized
3260000	3262000	it has something to do with
3262000	3264000	what you were talking about.
3264000	3266000	I think we can
3266000	3268000	keep in touch.
3268000	3270000	You should have it.
3270000	3272000	I'm in control of everything.
3272000	3274000	Okay.
3274000	3276000	I'm just cyber-stalking you
3276000	3278000	right now.
3278000	3280000	I already have
3280000	3282000	C.
3282000	3284000	I can stalk others.
3284000	3286000	Keep stalking.
3286000	3288000	I was wondering
3288000	3290000	if
3290000	3292000	Jiao Yan joined
3292000	3294000	Taira's team.
3294000	3296000	If you're interested in joining Taira.
3296000	3298000	She gave a talk last year.
3298000	3300000	She gave a talk last year.
3300000	3302000	Yixu,
3302000	3304000	are you in Taira?
3304000	3306000	You're a passer-by.
3306000	3308000	I'm a passer-by.
3308000	3310000	You can join us next time.
3310000	3312000	Okay.
3312000	3314000	I'll give you the membership form.
3314000	3316000	I'll give you the membership form.
3316000	3318000	Okay.
3318000	3320000	If you're interested,
3320000	3322000	you're welcome to join Taira.
3322000	3324000	Okay.
3324000	3326000	The biggest problem is
3326000	3328000	you can't find students
3328000	3330000	even if you want to.
3330000	3332000	What students?
3332000	3334000	PhD students.
3334000	3336000	You mean me?
3336000	3338000	I mean me.
3338000	3340000	I can't find students.
3340000	3342000	Not necessarily.
3342000	3344000	We'll have students
3344000	3346000	after the promotion.
3346000	3348000	I'll turn off
3348000	3350000	the recording of our talk.
