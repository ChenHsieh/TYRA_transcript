WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
All right, so today's speaker is Fang Sichun, MD.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.200
So Fang Sichun is actually one of my friend

00:11.200 --> 00:15.280
back to college from entomology department.

00:15.280 --> 00:20.280
And he's doing PhD in University of Texas, Austin.

00:21.840 --> 00:26.760
And he's going to introduce some story about ants to us.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.720
So just give the time to Andy now.

00:31.880 --> 00:32.720
All right.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.000
Thank you, Oscar.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.720
Thanks for the introduction.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.720
So today I have four things that I want to share with you.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.000
The main idea is to show you the embryo development

00:46.000 --> 00:49.760
of one of the live callers, one of the antennae ants,

00:49.760 --> 00:51.600
and we also call it live callers.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.360
The species name is Ada texana.

00:54.400 --> 00:59.400
And since my childhood,

00:59.840 --> 01:01.880
I bet everybody watched Lion King before.

01:01.880 --> 01:04.040
And this is one clip from that movie.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.000
That scene was fascinating.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.880
That was actually the first time I knew,

01:08.880 --> 01:10.800
oh, there are some ants with a couple leaves

01:10.800 --> 01:12.200
and bring them back.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.120
But at that moment, I didn't know what they were doing

01:15.120 --> 01:19.000
or not even saying what is the social insects.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.240
So I'm going to show you

01:23.240 --> 01:28.120
what are the typical, like a true social insects around us.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.160
Termites, honeybees, ants, and wasps.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.920
So the typical pictures for social insects

01:36.920 --> 01:40.320
is that they have hierarchical level.

01:40.320 --> 01:45.320
For example, they have workers, they have queens.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.120
Sometimes they will have big soldiers,

01:49.120 --> 01:51.240
like a larger body size.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.560
And also all of the characters I mentioned,

01:54.560 --> 01:55.640
they're all females.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.360
For those sexual reproductive system social insects,

02:00.360 --> 02:01.680
they do have males.

02:03.120 --> 02:07.360
So how do we distinguish the male and the female

02:07.360 --> 02:08.280
social insects?

02:08.280 --> 02:12.680
Oh, by the way, termites, it's kind of awkward.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.760
The sexual determination for termites,

02:15.760 --> 02:20.240
it's different as honeybees, wasps, or ants.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.600
And we're not going to explore too much

02:22.600 --> 02:24.480
about termites today.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.480
Okay, so when we talk about the sex determination

02:29.600 --> 02:33.960
for use of social insects, let's take ants as the example.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.720
This is the word that people will see.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.760
We call the haploid diploidy.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.320
So haploid means one set of chromosome

02:43.320 --> 02:46.200
and diploid means like two sets of chromosome.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.600
Take us human being as the example,

02:48.640 --> 02:50.160
we are diploid.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.480
Okay, that means we have two sets of chromosome.

02:53.480 --> 02:57.640
And the way that human being decides the sex

02:57.640 --> 03:00.960
is based on X or Y chromosome.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.720
But the story is different in ants world.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.960
For the males, for the male ants,

03:06.960 --> 03:09.840
they actually only have one set of chromosome,

03:09.840 --> 03:11.320
which is haploid.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.240
And for the females, including queens or workers,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.800
they do have two sets of chromosome.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.200
So let's say if the egg got fertilized,

03:22.200 --> 03:25.320
that will become a future queen or future worker,

03:25.320 --> 03:27.880
which is a female, right?

03:27.880 --> 03:30.840
If the egg didn't get fertilized successfully,

03:30.840 --> 03:35.280
can be a trophic egg or it can be a male, right?

03:35.280 --> 03:40.280
So as I mentioned that Disney influenced me a lot

03:40.760 --> 03:42.240
since my childhood,

03:42.240 --> 03:45.000
but actually sometimes they make some mistakes.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
So this is the clip from the Bugs Life by Pixar Disney.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.120
The left hand side,

03:55.120 --> 03:59.280
that's supposed to be a male worker in that movie,

03:59.280 --> 04:00.680
his name is Flick.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.600
And the right hand side is the princess Ada,

04:04.880 --> 04:08.720
a female version queen that Flick fall in love with.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.840
One thing, the first thing Pixar made like wrongly

04:15.680 --> 04:18.280
is Flick can never be a male worker.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.480
There's no male worker, okay?

04:20.480 --> 04:24.120
And a second, if we consider the real situation

04:24.120 --> 04:26.080
in the field, talking about Ada,

04:26.080 --> 04:28.120
this genus, Ada Texana,

04:28.120 --> 04:29.880
the queen, the size of the queen

04:29.880 --> 04:32.560
is way bigger than the worker.

04:32.560 --> 04:37.560
So if we want to correct Pixar in the movie,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.000
it should be like this.

04:39.960 --> 04:44.280
So that's a queen and a worker, okay?

04:44.320 --> 04:46.120
And what's the real situation?

04:47.560 --> 04:52.000
Here is the Ada queen and here is the worker, okay?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.840
So how do you decide?

04:53.840 --> 04:58.840
How does the egg decide to be a queen or a worker?

04:59.640 --> 05:00.560
Since both of them,

05:00.560 --> 05:03.600
they are deployed like a fertilized eggs.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.000
It's still a mystery, okay?

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
So here I have a simple cartoon figure to show you.

05:12.320 --> 05:16.600
Question marks on the slides means

05:16.600 --> 05:18.880
there's still something like the mechanism

05:18.880 --> 05:20.560
that we don't know.

05:20.560 --> 05:25.560
So back to 1990s, Diana Wither and other groups,

05:26.240 --> 05:30.280
they thought juvenile hormone plays an important role

05:30.280 --> 05:33.240
at the late level stage to determine

05:33.240 --> 05:36.120
whether that individual will become a future queen

05:36.120 --> 05:37.640
or just a worker.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.440
The more juvenile hormone got expressed,

05:40.480 --> 05:43.480
the higher possibility that individual

05:43.480 --> 05:45.880
will become a queen, okay?

05:45.880 --> 05:49.640
And till 2015, another group, they figured out,

05:49.640 --> 05:53.320
oh, EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor receptor,

05:53.320 --> 05:56.200
gene, plays another important role

05:56.200 --> 05:58.040
during late level stage,

05:58.040 --> 06:01.720
may involve in caste determination.

06:02.880 --> 06:07.560
But the other group from Canada, Ahab's lab,

06:08.520 --> 06:13.520
they published a series of paper back to 2008 and 2010,

06:13.760 --> 06:16.680
and they brought up really interesting

06:16.680 --> 06:20.400
and important finding as they thought

06:21.320 --> 06:24.000
the caste determination may be determined

06:24.000 --> 06:27.960
at a very, very early stage during oogenesis, okay?

06:27.960 --> 06:32.960
Oogenesis means before the egg being laid,

06:33.160 --> 06:36.800
i.e. the egg still in the ovary.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.880
Due to some gene regulation,

06:39.760 --> 06:44.040
their final character, like either queen or worker,

06:44.040 --> 06:47.160
will be determined, okay?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.840
And how about the embryo development?

06:50.840 --> 06:54.800
Do people know anything about embryo development?

06:54.800 --> 06:59.520
The answer is no before I start to have my PhD.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.160
And that was actually quite surprising

07:05.040 --> 07:08.200
because people study ants a lot.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.200
For example, like fire ants, like how to kill them, right?

07:11.200 --> 07:15.640
But or some interesting ecological concepts

07:15.640 --> 07:17.240
or behavioral studies,

07:17.240 --> 07:21.120
like ants are one of the hottest species

07:21.120 --> 07:24.480
when you study insects

07:24.480 --> 07:26.560
that people will just use as a material.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.680
But surprisingly, we don't know too much

07:31.360 --> 07:34.040
during the egg stage or the larva stage

07:34.840 --> 07:35.680
or the pupa stage, okay?

07:35.680 --> 07:39.840
People apparently care more about the later on stage

07:39.840 --> 07:42.160
like the adult, like what's their behavior.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.600
So when I look back to those references,

07:45.600 --> 07:49.080
we left so many question marks, okay?

07:49.080 --> 07:52.600
No matter like how many people study ants,

07:52.600 --> 07:55.360
we still don't know too much about egg stage.

07:56.560 --> 08:01.560
And there was the paper back to 2006

08:01.920 --> 08:06.800
and they show some footage

08:06.800 --> 08:10.000
of the embryo development of two ants.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.320
The left-hand side, this one is Argentine ants,

08:13.320 --> 08:14.760
which is the huge pest.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.480
And this one is the Ferroni ants,

08:16.480 --> 08:18.800
also a pest and it's quite common.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.240
We also have that in Taiwan.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.400
In the whole paper, there's only six figures

08:28.280 --> 08:33.640
to show how does the embryo grow,

08:33.640 --> 08:38.640
but to me, it's not informative enough, right?

08:38.760 --> 08:42.080
Because I want to see like the start and the end.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.720
Based on the figure, people thought like,

08:46.720 --> 08:50.160
maybe the ants embryo development

08:50.160 --> 08:55.160
is similar to Drosophila based on figure D.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.720
Okay, why do people think like that way?

08:59.080 --> 09:03.760
So there are three types of the embryo,

09:03.760 --> 09:05.840
the insect embryos, okay?

09:05.840 --> 09:09.320
Based on the size of the germ band,

09:09.320 --> 09:12.480
we call it insect fate map, okay?

09:13.400 --> 09:17.960
Here represents three types of the embryo,

09:17.960 --> 09:21.120
long, intermediate and short, okay?

09:21.120 --> 09:23.560
The color part is the germ band,

09:23.560 --> 09:28.520
which will become a future embryo, a future larva, okay?

09:30.080 --> 09:31.720
For the long germ band species,

09:31.720 --> 09:35.440
you will have the head, thorax and abdomen part, okay?

09:35.440 --> 09:37.720
If you are not too familiar with insects,

09:37.720 --> 09:41.520
that's one, the three of the majority part of the body

09:42.680 --> 09:44.760
of insects, head, thorax and abdomen,

09:44.760 --> 09:48.360
well, and wings and legs.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.520
For the intermediate germ band species like beetles,

09:52.480 --> 09:54.960
at the beginning, once the egg being laid,

09:54.960 --> 09:57.520
you won't be able to see the abdomen part,

09:57.520 --> 10:01.960
you will see head part and part of the thorax, okay?

10:01.960 --> 10:06.120
So that's the short germ band species like crickets, okay?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.160
So I put a wasp here.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.280
For social insects, lots of scientists,

10:14.280 --> 10:16.400
they study honeybees and wasps,

10:16.400 --> 10:19.400
and they compare the Drosophila,

10:19.400 --> 10:22.640
one of the most famous model species

10:22.640 --> 10:24.800
that people study embryo development.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.240
They compare the wasp embryogenesis

10:28.240 --> 10:32.720
and the honeybee embryogenesis with Drosophila,

10:32.720 --> 10:36.400
and they figured out, oh, actually, they're pretty similar.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.600
Those social insects, the wasps and the honeybees,

10:41.600 --> 10:44.840
embryogenesis are pretty similar to Drosophila.

10:44.840 --> 10:49.200
So people didn't pay enough attention to ants

10:49.960 --> 10:54.960
and they just referred to, based on whatever they knew,

10:55.040 --> 10:57.880
and they thought, oh, maybe ants,

10:57.880 --> 11:01.840
it's similar to honeybees or wasps,

11:01.840 --> 11:04.960
because they belong to the same order, okay?

11:04.960 --> 11:08.480
And today, I'm going to show you that's not the truth.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.960
That's not the whole story.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.000
So four things I want to show you as the first,

11:15.440 --> 11:20.440
well, I will talk about the ant embryogenesis,

11:21.560 --> 11:24.720
but I will involve two different species,

11:24.720 --> 11:27.680
except the Adatexanthum.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.720
I will also include Microsaparus methi,

11:29.720 --> 11:31.480
and I will explain what is the high

11:31.480 --> 11:34.320
and lower agriculture mean later.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.680
That's the first part.

11:35.680 --> 11:40.120
And the second, I want to compare two types of eggs.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.840
One is laid by the foundress,

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
one is laid by the mature queen.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.840
Foundress means the new daughter queens

11:46.840 --> 11:50.960
just fly out from the nest and have the mating flight

11:50.960 --> 11:55.800
and start to build their own kingdom, their own colony, okay?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.760
The fresh queen, okay?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.440
Like the one you saw from the Pixar on the Bug's Life.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.520
That's the foundress.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.040
That's the virgin queen.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.320
And the third part, I'm going to use

12:06.320 --> 12:10.360
two genetic staining evidence to prove

12:10.360 --> 12:15.360
that the ant embryogenesis is not the same

12:16.880 --> 12:19.800
as honeybees or wasps.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.200
And the last part, that's kind of like a side project

12:25.200 --> 12:28.680
that I was lucky enough to figure out.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.880
We found out some new story about the trophic egg,

12:31.880 --> 12:33.960
and I will go deeper after.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.680
So here's the first part.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.800
The difference of embryogenesis

12:37.840 --> 12:40.600
between low and high agriculture ants.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.720
Here are the two species I include.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.120
The Ana texana, the leaf color ants,

12:46.120 --> 12:48.360
is the high level agriculture

12:48.360 --> 12:52.520
based on the phylogeny tree.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.440
And I will show you in the next slide.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.160
And M. smithii is the low agriculture ants, okay?

12:58.160 --> 13:00.320
And there are several features I want to point out

13:00.320 --> 13:02.920
to show how different these two ants

13:02.920 --> 13:04.440
are in different perspectives,

13:04.440 --> 13:09.360
like the ecology or even the reproductive system.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.120
First, Ana texana is sexual.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.520
They do have the male,

13:13.520 --> 13:17.840
but M. smithii, microcephalus smithii, they're asexual.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.920
People also call them pathogenesis.

13:20.920 --> 13:25.920
And the second feature is if you go to the fields,

13:26.160 --> 13:28.280
you will figure out there are different size

13:28.280 --> 13:30.160
of the workers of Ana texana.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.120
There are some small workers, there are some big workers,

13:33.120 --> 13:35.120
but for M. smithii,

13:35.120 --> 13:38.800
they are no difference between worker size, okay?

13:38.800 --> 13:40.640
They're almost identical.

13:40.640 --> 13:41.960
Well, they're clonal, right?

13:41.960 --> 13:42.840
They're asexual.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.480
And so that's the size.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.080
It's pretty similar.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.800
So what is the high and low agriculture mean?

13:48.800 --> 13:53.120
It's based on the position of the phylogeny tree, okay?

13:53.120 --> 13:56.760
Here is the low agriculture ants,

13:56.760 --> 13:58.560
the microcephalus smithii,

13:58.560 --> 14:02.600
and Ana texana is the high agriculture.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.680
In the fields, the low agriculture ants

14:05.680 --> 14:10.680
not only use some dead leaf parts

14:10.840 --> 14:14.360
or roses or branches to cultivate their fungus,

14:14.360 --> 14:16.760
but also they collect caterpillar poops

14:16.760 --> 14:18.640
to grow the fungus.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.800
And the Ana texana, they basically cut the leaves

14:22.800 --> 14:25.040
and bring the leaves back to the colony,

14:25.040 --> 14:29.400
use those leaves as a nutrient to cultivate the fungus,

14:29.400 --> 14:32.560
grow the fungus, and they eat the fungus.

14:33.520 --> 14:37.520
So overall, we call them Antennae ants, okay?

14:37.520 --> 14:41.240
Antennae ants means the ants will grow the fungus

14:42.160 --> 14:43.720
in no matter what perspectives,

14:43.720 --> 14:44.920
like in different ways,

14:44.920 --> 14:49.200
and they eat the fungus and they live in the fungus.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.120
So they are farmers, okay?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.520
So when we look at the life history

14:54.520 --> 14:57.200
for those two different Antennae ants,

14:57.200 --> 15:02.200
they're on the two sides of the phylogeny tree.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.000
We may think, oh, they're so different

15:05.000 --> 15:07.400
based on their behavior, based on their ecology,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.960
even their morphology, they look so different.

15:09.960 --> 15:14.480
But surprisingly, they spend their egg stage,

15:14.480 --> 15:15.800
it's almost identical.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.280
So what does that mean?

15:17.280 --> 15:19.600
That means they spend most of the,

15:19.600 --> 15:21.680
I mean, sorry, they spend,

15:22.840 --> 15:26.400
both of them spend about 20 days for hatching.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.080
And how about those details

15:30.080 --> 15:33.680
during the embryogenesis, the features, okay?

15:33.680 --> 15:36.000
So the next slide shows the complete,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.040
the first complete development table

15:38.040 --> 15:40.760
for the Adatexana, okay?

15:40.760 --> 15:43.800
From day one to day 15,

15:43.800 --> 15:46.600
the eggs were from the foundresses,

15:46.600 --> 15:49.200
from those nude or the queens, okay?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.800
So there are lots of information here,

15:51.800 --> 15:54.720
and I'm going to show you one by one,

15:54.720 --> 15:56.480
explain one by one.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.800
So the egg is about 300 micrometer,

16:00.560 --> 16:03.720
and day two, you will see lots of nuclei

16:03.720 --> 16:05.800
showed up on the surface of the egg.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.920
We call it blastodon, okay?

16:07.920 --> 16:11.280
Once you see that, the future embryo nuclei

16:11.280 --> 16:13.720
will start to gather to the posterior part

16:15.960 --> 16:20.240
of the egg and form a heart-shaped embryo, okay?

16:20.240 --> 16:23.480
So first stage will be blastodon,

16:23.480 --> 16:27.120
and the second stage will be the heart-shaped embryo.

16:27.960 --> 16:32.960
The third stage will be the elongation stage, okay?

16:33.040 --> 16:36.560
When the heart-shaped embryo, the germ band formed,

16:36.560 --> 16:40.040
the embryo will start to elongate

16:40.040 --> 16:44.320
and form gradually day by day when it gets older.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.280
So the elongation stage

16:47.360 --> 16:51.560
was from day four to day eight, okay?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.640
And insects, they're autopods.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.560
They have axoskeletons, right?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.760
And they have different segments.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.760
So segmentation is the final step

17:03.840 --> 17:06.960
that's when the embryo grows.

17:08.680 --> 17:13.080
So day nine, you can start to see those lobes forming,

17:13.080 --> 17:14.760
the segments forming,

17:14.760 --> 17:18.880
and till day 12, you can see,

17:18.880 --> 17:20.520
compared with day nine, day 12,

17:20.520 --> 17:23.480
there are more and more lobes adding up.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.240
Day five, it's almost like lava.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.160
And then the next day,

17:28.160 --> 17:31.400
or within the same day, it will hatch, okay?

17:31.400 --> 17:34.520
That's the overall concept of embryo development

17:34.520 --> 17:36.200
of adatexana.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.160
How about microcephalus methi?

17:39.360 --> 17:40.800
It's pretty similar.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.040
Sorry, the footage is,

17:42.040 --> 17:44.640
some of the images are kind of foggy.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.720
That was the image I took almost three years ago,

17:47.720 --> 17:51.800
and we are recollecting the data for M. smethi.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.400
But on day five, you can see the heart shape,

17:55.400 --> 17:58.080
the future embryo formed,

17:58.080 --> 18:00.080
and then the elongation happening,

18:00.080 --> 18:02.200
and then segmentation happening,

18:03.560 --> 18:08.560
just as same as what you saw from adatexana, okay?

18:09.600 --> 18:14.360
So if we look at those four stages of two ants,

18:14.360 --> 18:17.040
of these two Antennae ants,

18:17.040 --> 18:20.640
higher agriculture ants, adatexana,

18:20.640 --> 18:24.120
and lower agriculture ants, microcephalus methi,

18:24.120 --> 18:28.080
those really similar feature, okay?

18:28.080 --> 18:31.240
So the first part, the conclusion is,

18:31.240 --> 18:36.240
even on the ecology, ecological or behavior perspectives,

18:38.600 --> 18:40.200
they're so different,

18:40.200 --> 18:43.040
but when we look at their embryogenesis,

18:43.040 --> 18:44.760
they're actually quite similar.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.480
All right.

18:48.480 --> 18:53.480
The second part is the differences

18:53.480 --> 18:58.480
between the adafoundraces and the mature queen laid eggs.

18:58.480 --> 19:02.920
So why is it interesting to compare this two?

19:02.920 --> 19:06.840
For a long time, people who study ants found out

19:06.840 --> 19:10.640
that for those foundraces laid eggs,

19:10.640 --> 19:12.920
they will usually hatch faster.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.480
Oh, sorry, not hatch faster only.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.080
For those foundraces,

19:18.080 --> 19:21.440
usually they will have the first broods of workers

19:21.440 --> 19:24.520
earlier than the mature colony, okay?

19:25.760 --> 19:29.240
But for ants, there are different stages,

19:29.240 --> 19:32.360
egg stage, lava stage, lava stage,

19:32.360 --> 19:35.040
pupa stage, and then worker.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.120
We don't know which stage got speed up,

19:38.120 --> 19:42.840
or every stage got speed up evenly, okay?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.400
For a long time, we just know,

19:44.800 --> 19:46.600
for those new queens,

19:46.600 --> 19:49.720
they will have the first broods of workers faster

19:49.720 --> 19:52.400
than the regular queen,

19:52.400 --> 19:55.240
but we want to know more details.

19:55.240 --> 20:00.240
So since I have the expertise in studying ants' embryogenesis,

20:01.840 --> 20:03.040
the egg development,

20:05.440 --> 20:10.440
I examined the eggs laid by the foundraces the past summer,

20:11.440 --> 20:13.800
and we found out something interesting.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.720
So I hope you still have the concept

20:18.720 --> 20:20.880
for the whole developmental series

20:20.880 --> 20:22.840
in your mind of Antitech Center.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.960
If we compare the eggs laid by those foundraces

20:30.040 --> 20:34.480
and the eggs laid by the mature queens on the same day,

20:34.480 --> 20:39.480
we can actually see the segmentation happens

20:40.440 --> 20:44.680
faster in the foundrace-laid eggs, okay?

20:44.680 --> 20:46.000
This is on day nine.

20:48.840 --> 20:53.800
Three mouse part segments, the lobe formed,

20:53.800 --> 20:56.760
and the future thorax segments formed already

20:56.760 --> 20:58.880
on day nine of the adenue.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.560
Adenue means the foundrace-laid eggs, okay?

21:02.560 --> 21:07.480
But nothing happened except the future head lobe formed

21:07.480 --> 21:12.040
in the mature queen-laid eggs.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.120
How about day 12?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So if we compare day 12,

21:16.000 --> 21:20.640
we can see actually from the new adenue,

21:20.640 --> 21:23.760
the foundrace-laid eggs, sorry, the phrase is so long.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.800
The foundrace-laid eggs will form multiple segments

21:27.800 --> 21:32.800
at this stage, but not the mature queen-laid eggs, okay?

21:32.920 --> 21:36.200
But does that mean there's no gene expression

21:36.200 --> 21:38.200
involved in segmentation at this stage?

21:38.200 --> 21:39.840
No, that's wrong.

21:39.840 --> 21:44.840
So even there's no obvious morphological lobes formed

21:44.960 --> 21:49.960
from those mature queen-laid eggs embryos at this stage,

21:50.360 --> 21:52.640
there's some conserved genes.

21:52.640 --> 21:56.280
For example, windlass here already has the expression.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.600
And I will go deeper for those gene expression later.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.080
At this moment, I want to point out that

22:07.200 --> 22:12.200
we firstly saw that actually during the egg stage,

22:13.400 --> 22:17.720
the accelerations got speed up already, okay?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.000
How about the larval stage?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.160
How about the pupa stage?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.440
That we don't know yet,

22:22.440 --> 22:25.520
but they are different at the beginning, okay?

22:25.520 --> 22:30.240
That means those foundraces-laid eggs got speed up

22:31.880 --> 22:34.400
when the egg being laid.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.480
So those are the four stages,

22:36.480 --> 22:39.280
blastorym, heart shape, elongation, and segmentation,

22:39.280 --> 22:44.280
and then labeled at which date each stage happened, okay?

22:45.760 --> 22:49.760
And so why do we have to know that?

22:49.760 --> 22:52.800
Actually, that brought some interesting concept

22:52.800 --> 22:57.800
about maybe we should exam some aging genes

22:57.920 --> 23:02.480
involved in elongation or segmentation at this stage.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.160
We want to figure out what's the causation

23:06.160 --> 23:08.720
for that acceleration, for that speed up.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.520
It's quite interesting, and that will be our next step.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.360
All right.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.520
Okay, in the third part,

23:17.520 --> 23:22.520
I want to explain the germbane type of the ants, okay?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.560
Recall what we just discussed.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.960
The honeybees and the wasps,

23:31.960 --> 23:36.280
their germbane type is the same as Drosophila.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.280
It's pretty similar to Drosophila.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.400
Drosophila is a fruit fly, okay?

23:40.400 --> 23:42.240
They're a long germbane species.

23:42.240 --> 23:47.240
And I want to know whether ants has the similar germbane,

23:47.320 --> 23:50.080
or actually ants follow different development pattern.

23:52.040 --> 23:55.400
And when people study the germbane,

23:56.360 --> 23:58.720
we use conserved genes, okay?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.800
What does conserved genes means?

24:00.800 --> 24:05.800
So conserved genes means you can see the same genes

24:06.520 --> 24:11.520
showed up for similar purposes in different species.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.640
In the textbook example,

24:13.640 --> 24:15.960
people compare the hawk's genes

24:15.960 --> 24:20.240
by fly, Drosophila, and the mouse, okay?

24:20.240 --> 24:22.680
Both of those two very different species,

24:22.680 --> 24:24.440
they have hawk's genes.

24:24.440 --> 24:29.440
And they have similar principle in embryo development.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.520
Even the outcome is totally different.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.280
So the hawk's genes expression

24:38.280 --> 24:43.280
involved in segmentation formation in insects, in flies,

24:44.080 --> 24:46.920
but in mammals, in mouse,

24:46.920 --> 24:51.920
it involves in the backbones or somites formation,

24:52.200 --> 24:54.240
or somites formation.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.560
Like if you consider backbone,

24:56.560 --> 25:01.440
it's also kind of like segment-like concept, okay?

25:03.120 --> 25:06.880
So the take-home message for the conserved genes

25:06.880 --> 25:11.880
means, okay, no matter how different the species are,

25:12.520 --> 25:17.120
they share the similar genes involved in similar principle.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.680
And how do they utilize those conserved genes

25:22.440 --> 25:23.640
in studying the germ bin?

25:23.640 --> 25:27.120
So here is quite a little bit complicated.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.360
I hope that can recall your high school biology

25:32.360 --> 25:34.640
or college biology.

25:35.480 --> 25:40.480
First, I want to say is from DNA to RNA to protein,

25:41.880 --> 25:46.680
there are different procedures, not procedures, sorry.

25:46.680 --> 25:50.080
So DNA will be transcribed to RNA

25:50.120 --> 25:52.760
and then it will be translated to protein, okay?

25:52.760 --> 25:57.520
That's how it works in the world, right?

25:59.000 --> 26:03.400
For sometimes, not every DNA

26:03.400 --> 26:07.680
will successfully being translated to protein.

26:07.680 --> 26:12.680
Sometimes it will just end at the transcription step,

26:12.680 --> 26:15.240
like they will stop at mRNA

26:15.240 --> 26:18.440
and no more protein will be made, okay?

26:18.440 --> 26:21.640
And sometimes, yes, you will see DNA RNA

26:21.640 --> 26:24.680
and then find a product protein, okay?

26:24.680 --> 26:28.040
For those genes, for those conserved genes,

26:28.040 --> 26:30.680
which will stop at mRNA stage,

26:30.680 --> 26:33.480
we have to use in-situ hybridization.

26:35.320 --> 26:39.600
And for the genes will successfully

26:39.600 --> 26:41.960
being translated to protein,

26:41.960 --> 26:45.800
we use immunohybridization, all right?

26:45.800 --> 26:49.160
So let me explain it slowly.

26:49.160 --> 26:52.520
For in-situ hybridization,

26:52.520 --> 26:57.240
we have to make the RNA probe

26:57.240 --> 27:00.240
by using a DIC-labeled nucleotide.

27:01.160 --> 27:04.760
So DIC-label is just like a price tag, okay?

27:04.760 --> 27:07.280
Attached to those nucleotides.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.720
Nucleotides are the code for your sequence,

27:11.720 --> 27:14.400
for our DNA or RNA, okay?

27:14.760 --> 27:16.240
What are those codes?

27:16.240 --> 27:21.240
Those are ATCG and for DNA, AUCG for RNA.

27:22.720 --> 27:26.160
So we assemble those RNA probe

27:27.320 --> 27:30.360
with the DIC-labeled nucleotide.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.120
That's the first step.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.440
And the second step,

27:35.440 --> 27:40.440
we treat the sample with anti-DIC antibody.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.240
So that's another concept.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.840
Back to your high school or college biology.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.440
What is the antigen?

27:49.440 --> 27:51.160
What is the antibody?

27:51.160 --> 27:55.680
So during spring, there's lots of pollen, right?

27:55.680 --> 27:56.840
And you will sneeze

27:56.840 --> 27:59.240
and you will have some immunoreaction.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.760
The reason why you will sneeze

28:01.760 --> 28:05.600
is because those pollens you sniff in,

28:05.600 --> 28:07.760
those are the antigen.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.920
And your body, you have your immunosystem.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.840
Your body will recognize that out here

28:15.880 --> 28:19.240
as a bad thing and start to generate,

28:19.240 --> 28:21.280
start to make antibody.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.480
So when the next time you face the same antigen

28:24.480 --> 28:25.600
like the pollen,

28:26.640 --> 28:29.480
your body will have enough antibody

28:31.240 --> 28:32.880
to make that reaction

28:32.880 --> 28:35.760
so you can sneeze those bad things

28:35.760 --> 28:37.800
which are pollens out, right?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.560
The bad things that is bad to your body.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.920
So this is the same idea.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.800
The DIC-labeled, the DIC,

28:49.480 --> 28:54.480
is the site that the anti-DIC antibody can bind to.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.720
It's like making different layers of sandwiches.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.680
And we also have the alkaline phosphatase

29:04.440 --> 29:07.960
attached to that antibody.

29:07.960 --> 29:12.320
And then we use chemicals, MBT and BCIP,

29:12.320 --> 29:14.160
to make the color.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.360
Okay, that's the reason why we can see

29:17.200 --> 29:19.680
with this successful binding

29:19.680 --> 29:22.840
between the DIC-labeled conjugated probe,

29:22.840 --> 29:25.720
the RNA probe we made with the DIC,

29:25.720 --> 29:30.720
and the successful binding of the anti-DIC antibody

29:31.440 --> 29:33.120
attached to it,

29:35.080 --> 29:40.040
we can, and then the next layer is the MBT-BCIP.

29:40.040 --> 29:44.840
We can successfully see those colors, okay?

29:45.880 --> 29:48.200
I hope I explained it clearly.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.920
So three layers.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.040
The first is the MRA, okay?

29:54.040 --> 29:57.720
The MRA expression exists in the embryo at somewhere,

29:57.720 --> 29:59.360
but how do we see that, right?

29:59.360 --> 30:02.480
We need to see some color, right?

30:02.480 --> 30:04.680
So we know where does it happen.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.200
And how do we know?

30:06.200 --> 30:09.560
First, we make the probe, the MRA probe,

30:09.560 --> 30:11.400
to anneal with it,

30:11.400 --> 30:15.400
and then we treat them, the antibody,

30:15.400 --> 30:17.800
the antibody attached to a non-detect,

30:17.800 --> 30:22.040
and we use chemicals to trigger that colorization

30:22.040 --> 30:23.520
so we can see the color.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.680
When we see the color,

30:24.680 --> 30:28.720
we know where does the MRA got expressed.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.520
That's the big story in short.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.600
That's in-situ hybridization.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.800
Immunohybridization, same idea.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.720
We also treat them with different antibody.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.240
First layer is the antigen.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.640
You can consider as a protein.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.840
There are some binding sites on the protein

30:49.840 --> 30:54.600
that the antibody can recognize, okay?

30:54.600 --> 30:57.760
So two layers in this picture.

30:57.760 --> 31:02.760
The first antibody will bind to that protein, right?

31:02.920 --> 31:05.600
And then we treat the sample

31:05.600 --> 31:07.720
with a second layer antibody

31:07.720 --> 31:10.760
which attached to a fluorescent tag

31:10.760 --> 31:13.520
so we can see the color

31:13.520 --> 31:18.520
after the tag got excited by the laser, okay?

31:19.960 --> 31:21.560
Well, same idea, okay?

31:21.560 --> 31:24.040
I hope you don't get confused at this moment.

31:25.040 --> 31:29.040
So for in-situ hybridization,

31:29.040 --> 31:34.040
as for those expression stops at MRA, right?

31:34.200 --> 31:35.400
Because there's no protein.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.640
So no protein can be reproduced

31:38.640 --> 31:41.680
so there's no way you can use the immunohybridization

31:41.680 --> 31:43.600
to see the colorization.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
But for the immunohybridization,

31:45.600 --> 31:49.840
since you can easily make antibody attached to the protein,

31:50.840 --> 31:53.960
then we don't have to make the probe.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.400
Right.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.040
And what do I want to see?

31:58.040 --> 32:02.080
There are two conserved genes involved in segmentation

32:02.080 --> 32:07.080
that you can see it in even really different species.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.720
So this is the example

32:08.720 --> 32:11.200
for grasshopper embryo development.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.440
Witless is the first gene.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.000
Engrailed is the second gene.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
In each segment of the insect's embryo,

32:22.040 --> 32:24.600
witless MRA will be expressed

32:24.600 --> 32:27.480
at the anterior part of each segment.

32:27.480 --> 32:31.400
Engrailed protein will be translated

32:31.400 --> 32:36.080
at the posterior part of each segment.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.280
So in the real sample,

32:38.280 --> 32:41.480
you will see witless, engrailed, witless,

32:41.480 --> 32:43.040
engrailed, witless, engrailed,

32:43.040 --> 32:46.440
just like the cartoon that I showed you, okay?

32:46.440 --> 32:49.280
For the mouse part, for the thorax,

32:49.280 --> 32:52.000
for the abdominal segments.

32:53.360 --> 32:58.360
How about those expression in ants, okay?

32:58.440 --> 32:59.720
And why is it important

32:59.720 --> 33:02.120
to see those two genes involved in ants?

33:03.240 --> 33:05.920
For Drosophila, for fruit fly,

33:05.920 --> 33:08.000
those segmentation gene expression

33:08.000 --> 33:09.920
showed up in the same time.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.720
That's the typical feature for long-germband species.

33:14.720 --> 33:18.040
So people study honeybee embryo development,

33:18.040 --> 33:19.640
they see the same pattern,

33:19.640 --> 33:22.040
those bands showed up in the same time.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.120
Sometimes depends on the species.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.880
Sometimes it's like 14 stripes,

33:25.880 --> 33:27.560
sometimes like 16 stripes.

33:28.640 --> 33:32.680
Depends on whether it's a wasp or honeybees, okay?

33:32.680 --> 33:37.360
But if you see all the bands showed up in the same time,

33:37.360 --> 33:40.960
that's the typical feature for a long-germband species.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.240
But not for a short or intermediate germband species.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.560
That's the reason why I use those two genes

33:49.560 --> 33:53.760
to see whether ant embryo is similar

33:53.760 --> 33:57.640
to honeybees or not, right?

33:58.720 --> 34:03.720
So with the concept of the whole story

34:04.360 --> 34:09.360
of the ant development pattern, the embryogenesis,

34:09.880 --> 34:13.720
I can, we can easily figure it out

34:13.720 --> 34:18.720
when is the proper time for us to apply those probes,

34:19.480 --> 34:24.000
like the wingless or the engrossed antibody, right?

34:24.000 --> 34:28.080
We definitely don't want to apply those probes

34:29.560 --> 34:33.920
at a very early stage before any segments formed, right?

34:33.920 --> 34:37.440
Like the heart-shaped stage, no matter how hard we try,

34:37.440 --> 34:39.480
there's no way we can see the signal, right?

34:39.480 --> 34:43.440
We got to apply the probes or antibody at the right time.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.520
That's one of the important reason

34:47.520 --> 34:52.520
why we have to know the developmental table first.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.720
So with that idea, with that concept,

34:56.720 --> 35:00.800
we know between day nine to day 12,

35:00.800 --> 35:04.000
like when the segments starting to pop out,

35:04.000 --> 35:07.720
are the good timing for us to apply those conserved genes,

35:07.720 --> 35:12.720
probes or antibody, okay, to see the signal expression.

35:12.800 --> 35:17.000
So for wingless on day nine, as you can see,

35:17.000 --> 35:20.120
there's no obvious stripes formed yet,

35:20.120 --> 35:22.480
but started by day 10,

35:22.480 --> 35:25.120
you can see three stripes over here,

35:25.120 --> 35:27.480
the top row and this bottom row,

35:27.480 --> 35:28.640
there are the same data,

35:28.640 --> 35:31.200
but just use different way

35:31.200 --> 35:35.600
to show the bands to the audience, right?

35:35.600 --> 35:40.400
And when the embryo gets older,

35:40.400 --> 35:42.840
more stripes are adding up, okay?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.400
Those are the stripes number.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.720
Day nine, you got zero.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.600
Day 10, we see four.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.840
Between day 10 and day 11, we see 10.

35:52.840 --> 35:57.480
And until day 12, we got 12, okay?

35:57.480 --> 36:02.480
So that's the evidence to prove that those segments,

36:03.600 --> 36:05.640
those stripes are actually adding up.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.720
They didn't show up simultaneously.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.400
How about the engraved?

36:12.680 --> 36:15.320
Let me recall that wingless and engraved

36:15.320 --> 36:18.360
will be expressed at the same time.

36:19.480 --> 36:20.800
One is at the anterior,

36:21.720 --> 36:25.000
one is at the posterior of the segments, right?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.320
So we should be able to see the similar pattern

36:28.880 --> 36:31.480
when we examine the engraved gene expression,

36:31.480 --> 36:32.520
engraved protein.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.240
So the day 10 embryo,

36:37.240 --> 36:41.080
you can see there's only eight stripes, okay?

36:41.080 --> 36:43.000
But when the embryo gets older,

36:43.000 --> 36:45.480
the stripes number get adding up.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.280
So that's the second evidence to show,

36:48.280 --> 36:52.200
all right, actually embryogenesis

36:54.160 --> 36:55.880
follow different development pattern

36:55.880 --> 36:59.160
as other social insects, okay?

36:59.160 --> 37:04.160
So they're actually not long-term band species, okay?

37:04.560 --> 37:07.120
They're more similar to like tribolium,

37:07.120 --> 37:10.640
like the beetles or the crickets.

37:10.640 --> 37:14.160
That's a really interesting and surprising finding.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.120
How about other social insects

37:18.120 --> 37:22.720
that is not similar to honeybees or wasps?

37:22.720 --> 37:25.480
Yes, we do find the evidence.

37:26.320 --> 37:31.320
There's another wasp show a different,

37:31.680 --> 37:33.520
show the similar pattern,

37:33.520 --> 37:36.080
development pattern as the ants,

37:36.080 --> 37:39.720
which is either we can call it a short-term band

37:39.720 --> 37:43.040
or intermediate-term band development.

37:43.040 --> 37:46.680
So the green signals are the engraved protein,

37:46.680 --> 37:48.440
like the one you just showed.

37:48.440 --> 37:53.440
You can see when the embryo grow from A to H,

37:53.440 --> 37:56.200
you start to see the signal adding up.

37:56.200 --> 38:01.200
C, you only see one band, one, yeah.

38:01.360 --> 38:04.640
You see, well, this is the first band got formed.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.440
It's not the actual band yet.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.440
But D, you see like three stripes,

38:08.440 --> 38:10.560
and E, you got more stripes,

38:11.560 --> 38:13.880
and till H, like before,

38:13.880 --> 38:18.360
you see like 16 stripes, 14 to 16 stripes.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.440
Okay, and the red dots over here,

38:20.440 --> 38:24.000
those are another different gene called VASA.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.240
We're not going to explain too much.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.880
I'm not going to explain VASA today.

38:30.400 --> 38:35.200
So not just in ants, but also other social insects,

38:35.200 --> 38:40.040
different wasps show the short-term

38:40.040 --> 38:43.600
or intermediate-term band embryo development pattern.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.560
All right.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.480
So can we say that the ants

38:51.480 --> 38:56.360
has identical development pattern as crickets,

38:56.400 --> 39:00.080
because they're not the same as flies or honeybees?

39:00.080 --> 39:01.400
No, we can't say that.

39:02.280 --> 39:07.280
I used the embryogenesis figure from two papers.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.600
First, we know, okay,

39:09.600 --> 39:12.880
based on the adding up stripes feature,

39:12.880 --> 39:17.040
ants are not like flies or honeybees.

39:17.040 --> 39:22.040
But the embryo, the germ band formed completely.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.920
Imagine the germ band is the hot dog,

39:25.920 --> 39:29.400
and the yolk, the rest of the embryo is the bone, okay?

39:31.040 --> 39:34.520
The ant embryo formed the hot dog first,

39:34.520 --> 39:38.640
like completely, and then segments formed gradually.

39:38.640 --> 39:42.320
But in the short-term band species like crickets,

39:42.320 --> 39:44.880
you don't see the full hot dog first.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.920
You see part of the hot dog,

39:46.920 --> 39:49.680
and then more segments adding up.

39:49.880 --> 39:52.600
So when the embryo gets older,

39:52.600 --> 39:57.080
the hot dog, the germ band gets longer and longer, okay?

39:57.080 --> 40:02.080
In ants, you see the germ band formed completely,

40:02.400 --> 40:04.000
then segmentation.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.440
But in crickets, well,

40:06.440 --> 40:11.440
you don't see that four complete developed germ band.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.480
You see the segments and the germ band elongation,

40:16.480 --> 40:18.960
like it happens in the short-term band.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.880
Germ band, sorry.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.400
You see the segmentation adding up

40:24.400 --> 40:28.520
and the germ band elongation in the same time, okay?

40:28.520 --> 40:31.600
So we think at this moment,

40:31.600 --> 40:35.280
based on our DAPI standing morphological data

40:35.280 --> 40:36.960
of the development table,

40:36.960 --> 40:39.960
and the two conserved gene expression data,

40:42.200 --> 40:46.960
the ants' embryogenesis is more like a mixture

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
of long-term band and short-term band, okay?

40:54.080 --> 40:57.280
And the next part will be the trophic egg.

41:00.480 --> 41:04.120
So trophic egg means the nutrient, okay?

41:04.120 --> 41:05.920
And for a long time,

41:05.920 --> 41:09.000
for those entomologists who study ants,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.720
trophic eggs are considered

41:12.720 --> 41:16.240
as one of the nutrients to those babies, okay?

41:17.640 --> 41:21.120
Here's the picture I took that the workers,

41:21.120 --> 41:25.800
the worker of Adatexana guards those eggs,

41:25.800 --> 41:29.600
her future sisters in the fungus garden.

41:31.280 --> 41:35.120
Usually the workers will chop off the trophic eggs

41:35.120 --> 41:40.120
and feed those larvae when the fungus start to grow,

41:42.200 --> 41:46.600
I mean, in the founding colony, right?

41:46.640 --> 41:48.720
In the founding colony,

41:48.720 --> 41:52.040
the queen only has small piece of fungus,

41:52.040 --> 41:54.800
so there's limited food resource.

41:54.800 --> 41:58.120
Therefore, the queen has to lay some trophic eggs

41:58.120 --> 42:01.360
and use those nutrients, the workers,

42:01.360 --> 42:04.480
either the workers will use the trophic eggs

42:04.480 --> 42:06.160
to feed those babies,

42:06.160 --> 42:09.560
or before the first broods of workers come out,

42:10.760 --> 42:12.880
the queen will chop off those trophic eggs

42:12.880 --> 42:15.480
and feeds them as a nutrient,

42:15.520 --> 42:19.880
feeds to the first broods of baby as a nutrient, okay?

42:19.880 --> 42:23.080
And the life history trade for a fungus growing ant

42:23.080 --> 42:24.680
is the queen lay eggs,

42:24.680 --> 42:29.400
and also she brought a small patch of the fungus

42:29.400 --> 42:31.480
from the mother colony

42:31.480 --> 42:35.080
and use her feces, poops,

42:35.080 --> 42:36.760
to cultivate the fungus.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.760
Meanwhile, take care of those broods

42:39.760 --> 42:43.360
and make them, help them to grow up successfully,

42:43.360 --> 42:46.120
and those workers, once she has those workers,

42:46.120 --> 42:48.840
enough workers, those workers will take care of her

42:48.840 --> 42:52.920
and also start to make the fungus garden be bigger,

42:52.920 --> 42:54.640
like this, right?

42:54.640 --> 42:57.000
And one interesting thing that I discovered,

42:57.000 --> 43:00.520
like luckily, a few months ago,

43:00.520 --> 43:05.040
is we found a new type of trophic eggs, right?

43:07.880 --> 43:10.080
So when I first look at that,

43:10.120 --> 43:13.000
I just thought, why the eggs,

43:15.040 --> 43:17.200
the morphology of the eggs is so different,

43:17.200 --> 43:18.120
they're so bizarre,

43:18.120 --> 43:20.880
it looks like two eggs attached to each other.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.520
And then I did multiple different sampling.

43:24.520 --> 43:28.400
I figured out, actually, here are the fertilized eggs,

43:29.400 --> 43:30.640
like here,

43:30.640 --> 43:34.000
and those two are the huge, massive trophic eggs

43:34.000 --> 43:36.840
that anneal to each other,

43:36.840 --> 43:39.760
and even deform, okay?

43:40.440 --> 43:43.080
So I sampled, like I got more samples

43:43.080 --> 43:44.600
from those funguses,

43:46.280 --> 43:51.280
and we can clearly see that those funguses,

43:51.320 --> 43:55.040
they do lay trophic eggs,

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
like those massive trophic eggs

43:57.040 --> 44:01.440
and the fertilized eggs in the same time, okay?

44:01.440 --> 44:06.120
This is not the same you can see from the mature garden.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.320
For the mature garden,

44:08.320 --> 44:12.120
that we have, like four or five years old garden,

44:12.120 --> 44:15.840
those queens only lay fertilized eggs.

44:15.840 --> 44:20.840
So only during the foundries,

44:20.920 --> 44:22.920
only during the foundry level,

44:23.800 --> 44:26.600
like when they start to establish the fungus garden,

44:27.720 --> 44:29.360
you can see those trophic eggs.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.600
And here is their cartoon figure

44:32.600 --> 44:36.320
to show three types of eggs.

44:37.320 --> 44:39.840
The first one is the fertilized eggs,

44:39.840 --> 44:42.480
like regular egg, the 2N egg,

44:42.480 --> 44:46.000
and the second is, we call it trophic A,

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
and the third is the trophic B.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.240
Here's the actual figure for fertilized trophic A

44:52.240 --> 44:54.600
and trophic B, okay?

44:57.960 --> 45:00.360
And I'll have more footage to show you

45:01.680 --> 45:04.120
how do I distinguish whether that egg

45:04.200 --> 45:07.280
is a trophic A or trophic B.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.440
So let's focus on trophic B first.

45:11.480 --> 45:15.480
One interesting feature for trophic B is

45:15.480 --> 45:17.840
the egg is just like a water balloon.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.760
It's so massive.

45:19.760 --> 45:23.680
And when you place it on their solid place,

45:23.680 --> 45:27.840
solid surface, it will deform, okay?

45:29.120 --> 45:33.440
And if you place it on the fungus garden,

45:33.760 --> 45:38.360
after 24 hours, it will be liquefied or deliquent.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.520
Okay, what does that mean?

45:39.520 --> 45:41.200
Why is it important to see,

45:41.200 --> 45:44.840
like, why is it interesting?

45:44.840 --> 45:48.040
So trophic eggs, for a long time,

45:48.040 --> 45:50.520
people just think, people think,

45:50.520 --> 45:54.360
or observe that either the new queen

45:54.360 --> 45:59.360
or the new workers will use them to feed the babies.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.120
But this is the first evidence,

46:02.120 --> 46:05.440
first discovery to see that actually

46:05.440 --> 46:09.720
trophic B egg can also be one of the nutrients

46:09.720 --> 46:12.080
for the fungus garden, okay?

46:13.400 --> 46:16.640
The fungus garden started with a small patch,

46:16.640 --> 46:18.240
like a really small piece,

46:18.240 --> 46:23.240
when the new queen fly out from their mother colony.

46:24.080 --> 46:26.600
And the fungus garden ants,

46:26.600 --> 46:29.240
the fungus garden ants, the leaf collar ants,

46:29.240 --> 46:31.960
they cannot live without fungus.

46:32.800 --> 46:35.760
No matter how many workers they got,

46:35.760 --> 46:37.240
once they lost the fungus,

46:37.240 --> 46:40.040
the whole colony will just die, okay?

46:40.040 --> 46:43.560
So it's really important to make sure

46:43.560 --> 46:45.720
that small patch of the fungus

46:45.720 --> 46:48.840
the queen brought out from the mother colony

46:48.840 --> 46:52.600
can successfully be cultivated

46:52.600 --> 46:56.000
during the first or second month, right?

46:58.080 --> 47:01.400
Okay, so we hypothesize that

47:01.480 --> 47:05.360
the trophic B, the egg laid by the queen

47:06.360 --> 47:08.920
has the evolutionary benefits

47:08.920 --> 47:13.120
to make sure the fungus garden

47:13.120 --> 47:17.440
can obtain, receive enough nutrient.

47:19.960 --> 47:23.560
This is another replication that we did the collection,

47:23.560 --> 47:25.800
and you can see after two hours,

47:25.800 --> 47:27.720
in the first footage,

47:27.720 --> 47:30.520
you see three trophic B eggs.

47:30.520 --> 47:32.440
After 24 hours,

47:33.760 --> 47:36.320
we clearly see that the trophic eggs

47:36.320 --> 47:39.360
got deliquid, liquefied, okay?

47:40.240 --> 47:43.840
So would the egg be liquefied

47:45.640 --> 47:47.880
by the fungus only,

47:47.880 --> 47:51.280
or it will be liquefied just by itself?

47:51.280 --> 47:52.760
I mean, without the fungus,

47:52.760 --> 47:55.880
we're really interesting to know that.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.320
The next step we did

47:57.320 --> 47:59.600
is we put the trophic B egg

47:59.600 --> 48:00.880
on the compost slab

48:00.880 --> 48:05.440
in the close to 100% humidity environment.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.840
In the petri dish they've created,

48:08.840 --> 48:10.800
after 24 hours,

48:10.800 --> 48:15.480
the egg will be deliquid by itself, okay?

48:15.480 --> 48:17.600
So it proves that

48:18.560 --> 48:21.880
this is a really nice

48:22.760 --> 48:24.960
co-evolutionary evidence

48:24.960 --> 48:27.680
to help the fungus,

48:27.680 --> 48:29.400
to help the queen,

48:29.400 --> 48:32.080
like on both parties, right?

48:32.080 --> 48:34.040
So the queen needs the fungus,

48:34.040 --> 48:36.360
and she will lay those trophic eggs

48:36.360 --> 48:40.480
to help her to maintain the fungus,

48:40.480 --> 48:42.880
to grow the fungus to be better, okay?

48:42.880 --> 48:47.320
And the egg itself will deliquid,

48:47.320 --> 48:50.680
so it will provide the nutrient

48:50.680 --> 48:53.280
or the water to that small fungus

48:53.280 --> 48:58.280
and help them to grow well at the beginning, right?

49:04.080 --> 49:07.880
We have more image to show the difference

49:07.880 --> 49:09.560
between the fertilized eggs,

49:09.560 --> 49:10.720
trophic A egg,

49:10.720 --> 49:12.320
and trophic B egg.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.720
For the fertilized eggs,

49:15.040 --> 49:19.560
usually the eggs will be guarded by the worker,

49:19.560 --> 49:23.560
and after 20 days,

49:23.560 --> 49:25.680
depends on the temperature,

49:25.680 --> 49:27.240
or 15 days,

49:27.240 --> 49:30.400
it will hatch to larvae,

49:30.400 --> 49:33.240
and will grow up to worker.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.960
And those fungus,

49:35.960 --> 49:39.480
the mycelium cannot intrude to those eggs,

49:39.480 --> 49:41.720
cannot harm those eggs, okay?

49:43.520 --> 49:44.680
On bigger B,

49:44.680 --> 49:46.320
you can see the mycelium grow

49:46.320 --> 49:47.680
on the surface of the egg,

49:47.720 --> 49:50.440
but the egg's still pretty good,

49:50.440 --> 49:51.800
in a good status.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.040
And bigger C,

49:54.640 --> 49:57.200
you can see the egg's still really,

49:58.680 --> 50:00.520
it's not damaged.

50:00.520 --> 50:03.600
But how about the other two trophic eggs,

50:03.600 --> 50:06.800
the trophic A and trophic B, okay?

50:06.800 --> 50:08.440
For the trophic A egg,

50:10.160 --> 50:12.360
the mycelium will start to absorb

50:12.360 --> 50:14.240
the nutrient from inside,

50:14.240 --> 50:15.760
and cause the dent,

50:15.760 --> 50:17.480
and eventually it just sucked up

50:17.480 --> 50:19.280
all the nutrient by days,

50:19.280 --> 50:21.400
like after 13 days.

50:23.080 --> 50:24.400
And the trophic B egg,

50:24.400 --> 50:27.240
it will deliquest by itself, okay?

50:27.240 --> 50:30.200
Just like the way I explained to you,

50:30.200 --> 50:33.600
and why it is important

50:35.160 --> 50:39.320
to help to cultivate the fungus garden.

50:43.280 --> 50:44.120
Okay.

50:44.120 --> 50:48.920
So besides the image evidence,

50:48.920 --> 50:51.240
I also fixed the trophic A egg

50:51.240 --> 50:52.440
to prove that

50:56.360 --> 50:58.160
we have two types of trophic egg.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.160
So for the fertilized egg,

51:01.160 --> 51:02.000
day five,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.960
you can see the embryo start to grow,

51:03.960 --> 51:05.920
like during the elongation.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.360
This is the future head lobe,

51:08.360 --> 51:10.240
here's the future body.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.920
But the trophic A egg,

51:11.920 --> 51:14.080
there's only a single nuclei,

51:14.880 --> 51:15.800
and nothing happens,

51:15.800 --> 51:19.400
and eventually the fungus garden

51:19.400 --> 51:21.280
will absorb the nutrient.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.000
Okay.

51:28.320 --> 51:31.760
The last part of my talk will be,

51:31.760 --> 51:34.880
let's go back to those males, okay?

51:36.120 --> 51:38.920
So I briefly explained

51:38.920 --> 51:41.640
how does the embryo grow in ants,

51:41.640 --> 51:44.080
and the differences between lower

51:44.080 --> 51:46.440
and higher level agriculture ants,

51:46.440 --> 51:48.680
and no matter how different they are,

51:48.680 --> 51:51.600
they show the similar development pattern

51:51.600 --> 51:53.200
of their embryos.

51:53.200 --> 51:58.000
And also, we found out a new type of trophic eggs

51:58.000 --> 52:00.040
that people never discovered before,

52:00.040 --> 52:02.920
and we had the hypothesis that

52:02.920 --> 52:07.160
trophic eggs can also be the nutrient resource

52:07.160 --> 52:08.120
for the fungus garden,

52:08.120 --> 52:10.760
not just for the babies, the larvae.

52:11.960 --> 52:15.360
And one interesting we found out is,

52:15.360 --> 52:16.880
do you remember that I mentioned

52:16.880 --> 52:20.000
the haploid diploid of the insects?

52:20.000 --> 52:23.200
Some haploid eggs laid by the foundresses

52:23.200 --> 52:27.040
will become a male, okay?

52:27.040 --> 52:29.200
But usually that won't happen

52:29.200 --> 52:31.720
when the foundresses started

52:31.720 --> 52:34.240
to establish the colony, right?

52:34.240 --> 52:37.200
Because only female workers are useful

52:37.200 --> 52:40.120
that can help her to maintain everything.

52:40.160 --> 52:44.480
The male individual is totally useless

52:44.480 --> 52:45.840
at that stage.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.040
They do nothing.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.320
They basically just waste the energy,

52:50.560 --> 52:54.320
and also they are not helpful, okay?

52:55.200 --> 52:56.880
Ideally, that won't happen,

52:56.880 --> 53:01.880
but we did find a weird nanotech male

53:02.600 --> 53:06.800
from those founding colony, okay?

53:06.800 --> 53:09.120
And those males are really small.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.200
We call it nanotech.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.440
Nanotech means like lack of nutrient

53:12.440 --> 53:15.840
and body size is really small.

53:18.800 --> 53:23.280
We found out that they have weird,

53:23.280 --> 53:27.720
like fairy wings.

53:27.720 --> 53:30.480
The wings are not well-developed,

53:30.480 --> 53:33.960
and they were just crawling around

53:33.960 --> 53:35.840
in the fungus garden.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.840
Once the pupa occlusion happened,

53:41.400 --> 53:43.440
like became an adult,

53:43.440 --> 53:47.760
the queen will kill that within 48 hours, okay?

53:49.120 --> 53:50.360
Oops, yeah.

53:50.360 --> 53:52.440
So here's the complete vision

53:52.440 --> 53:56.600
for the nanotech male of Eta texana.

53:57.680 --> 54:00.080
The morphology is totally different

54:00.080 --> 54:03.040
as the regular female workers.

54:04.040 --> 54:07.600
We don't know the queen can recognize

54:07.600 --> 54:10.920
the weird nanotech male by vision

54:10.920 --> 54:13.360
or by the smell.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.120
More studies we have to do,

54:16.200 --> 54:19.120
but at least one thing we can assure is

54:19.120 --> 54:20.080
during this stage,

54:20.080 --> 54:23.640
the egg, the larvae, or the pupa stage,

54:23.640 --> 54:25.840
here's the nanotech, future nanotech male.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.560
Before pupa stage,

54:29.560 --> 54:32.360
the queen will still take care of them

54:32.960 --> 54:37.880
as the way the queen takes care of the workers.

54:37.880 --> 54:42.440
But once they become the weird,

54:42.440 --> 54:44.320
crawling around male,

54:45.320 --> 54:46.280
they'll be killed,

54:46.280 --> 54:49.800
like literally ripped off by the queen.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.960
So that's also a new finding

54:53.960 --> 54:55.880
that we're excited to publish

54:55.880 --> 54:57.320
on Insect Social

54:59.160 --> 55:01.920
of the behavior

55:03.120 --> 55:05.400
so the queen knows

55:05.400 --> 55:08.800
those are not actual helpful workers

55:08.800 --> 55:11.640
and they will just kill them.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.280
But the stories behind them

55:13.280 --> 55:16.560
is like how does she receive the signal,

55:16.560 --> 55:18.120
how does she know by vision

55:18.120 --> 55:20.000
or by other smell cues

55:20.000 --> 55:24.840
are really interesting to do more research.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.320
All right.

55:26.320 --> 55:28.040
I hope you guys don't fall asleep.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.280
It's a long talk.

55:29.320 --> 55:30.960
And overall,

55:32.680 --> 55:34.520
I finished the four parts.

55:34.520 --> 55:36.880
And thanks for your listening.

55:36.880 --> 55:40.960
And please ask me if you have any question.

55:42.480 --> 55:43.320
Thank you.

55:45.600 --> 55:46.960
Okay.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.560
Thanks for Andy's talk.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.320
Let's give him a applause first.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.320
Thank you.

55:56.680 --> 55:57.680
Don't look at me.

56:01.000 --> 56:01.520
All right.

56:01.520 --> 56:04.560
So if you have any questions,

56:04.560 --> 56:07.360
please just go ahead and ask Andy.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.560
How many people we have?

56:14.720 --> 56:16.880
Now we have six, including you.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.040
Okay.

56:18.040 --> 56:21.280
Sorry, the talk was like too long.

56:21.280 --> 56:22.960
I was starving.

56:23.080 --> 56:24.080
No, I think you're fine.

56:24.080 --> 56:28.200
But your talk is pretty kind of professional.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.840
And even I don't understand,

56:31.840 --> 56:36.840
I would say half of the sites

56:37.280 --> 56:42.240
because I don't study embryo genesis.

56:42.240 --> 56:44.920
Anyway, the development of embryos, right?

56:44.920 --> 56:45.760
Yeah.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.600
But actually I do have one question.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.520
Why do we care about?

56:53.520 --> 56:56.160
So that question,

56:56.160 --> 56:57.120
so first let me ask,

56:57.120 --> 56:58.640
what is the germ band though?

57:00.080 --> 57:03.760
Oh, so the germ band means the embryo.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.720
The embryo itself.

57:06.720 --> 57:07.560
Okay.

57:07.560 --> 57:12.160
So the embryo has the yolk and the future larva.

57:12.160 --> 57:15.920
And the germ band is just like the hotdog.

57:15.920 --> 57:18.040
And the yolk is like the bond.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.320
The overall, the two things,

57:20.320 --> 57:23.320
we call it an egg, right?

57:25.320 --> 57:26.160
Yeah.

57:26.160 --> 57:31.160
So the future larva grow from the germ band.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.280
Okay, start with the small heart

57:33.280 --> 57:35.280
and then start to grow bigger and bigger

57:35.280 --> 57:38.360
and then segments and then form the future larva.

57:38.360 --> 57:39.400
That's the germ band.

57:40.360 --> 57:42.480
And why do we need to care the difference

57:42.480 --> 57:44.680
between long and short germ bands?

57:44.680 --> 57:46.760
We actually don't have to care about that.

57:48.040 --> 57:51.560
So, no, that's not true.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.000
So that doesn't matter.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.200
That actually doesn't matter.

57:54.200 --> 57:56.720
Like, okay, yeah, it's long or short.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.760
But the reason why I want to study this

57:58.760 --> 58:02.560
is because the very first few slides

58:02.560 --> 58:04.720
I mentioned cast determination.

58:04.720 --> 58:07.040
So actually at the beginning,

58:07.040 --> 58:09.400
I really want to know what are the genes

58:09.400 --> 58:12.240
involved in cast determination in ants

58:12.240 --> 58:15.400
if that actually happens during early stage.

58:16.400 --> 58:21.400
But without knowing the complete development table,

58:21.400 --> 58:25.280
I can barely can do anything, right?

58:25.280 --> 58:27.360
I don't have the tool.

58:27.360 --> 58:29.640
For example, for like flies,

58:29.640 --> 58:31.320
people know how the embryo grows.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.600
So I can see different gene expression

58:33.600 --> 58:34.920
at different stage.

58:34.920 --> 58:39.000
With that knowledge, I can do some prediction, right?

58:39.320 --> 58:46.720
So if Ahab's theory is not saying it's wrong.

58:46.720 --> 58:49.400
I mean, if his theory is correct,

58:49.400 --> 58:53.160
we should be able to see some gene expression

58:53.160 --> 58:55.520
during the early embryo development.

58:58.040 --> 59:00.520
But how do I apply those probes?

59:00.520 --> 59:01.880
How do I apply those genes

59:01.880 --> 59:04.240
without knowing the development table?

59:04.240 --> 59:07.680
We can do nothing, right?

59:07.680 --> 59:13.320
So I got to study like how does the embryo grow first.

59:13.320 --> 59:15.440
And surprisingly, we figured out,

59:15.440 --> 59:19.560
oh, okay, so actually they have different pattern

59:19.560 --> 59:22.040
like other social insects.

59:22.040 --> 59:24.440
So we divide them into different categories.

59:24.440 --> 59:27.240
So my finding just like to point out,

59:27.240 --> 59:32.840
oh, ants, they are more like grasshoppers,

59:32.840 --> 59:38.960
like crickets, not like honeybees or wasps.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.520
Okay, so that's just a step

59:40.520 --> 59:43.320
before you can move on to your further research.

59:43.320 --> 59:45.440
Exactly, that's the foundation.

59:45.440 --> 59:46.480
Yes, yes.

59:46.480 --> 59:50.720
But if you ask like why does long or short matter?

59:50.720 --> 59:51.680
No, that doesn't matter.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.240
It's just like a prescription, right?

59:54.240 --> 59:56.520
Okay, okay, okay.

59:56.520 --> 59:58.400
Got it.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.720
All right, are there any other questions?

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.320
Hi, I have two questions.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.600
So I'm Jason.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.000
I'm from, I'm Jason Hong.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.680
I'm like a physics postdoc.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.360
So, you know, I have no prior knowledge about the ant

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.320
and like I have no limited knowledge about biology.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.080
So I have like one pretty simple question.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.400
So you mentioned that for male ant,

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.360
it only has like one set of chromosome

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.200
and for female, there are two, right?

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.360
So like what determines that?

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.480
So for human, we know that it's,

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.520
so you have two kind of sperm.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.560
So one is with X and one is Y.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.280
And like that determines the sex of your like birth.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.920
So like what determines that in the ant colony?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:04.600
Right, so the egg has a single set of chromosome.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.960
And if the egg got fertilized,

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.960
the sperm will bring another set of chromosome

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.560
into that egg, right?

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.080
So if the egg got fertilized,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.880
it will be a two ant individual.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.880
Like it has two sets of chromosome.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.120
If the egg didn't get fertilized,

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.960
it will be a male supposedly from a mature colony.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.000
Okay, I see.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.120
Yeah.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:38.360
So even not fertilized egg can be hatched in ant egg?

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.000
Theoretically, yes.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.760
But there's some, like you don't see that,

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.680
you don't see male ants come out from the founding colony.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.240
Founding colony means the colony just started to grow.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.800
You only see the male ants come out from the mature colony.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.960
Yeah, so that's also a topic like people want to study

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.480
the reason why.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.200
Okay, so we don't know why yet?

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:07.840
We don't know.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.040
We don't know why yet.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.560
Okay, so I have another question.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.640
So you mentioned that for the foundress ant

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.840
and the mature queen egg,

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.120
they have a different hatch time.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.000
Right.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.520
Right, so also like I guess you show the data,

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.600
but I don't remember you explain why that is the case.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.680
And is there any method we can understand why?

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:42.600
So is it due to chemicals or due to some biological processes?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:46.920
Okay, so we don't know the real key factors

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.480
involved in that acceleration.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.000
And for now, we guess it's because of methylation.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.760
So, all right, let's put it in the easy way.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.200
So when, think about you're the new mom

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.480
and you have to start your colony

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.160
and there's so many birds or frogs trying to eat you

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.320
and you got to face those pressures in the field

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.240
and start like also having babies

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.080
and start to build your nest.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.080
So you want to do that ASAP, right?

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.160
You want to do that as soon as possible.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.240
Yeah, and that's the reason why we think that makes sense

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.040
that those foundresses broods will grow faster.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:32.960
Okay.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.080
Right, but what's the mechanism behind this?

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.680
What's the reason for causing that speeding up process?

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.880
We don't know.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.960
Okay.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.360
Oh, I also...

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.400
Oh, sorry.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.960
Oh, maybe it's okay.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.200
So I also heard that in humans,

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.360
it's actually like the first birth song,

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.600
you will have a higher probability for like early birth.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.160
Is that the...

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.320
I mean, that might be like a very far away,

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.040
but is that something also similar?

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.600
Oh, I have no idea.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.800
Really?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.480
I actually don't know.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.520
Okay, yeah.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.920
So I guess you can check.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.600
I don't know what it is.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.120
It's a legend.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120
It's a rumor kind of thing.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.800
Okay, okay, cool.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.120
I will check it.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.760
Wait, doesn't it mean the first born

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.680
will be larger than the others?

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.720
It will be faster.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.160
The pregnancy period is shorter.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.160
Oh.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.720
In what animal?

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.840
It's more like the rate for early birth is higher.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920
Interesting.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.040
Yeah, I would check it.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.040
Okay.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.040
I haven't heard about that as well.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.240
I'm not very sure.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.320
So you should double check.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.200
But that's interesting.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200
All right.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.200
So are there any other questions

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.200
or other concerns or suggestions for Andy?

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200
All right, if not,

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200
I'm going to stop recording this talk.
