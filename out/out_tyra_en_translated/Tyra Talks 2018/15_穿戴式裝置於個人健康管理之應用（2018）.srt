00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am the host for this week, Lin Yu-Wei.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am very happy to invite our speaker today, Zhou Zhijie.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at NTU,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and is currently a doctor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Lincoln.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Under the guidance of Professor Dai Yu-Chang,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
he has been conducting research on wearable devices and biomimics for medical purposes.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Zhijie and his speech today.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now let's give the microphone to our speaker today, Zhijie.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, for the introduction.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello, everyone. I am Zhou Zhijie.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Without further ado, let's get to the topic.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
First of all, I would like to introduce to you

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
why wearable devices have become a hot topic in recent years.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Basically, it can be divided into several aspects.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The first is the concept of non-invasive.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The concept of non-invasive means that the device does not need to enter our body.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You may have been to the hospital for injections or blood draws.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Once something enters your body, the first reaction is pain.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In addition to the pain, the immune system will also react to foreign bodies.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For example, some white blood cells or other immune cells will attack foreign objects.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Basically, it will cause a lot of inflammation, swelling, pain, and heat.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Therefore, wearable devices basically avoid such risks.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Many technology giants like Apple and Fitbit

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
want to study non-invasive devices first

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and see where their limits can be pushed.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then they will consider the so-called minimally invasive devices.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In fact, there is a huge barrier between non-invasive and minimally invasive.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Whether it is from the perspective of devices or from the perspective of government agencies like the FDA,

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the biggest barrier is still entering the body.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Once you enter the body, there is a lot of risk.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Stay outside the body is a very low-risk device.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Basically, wearable devices have become so popular recently.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Next is the so-called big clinical data.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I believe everyone has heard of big clinical data.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The meaning of big clinical data is that this device can provide some diagnostic information.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This diagnosis is also a bit tricky.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How can we determine the value of the diagnosis?

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What metrics are really useful?

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The third part is the so-called Autonomous Sensing.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Autonomous Sensing is not as complicated as you think.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just put the wearable device on your body and it will automatically start to measure.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then you don't need to intervene.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then it can continuously send this data out in a wireless way.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The advantage is that even if you are not conscious, for example, when you are sleeping,

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
this device can still continue to measure and send the data out.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it can let us see some things that we couldn't see before.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For example, when you are sleeping, it can help you measure the cycle of sleep,

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or the heartbeat when you are resting, and so on.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The fourth aspect is that it is very easy to compare with portable devices,

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
such as mobile phones, smartphones, or even tablets.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Basically, these portable devices can be used as a relay station.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can imagine that your wearable sensor is a bit like a place to send signals.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then store these signals in the portable device.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Basically, the computing power of these portable devices is relatively strong,

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and the bandwidth to upload data is relatively high.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
On the one hand, it can be used as a relay station, and on the other hand,

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
it can be used as a place to send signals.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There are a lot of benefits that you can think about.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Next, I will talk about the logic of why we want to use wearable devices

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to monitor the health of our body.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is a study in Stanford,

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
which is called digital health.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It is a comparison of regular visits to the hospital

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and digital health.

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The so-called digital health is actually

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
collecting all the data that should be collected at the hospital,

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
digitizing it,

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and then processing these digitized data.

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This study is actually very simple.

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There are only two main variables.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
One is to measure the skin temperature,

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and the other is to measure the heart rate.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If I put the sensor on the patient

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
for a long time,

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the patient will inevitably get sick.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
when the patient is sick

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
are basically the same.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
are basically the same.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
are basically the same.

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
are basically the same.

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
are basically the same.

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
are basically the same.

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
are basically the same.

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
are basically the same.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
are basically the same.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
are basically the same.

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The wearable sensor has some information in it.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How do we get this information out?

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How do we get this information out?

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How do we get this information out?

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We have big clinical data.

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When do we get this data?

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can get some useful information

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
such as your body temperature, heart rate, etc.

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

115
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Can we tell if a person is healthy or sick?

117
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We can tell from the data from the sensors.

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
For example, a disease has a certain distribution in the data space of the sensor.

119
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So this is a very interesting question.

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So this is a very interesting question.

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Before this disease appeared, our data space was completely blank.

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Before this disease appeared, our data space was completely blank.

123
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But there are actually some privileges in this sleep stage.

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But there are actually some privileges in this sleep stage.

125
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
For example, when we sleep, our body does not move.

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
For example, when we sleep, our body does not move.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Because there is a lack of noise in our daily life.

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
For example, motion noise.

129
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Or when we do other things during the day, our heartbeat suddenly changes.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But when we sleep, it doesn't change.

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
At present, some wearable sensors are already measuring heartbeats during rest and sleep.

132
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
At present, some wearable sensors are already measuring heartbeats during rest and sleep.

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I will show you some data later.

134
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Location.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The main thing is to see where our sensors can be placed in the body.

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The main thing is to see where our sensors can be placed in the body.

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Research related to motion impedance.

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Research related to motion impedance.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Research related to motion impedance.

140
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
First look at this picture.

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can see that its range is a bit different.

142
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You can see that the place where wearable devices are often placed, such as a bowl, is actually a good place to put it.

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Because it doesn't have too many...

144
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is a matrix.

145
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It tells us what sensor is most suitable for measuring when placed in a certain place.

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
For example, the red block is used to measure whole body motion.

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Basically, it is used to measure the movement of the whole body.

148
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You can imagine that your limbs, hands and feet are often moving.

149
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But if you want to track the center of the whole body, the red block will be more accurate.

150
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And so on.

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
For example, the extension of the joint stretch, of course, depends on the elbow and knee joint.

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So...

153
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The last one is the place where the sensor is really placed.

154
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is interesting. You can compare it with the two pictures just now.

155
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
For example, many devices are placed at the wrist or ankle.

156
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Next, I will discuss the future prospects of wearable devices.

157
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Basically, it is like this.

158
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:15,000
From the era of personal computers, the market trend is to try to make the size of the computer smaller and smaller.

159
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
From personal computers to knee-shaped devices and wearable devices.

160
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The so-called computing unit is the center of the data, which is closer to the body.

161
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The advantage of doing this is that you don't need too much delay from your sensor to get the data.

162
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can do the operation directly.

163
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This is the size of the entire market of wearable devices.

164
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is the size of the entire market of wearable devices.

165
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The size of the entire market of wearable devices is the largest at the beginning.

166
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
However, as soon as Apple Watch appeared, it appeared around the middle of 2015.

167
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
As soon as it appeared, it immediately ate up the market share.

168
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Then, until recently, 2016 to 2017, you can see that the largest has become Apple Watch.

169
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Then, on the contrary, Feizui started to decline from the highest point.

170
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is a very interesting phenomenon, and you can think about why.

171
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The last is my own imagination.

172
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
From the beginning of the 2000s, the so-called smartphones began to appear.

173
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
By 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.

174
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It has PPG, which is a method of optical heart rate detection.

175
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Motion is basically an accelerometer.

176
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It can see the motion of your entire body.

177
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
ECG is a heart rate map.

178
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Blood pressure.

179
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Basically, these are some of the information that is easier to get.

180
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
However, its application is actually limited.

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In the next ten years, there may be some new wearable devices.

182
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
For example, FUET, which measures biomarkers in sweat.

183
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
LP is ocular pressure.

184
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
CGM is Continuous Glucose Monitoring.

185
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Basically, these devices may need to use minimally invasive sensors.

186
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
However, it still has great advantages.

187
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Because it basically gives us some information that the previous wearable sensors cannot provide.

188
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course, it is more difficult for the government to get FDA approval.

189
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because it is a relatively high-risk device for patients.

190
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:39,000
My prediction is that after 2030, it depends on how the market reacts.

191
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Because there is the first and second generation of wearable devices.

192
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If the market reacts well, there may be new minimally invasive devices.

193
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Then let the market continue to grow.

194
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Or like personal computers or smartphones, it will start to saturate.

195
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So you can wait and see what the future of wearable devices will look like.

196
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Next, let's move on to the next topic.

197
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will introduce the wearable sensors on the market now.

198
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
First, let's talk about Fitbit.

199
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Fitbit is the first company to launch a smartwatch.

200
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
At first, it only gives you some heart rate information.

201
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Heart rate information is based on optical detection.

202
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The principle is simple.

203
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It uses a green light LED to illuminate the threshold under the skin.

204
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
When your blood flow changes, it will affect the intensity of the reflected green light.

205
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
When the green light shines fast enough, for example, this is a 25Hz frequency.

206
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The heart rate is about 1 to 2Hz.

207
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The 25Hz light can be modulated by the heart rate.

208
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You can get heart rate information by processing digital signals.

209
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is the first generation of Fitbit.

210
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Recently, they have added some new features.

211
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
They are interested in sleep tracking.

212
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The reason is simple.

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
First, it is easy to measure.

214
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Because you don't move much when you sleep.

215
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So there is little noise.

216
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You can see the picture on the right.

217
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Fitbit uses EEG to divide the sleep cycle into 3 to 4 types.

218
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The most famous is REM.

219
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Rapid Eye Movement.

220
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is the sleep cycle when you are dreaming.

221
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There are other types, such as pre-sleep and deep sleep.

222
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It can show you the percentage of each sleep cycle.

223
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Although it is a sleep cycle, it does not use EEG.

224
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It only uses heart rate and acceleration to measure data.

225
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You can see that the cycle is fast.

226
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Some people complain that there are some false signals.

227
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's take a look at the EEG.

228
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:41,000
EEG measures the electric field on the head and nose.

229
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Different sleep cycles have different brain waves.

230
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 correspond to the sleep cycle of JELLO and DEEP.

231
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Fitbit does not measure EEG.

232
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It only uses heart rate and acceleration to measure data.

233
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This is the sleep cycle of JELLO and DEEP.

234
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Let's take a look at Apple Watch.

235
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Apple Watch is a little later than Fitbit.

236
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The reason is that it has a lot of functions that are not related to clinical information.

237
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Apple likes to make things fancy, so it adds a lot of external functions.

238
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
In the latest series 4, Apple tried to add ECG.

239
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You can see that there is an optical heart rate sensor on the back.

240
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This part is the same as Fitbit.

241
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But there are two more electrodes.

242
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
One is the crystal electrode on the back.

243
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The other one is the electrode above the circle.

244
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:54,000
When you want to measure ECG, you have to touch the dial with your right finger.

245
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This way, you can form a circuit to measure your ECG.

246
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But this ECG only has one channel.

247
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You can think about it. It measures the electrical field from the left to the right of your heart.

248
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But this also requires FDA clearance.

249
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Because it claims to be a device that can assist with medical care.

250
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Any device that claims to have this needs FDA approval.

251
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Once you have this ECG, you can do some irregular rhythm notification.

252
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It can see if there are any abnormal frequencies in your ECG waveform.

253
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The so-called abnormal frequency is a signal like a heart beat or atrial fibrillation.

254
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Once the ECG is detected, it will give you an alarm.

255
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The so-called class 2 is not the simplest medical device for FDA.

256
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But it's not as invasive as class 3.

257
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
This device can't be used for diagnosis.

258
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
This is a point that FDA emphasizes.

259
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The last feature is the accelerometer.

260
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:59,000
When you fall, it will tell you if you need to call an ambulance.

261
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is a very fancy feature.

262
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The next product I want to introduce is Omron.

263
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You may think of it as a blood pressure monitor.

264
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Or a stopwatch.

265
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
What I'm going to talk about today is a blood pressure monitor.

266
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The traditional blood pressure monitor has a cuff.

267
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You have to tie it to your arm.

268
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Then it will start to add pressure.

269
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Then it will measure your heart rate.

270
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
When you can't hear your heart rate, it's a cuff.

271
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
When you can hear your heart rate again, it's a cuff.

272
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Where is this intervention?

273
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You can see the watch on the right.

274
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's actually made very small.

275
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You can wear it on your wrist.

276
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If you press a button, it will stop the process.

277
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But it's made on the wrist.

278
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The advantage is that you can wear it all day.

279
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
The advantage is that you can wear it on your wrist.

280
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
When you want to measure your heart rate, you can press it at any time.

281
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But you still need to operate it manually.

282
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Ideally, this device will measure your heart rate every fixed time.

283
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Even when you sleep.

284
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
This is what I think is ideal.

285
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So there are still some improvements.

286
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And it's still under development.

287
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So it hasn't been released yet.

288
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Because it still needs FDA clearance.

289
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Next is the Freestyle company.

290
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
This is actually a British company.

291
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:29,000
In the United States, I know Metronic and Dexcom are doing blood sugar testing.

292
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Why do we need to measure blood sugar?

293
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
In fact, this device is not for ordinary people.

294
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It's actually for diabetes patients.

295
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Why do I want to let diabetes patients measure their blood sugar?

296
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The reason is that their body can't produce insulin.

297
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So they have to inject insulin into their body to control their blood sugar.

298
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If their blood sugar is too low, it will be life-threatening.

299
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So they want to keep monitoring their blood sugar level.

300
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And keep it within the normal range.

301
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This device is already very small.

302
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Because the needle is only 0.4 mm.

303
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It can be regarded as a wearable device.

304
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,000
After the needle is inserted into the skin, it can stay on it for about 14 days.

305
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Just two weeks.

306
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Then you don't have to take it off.

307
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's basically like a patch.

308
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's a bit like a sticker.

309
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You just stick it on your body.

310
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
If you scan the sensor, it will send the glucose reading to your scanner.

311
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Then the scanner can pair with your phone.

312
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It will send the glucose reading to your phone.

313
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The advantage of this device is that if you want to measure blood sugar, you need to poke a hole in your finger.

314
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then squeeze the blood out.

315
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You can imagine that the process is very painful.

316
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Basically, you just need to poke a hole with this device.

317
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You only need to poke it once every two weeks.

318
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And the advantage of this device is that you don't have to poke it yourself.

319
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
This device continues to measure blood sugar.

320
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So basically, it can measure blood sugar even when you sleep.

321
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
OK.

322
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The last one is a company called Emotiv.

323
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's actually doing EEG.

324
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You can see this in the upper right corner.

325
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's a bit like a headgear.

326
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
There are actually more than ten electrodes on it.

327
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This is basically a device that is not really used for medical diagnosis.

328
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's more like a device that monitors your brain waves.

329
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:43,000
In addition to measuring EEG, it can also measure...

330
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
For example, if you say a command in your head, it will translate it for you.

331
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This is actually pretty cool.

332
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It can also detect facial expression changes on your face.

333
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
This device has a EEG system with Clinical.

334
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You can see that this is basically very consistent.

335
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Clinical's EEG is actually very expensive.

336
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's about 60k.

337
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
They developed Emotiv themselves.

338
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's only a few hundred dollars.

339
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
OK.

340
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Let me give you a brief introduction to how EEG came about.

341
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Everyone knows that the brain has various cortex.

342
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
This EEG...

343
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You can see these...

344
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Have you ever heard of alpha or beta?

345
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
All kinds of brain waves come from the cortex.

346
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's just that it's not the same as the nervous system.

347
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The reason is that this is not the real action potential.

348
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
It's actually a change in hyperpolarization and depolarization.

349
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This cycle is actually very long.

350
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You can see that there's a scale at the bottom.

351
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
This is one second.

352
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The action potential is usually only a few dozen milliseconds.

353
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So this is not the action potential.

354
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
This is actually a change in hyperpolarization.

355
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
After this is produced in the cell,

356
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
it actually has a local field potential.

357
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
It's measured near the cell to the junction point.

358
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Then this junction point goes all the way through the medium between the cells.

359
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Then it's passed on to the cortex.

360
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Then it's passed on to the cortex.

361
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Then it's passed on to the cortex.

362
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So you can see that the cortex is actually just a depolarization of the nerve.

363
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Of course, the EEG hasn't been declared to be able to measure while sleeping.

364
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So I don't know what happens if it really wears this device when it's sleeping.

365
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think it should be quite interesting.

366
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Okay, let's move on to the third part.

367
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The third part is mainly some relatively new technologies.

368
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
There are mainly...

369
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
The first one is continuous blood pressure monitoring.

370
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
As I just said, it still needs you to measure it yourself.

371
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So its measurement speed can't be that fast.

372
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Continuous blood pressure is a new device.

373
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It uses the ultrasound to track the blood pressure in the blood vessel.

374
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
This is the normal distribution range of blood pressure in general.

375
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This is the basic structure of the device.

376
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The main signal source is the piezoelectric material.

377
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's sealed in epoxy.

378
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Then some electrodes are applied to the surface.

379
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
At the same time, the piezoelectric material is actually in two directions.

380
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
One is when you give it electricity, it will generate a current.

381
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The other is when you have a current, it will generate a signal of electricity.

382
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So it's actually in both directions.

383
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The principle is that you give a pulse at the beginning.

384
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So the piezoelectric material will generate a pulse.

385
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Then it presses the blood vessel.

386
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So it will see how the blood vessel is changing with the blood pressure.

387
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
According to the time-of-flight, it can reverse the environment of the blood vessel.

388
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then this signal can be reversed into blood pressure.

389
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The two positions are in the pulmonary artery.

390
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So it's just a little patch on top of it.

391
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There are some sensor arrays in this patch.

392
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Maybe there are a few sensor arrays on top of the blood vessel.

393
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It can measure the blood pressure.

394
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The next one is actually quite interesting.

395
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
This is actually a device that can measure sweat.

396
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So why are we interested in sweat?

397
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The reason is that a lot of metabolism will come out with sweat.

398
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Such as glucose and lactate.

399
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They all show up in the sweat.

400
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And their concentration is quite similar to the concentration in the blood.

401
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So sweat can be thought of as a substitute for blood.

402
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Then you don't really need to put a needle into your blood vessel.

403
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So it has the advantage of non-invasive.

404
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Then it can measure the concentration of electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium.

405
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm curious about the time difference between glucose and lactate in sweat and in blood.

406
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I would say about ten minutes.

407
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They actually did a similar research.

408
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Look at the concentration of glucose in your blood.

409
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Then you will see that if there is a spike in the blood, there will be a delay in the spike in the sweat.

410
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That delay is usually about ten minutes.

411
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So it's a delay, but the timing resolution is higher.

412
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So even if it's a very short spike, you can still see it.

413
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's just a delay, right?

414
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
If it's a very short spike, it's not very certain.

415
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Because the spike I'm talking about is usually like a step.

416
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
For example, after you eat, your blood sugar will suddenly rise and then slowly fall.

417
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So it's actually not a really short spike.

418
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's actually a step up and then slowly decay.

419
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
This device is actually made like a wristband.

420
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Its principle is basically to detect your target with a variety of different coating electrodes.

421
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Like glucose and lactate, it uses enzymes to detect.

422
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:48,000
It basically puts the enzyme on the permeable film.

423
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Then let it react with the target.

424
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
After the target is reacted, the enzyme dissolves the target and releases the electron.

425
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Then the electron is picked up as a voltage signal.

426
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The other part is the concentration of sodium and potassium.

427
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It uses ion-selective electrodes.

428
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It uses a variety of coatings on the surface.

429
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
This improves the professionalism of the ion.

430
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So there won't be any interference problems.

431
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's the same as converting it into an electrode.

432
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Finally, it's sent to a wireless ECB and sends the signal to the mobile phone.

433
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is what it actually measured when it was running.

434
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You can see that there are five different data.

435
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The temperature on the skin, lactate, sodium, potassium, and potassium.

436
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It also has a collaboration with the device.

437
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This collaboration is very good.

438
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because it matches the commercial device.

439
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The only bad thing about this device is that it needs to let this person sweat.

440
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Basically, you can see that there is a period of time after the exercise.

441
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Then he started to sweat to get this reading.

442
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The last one is the pressure in the eye.

443
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It's actually measured...

444
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's different for each eye.

445
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Jump to the structure of the eye.

446
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
This is the structure of the human eye.

447
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Basically, the pressure we're talking about is the small part in front of the eye.

448
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's called aqueous humor.

449
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
In Chinese, it's called aqueous liquid.

450
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Basically, it's the space between your mucous membrane and the crystal.

451
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
There's actually a little bit of aqueous liquid in it.

452
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's only a few microliters.

453
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
In fact, these microliters determine the balance of pressure in your eyes.

454
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Because the vitreous body in the back is a glass body.

455
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Basically, the volume won't change.

456
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So if the pressure in the front increases, it will start to compress the mucous membrane and blood vessels in the back.

457
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's why it's called this disease.

458
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
This disease is called glaucoma.

459
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
OK.

460
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So we want to monitor this 24-hour eye pressure change.

461
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Can you imagine the same thing?

462
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's actually hard to sleep.

463
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And there's an interesting phenomenon.

464
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
In fact, when you sleep, your eye pressure is the highest.

465
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So, in fact, ophthalmologists are very interested in eye pressure changes when they sleep.

466
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So we started to think about whether or not we could put a wearable device on your eyes and measure the eye pressure change.

467
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Someone suggested that you could actually use this wearable glasses as your platform to measure eye pressure changes.

468
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
This is actually a new company's idea.

469
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It actually uses existing wearable glasses materials.

470
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Then they added a strain gauge to measure the change in the curvature of the mucous membrane.

471
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
They claim that this can be connected to intraocular pressure.

472
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
In fact, FDA has also approved this device.

473
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It can actually be placed on the glasses and continue to measure 24 hours.

474
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
OK.

475
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Then the main target is still these patients with light eyes or patients who are about to get light eyes.

476
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
As you can see, the structure of this device is very simple.

477
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
There is a coil.

478
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It is actually used to receive power and send information back to the microcontroller.

479
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
There is also a small microcontroller here.

480
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But its function is just to help modulate the signal and measure the strain gauge itself.

481
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
As you can see, this device does not have a battery.

482
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It actually needs a larger coil outside the glasses to provide this power.

483
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
This power is also a receiver coil.

484
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It can digitize the signal and send it to the recorder.

485
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I personally don't really appreciate this.

486
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Because it feels a little strange.

487
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You can actually make it like a blindfold device.

488
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You don't have to make it so complicated.

489
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And this wire is not very convenient when you sleep.

490
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Then back to Glocoma.

491
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
This is what I just talked about.

492
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
When you sleep, the eye pressure is actually higher.

493
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The black one in the middle is actually the eye pressure when you sleep.

494
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Generally, the standard eye pressure for Glocoma is 21 mmHg.

495
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's about this line.

496
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
21 is here.

497
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The upper line is actually the real Glocoma patient's eye pressure.

498
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The bottom line is normal.

499
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:18,000
In fact, there is a big difference between standing up and squatting.

500
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Because when you stand up, there is a pressure difference caused by the height.

501
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It even has something to do with standing or lying down.

502
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So when you lie down, your posture changes.

503
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Basically, the eye pressure will be a little higher.

504
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Compare with when you stand up.

505
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They maintain the same posture.

506
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
If you stand up, it will be colder during the day.

507
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
The last new technology is the battery technology.

508
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I just talked about so many wearable devices.

509
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
If they put batteries in, they will basically use lithium-ion batteries.

510
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The reason is that its energy density is the highest.

511
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Of course, this is also why smartphones and laptops use lithium-ion batteries.

512
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You can see this picture.

513
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This is the current structure of the mainstream lithium-ion battery.

514
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It has two levels, one level and a separator in the middle.

515
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
What's the bad thing about this?

516
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It's very fragile.

517
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The reason is that when the lithium-ion battery is charged, it will heat up easily.

518
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Once it reaches a certain temperature, it will start to affect the electrolyte inside.

519
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
After the electrolyte breaks down, it releases gas.

520
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The gas is more serious because it causes internal pressure to increase.

521
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:29,000
After the internal pressure increases, the structure of the separator is destroyed.

522
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Once the structure is damaged, the battery is like a short-circuit.

523
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
A short-circuit is a positive feedback.

524
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It will cause more heat to be released.

525
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
The whole thing will break down.

526
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:56,000
If you insert a nail into the lithium-ion battery, it will start to ignite and explode.

527
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We don't want this scenario to happen to wearable devices.

528
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
It's basically wearing on your body.

529
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:16,000
If there is a problem with the battery, it will be a big problem.

530
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Recently, someone proposed a new design.

531
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It uses the same structure as the solar panel.

532
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
The structure is on the right.

533
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It uses a 3D structure.

534
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Basically, the structure of the battery is changed to a solid-state silicon.

535
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So there is no weak and easy-to-puncture problem.

536
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The traditional lithium-ion battery has a very fragile structure.

537
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It's easy to break through.

538
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But if you change it to a solid-state substrate, it's not easy to be affected by external forces.

539
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:21,000
On the other hand, you can use the photolithography method to pattern the structure of the two-stage and one-stage.

540
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
It can increase the density a lot.

541
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
On the one hand, it is safer.

542
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
On the other hand, the density of its unit has also been increased.

543
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
In the future, it is very likely to see this new lithium-ion battery being used on wearable devices.

544
00:53:41,000 --> 00:54:04,000
In the last part, we will discuss the problems that wearable devices may encounter in addition to this technology.

545
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
The first one is privacy.

546
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:18,000
When a sensor starts to collect very personal data,

547
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and there is a lot of data,

548
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
there will be a question mark.

549
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
What kind of people can access this data?

550
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What kind of people can't access it?

551
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You may have heard of Google Glass before.

552
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:56,000
The reason why it was scared was because it was collecting data.

553
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
If the camera is not approved by other people,

554
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
it will randomly shoot everywhere.

555
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It violates other people's privacy.

556
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The same goes for wearable devices.

557
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It collects personal data all the time.

558
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
If it is not approved,

559
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
for example, you wear a wearable device today,

560
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and the watch is lost.

561
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Can other people easily access your data?

562
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
This is a privacy issue.

563
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:45,000
The following table is a survey on wearable devices.

564
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:57,000
On the left, you can see how people react to wearable devices.

565
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Most people are very happy.

566
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
There is a new toy to play with.

567
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
But when it comes to trust,

568
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
people start to have questions.

569
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
The most trusted people are doctors, hospitals,

570
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
or health insurance.

571
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
These people are more trustworthy.

572
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The following categories are cell phone providers,

573
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
entertainment providers, etc.

574
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
People's trust suddenly dropped.

575
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
This is also a trend.

576
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
If you want to collect data,

577
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:47,000
it is recommended to start from hospitals or doctors' offices.

578
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Traditionally, people are more confident in health care providers.

579
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
They know they won't use these data.

580
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
The second discussion is about business.

581
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
This is an interesting issue.

582
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Everyone sees that wearable devices have a good market.

583
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:29,000
But it is difficult to enter this market.

584
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The reason is that it requires a lot of investment.

585
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
First, if you want to use wearable devices for diagnosis,

586
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
you need to get FDA approval.

587
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Basically, whether it is class 2 or class 3,

588
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
you need to invest in research and development,

589
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
or even apply for a patent.

590
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Then you can get FDA approval.

591
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:11,000
But consumers care a lot about the price of wearable devices.

592
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You can see the following.

593
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Whether it is fitness band, smart glasses, smart watch, or smart clothing.

594
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
The first thing everyone cares about is the price.

595
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The second is that you may not use it.

596
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Then there are others.

597
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The first is that the cost of investment is high,

598
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
but you can't lower the price.

599
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
The last one is the difficulties that wearable devices may face.

600
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
There are five points.

601
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:12,000
The first is that consumers don't know why they need to use wearable devices.

602
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
What can wearable devices do?

603
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
As mentioned earlier,

604
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
for example, sleep tracking.

605
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Even if I know that my sleep is divided into these weeks,

606
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
what are the possible applications?

607
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
For example, can it assist me in diagnosing what diseases I may have?

608
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Or when I go to see a doctor,

609
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
can it give the doctor some judgment criteria?

610
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The second is that wearable devices are easy to lose.

611
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
This is the same problem as mobile phones or other portable devices.

612
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And it's quite troublesome to lose it.

613
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Currently, wearable devices do not have ID settings.

614
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Basically, it's wearable.

615
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It won't be linked to your account.

616
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The third is that

617
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
is it attractive or comfortable to wear?

618
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This is a question worth thinking about.

619
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:51,000
When we don't know what function this device can do,

620
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
there is no reason to want to wear it.

621
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
For example,

622
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
if you don't wear glasses,

623
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
you may not want to wear glasses.

624
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Wearing glasses only provides you with some minimal benefits.

625
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The fourth is battery life.

626
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Currently, most wearable devices only last 7 to 10 days.

627
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Some people may complain that they can't last longer.

628
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
The fifth is about syncing.

629
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Can it pair well with your smartphone?

630
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
This is a technical problem.

631
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's easy to solve.

632
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:02,000
But if you want to design a new wearable device,

633
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
you need to read.

634
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
This is the last video.

635
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
If you have any questions or experiences with wearable devices,

636
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
please feel free to ask.

637
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
If you have any questions,

638
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
please feel free to ask.

639
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Thank you.

640
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Thank you, Zijie.

641
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

642
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Please turn on your microphones.

643
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Let's open the Q&A session.

644
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Do you have any questions?

645
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I have a question.

646
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Can you hear me?

647
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yes, I can hear you.

648
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Let's say 10 or 15 years later,

649
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
everyone wears a certain wearable device.

650
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Your data will be uploaded to a data center for 24 hours.

651
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
The manager of the data center is basically a group of MDs.

652
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
They can see the data and know where the person's body may have problems.

653
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
In other words, this system can replace the current GP.

654
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
After the initial diagnosis,

655
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
the GP may be suffering from a skin disease.

656
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The GP will be transferred to the relevant department.

657
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
In other words, this whole system will become the first line of defense of the medical system.

658
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Imagine this society.

659
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
If this society really exists,

660
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
what do you think is the technical problem?

661
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I can imagine other problems in society or politics.

662
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
But what do you think is the technical problem?

663
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Now there is a fundamental question.

664
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
How far can this wearable device go?

665
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
If you don't want an invasive action,

666
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
it's actually very limited.

667
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So I think the first technical problem is

668
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
how to measure all the data you need in a minimally invasive situation.

669
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Then your data can distinguish between different diseases.

670
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I think this is the first problem.

671
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And it's a must-solve problem.

672
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
If you want to get into the ideal scenario,

673
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
you have to be able to do it.

674
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Hello, I have a question.

675
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Can you hear me?

676
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yes.

677
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Hello, I would like to ask.

678
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
You just said that there are some minimally invasive devices.

679
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I do cancer research.

680
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I know that some of the current scientific cancer fields

681
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
are already targeting some cancer prevention methods.

682
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:31,000
For example, there are some so-called tumor DNA in the blood of cancer patients.

683
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I wonder if this technology has been applied

684
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
or is already being developed on this wearable device.

685
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
How will it develop in the future?

686
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
OK, thank you, William.

687
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Basically, yes.

688
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Someone is already doing this.

689
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I didn't mention it just now.

690
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
In fact, many people are doing so-called lab-on-a-chip.

691
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Basically, using a single chip,

692
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,000
you can do what a whole lab can do.

693
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
For tumor cells, yes.

694
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But because it needs to use a protocol.

695
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Basically, it's still a protocol.

696
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Because it basically looks at the circulating tumor cells.

697
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So it needs to first design a filter

698
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
to filter out these tumor cells.

699
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
After filtering out,

700
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
it will look at which tumor cells belong to which cancer.

701
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
For example, doing DNA sequencing and so on.

702
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
If you want to turn it into a wearable device,

703
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
you still have to solve the invasive problem first.

704
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Because if you want to take a blood sample,

705
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
the trouble with blood is that it is easy to coagulate.

706
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Coagulation occurs.

707
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So how do you get it from your bloodstream

708
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
to the cancer cell?

709
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
At the same time, it doesn't coagulate.

710
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
This is actually a problem that needs to be solved.

711
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
But if you can get this blood sample,

712
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
it's technically feasible.

713
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So now in this wearable device,

714
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
there is no way to make this breakthrough, right?

715
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
If you don't want human intervention,

716
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't think it's there yet.

717
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But if you can do it like a blood sugar machine,

718
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
you poke a hole and squeeze the blood out,

719
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and then drop it on the lab arm chip,

720
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
it can actually be done.

721
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So the difference is whether it can be automated.

722
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
So the difficulty now is that

723
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
the coagulation situation you just mentioned,

724
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
that is, in a long-term surveillance,

725
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
instead of a single-point,

726
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
time-point time to detect.

727
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That's it.

728
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Thank you.

729
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Hi.

730
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm from the Taiwan University Student Association.

731
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

732
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I'm the president of this year.

733
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I'm also from the Electrical Engineering Institute.

734
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
But I'm studying electrical waves now.

735
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And then in this regard,

736
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
maybe it's related to you.

737
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Maybe it's like Energy Harvesting.

738
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And then I'm doing the topic now.

739
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It's UCLA.

740
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
They're developing how to make the antenna satellite.

741
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It's possible to do the level of micrometer.

742
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It should also be related to wearable.

743
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But I'm pretty curious.

744
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Like in the topic you're studying,

745
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
now it's more of an application.

746
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
What are the more common

747
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
or specific hardware bottlenecks?

748
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
For example, the most common is of course the battery.

749
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Or is there anything that is still difficult to overcome?

750
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Or is it just that you need to find a better application?

751
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Thank you.

752
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
OK, thank you for your question.

753
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yes, you just mentioned the battery.

754
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's already a big concern.

755
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
In terms of hardware.

756
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The reason is because, think about it.

757
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:20,000
If you want to put a battery inside the body,

758
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
the size has a big limit.

759
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Because the bigger the size,

760
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
the stronger the immune response.

761
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Of course, we want to make the battery smaller and better.

762
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Even without the battery.

763
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Just use the wireless power transfer to provide energy.

764
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So the battery is a concern.

765
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
In fact, everyone has been thinking about

766
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
how to give the power to the device.

767
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Either by inductive coupling.

768
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Or even using ultrasound.

769
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
In fact, I have been doing this kind of wireless power transfer project before.

770
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Then I studied how to use ultrasound to provide this energy.

771
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So everyone is also brainstorming

772
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
how to make this power better.

773
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Because you don't want the battery to get into the body.

774
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
There is also a biocompatibility.

775
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So basically all the batteries you need to use in the implant.

776
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Like your pacemaker battery.

777
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
It also needs special design.

778
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
It must be placed in a good enclosure.

779
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It must ensure that the electrolyte will not leak out.

780
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And it won't short-circuit.

781
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Because FDA has a lot of concerns about this.

782
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Then you just talked about hardware.

783
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
There is another question.

784
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Because you are doing antenna related.

785
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So I would like to talk about communication.

786
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,000
How to get the signal out with the minimum energy per bit.

787
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
This is also a problem.

788
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Because your body.

789
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
For example, if you use gigahertz.

790
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It actually has a lot of energy damping.

791
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It is actually wasted in your interstitial space.

792
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Because your tissue is also for power supply.

793
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And in the gigahertz range.

794
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Whether it's water or ion.

795
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It actually absorbs a lot of energy.

796
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So if you want to use wireless.

797
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
If you send this data out.

798
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It will waste a lot of energy.

799
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So how to use this.

800
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Maybe you want to find a frequency band.

801
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Optimize your energy.

802
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
This is also a research question.

803
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Then, of course, other things.

804
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Like this sensor design.

805
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Because now we can use the sensor on the left.

806
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
In fact, it is also limited.

807
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Then how to improve this sensor design.

808
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Then make it energy efficient.

809
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Or this.

810
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The smaller the bone factor.

811
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So basically.

812
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Let this patient.

813
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
When you put these devices in your body.

814
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You almost don't feel pain.

815
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
This is also a direction.

816
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So yeah.

817
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
These three aspects are actually Howard.

818
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Especially in our lab that does this kind of device.

819
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
In fact, I have been working hard.

820
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Hello, I have a more naive question.

821
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
But you just talked about the battery.

822
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Then I thought at the beginning.

823
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Hey, since the battery has its limitation.

824
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Then why don't you use something like solar cells?

825
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
In this way.

826
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
To work hard in this direction.

827
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
You talk about solar cells.

828
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Does it mean that you harvest energy from the environment?

829
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Correct.

830
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
OK.

831
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yes.

832
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Someone is also doing this direction.

833
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
But basically.

834
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
The current problem.

835
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Because everyone.

836
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
May say.

837
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
If you want to harvest energy from the environment.

838
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Where is your source?

839
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The first one is probably.

840
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Temperature.

841
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
But your body temperature is only 37 degrees.

842
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So with you.

843
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
The room temperature is 25 degrees.

844
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
There is only a dozen degrees difference in the middle.

845
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So this temperature may not be enough.

846
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You use it to generate electricity.

847
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Then the second one may be.

848
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Is the motion produced by the body itself.

849
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
But there is a problem here.

850
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The first one you are.

851
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
To make sure this motion is.

852
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Is.

853
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It has been happening.

854
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Not like this.

855
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
For example, your muscles move.

856
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Then it's gone.

857
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You may want to.

858
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
For example, heartbeats.

859
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Or breathing.

860
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
This kind of motion that has been happening all the time.

861
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Then use this motion to generate electricity.

862
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Someone is doing this.

863
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Then the third type.

864
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Is from chemical chemistry.

865
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
For example, glucose.

866
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Someone is studying how to use glucose to generate electricity.

867
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But this is still in the research stage.

868
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
There is no real commercial device.

869
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
The reason is that.

870
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Its conversion efficiency is still too low.

871
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
There is no way to provide this.

872
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
The lowest power needed by the sensor.

873
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So most of it is still.

874
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's all about providing power to the outside world.

875
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
What about solar energy?

876
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Solar energy.

877
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The first problem you encounter is the problem of light.

878
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Because once the light enters the tissue.

879
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
For example, the skin.

880
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
It begins to diffuse.

881
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
After the diffusion, you can really penetrate the depth.

882
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Only a few millimeters.

883
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
So after a few millimeters.

884
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Basically, you can't see the light.

885
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So there is no way to use solar energy.

886
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Unless you put it directly on the surface of the body.

887
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
There is still a possibility.

888
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Hello.

889
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Hello.

890
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I am currently doing.

891
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Biological research.

892
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Then I am also studying.

893
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I want to ask some questions about animals.

894
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
For example.

895
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Now these devices are being developed.

896
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Although I don't think so.

897
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
But still at some stage.

898
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Because of safety factors.

899
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Like traditional experiments.

900
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Do you use experimental animals?

901
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Or say.

902
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
These devices are for.

903
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Because we know that animal experiments.

904
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It is also necessary, for example, to draw blood every day.

905
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Or measure blood pressure every day.

906
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Or look at some of their physical changes.

907
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Does anyone already use these devices?

908
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Do some applications for animal experiments.

909
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Thank you.

910
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
In fact, there is.

911
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Basically, we.

912
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
These sensors.

913
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Especially implant.

914
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Is the device that is really placed in the human body.

915
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Basically, all have to go through animal experiments first.

916
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So actually animal experiments.

917
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It is also a very good platform.

918
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Can these sensors really work?

919
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
OK.

920
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Like I have a colleague.

921
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
He is doing this.

922
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I just talked about intraocular pressure.

923
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
This is the device for measuring eye pressure.

924
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
He basically puts it in first.

925
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
For example, to study in the eyes of rabbits.

926
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Then look at his sensor.

927
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Is it a good response?

928
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Because basically.

929
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
The advantage of animal experiments is.

930
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's easy.

931
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
So.

932
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Generally, if you are really doing implants.

933
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Will use animal experiments first.

934
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Then you just talked about.

935
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Is there a device?

936
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Really used to measure animal.

937
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
That.

938
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
For example, blood pressure or the like.

939
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
In fact, there is really a company doing this.

940
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Is specifically for animal experiments.

941
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Then.

942
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
It basically provides a.

943
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
A whole set of complete wireless.

944
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
This measuring system.

945
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
For example, blood pressure.

946
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Then.

947
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I forgot the other parameters.

948
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
But it can measure a lot of.

949
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Basically very similar to people.

950
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It basically can measure.

951
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Because the lab often uses mice.

952
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So it can measure the mouse's blood pressure.

953
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Then, for example, heartbeats and the like.

954
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Then it can put this.

955
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Integrated into a platform.

956
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Then give the lab people a reference.

957
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So what you say is actually done.

958
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
OK, thank you.

959
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Hello.

960
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Hello, I am Red Stone.

961
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Now at the University of Michigan.

962
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
As a postdoc.

963
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Then I have a.

964
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I have two questions.

965
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
The first one is that I heard before.

966
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Is to use Fitbit.

967
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
These products.

968
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
They usually use it for a year or two.

969
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Will be broken.

970
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I want to know.

971
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
These are the devices.

972
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Is the problem solved?

973
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I didn't mention these questions.

974
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
OK.

975
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Durability.

976
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
If the problem is.

977
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
In fact, I have been using Fitbit myself.

978
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Its durability.

979
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
In fact, the main thing is.

980
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Mechanical durability.

981
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Its sensor itself is not broken.

982
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But he.

983
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
For example, his wristband.

984
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
With this sensor.

985
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The junction of the wristband.

986
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
There is actually a problem with the connection.

987
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
For example, you often go to this.

988
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Exercise.

989
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Then stretch it.

990
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It is easy to produce mechanical fatigue.

991
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Then the place where the fatigue is easy to break off.

992
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
OK, but this.

993
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It has nothing to do with its sensor itself.

994
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Because the sensor itself uses this optical method.

995
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So unless you go on purpose.

996
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
To break it down.

997
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Otherwise, it is actually very difficult to break down.

998
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
OK, so in fact.

999
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
This problem has already been solved.

1000
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So basically.

1001
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
In fact, you just solve it.

1002
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Mechanical strength is OK.

1003
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
So this is actually with the sensor.

1004
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It is not related to the problem itself.

1005
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's just that it's designed.

1006
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I don't think so much.

1007
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
OK, then the second question is.

1008
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
About that EEG.

1009
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I want to know that.

1010
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
When you use this.

1011
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
EEG device.

1012
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
You have to wear it on your head.

1013
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
That is the helmet.

1014
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
But you still have hair.

1015
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Those EEG.

1016
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Can't directly touch your scalp.

1017
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Then these.

1018
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
In this case, those EEG.

1019
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Can still work?

1020
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Oh, yes, that's a good question.

1021
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
They actually have a special design.

1022
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
For this EEG.

1023
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
It's not like what you think.

1024
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
It's just a flat EEG.

1025
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It's actually a bit like an octopus's foot.

1026
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It has this.

1027
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
For example, a few.

1028
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
This helmet.

1029
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's actually a bit like.

1030
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Add a little pressure.

1031
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
On that EEG.

1032
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
It can actually.

1033
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Go through your hair.

1034
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Then directly touch your scalp.

1035
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
That EEG.

1036
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
It's actually a special design.

1037
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Yes, thank you.

1038
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Hello.

1039
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Hello.

1040
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I would like to ask a question.

1041
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Related to materials.

1042
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Because these wearable devices.

1043
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Relative to the skin.

1044
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Or any part of the body.

1045
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
So their.

1046
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Capability is relatively better.

1047
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I can imagine.

1048
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Consider some mechanical properties.

1049
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
If you consider these properties.

1050
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Biocompatible.

1051
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Bioresorption.

1052
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So it will be weaker.

1053
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Based on these.

1054
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Material selection.

1055
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
What kind of material do you use most often?

1056
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Or is there any.

1057
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Already commercial.

1058
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Or is it special.

1059
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
To synthesize these.

1060
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Polymer or organic.

1061
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
To be able to do these things.

1062
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
This is also a good question.

1063
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Basically.

1064
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Currently.

1065
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Whether in this.

1066
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
The medical world.

1067
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Or this.

1068
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Medical equipment.

1069
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Everyone uses this most often.

1070
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
PDMS.

1071
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
That is.

1072
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
This.

1073
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
This.

1074
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Silicone.

1075
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
It's a bit like silicone.

1076
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Its advantage is because.

1077
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
First of all, its material is very soft.

1078
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Second.

1079
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Its extensibility is very good.

1080
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
You can pull it.

1081
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
For example, more than 200%.

1082
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It still won't break.

1083
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Flexibility is also very good.

1084
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It can confirm.

1085
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Confirm to your skin surface.

1086
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Then it is.

1087
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Water and air.

1088
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It actually has this inside.

1089
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Porosity.

1090
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
It has this nanostructure inside.

1091
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Porosity.

1092
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
These small molecules.

1093
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Structure passed.

1094
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So basically.

1095
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Everyone's first choice is to use PDMS.

1096
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Then.

1097
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
If you don't want to.

1098
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Let these.

1099
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
For example, water vapor.

1100
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Or something else.

1101
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
We will be outside PDMS.

1102
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Outside.

1103
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Coat a thin layer.

1104
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Polymer to protect it.

1105
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Like our lab.

1106
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
A kind of.

1107
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Polymer material.

1108
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It can.

1109
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
By chemical.

1110
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Then directly.

1111
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
On top of PDMS.

1112
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It's a bit like.

1113
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Two-layer structure.

1114
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It's just that the outer layer is very thin.

1115
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
It won't affect.

1116
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Overall mechanical property.

1117
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Then.

1118
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And this material.

1119
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It's actually a biochemical.

1120
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Then.

1121
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It's basically.

1122
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's a bit different from PDMS.

1123
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Because it doesn't have this inside.

1124
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Nanoporous.

1125
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
So it.

1126
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
So it won't let this.

1127
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Water vapor to pass.

1128
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So if you want.

1129
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
If it's a barrier.

1130
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
In fact, you can add this outside.

1131
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Polymer.

1132
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Then you can ask.

1133
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
What kind of standard.

1134
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Biofluid barrier.

1135
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Because we know these.

1136
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Protocols or biological.

1137
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It may be an electrolyte.

1138
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
If it's on both sides of EEG or ECG.

1139
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
These will not form noise.

1140
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Or other concerns.

1141
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
OK.

1142
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Basically.

1143
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Of course, it depends on you.

1144
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
What about the process of adding this material?

1145
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Like PDMS, it's almost.

1146
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
If there is no process.

1147
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Just a few microns.

1148
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Just a few micrometers.

1149
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
It basically won't have any.

1150
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
This transparency.

1151
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So basically.

1152
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
That's our criteria.

1153
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Of course, he started.

1154
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
When commercialized.

1155
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
At first.

1156
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It's actually used to protect the circuit board.

1157
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Is to protect the circuit board.

1158
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Not corroded by this water vapor.

1159
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So.

1160
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Their initial criteria.

1161
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
It's about 10 or 20 microns.

1162
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Then we.

1163
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
If you take it.

1164
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
If you do this, it's probably the same thickness.

1165
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So it won't be much different.

1166
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
OK.

1167
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Thank you.

1168
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I would like to continue the last question.

1169
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
That is, why would you choose Perlin?

1170
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Don't choose PolyMNL.

1171
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Oh.

1172
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Actually.

1173
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
There are a few reasons.

1174
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
That is.

1175
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
The first one is.

1176
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
The two of them.

1177
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
The physical nature is a bit different.

1178
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
The first one.

1179
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
PolyMNL is.

1180
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's a bit like.

1181
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Semi-transparent material.

1182
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Then Perlin is completely transparent.

1183
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
So if you want.

1184
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
For example, optical.

1185
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
If you want to use an optical device.

1186
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Perlin is a better choice.

1187
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Then the second one is.

1188
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
PolyMNL.

1189
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
That is.

1190
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Glass transition temperature.

1191
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Higher.

1192
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So basically you heat it up.

1193
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
For example, 200 or 300 degrees.

1194
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It still won't deform.

1195
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Then Perlin.

1196
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
It's when you heat it up.

1197
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
200.

1198
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Around 200 degrees.

1199
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It's kind of like a semi-melted state.

1200
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
So it's easier to shape.

1201
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
If you need to shape.

1202
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Because.

1203
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Generally speaking, when we do Perlin.

1204
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
There are usually two layers of Perlin.

1205
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So how do you put these two layers of Perlin.

1206
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Just put it together.

1207
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I usually use this.

1208
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Is the heating method.

1209
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
To put it together.

1210
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
PolyMNL.

1211
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I don't know if it is.

1212
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Easier than Perlin.

1213
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So generally.

1214
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
We usually choose to use Perlin.

1215
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
When the temperature is relatively low.

1216
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Yes.

1217
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So these are two.

1218
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
More different places.

1219
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Of course.

1220
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Some people use PolyMNL.

1221
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
His life.

1222
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It won't be as long as Perlin.

1223
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Some people in our lab.

1224
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Is the same.

1225
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Circuit.

1226
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
The same circuit.

1227
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
One is using PolyMNL.

1228
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The other is using Perlin.

1229
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
He found that PolyMNL.

1230
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
It can only last about a month.

1231
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And then the top ones.

1232
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Layout is starting to melt.

1233
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Is to be dissolved.

1234
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Then but.

1235
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Perlin.

1236
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Because it has a very poor water permeability.

1237
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
So basically the water is not easy to pass through.

1238
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
If there is no water.

1239
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Basically your ion can't work.

1240
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
So his device.

1241
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Yes.

1242
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Thank you.

1243
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Do you have any other questions?

1244
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
If not.

1245
