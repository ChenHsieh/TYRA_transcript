0	9000	Hello everyone, I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.
9000	23000	We are very honored to invite Zhang Fengxun today. He is currently a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Michigan University.
23000	30000	His current major is Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, and has recently been renamed Sustainable Development Studies.
30000	39000	Before coming to the United States as a doctoral candidate, Fengxun studied in the Department of Insectology at the University of Taiwan.
39000	60000	He wrote a small paragraph about his own self-introduction. He is a community ecologist.
60000	76000	What he wants to understand is the interaction between species and the environment in which we humans exist.
76000	86000	In addition to ecology, he likes comedy, baseball, his home, and Taiwan.
86000	105000	Today's speech is different from the past, because we think that in addition to sharing his own research points and results, we hope that he can share more information.
105000	116000	Of course, we are very fortunate that Fengxun attended this year's annual meeting of the American Ecological Association a few weeks ago.
116000	121000	The annual meeting of the American Ecological Association is one of the largest in the world and attended by many people.
121000	135000	From his point of view, what important information is there at this year's annual meeting, and what breakthroughs are there in this area that are worth highlighting?
135000	148000	Let's welcome Fengxun with a round of applause.
165000	174000	Fengxun is not a formal Chinese name, but deals with issues such as sustainable development.
174000	183000	What is special about our association is that it is not the same as the ecological association we are familiar with.
183000	194000	Generally, the ecological association is based on basic science. We want to know the cause of a phenomenon, the evolution of species, and so on.
194000	201000	However, our association now thinks that we only understand these things, which is like being in an academic ivory tower.
201000	209000	In fact, this is not helpful for the development of ecology, so they think we should solve the problem more actively.
209000	220000	That is to say, how do we solve the problem of applying the ecological theory we already know to the major changes in the environment that we humans are facing now?
220000	232000	Or how do we make these relatively terrible extreme climates and other phenomena less common or milder?
233000	256000	This is my background, and what I want to share with you today is that I went to the US Ecological Annual Conference two weeks ago to participate in the conference.
256000	271000	I would like to share with you what I have seen, what I have played, and what I have thought.
271000	278000	I would like to introduce ESA, which stands for Ecology Society of America.
278000	284000	In fact, each country has its own ecological association, and Taiwan also has one.
284000	289000	However, ESA's annual meeting should be the largest in the world.
289000	297000	This year, more than 4,000 people participated in the conference.
297000	303000	I also went to talk to people after the conference.
303000	305000	I asked them about the situation in Europe.
305000	309000	They said it was much smaller, maybe less than 2,000 people.
309000	318000	This is the biggest conference in the world, and I think it is also the most complete conference in terms of discussion issues.
318000	329000	The disadvantage is that there are too many people, and you can't get to know everyone, and you can't have a very in-depth conversation with everyone.
329000	337000	So if your social skills are not good, you will be like me for a long time and don't know what to do.
337000	339000	I can only find someone to talk to.
339000	342000	So it's a good opportunity to practice talking to people.
342000	344000	This is a side effect.
344000	349000	Anyway, this is ESA's brief introduction.
349000	353000	I went to the conference two weeks ago.
354000	363000	Because I don't really know what everyone's background is, I will first introduce what ecology is.
363000	383000	If you google ecology or go directly to wiki, they will tell you that this is a choice between biological interaction and biological organism interaction with the environment.
383000	396000	In short, I want to learn how two organisms interact, including how we grab food, how we eat each other, how we help each other, and how the environment affects our relationship with each other.
396000	401000	All the discussions about this are ecological issues.
401000	406000	I don't think anyone will know what I'm talking about, because it's too abstract.
406000	419000	So when we talk about ecology, we immediately think of the existence of hierarchy.
419000	434000	Just like when we were in high school, we learned that the human body is made up of cells, and the cells make up the tissues, and the tissues make up the organs, the circulatory system, and the individual.
434000	440000	So in fact, ecology has a similar hierarchy.
440000	448000	From the smallest organism, which is a biological individual, to the vast majority of these biological organisms, which you can see in the picture below.
448000	452000	This should be a geoduck, I don't know what to draw.
452000	457000	Then with a group of geoducks, they are all the same, a group of geoducks.
457000	463000	Then it becomes a population ecology.
463000	471000	Then if you go up, in addition to this geoduck, there may be geoducks, snakes, eagles, other animals, trees, grass.
471000	475000	There are different kinds of animals living in the same time and space.
475000	480000	This forms a community, a group.
480000	486000	In short, many kinds of animals live in the same place.
486000	488000	This is called a community ecology.
488000	499000	If we enlarge the scope a little more, for example, we want to know that in addition to so many kinds of animals, where do they get the energy they need?
499000	502000	Where do their excrements go?
502000	507000	What kind of changes did their excrements make to the non-biological environment?
507000	512000	Then it becomes an ecosystem.
512000	516000	An ecosystem is a system.
516000	521000	The whole thing, biological and non-biological, all come together and become an ecosystem.
521000	524000	Then there are people studying ecosystem ecology.
524000	527000	Then to a bigger point is the biosphere.
527000	532000	I think this is a whole planet.
533000	537000	It's not a very meaningful classification.
537000	540000	But if you insist on expanding, it becomes a whole planet.
540000	549000	Then these levels, each level has its own questions to explore.
549000	558000	For example, people who study individual creatures will want to know how a creature grows.
558000	564000	How do I react to the environment and so on?
564000	573000	Then the population ecology of the ecosystem is that I want to know why this species is sometimes more and sometimes less.
573000	582000	For example, the evaluation of fish resources is one of the important parts of the population ecology.
582000	588000	For example, in Taiwan, I want to know how many fish I can catch this year.
588000	591000	When should I catch it? When should I not catch it?
591000	596000	This is the question that the population ecology has to answer.
596000	601000	The community ecology is like I just said.
601000	604000	Different interactions between different species.
604000	610000	So the most critical question is why there are so many species in the world.
610000	615000	How do so many species live together in this world?
615000	617000	Then it becomes so many species on the Internet.
617000	621000	What impact does the environment of non-living things in this world have?
621000	624000	This is the ecosystem ecology.
624000	628000	This is roughly the hierarchy in ecology.
628000	635000	I identify myself as a community slash a little ecosystem ecologist.
636000	643000	What I'm interested in is that I want to know how each species interacts with each other.
643000	646000	What impact do they have on the environment?
646000	649000	Or to be more direct with people.
649000	654000	There are many species in this system or in this natural environment.
654000	656000	What impact does it have on me?
656000	658000	What does it matter to me?
659000	664000	Then talk about community ecology or ecosystem ecology.
664000	671000	A question that everyone will ask is why there are so many species in this world.
671000	674000	This is a very, very old question.
674000	678000	It's also very old and very important.
678000	682000	It's also a question that we haven't answered in 100 years.
683000	687000	Because from the very beginning of 19
687000	691000	I want to explain why there are so many species of people.
691000	696000	I have written here that it is Brunel.
696000	700000	Then I put a table on the right for everyone to see.
700000	703000	When we want to answer this question,
703000	707000	I want to know why there are so many species.
707000	713000	What is the evolution of ecologists' ideas from the past to the present?
713000	721000	In short, I think it can be divided into two periods.
721000	722000	The first period.
722000	728000	The reason I'm talking about this now is because this question is very difficult to answer.
728000	729000	And it's also very important.
729000	733000	So now a lot of ecological research is actually inseparable from
733000	735000	The most fundamental question I'm asking now.
735000	738000	Why are there so many species?
738000	741000	Then when we answer this question,
741000	745000	For ancient ecologists,
745000	749000	The way we try to answer is
749000	752000	I think it's a turnip, a pit, this method.
752000	755000	In other words, how many resources can be used in the world?
755000	762000	Or how many niches can be occupied by species?
762000	764000	Then we should have seen so many species.
764000	767000	So including Grinnell, including Elton,
767000	769000	These are all very famous ecologists.
769000	775000	They all proposed various ideas about niches or ecological hypocrisy.
775000	781000	I will not explain their ideas one by one.
781000	785000	In short, the concept of this niche is a turnip, a pit.
785000	789000	Until about 2000,
789000	793000	The previous idea was that a turnip, a pit.
793000	795000	At most, the environment changes.
795000	797000	Then create different turnip pits.
797000	799000	So there are different species.
799000	801000	Sometimes the turnip pit is big, sometimes the turnip pit is small.
801000	806000	The density of species will be high.
806000	808000	The density of species will be low, etc.
808000	811000	So different species can coexist together.
811000	814000	Until about 2000,
814000	817000	There was a man named Steve Hoppe.
817000	822000	I don't know what his idea was.
822000	824000	But he proposed a theory.
824000	826000	There is no turnip, a pit.
826000	828000	Everything is random.
828000	831000	He proposed a neutral theory.
831000	834000	We see so many species.
834000	837000	Is it because of a random phenomenon?
837000	843000	The most classic example is that he took a long-term experimental observation station.
843000	848000	Then he went to study the changes in the composition of the species in the experimental observation station, etc.
849000	852000	Then he found that he could use a random model.
852000	854000	Make a random mathematical model.
854000	860000	You can predict the changes in the composition of long-term species.
860000	862000	The prediction is not bad.
862000	864000	Then he proposed a theory.
864000	866000	There are so many species in the world.
866000	868000	It's not a turnip, a pit.
868000	871000	There is a big species pool over there.
871000	873000	In this species pool,
873000	875000	ABCD may appear this year.
875000	877000	EFGH appeared this year.
877000	879000	ABEH appeared the following year.
879000	881000	He went on like this.
881000	885000	After this neutral theory was proposed,
885000	889000	everyone thought that we had been faking for almost 100 years.
889000	892000	So there was another man named Peter Chesson.
892000	895000	The fourth bullet point.
895000	898000	He proposed another theory.
898000	901000	We call it Modern Coexistence Theory.
901000	904000	He proposed this theory.
905000	907000	Under this framework,
907000	911000	neutral theory is just a special case under this framework.
911000	915000	In other words, Peter Chesson's framework
915000	924000	includes the theories we know so far.
924000	927000	He wanted to make a big framework
927000	931000	to tell us that different communities, different natural environments,
931000	934000	we will see different species.
934000	937000	Because there are different mechanisms behind it.
937000	942000	So he proposed a fluctuation-independent mechanism.
942000	945000	The first part of his modern theory is that
945000	948000	when the environment has reached a balance,
948000	952000	how many species will exist here
952000	958000	determines how much the resources used by these species are different
958000	964000	compared to the ability of their resources to interact.
964000	966000	How much difference does their ability make?
966000	968000	This is called stabilizing.
968000	970000	For example,
970000	976000	if I love to eat apples and he loves to eat oranges,
976000	978000	then I will eat my apples well,
978000	979000	and he will eat his oranges well.
979000	982000	If not, we can coexist in this world without any problems.
982000	986000	Then the concept of using different resources
986000	989000	is called stabilizing.
989000	993000	Another one is that we both love to eat apples,
993000	997000	but my speed of eating apples is about the same speed as yours.
997000	999000	So we fight fiercely.
999000	1000000	I take a bite, you take another bite.
1000000	1002000	I take another bite, you take another bite.
1002000	1005000	So we keep fighting each other.
1005000	1009000	So no one can kill each other.
1009000	1014000	So we can coexist in this world very tightly.
1014000	1017000	This is a mechanism of equalizing.
1017000	1019000	Under this framework,
1019000	1021000	the neutral theory I just mentioned
1021000	1025000	is an extreme state of equalizing.
1025000	1026000	Everyone is the same.
1026000	1031000	No one can kill another person.
1031000	1033000	So there are a bunch of species in this world
1033000	1040000	fighting each other here.
1040000	1043000	So far,
1043000	1046000	everyone seems to be a little satisfied.
1046000	1047000	I think it's not bad.
1047000	1049000	We can use this big framework
1049000	1053000	to explain why we can see so many different species.
1053000	1054000	But in fact,
1054000	1056000	current ecologists
1056000	1060000	can't understand these theories of Jason.
1060000	1061000	On the one hand,
1061000	1063000	it seems that we are enough here.
1063000	1064000	We just need to know
1064000	1069000	that everyone fights each other fiercely,
1069000	1071000	or that everyone uses different resources.
1071000	1072000	You can explain
1072000	1074000	why there are different species here
1074000	1078000	and then continue to extend.
1078000	1083000	But when some current theoretical ecologists
1083000	1087000	continue to dig Jason's framework,
1087000	1092000	they will find that there is actually another mechanism,
1092000	1095000	which is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism.
1095000	1103000	The reason why this mechanism allows species to coexist
1103000	1107000	is because it feels that the environment is constantly changing.
1107000	1110000	So the system can't reach a balance
1110000	1113000	or is on the way to a balance.
1113000	1115000	So since we are still in a state
1115000	1117000	where the environment is constantly changing,
1117000	1120000	what we know now
1120000	1122000	is that when we see these species,
1122000	1124000	we can't use these theories
1124000	1126000	that we have obtained
1126000	1128000	in a balanced state
1128000	1132000	to explain why we see these now.
1132000	1134000	Of course, this is difficult
1134000	1136000	because we don't know
1136000	1138000	whether the natural environment we live in
1138000	1140000	has reached a balance
1140000	1142000	or has not reached a balance.
1142000	1146000	So I think this is a big question.
1146000	1149000	This is also the first thing I saw
1150000	1154000	and I think it may be a topic
1154000	1158000	that many ecologists will start to study in the future.
1158000	1161000	How to quantify a system
1161000	1163000	has it reached a balance
1163000	1167000	or has it not reached a balance?
1167000	1169000	If it has not reached a balance,
1169000	1172000	it is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism.
1172000	1175000	How do we quantify these mechanisms?
1175000	1177000	How do we use these mechanisms
1177000	1179000	to explain how many different creatures
1179000	1182000	I see in this system now?
1182000	1187000	In the fluctuation-dependent mechanism,
1187000	1189000	the main core is that
1189000	1191000	the environment is constantly changing.
1191000	1194000	So when the environment is constantly changing,
1194000	1198000	if I like low resources,
1198000	1200000	I can live a good life.
1200000	1202000	When in low resources,
1202000	1204000	I can find a way to get rid of people.
1204000	1206000	Another person may be
1206000	1208000	when in high resources,
1208000	1210000	he will find a way to get rid of me.
1210000	1212000	But because the environment is constantly changing,
1212000	1214000	we have to
1214000	1216000	adapt to the environment.
1216000	1218000	This is the concept.
1218000	1220000	It's not like what I eat,
1220000	1222000	what you eat,
1222000	1224000	and stay in a very stable state.
1224000	1226000	Now the environment is changing,
1226000	1230000	and we have our own density.
1230000	1232000	There may also be feedback back to the environment.
1232000	1234000	This is the storage effect
1235000	1238000	If you are interested,
1238000	1240000	I don't know if you are interested.
1240000	1242000	If you are interested, you can go and see
1242000	1246000	this paper I wrote.
1246000	1248000	I think he wrote it very well.
1248000	1251000	Then there is a sentence
1251000	1254000	in a relatively flat language
1254000	1256000	that tells us what the whole
1256000	1258000	Coexistence Theory is talking about.
1258000	1260000	I'll give you an example here.
1260000	1263000	What is a fluctuation-dependent mechanism?
1264000	1267000	This paper is also a good one.
1267000	1269000	Sorry, the resolution is not very good.
1269000	1271000	This is a new paper that came out recently.
1271000	1273000	In this paper,
1273000	1275000	he wants to prove one thing.
1275000	1279000	Storage effect and relative non-linearity
1279000	1281000	These two fluctuation-dependent mechanisms
1281000	1288000	is the reason for the coexistence of two species.
1288000	1292000	You can see panel A and B.
1292000	1297000	Different colors represent the density of different species.
1297000	1299000	Yellow is one, blue is another.
1299000	1302000	Then the background is either white or light,
1302000	1306000	or gray represents the richness of resources.
1306000	1311000	The background is dark or light,
1311000	1315000	which represents the richness of resources.
1315000	1317000	So we can see from panel A and panel B,
1317000	1319000	when there is less resource,
1319000	1321000	it is not so dark.
1321000	1323000	Yellow wins.
1323000	1325000	On the other hand, when it's darker,
1325000	1327000	in panel C,
1327000	1329000	blue wins.
1329000	1331000	But when we get to panel D,
1331000	1334000	he deliberately adds resources in that system.
1334000	1338000	Sometimes this system has a lot of resources,
1338000	1340000	and then sometimes he takes the resources away,
1340000	1342000	and then he adds resources and takes them away.
1342000	1345000	It creates a human-made fluctuation.
1345000	1348000	When we see a human-made fluctuation,
1349000	1354000	yellow and blue can coexist.
1354000	1357000	No one can eliminate anyone.
1357000	1362000	For example, this is the first real experiment proof.
1362000	1366000	Of course, everyone does this kind of experiment.
1366000	1372000	But this paper has a special point.
1372000	1375000	In addition to telling you that you can really coexist,
1375000	1380000	it really uses a mathematical model to really quantify
1380000	1385000	how much storage effect I can have,
1385000	1388000	how much relative non-inheritance.
1388000	1391000	So let everyone know that there are really two kinds of
1391000	1394000	environmental changes
1394000	1397000	that allow species to coexist.
1397000	1399000	It's not just that we want to say,
1399000	1401000	because of environmental change,
1401000	1406000	everyone has different levels of resources,
1406000	1408000	so of course we can coexist.
1408000	1413000	This kind of verbal argument is right.
1413000	1415000	So this is the first one.
1415000	1419000	I think it's a pretty eye-opening study.
1419000	1422000	Then at the seminar,
1422000	1424000	I also saw a few talks,
1424000	1426000	so I tried to quantify
1427000	1432000	why species can coexist in changing environments,
1432000	1438000	and what is the mechanism behind their coexistence.
1438000	1440000	Is everyone suitable for different environments?
1440000	1444000	Or is the environment I affect affecting me?
1444000	1450000	This is the first highlight I saw at this conference.
1451000	1454000	I have a question.
1454000	1457000	So you're showing this now,
1457000	1460000	for example, there are two species of yellow and blue.
1460000	1461000	Yellow and blue species.
1461000	1464000	Both of them have a feature,
1464000	1467000	which is that you can see the peak at each point.
1467000	1471000	That is, the slope is very large.
1471000	1474000	So it means that these two species themselves
1474000	1481000	have a very small response time scale to change.
1481000	1483000	Maybe less than a day.
1483000	1487000	But if you look at the D-panel in the lower right corner,
1487000	1491000	it's like external excitation.
1491000	1494000	That is, their environment changes,
1494000	1497000	their scale is ten days, five days,
1497000	1498000	a few days, a few days, a few days.
1498000	1501000	That's the width of black and white.
1502000	1507000	So the time scale of the species system
1507000	1511000	and the time scale of excitation are very different.
1511000	1514000	So you can see this phenomenon very clearly.
1514000	1517000	But if today the species must use
1517000	1519000	about the same time,
1519000	1525000	or even longer, to respond to external excitation,
1525000	1529000	then the whole model will fail.
1529000	1532000	Because it may not have time to reach the next state.
1532000	1534000	The environment has changed again,
1534000	1536000	and then it will collapse in the end.
1536000	1537000	It's a mess.
1537000	1538000	Yes, it's possible.
1538000	1540000	So what I'm talking about now,
1540000	1542000	this fluctuation-dependent thing,
1542000	1545000	is actually what you're talking about.
1545000	1546000	It's a relative concept.
1546000	1548000	If the environment is changing,
1548000	1549000	it must be fluctuation-dependent.
1549000	1557000	It can be said that my own life cycle is very short.
1557000	1559000	So even if the environment changes once a year,
1559000	1562000	I have already given birth dozens of times a year.
1562000	1565000	Yes, I have reproduced dozens of times.
1565000	1568000	So the change in the environment is meaningless to me.
1568000	1570000	So I just said that in a system,
1570000	1574000	now we want to answer this question.
1574000	1576000	Ecologists,
1576000	1579000	the first difficult point is
1579000	1582000	that we have to identify the change in the environment
1582000	1585000	for the life cycle of my species.
1585000	1586000	In terms of life cycle,
1586000	1588000	is it dependent or independent?
1588000	1591000	If it is dependent,
1591000	1593000	if it is fluctuation-dependent,
1593000	1595000	we can then ask
1595000	1600000	which mechanism is it?
1600000	1603000	Does this answer your question?
1603000	1604000	Oh, thank you.
1604000	1606000	Yes.
1606000	1608000	Okay,
1608000	1611000	next, like I just said,
1611000	1614000	this is a very old question.
1614000	1616000	It's so old that
1616000	1618000	some people don't want to answer this question anymore.
1618000	1620000	So everyone started to ask this question
1620000	1622000	in another way.
1622000	1625000	Now there are so many species in this environment.
1625000	1627000	So then,
1627000	1629000	the question just answered is
1629000	1630000	why does this environment
1630000	1632000	allow me to see so many species?
1632000	1634000	But now,
1634000	1635000	everyone may find it boring,
1635000	1636000	so ask it the other way around.
1636000	1637000	So many species,
1637000	1640000	what impact will it have on this environment?
1640000	1642000	This question
1642000	1643000	or this question
1643000	1645000	is actually not something that happened recently,
1645000	1647000	but it suddenly became obvious.
1647000	1651000	It probably started in the late 1990s.
1651000	1652000	There was a person in Europe
1652000	1656000	who did a project called Ecotron.
1656000	1657000	In other words,
1657000	1660000	it's probably like...
1660000	1661000	I don't know if everyone knows
1661000	1662000	that there is a kind of...
1662000	1663000	Give you a glass ball,
1663000	1665000	and then there is grass inside.
1665000	1666000	There are different kinds of grass,
1666000	1670000	and then there are some moss,
1670000	1671000	something wet,
1671000	1673000	like a planet.
1673000	1674000	Ecotron is very similar to that concept.
1674000	1678000	It's a microcosm.
1678000	1680000	Their idea is that
1680000	1683000	the more species there are in this microcosm,
1683000	1684000	the more biomass I will see.
1684000	1690000	I can see the more creatures in it.
1690000	1691000	It started this
1691000	1698000	Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning Branch.
1698000	1700000	Biodiversity
1700000	1703000	How does it affect the function of this system?
1703000	1704000	Function means
1704000	1706000	what is the production volume of this system?
1706000	1710000	How efficient is this system
1710000	1713000	with the nutrient salt?
1713000	1714000	The most famous one
1714000	1716000	will be brought to everyone.
1716000	1719000	It's in Minnesota.
1719000	1720000	There is a person
1720000	1721000	who is the first person
1721000	1723000	to really do this large-scale experiment.
1723000	1727000	You can see it in the picture on the left.
1727000	1728000	It's called Seagull Creek.
1728000	1731000	It really digs a piece of land
1731000	1733000	and plants this grass.
1733000	1738000	You can see a plot.
1738000	1740000	There may be five kinds of grass in this plot.
1740000	1741000	There is one kind of grass in another plot.
1741000	1743000	There are several kinds of grass in a plot.
1743000	1744000	It goes down like this.
1744000	1746000	Or in Germany,
1746000	1747000	Jena Experiment
1747000	1748000	also does similar things.
1748000	1749000	There are different kinds of grass
1749000	1753000	in each block.
1754000	1757000	When I have a lot of grass,
1757000	1759000	does this grass
1759000	1760000	use different resources
1760000	1762000	in order to survive?
1762000	1765000	In total,
1765000	1766000	I can take more resources
1766000	1769000	from the environment.
1769000	1771000	As I just said,
1771000	1773000	there is a concept of a radish pit.
1773000	1775000	The whole pit is full.
1775000	1778000	We take a lot of resources
1778000	1780000	from the system.
1780000	1784000	A lot of biodiversity grows out of it.
1784000	1785000	This kind of research
1785000	1789000	has been done for more than 10 years.
1789000	1791000	We have now discovered
1791000	1793000	a general pattern.
1793000	1795000	When we see a lot of species
1795000	1797000	in an environment,
1797000	1799000	when biodiversity increases,
1799000	1801000	when X goes to the right,
1801000	1802000	we see that those functions
1802000	1804000	will increase.
1804000	1806000	How much resources can we take away?
1806000	1809000	How much biodiversity can we produce?
1809000	1811000	We all see a function
1811000	1816000	that increases but saturates.
1816000	1818000	This is the knowledge we know now.
1818000	1819000	However,
1819000	1821000	the knowledge we have now
1821000	1826000	is all based on grass experiment.
1826000	1827000	This is the grass experiment
1827000	1829000	I just showed here.
1829000	1831000	We all plant grass
1831000	1833000	or raise a certain
1833000	1836000	nutrient-based organism.
1836000	1837000	Then we find that
1837000	1841000	the nutrient-based organism functions well.
1841000	1842000	However,
1842000	1843000	this is not enough.
1843000	1845000	In our world,
1845000	1847000	it is impossible to have only grass.
1847000	1848000	At least there are humans.
1848000	1850000	At least insects eat grass.
1850000	1851000	Rabbits eat grass.
1851000	1852000	Lions eat rabbits.
1852000	1855000	There are many different kinds of life.
1855000	1856000	Now,
1856000	1858000	there are a few questions
1858000	1862000	that ecologists want to continue to explore.
1862000	1863000	The first is
1863000	1866000	the function of these ecosystem.
1866000	1867000	For example,
1867000	1869000	the production of biomass, etc.
1869000	1871000	Is it related to
1871000	1874000	what we need in this world?
1874000	1876000	This is the first one above.
1876000	1878000	How do we put these functions
1878000	1880000	and services
1880000	1882000	I will talk about what service is later.
1882000	1885000	Service is the function we need.
1885000	1887000	How do we put these two things together?
1887000	1888000	Otherwise, people will think that
1888000	1890000	our ecological system is
1890000	1893000	locked in a academic ivory tower.
1893000	1896000	Purely understand the phenomenon of the natural environment
1896000	1897000	and then it's over.
1897000	1898000	No more.
1898000	1899000	Everyone hopes that
1899000	1901000	we ecologists can contribute to
1901000	1903000	some changes in the environment, etc.
1903000	1906000	This is the first
1906000	1908000	ecologicalists
1908000	1911000	want to continue to study.
1911000	1914000	Next is what I just said.
1914000	1915000	All the knowledge we learn now
1915000	1917000	is very flat.
1917000	1919000	Or the same nutrient class.
1919000	1920000	But the natural environment
1920000	1922000	is a very three-dimensional state.
1922000	1924000	So should we
1924000	1925000	put the natural environment
1925000	1928000	into a very three-dimensional state?
1928000	1931000	The third one is
1931000	1934000	how can we predict accurately
1934000	1936000	or accurately
1936000	1938000	when the environment changes
1938000	1939000	to reflect
1939000	1942000	how many species will be left now.
1942000	1944000	How many species will be left
1944000	1946000	and how many functions
1946000	1948000	will be left, etc.
1948000	1950000	So these three are from
1950000	1953000	Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning.
1953000	1955000	The three branches
1955000	1958000	I think are ecological systems.
1958000	1961000	I can't say it's obvious,
1961000	1963000	but a lot of people are doing it.
1963000	1965000	Now I'm going to talk about the first one.
1965000	1967000	What is ecosystem services?
1967000	1969000	These services mean
1969000	1971000	all people
1971000	1972000	live in this world
1972000	1974000	and learn about these
1974000	1976000	functions,
1976000	1977000	patterns,
1977000	1980000	all the things you need.
1980000	1981000	And then,
1981000	1983000	I remember it was the UN
1983000	1984000	or something.
1984000	1988000	The report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
1988000	1990000	At that time, it was clearly defined
1990000	1993000	that our current ecosystem
1993000	1995000	is actually the whole earth.
1995000	1997000	These services
1997000	1998000	are provided to people.
1998000	1999000	There are these four categories,
1999000	2001000	supporting provisioning,
2001000	2003000	regulation, and culture.
2003000	2005000	The first few are easier to understand.
2005000	2007000	Supporting services
2007000	2009000	that support the operation of the earth.
2009000	2011000	For example, the cycle of nutrients.
2011000	2013000	You may have learned
2013000	2014000	that in biology,
2014000	2016000	we learn about the water cycle,
2016000	2017000	the egg cycle, the carbon cycle,
2017000	2019000	the carbon cycle, and so on.
2019000	2021000	Or how much
2021000	2023000	production
2023000	2025000	can be used by us, etc.
2025000	2027000	Then these will support
2027000	2029000	how much food can we eat,
2029000	2031000	the water cycle,
2031000	2032000	because of the water cycle,
2032000	2033000	how much clean water
2033000	2034000	can be used by us.
2034000	2035000	This is provisioning.
2035000	2037000	Or when we want to manage
2037000	2038000	a system,
2038000	2041000	we don't want to have too many pests.
2041000	2044000	We want to maximize,
2044000	2047000	for example, maximize the number of corn.
2047000	2049000	We don't want too many corn pests.
2049000	2051000	The number of pest control
2051000	2055000	is the regulation services.
2055000	2058000	These three are relatively easy to understand.
2058000	2059000	I think,
2059000	2061000	and it is also now
2061000	2064000	a big problem for ecologists.
2064000	2066000	We call it cultural services.
2066000	2068000	What I wrote here is
2068000	2070000	you can think of everything
2070000	2072000	related to culture.
2072000	2075000	These are from the natural environment.
2079000	2081000	You get these ideas.
2081000	2082000	You get these inspirations.
2082000	2083000	You get these education.
2083000	2084000	You get to learn.
2084000	2086000	But as long as it's related to the environment,
2086000	2088000	it's not that kind of
2088000	2089000	ugly.
2089000	2090000	You don't have it.
2090000	2091000	If you don't have it,
2091000	2092000	you won't die.
2092000	2093000	But you will live unhappily.
2093000	2096000	These things are called culture.
2096000	2100000	So some people say
2100000	2102000	because nature is beautiful,
2102000	2103000	it's too beautiful.
2103000	2105000	So we can't maximize it.
2105000	2107000	We can only rely on the beauty of our inner self
2107000	2110000	to appreciate nature.
2110000	2112000	Then there are other people who say
2112000	2114000	that this is meaningless.
2114000	2116000	I say what you say is beautiful.
2116000	2117000	I can also say
2117000	2119000	that there is nothing in the world that is the most beautiful.
2119000	2121000	So how do we quantify
2121000	2123000	the services of these ecosystems,
2123000	2126000	especially the services of culture?
2126000	2128000	This is something that some people
2128000	2131000	are trying to figure out now.
2131000	2136000	And that part of people
2136000	2139000	includes a lot of economists.
2139000	2142000	Because economists are very...
2142000	2144000	I think
2144000	2146000	they are very good at estimating
2146000	2148000	the value of this thing in the market,
2148000	2150000	and then how to trade it.
2150000	2151000	So some people will think
2151000	2156000	that we will quantify these services.
2156000	2157000	For example,
2157000	2160000	a piece of clean water
2160000	2163000	is worth 2.5 million.
2163000	2166000	Then a big clean swimming pool
2166000	2167000	is worth 2.5 million.
2167000	2169000	A big clean swimming pool
2169000	2170000	is worth 10 million.
2170000	2172000	I don't know.
2172000	2175000	Just try to quantify it
2175000	2178000	or find a way to...
2178000	2180000	I can't say that this can be traded,
2180000	2182000	but use money to quantify it
2182000	2184000	so that we can do better management, etc.
2184000	2187000	Or we can use money
2187000	2189000	to quantify
2189000	2191000	almost everything in the world
2191000	2194000	in a system of communication.
2194000	2197000	This is the second thing I think
2197000	2201000	that eco-scientists are facing now.
2201000	2204000	This is also a problem
2204000	2206000	that some scholars
2206000	2209000	who are not trained in ecology
2209000	2213000	want to help us solve.
2213000	2216000	How to quantify ecosystem services,
2216000	2218000	especially these services
2218000	2222000	related to culture.
2222000	2224000	Even when I was at this conference,
2224000	2226000	there was a special workshop.
2226000	2228000	There were quite a few participants.
2228000	2230000	Almost 100 people.
2230000	2232000	Almost 100 people were discussing
2232000	2236000	ecosystem services.
2236000	2238000	This is the second thing
2238000	2241000	that I think is pretty cool.
2241000	2244000	Okay.
2244000	2247000	Next,
2247000	2249000	I just said
2249000	2250000	that when we understand
2250000	2251000	biodiversity,
2251000	2252000	what we understand now
2252000	2253000	is relative to others.
2253000	2254000	When we understand
2254000	2255000	the impact of biodiversity
2255000	2257000	on the environment,
2257000	2258000	our understanding
2258000	2260000	of biodiversity
2260000	2262000	is relative to others.
2262000	2267000	So probably after 2005 and 2007,
2267000	2269000	some people started to think
2269000	2271000	that biodiversity
2271000	2272000	should be said
2272000	2273000	that the natural environment
2273000	2275000	is a very three-dimensional state.
2275000	2276000	We should not only consider
2276000	2278000	the same nutrient class.
2278000	2279000	We should consider
2279000	2280000	all nutrient classes.
2280000	2283000	So there are some studies
2283000	2285000	that are also going to do
2285000	2287000	pest control.
2287000	2288000	Biological control.
2288000	2291000	These studies on biodiversity
2291000	2294000	will think that
2294000	2295000	they first thought that
2295000	2297000	if I want to control a pest,
2297000	2299000	for example, this soil.
2299000	2300000	We want to control this.
2300000	2302000	This should be considered
2302000	2303000	a insect.
2303000	2306000	I don't know what kind of insect this is.
2306000	2307000	Anyway, it's a pest.
2307000	2308000	We want to control
2308000	2310000	the number of pests.
2310000	2311000	Then we should put
2311000	2313000	a kind that will eat it
2313000	2315000	at the bottom.
2315000	2316000	Or is it better to put
2316000	2317000	everything in?
2317000	2318000	How should it be put
2318000	2320000	to let the number of pests
2320000	2323000	be suppressed to the minimum?
2323000	2325000	At the beginning,
2329000	2330000	when we consider
2330000	2332000	a lot of different nutrients
2332000	2333000	and a lot of different
2333000	2335000	nutrient classes,
2335000	2337000	the biodiversity we knew
2337000	2339000	would really affect
2340000	2341000	the ecosystem function.
2341000	2343000	Does this still exist?
2346000	2348000	This is the initial idea.
2348000	2349000	Until recently,
2349000	2352000	there have been more researchers
2352000	2354000	who have invested in this research.
2354000	2357000	Then we will think that
2357000	2359000	in addition to different
2359000	2360000	biological classes,
2360000	2361000	should we think of the
2361000	2363000	whole environment as a
2366000	2368000	network?
2368000	2370000	It's a concept of a food network.
2370000	2372000	There are a lot of food networks.
2372000	2373000	There are a lot of species
2373000	2375000	that exist in this system at the same time.
2375000	2376000	Then everyone eats each other.
2376000	2379000	Everyone grabs food from each other.
2379000	2381000	This research can actually
2381000	2383000	involve a debate
2383000	2384000	from a long time ago.
2384000	2387000	Everyone will ask
2387000	2389000	what kind of network
2389000	2390000	and what kind of food network
2390000	2392000	is the most stable state.
2392000	2393000	Before the emergence of
2393000	2395000	Biodiversity Ecosystem Function
2395000	2397000	,
2397000	2398000	everyone started to ask
2398000	2399000	what kind of food network
2399000	2401000	is the most stable.
2401000	2402000	At that time,
2402000	2403000	the pure research was
2403000	2405000	purely thinking about
2405000	2406000	how to prevent
2406000	2407000	this food network from crashing.
2407000	2409000	Maybe everyone is very good at connecting.
2409000	2411000	Connectedness is very high.
2411000	2415000	Everyone is in a small group.
2415000	2417000	It's very close to each other.
2417000	2420000	Then the small group and the small group
2420000	2422000	are not so close to each other.
2422000	2424000	How do these attributes of
2424000	2426000	each network
2426000	2428000	affect the stability of
2428000	2432000	the entire network?
2432000	2435000	Then put this idea
2435000	2437000	into the idea of
2437000	2439000	Biodiversity Ecosystem Function.
2439000	2441000	Everyone will start to think that
2441000	2443000	since each network
2443000	2445000	has different attributes,
2445000	2446000	different characteristics,
2446000	2449000	then in the state of different characteristics,
2449000	2451000	will there be different
2451000	2452000	food networks with different characteristics?
2452000	2454000	There will be different functions.
2454000	2456000	For example,
2456000	2459000	this opinion paper
2459000	2463000	is not a real data paper.
2463000	2467000	It provides an idea
2467000	2470000	that when different food networks
2470000	2474000	have different attributes,
2474000	2475000	different characteristics,
2475000	2477000	the energy flux
2477000	2478000	is not discussing
2478000	2479000	whether the entire network
2479000	2480000	will crash easily.
2480000	2481000	What we are discussing now is
2481000	2483000	how much energy flows in
2483000	2485000	and how much efficiency
2485000	2487000	flows out in the end.
2487000	2489000	Everyone started to ask this question.
2489000	2491000	Theoretically,
2491000	2493000	these are some of the network attributes.
2493000	2495000	How does it affect
2495000	2497000	the function of this part?
2497000	2499000	This question is
2499000	2502000	the question I am most interested in
2502000	2504000	asking in the future.
2504000	2506000	At the end,
2506000	2507000	I will talk about
2507000	2509000	my own research.
2509000	2511000	It's very simple.
2511000	2513000	My own research
2513000	2515000	is very related to
2515000	2517000	the question
2517000	2519000	that some ecologists
2519000	2521000	are starting to ask.
2521000	2523000	How do different network attributes
2523000	2525000	affect the function of this network?
2525000	2529000	This research,
2529000	2531000	I haven't seen it yet.
2531000	2533000	I think it's fun and cool,
2533000	2535000	but I haven't seen
2535000	2537000	too much
2537000	2539000	real data
2539000	2541000	doing this.
2541000	2543000	Now it's mainly
2543000	2545000	a very theoretical research.
2545000	2547000	In other words,
2547000	2549000	we have to use a more three-dimensional
2549000	2551000	way to understand
2551000	2553000	how diversity affects
2553000	2555000	the function
2555000	2557000	of the entire ecosystem.
2557000	2559000	We are still in a
2559000	2561000	theoretical stage.
2561000	2563000	Theoretically,
2563000	2565000	this full web,
2565000	2567000	everyone is very tight-knit,
2567000	2569000	or everyone's interaction is very strong.
2569000	2571000	I might see this kind of function.
2571000	2573000	Theoretically,
2573000	2575000	because
2575000	2577000	this can't be blamed on ecologists,
2577000	2579000	because I really want to quantify
2579000	2581000	a full web.
2581000	2583000	It's actually not easy.
2583000	2585000	Of course, many people are already doing full web.
2585000	2587000	But what everyone does is
2587000	2589000	for example,
2589000	2591000	fish in a lake,
2591000	2593000	I want to open his stomach
2593000	2595000	and see what kind of small fish and shrimp he ate.
2595000	2597000	In my own words,
2597000	2599000	A fish ate
2599000	2601000	C, D, E shrimp,
2601000	2603000	and so on.
2603000	2605000	Use various methods to see
2605000	2607000	what kind of things a species eats,
2607000	2609000	or if there are any
2609000	2611000	different species
2611000	2613000	eating and eating each other.
2613000	2615000	Use different microscopes,
2615000	2617000	or like I just said,
2617000	2619000	God content research.
2619000	2621000	We can't blame
2621000	2623000	that we don't have enough
2623000	2625000	empirical data,
2625000	2627000	but this empirical data is not easy to get.
2627000	2629000	So everyone will start to
2629000	2631000	dilute, for example,
2631000	2633000	we use
2633000	2635000	the size of the organism
2635000	2637000	to decide,
2637000	2639000	to estimate what he will eat.
2639000	2641000	Because for example,
2641000	2643000	a fish,
2643000	2645000	a goldfish,
2645000	2647000	I mean the goldfish in the aquarium,
2647000	2649000	he may eat a shark.
2649000	2651000	So we can use its size
2651000	2653000	to estimate what kind of food
2653000	2655000	a goldfish can eat.
2655000	2657000	Then use the size of the organism
2657000	2659000	and
2659000	2661000	the size of the organism
2661000	2663000	such a trait
2663000	2665000	to help each species
2665000	2667000	what kind of food
2667000	2669000	it may have.
2669000	2671000	Then build a
2671000	2673000	more realistic,
2673000	2675000	not so theoretical food network.
2675000	2677000	Then we use some attributes of this food network
2677000	2679000	to see what the function of this food network is.
2679000	2681000	But it's the same,
2681000	2683000	it's still built on a theory
2683000	2685000	that small fish can't eat big fish.
2685000	2687000	So it's not necessarily
2687000	2689000	that this is the most perfect food network.
2689000	2691000	It's just that
2691000	2693000	the biologists are starting to think
2693000	2695000	how to answer this question.
2695000	2697000	Including myself, I also think
2697000	2699000	this is the next topic
2699000	2701000	I want to continue
2701000	2703000	to study.
2703000	2705000	After finishing
2705000	2707000	these chapters of my Ph.D.
2707000	2709000	I want to do some research.
2713000	2715000	I've been
2715000	2717000	talking to
2717000	2719000	the people at the conference,
2719000	2721000	including some biologists
2721000	2723000	from France or Germany.
2723000	2725000	They all say they have
2725000	2727000	a huge greenhouse effect.
2727000	2729000	Like what I just said,
2729000	2731000	I want to make it three-dimensional,
2731000	2733000	like what you can see
2733000	2735000	on this picture.
2735000	2737000	There are a lot of things like a greenhouse.
2737000	2739000	Different food networks
2739000	2741000	are made up of different greenhouses.
2749000	2751000	Like the German
2751000	2753000	IDIV,
2753000	2755000	I think that organization is really cool.
2755000	2757000	First, they have a lot of money.
2757000	2759000	Second, the topics they study
2759000	2761000	are all my friends.
2761000	2763000	I like them a lot.
2763000	2765000	They seem to have a lot of future ideas.
2769000	2771000	This is my second
2771000	2773000	conference.
2773000	2775000	I think it's worth sharing
2775000	2777000	what biologists are thinking
2777000	2779000	about.
2779000	2781000	Third,
2781000	2783000	this research
2783000	2785000	was done by
2785000	2787000	my former teacher,
2787000	2789000	Sutiara.
2789000	2791000	She's my teacher.
2791000	2793000	But she doesn't know
2793000	2795000	much about math.
2795000	2797000	Anyway,
2797000	2799000	biologists want to
2799000	2801000	do this kind of research.
2801000	2803000	We're all looking for a cause-and-effect relationship.
2805000	2807000	For example,
2807000	2809000	why are there so many
2809000	2811000	species in the world?
2811000	2813000	What's the reason?
2813000	2815000	We saw this result.
2815000	2817000	Why are there
2817000	2819000	so many species?
2819000	2821000	Why do we get
2821000	2823000	these functions?
2823000	2825000	The reason is that there are so many species.
2825000	2827000	The result is that there are these functions.
2827000	2829000	But in addition to
2829000	2831000	actually doing experiments,
2831000	2833000	for example, like I just said,
2833000	2835000	it's hard to really
2835000	2837000	quantify
2837000	2839000	the cause-and-effect relationship
2839000	2841000	of a phenomenon
2841000	2843000	other than
2843000	2845000	the cause-and-effect relationship.
2845000	2847000	Sutiara
2847000	2849000	doesn't know much about math,
2849000	2851000	so
2851000	2853000	I just made it up.
2853000	2855000	It's based on
2855000	2857000	this theorem,
2857000	2859000	the Taken's theorem,
2859000	2861000	to develop a set of
2861000	2863000	mathematical models
2863000	2865000	or a set of
2865000	2867000	statistical methods.
2867000	2869000	We should talk about statistical methods.
2869000	2871000	It can measure
2871000	2873000	the impact of
2873000	2875000	a population
2875000	2877000	on another population.
2877000	2879000	It can use the relationship of time series
2879000	2881000	to know if a population
2881000	2883000	has a direct impact on another population.
2883000	2885000	For example,
2885000	2887000	this is the most common example.
2887000	2889000	Red and blue
2889000	2891000	are two species.
2891000	2893000	So at the time of A,
2893000	2895000	red and blue have a strong
2895000	2897000	relationship.
2897000	2899000	According to our
2899000	2901000	theory,
2901000	2903000	red is the cause of blue,
2903000	2905000	blue is the effect of red,
2905000	2907000	or vice versa.
2907000	2909000	But when we get to B,
2909000	2911000	we find that
2911000	2913000	their relationship is opposite.
2913000	2915000	It's negative.
2915000	2917000	So we say,
2917000	2919000	if red increases,
2919000	2921000	let blue decrease,
2921000	2923000	or vice versa.
2923000	2925000	We use this correlation
2925000	2927000	to infer the causality.
2927000	2929000	Red and blue have nothing to do with each other.
2929000	2931000	So we find that
2931000	2933000	red and blue have no causality.
2933000	2935000	However, these two time series
2935000	2937000	are written from the
2937000	2939000	mathematical formula above.
2939000	2941000	In other words,
2941000	2943000	red and blue, x and y,
2943000	2945000	have a causality.
2945000	2947000	But in our traditional
2947000	2949000	ecological research,
2949000	2951000	if we just do a bunch of correlations
2951000	2953000	or don't do experiments,
2953000	2955000	we can't know
2955000	2957000	the causality of
2957000	2959000	red and blue, x and y.
2959000	2961000	However,
2961000	2963000	using this method,
2963000	2965000	cross-mapping,
2965000	2967000	we can know
2967000	2969000	the causality of
2969000	2971000	red and blue.
2975000	2977000	I mentioned this method
2977000	2979000	because I saw
2979000	2981000	the experiment room
2981000	2983000	this year.
2983000	2985000	The experiment room is not that big.
2985000	2987000	It's just four or five people.
2987000	2989000	They came to give a talk.
2989000	2991000	Almost everyone came to give a talk.
2991000	2993000	It seems to me
2993000	2995000	that this method
2995000	2997000	has been developed successfully.
2997000	2999000	Let's use it.
2999000	3001000	It's a kind of
3001000	3003000	declaration
3003000	3005000	of significance.
3005000	3007000	A few years ago,
3007000	3009000	when I went to
3009000	3011000	ESA,
3011000	3013000	there were some
3013000	3015000	collaborators.
3015000	3017000	However,
3017000	3019000	it's not like this year.
3019000	3021000	Almost the whole experiment room
3021000	3023000	came to give a talk.
3023000	3025000	Ecologists, let's use CCM.
3025000	3027000	Let's use this method.
3027000	3029000	Let's not do correlations.
3029000	3031000	Let's not do x and y.
3031000	3033000	Let's use CCM.
3033000	3035000	Let's try to collect
3035000	3037000	time series data
3037000	3039000	to know who is the cause and who is the cause.
3039000	3041000	It's a kind of
3041000	3043000	declaration.
3043000	3045000	I think it's great.
3045000	3047000	Actually, ecologists are not that smart.
3047000	3049000	To be honest,
3049000	3051000	I decided to study ecology
3051000	3053000	because my math is not good enough.
3053000	3055000	I can't study physics.
3055000	3057000	I can't study chemistry.
3057000	3059000	I don't like to study humanities.
3059000	3061000	So, I decided to study biology.
3061000	3063000	I was happy to see the biology
3063000	3065000	running around.
3065000	3067000	I'm not good at math.
3067000	3069000	So,
3069000	3071000	I'm not sure
3071000	3073000	if this method
3073000	3075000	will work.
3075000	3077000	I'm not sure.
3077000	3079000	This method
3079000	3081000	requires a good time series.
3081000	3083000	As you know,
3083000	3085000	in the current
3085000	3087000	scientific research environment,
3087000	3089000	every project,
3089000	3091000	every grant
3091000	3093000	may take 3 to 5 years.
3093000	3095000	Maybe 10 years.
3095000	3097000	It's a good time series.
3097000	3099000	3 to 5 years.
3099000	3101000	3 to 5 years time series may not be long enough
3101000	3103000	to do CCM.
3103000	3105000	To do convergence cross mapping.
3105000	3107000	Next,
3107000	3109000	what I just said,
3109000	3111000	I just wrote
3111000	3113000	A detects an impact
3113000	3115000	on another population.
3115000	3117000	In other words,
3117000	3119000	if A's impact on B is
3119000	3121000	C's impact,
3121000	3123000	which is indirect,
3123000	3125000	then we get
3125000	3127000	A, B, C, these three time series.
3127000	3129000	It's possible for me to catch
3129000	3131000	A's impact on B.
3131000	3133000	But this impact is actually through C.
3133000	3135000	It's not A's direct impact on B.
3135000	3137000	In other words,
3137000	3139000	this method is not omnipotent.
3139000	3141000	I can only tell you
3141000	3143000	who might affect who.
3143000	3145000	But whether this impact is
3145000	3147000	a direct impact, I can't be sure.
3147000	3149000	In other words,
3149000	3151000	CCM, although it's powerful and cool,
3151000	3153000	it can let us know the causality.
3153000	3155000	But it still can't let us know
3155000	3157000	the real causal relationship.
3157000	3159000	Is the causality
3159000	3161000	direct?
3161000	3163000	So this method
3163000	3165000	still has some shortcomings.
3165000	3167000	But I think
3167000	3169000	it's already
3169000	3171000	a great way
3171000	3173000	to let everyone
3173000	3175000	who has a time series
3175000	3177000	to try to answer the questions
3177000	3179000	they want to answer.
3179000	3181000	Some more traditional
3181000	3183000	correlation analysis.
3185000	3187000	This is probably the last one.
3187000	3189000	Is the last one a summary?
3189000	3191000	I don't know.
3191000	3193000	I just summarized everything
3193000	3195000	I just said.
3195000	3197000	In short, we still have to ask
3197000	3199000	the most classic question.
3199000	3201000	How do species coexist?
3201000	3203000	Why are there so many species?
3203000	3205000	And now
3205000	3207000	a way to
3207000	3209000	answer this question.
3209000	3211000	We have to consider environmental changes.
3211000	3213000	Use fluctuation-dependent
3213000	3215000	mechanisms to explain species coexistence.
3215000	3217000	After species coexistence,
3217000	3219000	we are
3219000	3221000	trying to
3221000	3223000	solidify our understanding of biodiversity.
3223000	3225000	And
3225000	3227000	find a way to know
3227000	3229000	what impact
3229000	3231000	biodiversity
3231000	3233000	has on
3233000	3235000	the environment
3235000	3237000	we live in.
3237000	3239000	For example, how much food can we eat?
3239000	3241000	This kind of question.
3241000	3243000	Next is
3243000	3245000	causality inference.
3245000	3247000	We really want to know
3247000	3249000	some causal relationships.
3249000	3251000	Through time series analysis,
3251000	3253000	we want to know causal relationships.
3253000	3255000	Finally, ecosystem services.
3255000	3257000	I think it's a very
3257000	3259000	mysterious term.
3259000	3261000	I really think that Schneider University
3261000	3263000	seems to love this term.
3263000	3265000	We want to use ecosystem services
3265000	3267000	to manage our...
3267000	3269000	I forgot where it is.
3269000	3271000	Anyway, it's a country in South America.
3271000	3273000	I heard in the workshop
3273000	3275000	that our government is trying to
3275000	3277000	push the concept of ecosystem services.
3277000	3279000	We want to use the concept of ecosystem services
3279000	3281000	to manage the natural resources
3281000	3283000	of our country.
3283000	3285000	I think
3285000	3287000	these are some interesting topics.
3287000	3289000	After participating in this meeting,
3289000	3291000	I saw some interesting topics.
3291000	3293000	I want to
3293000	3295000	learn more about
3295000	3297000	the impact of
3297000	3299000	network
3299000	3301000	and
3301000	3303000	diverse ecosystem functioning.
3305000	3307000	Lastly,
3307000	3309000	I think
3313000	3315000	I don't know if this is a question
3315000	3317000	or a concern.
3317000	3319000	If you know a little bit about
3319000	3321000	ecosystem services,
3321000	3323000	you will know that
3323000	3325000	there are so-called
3325000	3327000	theoretical ecologists and
3327000	3329000	empiricists.
3329000	3331000	Some people's research is
3331000	3333000	a computer or a pile of paper
3333000	3335000	with a pile of equations
3335000	3337000	or a framework.
3337000	3339000	For example, I just talked about Peter Chesson
3339000	3341000	who proposed the Modern Consistent Theory.
3341000	3343000	Some people think
3343000	3345000	it's meaningless to just think about it.
3345000	3347000	I need to do experiments.
3347000	3349000	These two
3349000	3351000	I can't say two sides.
3351000	3353000	The communication between
3353000	3355000	these two ecologists
3355000	3357000	is not so smooth.
3359000	3361000	I think
3361000	3363000	maybe some people think it's not bad.
3363000	3365000	I don't think it's that smooth.
3365000	3367000	Because theoretical ecologists
3367000	3369000	are too smart
3369000	3371000	and empiricists
3371000	3373000	may not be able to keep up with their ideas.
3373000	3375000	On the other hand, empiricists
3375000	3377000	think we are materialistic enough.
3377000	3379000	Theoretical ecologists
3379000	3381000	think we are materialistic.
3381000	3383000	The other people are empty-handed.
3383000	3385000	So I think the communication between
3385000	3387000	these two sides needs
3387000	3389000	a strong theory.
3389000	3391000	Then I will do experiments
3391000	3393000	with these ecologists
3393000	3395000	to build a bridge of friendship.
3395000	3397000	Otherwise,
3397000	3399000	I've been thinking about
3399000	3401000	the mechanism of fluctuation-dependent
3401000	3403000	and how to influence co-existence.
3403000	3405000	It's meaningless if you can't do experiments.
3405000	3407000	Or
3407000	3409000	the most obvious example is
3409000	3411000	I did a theoretical model
3411000	3413000	and one of my
3413000	3415000	committee members said
3415000	3417000	is it useful to do so many theories?
3417000	3419000	Can you really do experiments
3419000	3421000	to verify your model prediction?
3421000	3423000	So my second chapter
3423000	3425000	is to do experiments
3425000	3427000	to see if the predicted results
3427000	3429000	can be seen
3429000	3431000	in real life.
3431000	3433000	It's like a debate.
3433000	3435000	It's like a civilized blind date.
3439000	3441000	This is what I want to say today.
3441000	3443000	This is what I want to say today.
3445000	3447000	What I saw at this conference
3447000	3449000	and what I think
3449000	3451000	ecologists are thinking about.
3455000	3457000	Is there any time left?
3457000	3459000	Actually,
3459000	3461000	it's about time.
3461000	3463000	But we can ask questions.
3463000	3465000	Before asking questions,
3465000	3467000	let's turn on the microphone
3467000	3469000	for two seconds.
3469000	3471000	Thank you, Feng Xun,
3471000	3473000	for the speech.
3477000	3479000	I don't know if you have any questions
3479000	3481000	or comments.
3487000	3489000	I have a similar question
3489000	3491000	or a comment.
3491000	3493000	You mentioned
3493000	3495000	network analysis
3495000	3497000	and causality interference.
3497000	3499000	You mentioned
3499000	3501000	time series analysis.
3501000	3503000	These two technologies
3503000	3505000	are very useful
3505000	3507000	in physics.
3507000	3509000	They are very useful
3509000	3511000	in physics.
3511000	3513000	They are very useful
3513000	3515000	in physics.
3515000	3517000	In fact,
3517000	3519000	they are widely used.
3519000	3521000	But I think
3521000	3523000	the biggest problem is
3523000	3525000	that
3525000	3527000	physicists' habits.
3527000	3529000	For example,
3529000	3531000	there are water molecules in the water.
3531000	3533000	There are one or two water molecules in the water.
3533000	3535000	I don't know how to use
3535000	3537000	ten water molecules.
3537000	3539000	The computer can't predict.
3539000	3541000	So I use one water molecule
3541000	3543000	and one water molecule.
3543000	3545000	So I use water molecules
3545000	3547000	and one water molecule
3547000	3549000	to check the phenomenon.
3549000	3551000	Then I said
3551000	3553000	that my model
3553000	3555000	would have such a phenomenon.
3557000	3559000	Then I went for experiments.
3559000	3561000	Then I said I understood
3561000	3563000	the flow of water.
3563000	3565000	I think this
3565000	3567000	can be delineated.
3567000	3569000	Assuming things can be delineated
3569000	3571000	in a condition
3571000	3573000	like a time series,
3573000	3575000	it would be more interesting.
3575000	3577000	Otherwise,
3577000	3579000	physicists say
3579000	3581000	they can calculate one by one,
3581000	3583000	but they can't do fluid mechanics.
3583000	3585000	Then I said I would leave it to the computer.
3585000	3587000	Then I asked the computer
3587000	3589000	to do a large-scale
3589000	3591000	numerical simulation
3591000	3593000	to simulate some strange phenomena.
3593000	3595000	If the experiment can't be done,
3595000	3597000	I said the experiment wouldn't be done.
3597000	3599000	But it doesn't mean it's wrong.
3599000	3601000	Because in the real world,
3601000	3603000	water is still flowing.
3603000	3605000	This kind of research
3605000	3607000	and operation
3607000	3609000	is actually very difficult
3609000	3611000	for a system
3611000	3613000	with complex variables.
3613000	3615000	So let's go back
3615000	3617000	to the biological ecosystem.
3617000	3619000	Of course,
3619000	3621000	you can say
3621000	3623000	it's easy to issue a paper.
3623000	3625000	I just need to build up the model
3625000	3627000	and let the computer calculate it.
3627000	3629000	In the end,
3629000	3631000	you still have to go back
3631000	3633000	to whether you can explain
3633000	3635000	what happened in this world
3635000	3637000	and whether you can do experiments to verify it.
3637000	3639000	But there will be a lot of difficulty in the middle.
3639000	3641000	Then it becomes
3641000	3643000	a very interesting thought study.
3643000	3645000	But it's hard to say
3645000	3647000	if it has an impact on the learning itself.
3647000	3649000	I totally agree.
3649000	3651000	If I remember correctly,
3651000	3653000	the talk of the person next week
3653000	3655000	is similar to what you just said.
3655000	3657000	It's about building a climate model
3657000	3659000	or a water texture model
3659000	3661000	to understand
3661000	3663000	some of the changes
3663000	3665000	in the environment, etc.
3665000	3667000	That's a very popular question
3667000	3669000	for some ecologists
3669000	3671000	right now.
3671000	3673000	Because, as I just said,
3673000	3675000	we want to know how to face this world.
3675000	3677000	So if I can
3677000	3679000	use a digital simulation
3679000	3681000	and I know
3681000	3683000	that the temperature here is one degree higher
3683000	3685000	than the temperature in a black box,
3685000	3687000	I don't know what's going on.
3687000	3689000	Anyway, the sea level will rise by 50 meters.
3689000	3691000	I feel very happy.
3691000	3693000	If the prediction is accurate,
3693000	3695000	I feel happy.
3695000	3697000	But some ecologists
3697000	3699000	think that
3699000	3701000	it's like doing
3701000	3703000	big data analysis.
3703000	3705000	You don't know what's going on at all.
3705000	3707000	You only know one cause and effect.
3707000	3709000	So I think
3709000	3711000	this is a
3711000	3713000	question that depends on
3713000	3715000	what you want to answer.
3715000	3717000	If you really just want to solve an environmental problem
3717000	3719000	or a human survival problem,
3719000	3721000	you can do a data analysis
3721000	3723000	and I can come up with
3723000	3725000	an effective solution,
3725000	3727000	that's great.
3727000	3729000	But if I just want to increase my knowledge,
3729000	3731000	I think knowledge is the most important thing.
3731000	3733000	This is very meaningful to me.
3733000	3735000	This is why I don't
3735000	3737000	like
3737000	3739000	big data analysis
3739000	3741000	or environmental studies.
3743000	3745000	That's the reason.
3745000	3747000	In fact,
3747000	3749000	there are some people
3749000	3751000	in the conference
3751000	3753000	who are trying to
3753000	3755000	use CtS
3755000	3757000	to collect
3757000	3759000	more data
3759000	3761000	to understand environmental changes.
3761000	3763000	I don't think
3763000	3765000	they have a good enough
3765000	3767000	theoretical foundation.
3767000	3769000	I don't pay
3769000	3771000	too much attention to what they are doing.
3777000	3779000	Thank you.
3779000	3781000	Do you have any questions?
3783000	3785000	If you have any questions
3785000	3787000	or comments,
3787000	3789000	I'll tell you.
