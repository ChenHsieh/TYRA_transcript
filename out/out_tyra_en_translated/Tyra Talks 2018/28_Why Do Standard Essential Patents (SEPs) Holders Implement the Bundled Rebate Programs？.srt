00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He also analyzed the legal behavior of Taiwanese clients and non-independent individuals in the U.S. and East Germany.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Louis is also very interested in entrepreneurship.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and regularly holds meetings and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Today's topic is about his background in law and entrepreneurship.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Louis, please turn on your microphone.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Last year, I also talked about the topic of streaming, which is the issue of copyright for online streaming videos.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you are interested, please go to Tera's website and click on the link.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today's topic is completely different. It has nothing to do with copyright, but is related to patents.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis was co-written with a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's Administration College.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The main part of my thesis is to study whether the use of bundling in the market,

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or the use of bundling in the market, or the use of bundling in the market,

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
or the use of bundling in the market, and some economic analysis.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The main details of the content will allow me to talk about it for about 30-40 minutes.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It should not be too long, because this is a bit of a background, so I have to talk about it in detail.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm just curious about which background friends are coming to listen to my speech today.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know who will respond, so I'll turn off the full screen to see.

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are those with a deep background, welcome.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Then there are those with physics, mechanical.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So none of them are from the Academy of Social Sciences.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, very good. Then I will talk about it in detail.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In fact, the things in the Academy of Social Sciences or the law are not so complicated.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Today we will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process of deduction.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think there is no need to show off, just to show you what our results are.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't have much to say.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The things I study have some background knowledge that needs to be understood by everyone.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I say something wrong.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Its structure looks like this.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One of them is modern chip.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are the benefits of modern chip?

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The advantage is that after the modern chip is installed in the mobile phone today,

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
For example, we all know that the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In fact, this is very blind.

47
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Another example is that everyone is in the United States.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I assume that everyone is in the United States.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you take your mobile phone and go to some remote places, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But you can still make calls and you can still go online.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's just that it's very slow.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How is this function done?

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
In fact, this is the function of modern chip.

56
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.

57
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
However, its operating function is limited.

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is the function of modern chip.

59
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But the value of a smart phone is to be online.

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is a total of 1.2 years.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In fact, Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since Samsung, Intel, and Huawei.

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Huawei has not written here yet.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Huawei started to layout from 4G to 5G.

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This is the current state of the industry.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
From 2012 to now,

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we can see that the green part of the patent layout is high-speed communication.

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In fact, in various fields, including radio front, modulation, and core networking,

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the patent layout of the modern chip has a very high status.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The inter-digital and blackberry are all gone.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
These are all in the past.

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The former dragon head is no longer in use.

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can see that there is a lot of high-speed communication in green.

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In fact, the patent layout, especially 5G, is not as good as Qualcomm.

85
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So we can simply summarize one thing.

86
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.

87
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because most of the chips are sold due to the patent layout and the maintenance of product quality.

88
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So the state of maintenance is very good.

89
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users,

90
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:20,000
mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, 5, 6, and 7.

91
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But the problem is that these so-called communication standards,

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
as mentioned above, 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.

93
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Although there are a lot of patent layout behind these standards,

94
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and the negotiation process of each party,

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
because we always have to decide which standard to use.

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It must be of good quality and easy to promote.

97
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think everyone can understand this.

98
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In fact, there are international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So let's go back to the picture just now.

100
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think this picture is very important in the context of my law school.

101
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why is it important?

102
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI.

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
These three are very important to develop 4G and even 5G technical standard organizations.

105
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
These technical standard organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.

106
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future

107
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
to be able to be used by many people.

108
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's not that I only let a group of people use it.

109
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
A small group of people using it is not a standard.

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So everyone must be able to recognize that this thing is good for them.

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's easy to use and has a high rate of measurement.

112
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.

113
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But behind it, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.

114
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Because it's impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.

115
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is impossible.

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It must be a segment.

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It must be cut into many segments.

118
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Some companies focus on that.

119
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Some companies focus on that.

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
For example, you can see Radio Front End.

121
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar,

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it also means that there are a lot of things that Qualcomm can't do.

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So today I'm going to talk to you about this.

124
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This industry is very dense.

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This patent is called SEP.

126
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.

127
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The holders of SEP, such as Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel,

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
are considered to be these players.

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If people all over the world use this standard,

130
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
can they boost the price?

131
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If people all over the world use this standard,

132
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
can they boost the price?

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In order to prevent this from happening,

134
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
this is one point.

135
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Another point is that it can take advantage of the patent status of the market.

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because patents are legal monopolies.

137
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can understand it this way.

138
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Most people don't study law.

139
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you want to ask me how to understand patents,

140
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the way to understand it is very simple.

141
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It is a law that gives you the right to monopolize.

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time.

143
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
For your technology, for your patent.

144
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So it is a limited monopoly.

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
After these people have patents,

146
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
if these patents or technologies are used as standards,

147
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
it can increase their price infinitely.

148
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations I just mentioned?

149
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because the price is too high, no one can use it.

150
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?

151
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So in this atmosphere, in this concept,

152
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,

153
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
remember that this structural organization in the process of setting standards,

154
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
it will require all technical standards organizations,

155
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
all SEPs,

156
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you have to provide an LOA.

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.

158
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That is to say, you want to become a 3G standard,

159
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
for example, or 3G or 4G or 5G standards in the future.

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But your patent price must be within a certain range.

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But the condition of this range, we call it FRAMED.

162
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let me stop for a moment.

163
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.

164
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Does anyone have any questions now?

165
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's take a look.

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It seems that no one has asked me a question.

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If there is no problem, I will continue to speak.

169
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because I found that there is no social science background,

170
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I have to speak particularly slowly.

171
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The full name of FRAMED is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.

172
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
FRAMED is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.

173
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This condition actually includes a lot.

174
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you are interested, you can check it.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.

176
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You can use your technology to become my 5G standard.

177
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You can provide your patent and submit your patent application.

178
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But you have to accept FRAMED's restrictions.

179
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why?

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If the price is too high, everyone will not use it.

182
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The other point is the box below.

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The box below is the implementer.

184
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.

186
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
HTC is not the patent holders we just saw in the picture.

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
HTC is simply a person who is authorized to use the technical standards they have.

188
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then I use it and I adopt the technology.

189
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We call it implementers.

190
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It is not a person who develops modern chips.

191
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Simply put, HTC is the same as Apple.

192
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Of course, if you pay attention to this industry,

193
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.

194
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It also wants to make its own chips.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you are interested in the future, you can talk to me.

196
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.

197
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
In fact, there are still some entry barriers.

198
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
First, you have to accept it.

199
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You have to accept it in the SEP holders.

200
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You have to become a technical standard.

201
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You have to accept Friend.

202
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Second, the condition of Friend will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.

203
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It will have a third-party interest.

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We call it a third-party interest contract.

205
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The meaning of the third person is to include HTC.

207
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
HTC is not an SEP holder.

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
HTC is not an SEP holder, but its efficiency will affect the third person.

209
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So everyone can enjoy the benefits of Friend.

210
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
For example, HTC also uses the 3G, 4G, or 5G patents of these technical standard organizations.

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can't say that I'm not in this technical standard organization.

212
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Or I didn't participate in the process of designing this technical standard organization.

213
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So these SEP holders raised my price very high.

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No way.

215
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Basically, these SEP holders join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for the 5G standard.

216
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You have to accept these two conditions.

217
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
First, the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.

218
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Second, it will affect the third party.

219
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of Friend.

220
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I won't give you a discount because you are in a technical standard organization.

221
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No one else will.

222
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But I made a signal here.

223
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
My research is in this area.

224
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The source of all problems is here.

225
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's because of the so-called market monopoly.

226
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Why?

227
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Think about it.

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?

229
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?

230
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Because who sets the technical standards?

231
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It must be the industry leaders.

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If everyone gathers together in these industry leaders to have a meeting,

233
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.

234
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It seems that many manufacturers sit in a row together to eat and discuss things.

235
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It seems to be very simple and there is no legal problem.

236
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let me tell you.

237
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The problem is here.

238
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this from occurring.

239
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This prohibition is actually a so-called joint pricing behavior.

240
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The U.S. Anti-Trust Law has many different review standards.

241
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The most taboo thing is the so-called joint pricing.

242
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
A bunch of competitors in the same industry.

243
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
For example, Ericsson also has a patent.

244
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.

245
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Qualcomm is also a member.

246
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Because they all submit their patents and join their members.

247
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.

248
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
All set standards here.

249
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.

250
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you guys doing something?

251
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Why?

252
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Think from another perspective.

253
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Friend is what we just talked about.

254
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.

255
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
SEP or not.

256
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I promised you to set the price of Friend.

257
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But this is for everyone.

258
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
All SEP holders must require this condition.

259
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What about this technical standard organization?

260
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:12,000
For example, if I ask for 5%, the price of Friend is 5% for each product.

261
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
5% may be too high.

262
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
1% is called Friend.

263
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Think about it.

264
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
If such a condition appears.

265
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What is the price of Friend?

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What is the reasonable and non-discriminatory price?

267
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everyone can only charge 1%.

268
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In fact, from the perspective of the government, it will feel strange.

269
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why did you all create this RATE together?

270
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Is there a joint pricing behavior?

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So this problem is stuck.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This technical standard organization, I call it SSO.

273
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's easy for me to say.

274
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
SSO will worry.

275
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If everyone is investigating me, everyone is doubting me.

276
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Am I doing joint pricing over there?

277
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Because I said a sentence.

278
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The price of Friend is 1%.

279
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Am I not being investigated all day?

280
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So the problem is here.

281
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Although it is a very important organization.

282
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It made Friend.

283
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It requires everyone to accept Friend.

284
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.

285
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because of this, what is Friend?

286
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can report to everyone.

287
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What is Friend?

288
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In the legal circle.

289
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.

290
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Too much.

291
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Because no one really dares to go to court.

292
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It should be said that the court itself or the government unit.

293
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He never dared to respond positively to this matter.

294
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Includes his definition.

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He has his calculation method.

296
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But every court in the United States.

297
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Are using different methods of calculation.

298
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Today.

299
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So this thing is actually complicated.

300
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
OK.

301
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In fact, I will introduce this kind of background to everyone today.

302
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Because I think this thing needs to be explained to everyone.

303
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then his background state.

304
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then I can get into what we are studying.

305
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.

306
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That is, everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.

307
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I know what I am studying.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm getting into my stuff.

309
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This is easier for everyone to understand.

310
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Before we officially start talking.

311
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Before this fun case.

312
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Let me ask you first.

313
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The simple industry I just introduced.

314
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Or some knowledge background.

315
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Is there any problem with the introduction?

316
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Talk.

317
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
5 seconds.

318
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
3, 5, 4.

319
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No problem so far.

320
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
OK.

321
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
No problem, very good.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But if you have any questions, you are welcome.

323
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I also want to train.

324
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Talk to people in the legal field.

325
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
See what you think.

326
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
OK.

327
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
After having such background knowledge.

328
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Then we know that the technical standards have a lot of patents.

329
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
OK.

330
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He has to authorize him to be restricted by this regulation.

331
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Then he has a third-party regulation.

332
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So everyone can enjoy the friend.

333
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
OK.

334
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Good.

335
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Then there is that we all know that the modern chip is selling.

336
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Usually there are a lot of patents behind.

337
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
OK.

338
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So just about summary.

339
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Summary is like this.

340
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The problem is that we all know.

341
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I just mentioned that Qualcomm is an industry leader.

342
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
OK.

343
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The quality of the modern chip is very good.

344
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Then he is also Apple's long-term supplier.

345
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
OK.

346
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But last year, at the beginning of 2017.

347
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The US Federal Trade Commission FTC.

348
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And Apple itself.

349
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Apple is his downstream manufacturer.

350
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
OK.

351
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Then he specifically has a lot of this kind of claim.

352
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That is, he has advocated many things.

353
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What I want to focus on today is that Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.

354
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Playing with everyone in a so-called.

355
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Uh, he uses his position in the market.

356
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And then to achieve his goal of making profits.

357
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So how does he do this?

358
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
First of all.

359
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
This picture is actually public.

360
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's not me.

361
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's not that beautiful.

362
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.

363
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
He added his.

364
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This content of the prosecution and his analysis of the picture.

365
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That is, how Qualcomm.

366
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:48,000
How does Qualcomm do it and how does he do it?

367
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Basically, Qualcomm's approach is divided into two stages.

368
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is that before Qualcomm officially became Apple's supplier in 2007,

369
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Qualcomm already had a contract with Apple's assembly plant.

370
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
If you want to assemble, you will also use Qualcomm's patent.

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.

372
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
In fact, I just gave a simple example.

373
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
If you look at it, Qualcomm's patent layout has exceeded the scope of Modern Chip itself.

374
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It contains the entire technical standard.

375
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This is what he said.

376
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I also believe that this is the case.

377
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
If you look at Qualcomm, it was established in 1985.

378
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Then continue to develop in the communication chip industry.

379
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Then continue to expand the patent layout of his business.

380
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So in fact, the influence of his business is not just in the Modern Chip itself.

381
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It also contains the entire technical standard.

382
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So Qualcomm has been cooperating with Apple's suppliers.

383
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because Apple's supplier, for example, I just said Fushkang.

384
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Fushkang is not just an Apple product.

385
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He also does other things, such as HP.

386
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You do other products.

387
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
HP's, for example, subscriber.

388
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Qualcomm's patent or technology will also be used.

389
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Also need to do patent authorization.

390
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So it turns out that Qualcomm has been cooperating with Apple's other suppliers.

391
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So why did I mention Apple's supplier?

392
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The complexity is here.

393
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Because Qualcomm did a very interesting thing.

394
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Before he became Apple's supplier.

395
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He told Apple's supplier that I signed a contract with you.

396
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You want to assemble this Apple product.

397
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Then I will collect this patent with you.

398
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But the content of this patent, the scope, the content, the specific details.

399
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
How is it NDA?

400
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Non-Disclosure Agreement is not open to the public.

401
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What about other things?

402
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Because this is a bit complicated.

403
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But simply put, Qualcomm and Apple's assembly plant today.

404
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Then do the patent authorization.

405
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
These assembly plants can actually come back and ask Apple for reimbursement.

406
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Because the assembly plant feels that there is no need to bear this responsibility anymore.

407
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because this contract is actually negotiable.

408
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But in the real world, I can report to everyone.

409
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
In fact, most of the money in Taiwan's assembly plant.

410
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
A lot of money has become Apple to squeeze.

411
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Of course, Apple will say that I did not squeeze them.

412
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Of course, in this case, Qualcomm is.

413
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Qualcomm claims that I have been working with these assembly plants today.

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Then I asked them to pay me the rights to these patents.

415
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
If you don't want to pay this right, you can go back to Apple.

416
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You don't have to pay this money.

417
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Does Apple pay for you?

418
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But the fun thing is here.

419
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm is SEP.

420
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
In fact, its SEP is a range.

421
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Its range is the so-called Friend.

422
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
OK, it is fair and reasonable.

423
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It must be reasonable and non-discriminatory.

424
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But it signed the NDA with these assembly plants.

425
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then think about it, if you are Apple.

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then there is a chip that I want to use Qualcomm.

427
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
As a result, I use Qualcomm chips.

428
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The assembly plant below me has been asking me for money.

429
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Qualcomm and I have received more money.

430
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then you have to compensate me.

431
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Then how much compensation?

432
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Then how much according to the contract?

433
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Then Qualcomm asked him why it was this price.

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Apple asked those assembly plants why it was this price.

435
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
As a result, the assembly plant said I can't tell you.

436
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Why? Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.

437
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I can't tell you.

438
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
OK, so this is amazing.

439
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The first stage is that Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant for a sum of money.

440
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Then the source of this sum of money is NDA.

441
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It is not public.

442
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Then it becomes that Apple can only accept it unilaterally.

443
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Because the account is there.

444
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Qualcomm asked me for so much money.

445
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then Apple transferred the money to Apple.

446
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Then Apple can only accept it unilaterally.

447
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Apple thinks it's strange.

448
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Is this price reasonable?

449
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But I asked my assembly plant below me.

450
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
He can't say.

451
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
OK, that's weird.

452
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
OK, so Apple actually wants to get rid of this state.

453
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
How much did I pay Qualcomm?

454
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't know.

455
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I should say that I don't even know my source and my calculation method.

456
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I just kept paying for it.

457
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
He thinks it's unreasonable.

458
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It feels like the price is inside.

459
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Managers or lawyers or lawyers feel that this price may be unreasonable.

460
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Qualcomm wants too much money.

461
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.

462
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
OK, so this picture is later.

463
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Apple went to talk to Qualcomm.

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
After he went to talk, Apple said, OK, I can sign a contract with you.

465
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This contract is the gray part below.

466
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It includes BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.

467
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
These are all the abbreviations of this contract.

468
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
BCPA, for example, is full name is Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.

469
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
TA is Transition Agreement, etc.

470
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Anyway, it's an abbreviation.

471
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
In these contracts, Qualcomm and Apple went to talk.

472
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Then Apple felt very uncomfortable.

473
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You're going through my assembly plant in the middle.

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I want to talk to you directly.

475
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OK, I'll talk to you directly.

476
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Qualcomm agreed.

477
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
After he agreed, he signed these contracts.

478
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But he added some conditions to these contracts.

479
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
These conditions are fun.

480
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
This is what you see now.

481
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
These two.

483
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It sounds very simple.

484
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
In fact, the specific content looks like this.

485
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
This is the lawsuit.

486
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
This is mentioned in the Apple lawsuit.

487
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.

488
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't know what the confidential thing is.

489
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The main thing is these two.

490
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
One is that you have to promise me.

491
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You want me to provide Qualcomm to provide you chips.

492
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
The US Federal Trade Commission uses a word called No License, No Chip, No License.

493
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's the other way around.

494
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Sorry.

495
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's No License, No Chip.

496
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He said, OK, you want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.

497
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yes, but you have to accept this price.

498
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Accept this.

499
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You have to accept a certain price for my SEP.

500
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then he found out inside Apple that the price was a bit higher than the market.

501
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
But Qualcomm said, what can you do?

502
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
If you don't accept this price.

503
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.

504
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So these two are bundled together.

505
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The so-called bundle is to say that I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.

506
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yes, but you have to accept an Apple.

507
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In fact, this case is still running.

508
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The so-called price is not a friend.

509
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The so-called price is not a friend.

510
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It is possible that everyone in the market public thinks that these SEPs are 1%.

511
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But sorry, I want 5% from you.

512
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The 5% sales price.

513
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But because Qualcomm's quality is good.

514
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Then he is a market leader again.

515
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Then there are a lot of patents.

516
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So Apple has to accept this thing.

517
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay, this is the first point.

518
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
His so-called no license, no chip.

519
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
The policy is that I must accept you.

520
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You have to, you have to, you have to, Apple has to accept his contract terms.

521
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
In return, it means that you want me to use his, I use Qualcomm's modern chip.

522
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But I have to accept a higher friend price.

523
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The second point is.

524
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Okay, you want me to supply this, right?

525
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel that I did not treat you badly.

526
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He provides a rebate from the top.

527
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
This rebate is a fixed total price.

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That is to say, because you are my customer for a long time.

529
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Use my communication chip.

530
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Then I will give you a return.

531
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Let you continue to use.

532
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But the fun thing is coming again.

533
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Always hurt everyone.

534
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If I, because everyone is not learning law or business, it is in the mall.

535
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
All the conditions, all the benefits, or the so-called rebate, this kind of return.

536
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'll give you a sum of money.

537
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Ah, it's all conditional.

538
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Qualcomm said yes.

539
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Uh, Apple said yes.

540
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Then you give me back.

541
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You give me a return.

542
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But Qualcomm said yes.

543
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'll give you a return.

544
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But you have to accept the following conditions.

545
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
The following conditions are two.

546
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Ah, this condition includes the following.

547
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Chipset Supply Agreement.

548
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What does this condition include?

549
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
First, you have to continue to use my communication chip.

550
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You can't jump.

551
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You can't run to use Intel.

552
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
You can't run to use.

553
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Ah, Samsung or whatever.

554
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You can't run to use my competitor's chip.

555
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Does this sound reasonable?

556
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OK, it seems like nothing.

557
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
OK, what about the second point?

558
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's just fun.

559
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You can't go to any government unit to investigate me.

560
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Ah, you can't sue me.

561
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You can't issue a patent lawsuit.

562
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You can't use any other government.

563
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You can't start a lawsuit to investigate me.

564
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
OK, that's actually controversial.

565
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
OK, one is that I provide a return.

566
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Ah, but you have to continue to use my chip.

567
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Ah, this is called the so-called Boundary Bait.

568
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
OK, the second is that you want to use.

569
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You want me to provide a return.

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You can, no problem.

571
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But you can't sue me.

572
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
OK, so there are two points.

573
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
One is that I let you not investigate me.

574
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It completely locks you up.

575
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
OK, the other point is that you can't jump.

576
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You can't jump to another place.

577
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And then you can't.

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You can't sue me.

579
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So this makes Apple very upset.

580
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because he thinks I can't use other people's.

581
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Ah, I can't use other people's chips.

582
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And then you use the so-called No License No Chip in front of me.

583
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And then the price is so high.

584
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
OK, the price is so high.

585
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then you don't let me start a lawsuit.

586
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And then I don't know what the hell you're doing.

587
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And then you're the market monopoly.

588
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And then the whole thing comes together.

589
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Ah, that's just the whole case.

590
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The whole thing comes together.

591
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Just let Apple jump.

592
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And, uh, it triggered a lot of, uh, the EU.

593
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And that China, Taiwan, Taiwan.

594
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Maybe you've heard of it.

595
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
He's also investigating this.

596
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And then the United States.

597
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And then the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating this whole thing.

598
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
What is his legitimacy?

599
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
OK, so what we're talking about in this paper is.

600
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Say, uh, one thing we want to study is.

601
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What is the reason behind what Qualcomm is doing?

602
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Why does Qualcomm want to provide?

603
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Uh, this is the return to Apple.

604
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Because you can think about it.

605
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.

606
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Right?

607
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Right?

608
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Good quality.

609
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Ah, it's the market monopoly again.

610
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Why does he provide a return to Apple?

611
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Right?

612
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Because I'm lying down.

613
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm lying down and Apple's coming.

614
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You can think about it.

615
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
That's the question.

616
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I think it's interesting.

617
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
If you're a market monopoly.

618
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And then basically everyone's products.

619
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Almost all of them will use my modern chip.

620
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then.

621
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then my quality.

622
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
People can't catch up with me.

623
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
For example, he mentioned Intel in it.

624
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Intel doesn't matter to him at all.

625
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
He can't catch up with me at all.

626
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Ah, there's a very high entry barrier.

627
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You might.

628
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I don't know if you've learned this.

629
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I personally think he's on the entry barrier.

630
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's pretty high.

631
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The cost of this investment is very high.

632
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Ah, so.

633
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
This question has always been this question.

634
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It becomes the core of our paper.

635
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That is, if Qualcomm.

636
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
He's in a position that's close to a market monopoly.

637
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Or he's in a market leadership position.

638
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And then?

639
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
The layout of the patent is so wide.

640
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
OK, and then the quality of the product is also very good.

641
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So why did he provide this rebate to Apple?

642
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Ah, that's what he did in the real world.

643
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And provide this rebate.

644
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
This one.

645
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm going to tell you about this contract.

646
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
This deadline.

647
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's not even a year or two.

648
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's three to five years.

649
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
During the period.

650
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So, in fact, he continues to provide this rebate.

651
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And then.

652
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Provide such a return to this Apple.

653
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And then the two requirements are that you have to continue to use it.

654
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And then you can't investigate me.

655
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then.

656
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Uh, you have to.

657
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And then you have to accept my friend.

658
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You have to accept me.

659
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
This seems to be similar.

660
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This is not the price of the friend.

661
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
In fact, even the price of the friend is controversial.

662
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm not going to.

663
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Uh, not in today's.

664
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Within the scope of the report.

665
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because.

666
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Because you say everything.

667
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Apple says you're not a friend.

668
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Qualcomm says I'm a friend.

669
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Because I include the whole.

670
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
This is the patent I authorize you to give.

671
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's all about this.

672
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This know-how.

673
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And this.

674
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
The so-called technical standards.

675
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Of course.

676
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The price is so high.

677
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's reasonable.

678
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So, of course, it's not reasonable.

679
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
This is.

680
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Uh, the industry's problem.

681
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So, today.

682
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The problem is on this rebate.

683
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So, today, I'm going to tell you a little bit about it.

684
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That is to say.

685
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The point I focused on today.

686
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's also this paper.

687
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Me and that.

688
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The focus of the study with the classmate is.

689
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Why Qualcomm, he will.

690
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So insistent on providing rebate.

691
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
This thing.

692
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
OK.

693
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

694
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Uh.

695
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll pause it again.

696
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
See if you have any understanding of this case.

697
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hey.

698
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Do you understand the story I just told you?

699
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Because I don't know if you understand this story.

700
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Content.

701
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Hello.

702
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Do you understand?

703
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
This story.

704
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
OK.

705
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
All right.

706
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I think if I didn't listen.

707
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Uh, listen.

708
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Does anyone not understand?

709
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's what I should say.

710
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't understand which link.

711
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
OK.

712
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If you don't understand.

713
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Can you tell me which link you don't understand?

714
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Because he's a little bit complicated about this thing.

715
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Because I.

716
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Uh.

717
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
This thing involves my graduation thesis.

718
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So, he.

719
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Some small and complex.

720
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Some of the details of the industry's content.

721
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Let's see if you have any.

722
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Which side I just said a little bit.

723
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I don't understand.

724
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Is there?

725
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Good.

726
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
54321.

727
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Good.

728
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Just pretend.

729
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Just pretend you understand.

730
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Good.

731
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Good.

732
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
OK.

733
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Good.

734
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No one.

735
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
There is a response.

736
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OK.

737
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Just pretend to understand.

738
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Good.

739
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
On the basis of this posture.

740
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
We know.

741
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The love-hate relationship between Apple and Qualcomm.

742
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It's just like this.

743
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It was sued like this last year.

744
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That.

745
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
This.

746
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
For me.

747
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
At the beginning of this paper.

748
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
First.

749
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Uh.

750
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
He is a.

751
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Uh.

752
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The cross-section is a cross-domain.

753
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But the cooperation paper is like this.

754
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
What I'm in charge of is the legal analysis.

755
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Then my partner is.

756
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Responsible for the study.

757
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Game theory model.

758
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The introduction.

759
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And then.

760
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And from a commercial perspective.

761
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And.

762
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Uh.

763
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Economic perspective.

764
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
To analyze this whole thing.

765
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The first is.

766
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Everyone is already curious.

767
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But from my point of view.

768
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Is there a similar case in the past?

769
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Or in this kind of debate.

770
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The case.

771
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
How did they judge?

772
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Or what is the result of their judgment?

773
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Then I will report to you.

774
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Just.

775
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Simply put.

776
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's this thing.

777
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This problem.

778
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Even the court itself.

779
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's hard to get it done.

780
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
OK.

781
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That.

782
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Uh.

783
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The picture.

784
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What you see on the screen.

785
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The red part.

786
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Uh.

787
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Represents.

788
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
The court is.

789
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Uh.

790
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The red part right.

791
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The page.

792
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
These.

793
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
This red case is the court.

794
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Sentence.

795
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The defendant is like.

796
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Uh.

797
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This kind of company like Gaotong is illegal.

798
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
OK.

799
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The black part is that I don't have a label.

800
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I don't.

801
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
These cases in the black part.

802
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Is.

803
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The court believes.

804
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is.

805
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Legally.

806
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's like this.

807
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It's called.

808
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You have to accept this.

809
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
If you want to use.

810
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
As if Gaotong.

811
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
The state of Gaotong I just talked about.

812
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Is that if you want to use.

813
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Use my.

814
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Things you want.

815
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Uh.

816
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Become my supplier.

817
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Can.

818
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Uh.

819
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Or I'm going to supply you with good stuff.

820
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But you have to accept my conditions.

821
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Or I.

822
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Uh.

823
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You can buy it.

824
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But I.

825
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You have to buy a certain amount.

826
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Okay.

827
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
After buying a certain amount.

828
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'll give you a rebate.

829
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's a concept like this.

830
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's like this.

831
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
A transaction mode like this.

832
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's it.

833
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
These six cases.

834
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I sorted it out.

835
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
That's because everyone is not legal.

836
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
OK.

837
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That.

838
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I won't say it one by one.

839
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Ah.

840
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's actually the result.

841
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
His.

842
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The result is analyzed.

843
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The reason is also analyzed.

844
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That.

845
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Three red dots are.

846
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
These are the different courts.

847
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
For.

848
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
These cases.

849
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The reason for the use.

850
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So, as you can see.

851
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
A very special phenomenon is.

852
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Hey.

853
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
On the subject of this rebate.

854
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Or say this kind of bundle rebate.

855
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Different courts have different reasons.

856
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
OK.

857
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Also different results.

858
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
OK.

859
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
That.

860
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'll talk about it later.

861
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That is, Qualcomm actually used this point.

862
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Ah.

863
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's not a use.

864
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That is to say, he should.

865
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Maybe he saw this point.

866
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
We infer.

867
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
He saw this point.

868
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It may also become his.

869
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This.

870
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
To continue to use.

871
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
His bundle rebate.

872
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
To Apple.

873
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
OK.

874
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
This is a.

875
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Our inference.

876
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll mention it later.

877
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
This is my preliminary investigation.

878
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Found that.

879
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Ah.

880
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
If the defendant.

881
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The black one.

882
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The red case is illegal.

883
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The black case is legal.

884
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Then I'll see.

885
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That red case.

886
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What is illegal?

887
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Common features.

888
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
The first.

889
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Those illegal cases.

890
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
The red part.

891
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I just showed you.

892
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
The red part.

893
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
These defendants.

894
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
In fact, all.

895
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Ah.

896
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Have some.

897
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Market monopoly.

898
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So.

899
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
If you are a.

900
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Market monopoly.

901
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Easy.

902
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
If you are a monopolist.

903
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It may be easy to violate.

904
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Antitrust law.

905
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Ah.

906
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
This is in our.

907
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Ah.

908
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
If you learn this in our law school.

909
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Antitrust law.

910
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Basically, this.

911
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
This.

912
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
This is a high probability.

913
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
If you have this market.

914
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If the monopoly is basically easy.

915
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
This antitrust law.

916
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
This is.

917
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Ah.

918
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This is normal.

919
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
OK.

920
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Then in this bundle.

921
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
In the context of the rebate.

922
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It is also.

923
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's not an exception.

924
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But we have seen.

925
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The second point is very interesting.

926
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
We see the legal.

927
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We compare these legal cases.

928
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Ah.

929
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's the black one.

930
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
In those cases.

931
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We found that.

932
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The defendant is actually still possible.

933
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Is legal.

934
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Why?

935
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Because imagine.

936
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Today.

937
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
He's in front of him.

938
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Uh.

939
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That's what I just said.

940
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
In these black cases.

941
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
He has some.

942
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Ah.

943
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
These judges.

944
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Why?

945
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
In the same situation.

946
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I think they are legal.

947
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Because they don't have it at all.

948
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Eliminate the effect.

949
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
OK.

950
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
In general.

951
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's make it simple.

952
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Is.

953
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Anti-tax law is actually in the regulation.

954
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Is a law of corporate behavior.

955
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
OK.

956
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It is the law of market economy and corporate behavior.

957
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So.

958
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That.

959
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The market economy must maintain a competitive attitude.

960
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Instead of letting a person.

961
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Independent or say.

962
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Present a state of monopoly.

963
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But imagine.

964
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
If he was originally today.

965
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Although he is a.

966
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Through.

967
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Uh.

968
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
His sales behavior.

969
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And then his innovative business model.

970
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Achieve his.

971
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The leadership position of the market.

972
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But it's not monopoly.

973
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Leadership position.

974
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Then he wants to continue.

975
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The.

976
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
When increasing his market share.

977
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
He might let.

978
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Some other competitors.

979
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Uh.

980
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Some may have progress barriers.

981
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Or what is the situation.

982
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
His elimination effect.

983
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
He might make some.

984
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
For example, killing competition or something.

985
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
His.

986
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
He might let some other competitors.

987
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
He can't come in.

988
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Or potential competitors.

989
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
For example, like I just mentioned.

990
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Intel.

991
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Intel in the so-called.

992
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
This.

993
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Computer CPU.

994
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Everyone should know.

995
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's all done very well.

996
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Ah.

997
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
This kind of patent.

998
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The patent series are all very strong.

999
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And then with this Microsoft.

1000
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
In the late 90s.

1001
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's almost.

1002
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
This is.

1003
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's almost all computers.

1004
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But.

1005
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
He's in that communication chip.

1006
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
He just can't stand still.

1007
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
He just doesn't have the so-called.

1008
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
This status.

1009
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That today.

1010
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Uh.

1011
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
He's coming in today.

1012
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But in fact.

1013
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
He's coming in.

1014
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
He just needs to invest enough money.

1015
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
In fact.

1016
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
In fact, he is also doing it.

1017
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Just keep doing bad.

1018
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
OK.

1019
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But it's not that he can't do it.

1020
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Ah.

1021
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
There's a difference.

1022
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That is to say.

1023
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Let me talk about it again.

1024
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
There's a difference.

1025
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's the so-called can't do it.

1026
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That is to say, I.

1027
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I took advantage of some commercial behavior.

1028
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
For example, I.

1029
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I join all the people.

1030
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I don't provide you with the material.

1031
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You can't do it.

1032
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But this doesn't work.

1033
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Ah.

1034
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
This must be against.

1035
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
This antitrust law.

1036
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Because this is against this.

1037
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
This market competition.

1038
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The situation.

1039
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So now the situation is.

1040
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Hey.

1041
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
We.

1042
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Observe the previous few black cases.

1043
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We found that.

1044
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Why are those cases legal?

1045
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Because of those potential intruders.

1046
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
He wasn't excluded.

1047
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Enter this market.

1048
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
He can still enter this market.

1049
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Competition.

1050
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It means that his entry barrier is low.

1051
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
If the entry barrier is low.

1052
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
The court sees that the entry barrier is low.

1053
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That's just to say.

1054
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You might come in today.

1055
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It's just that you chose not to come in.

1056
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Or you.

1057
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Maybe you have other commercial considerations.

1058
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Instead of coming in.

1059
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So.

1060
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Before this.

1061
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Before.

1062
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Let me go back again.

1063
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Before.

1064
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Before.

1065
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Before.

1066
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Before.

1067
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Before.

1068
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Before.

1069
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Before.

1070
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Before.

1071
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Before.

1072
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Before.

1073
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Why are these black cases from before legal?

1074
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Why are these Bando Rebellion legal?

1075
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Because.

1076
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Other competitors.

1077
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
He.

1078
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It is not excluded.

1079
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It still came in.

1080
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It still joined this industry.

1081
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Continuing with.

1082
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
These defendants are in competition.

1083
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Let's say the defendant is Gaoton.

1084
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It is still.

1085
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Still come in this industry to compete.

1086
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's like what we're talking about today.

1087
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
The case of Gaotong is not the only one.

1088
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Provide a modern chip.

1089
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Samsung also has.

1090
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Huawei also has.

1091
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
OK, so it becomes.

1092
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's me.

1093
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
To provide a chip.

1094
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So.

1095
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Look at my phone.

1096
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You see.

1097
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I have a mobile phone.

1098
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm on his mobile phone.

1099
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So.

1100
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It becomes.

1101
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
In this case.

1102
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
In fact, there is a bit of a swing.

1103
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
If you listen to me.

1104
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You know what I mean.

1105
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Although Gaotong.

1106
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
He is in this market.

1107
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Based on monopoly status.

1108
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Based on this leadership status.

1109
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Then maybe.

1110
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
There are some monopolies in sales.

1111
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Power.

1112
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Because his product quality is good.

1113
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But.

1114
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Other people are still in it.

1115
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Right.

1116
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Other players are also in it.

1117
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Other manufacturers are also in it.

1118
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So.

1119
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
If you follow this.

1120
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The logic of the black case.

1121
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Then he might be illegal.

1122
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But according to the logic of the black case.

1123
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Then he might be illegal.

1124
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But according to the logic of the black case.

1125
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Then he might be illegal.

1126
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Then he might be illegal.

1127
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
OK.

1128
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So on this matter.

1129
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
In fact.

1130
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
why.

1131
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Let me tell you.

1132
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Why Taiwan.

1133
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I personally think.

1134
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Why Taiwan.

1135
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Can't judge Gaotong so soon.

1136
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Illegal.

1137
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The reason is actually here.

1138
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
The reason is actually here.

1139
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'll share it with you.

1140
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I don't know if it's good to say that.

1141
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I don't know if it's good to say that.

1142
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
But I personally think.

1143
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
It is worth thinking about.

1144
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
OK.

1145
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Every country has probably different.

1146
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
OK.

1147
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Every country has probably different.

1148
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But I personally think.

1149
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Whether Gaotong is really illegal.

1150
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Whether Gaotong is really illegal.

1151
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Then you are like this.

1152
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
A.

1153
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
A law is going on.

1154
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Will you be influenced.

1155
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Other manufacturers are against this matter.

1156
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Other manufacturers are against this matter.

1157
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I think there are casualties.

1158
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I think there are casualties.

1159
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
OK.

1160
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Since there are so many people in this business.

1161
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
OK.

1162
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Since there are so many people in this industry.

1163
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Why is he being punished?

1164
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Why is he being punished?

1165
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You have to give a fair reason.

1166
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You have to give a fair reason.

1167
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
The United States is a public debate country.

1168
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The United States is a public debate country.

1169
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So this thing no longer judged.

1170
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So this thing no longer judged.

1171
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So that's it for now.

1172
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So that's it for now.

1173
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So.

1174
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So.

1175
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The conclusion of this paper.

1176
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Is here, in this study.

1177
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And then there's a question in the paper.

1178
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
That is the question in the paper.

1179
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The question is about why bottled readers continue to act on it.

1180
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The question is about why bottled readers continue to act on it.

1181
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Regardless of this green act.

1182
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Regardless of this green act.

1183
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Regardless of this green act.

1184
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.

1185
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.

1186
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Regardless of this green act which has already fallen.

1187
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Regardless of this green act which has already fallen.

1188
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.

1189
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
After the model reads off,

1190
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
After the model reads off,

1191
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
we see some things in the model that we are spurred on.

1192
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
we see some things in the model that we are spurred on.

1193
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
We see some things in the model that we are spurred on.

1194
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.

1195
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.

1196
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.

1197
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
This is the case this model is one of the things.

1198
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And then from the business perspective.

1199
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and a law perspective

1200
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
This is the case this model is one of the things.

1201
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Watching these things.

1202
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Then this is what we're doing.

1203
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
One of the steps for how this paper answers the question.

1204
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
One of the steps for how this paper answer the question.

1205
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Do you have any thoughts or questions?

1206
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Do you have any thoughts or questions?

1207
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yes.

1208
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
MRI is not in the scope of modem.

1209
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,900
MRI is not in the scope of modem.

1210
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,600
No blueprint is in the appraiser system

1211
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,140
and has the blueprint design in a presupedit

1212
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,700
and has the blueprint design in a prespedit

1213
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
This is a bit complicated,

1214
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
I believe if you're in engineering school,

1215
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I believe if you're in engineering school,

1216
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,200
the math will be better than mine.

1217
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,940
I just briefly talk about math

1218
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:37,280
I just briefly talk about math

1219
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,320
The story that we just heard

1220
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,320
The story that we just heard

1221
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,320
After hearing our story,

1222
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
let's talk about assuming these mathematical models.

1223
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,620
Let's talk about assuming these mathematical models.

1224
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,900
First, for the game in the promotion theory,

1225
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,140
First, for the game in the promotion theory,

1226
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,440
we have three different games we play,

1227
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,280
we have three different games we play,

1228
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,280
One is One Stage Game

1229
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,940
One is One Stage Game

1230
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,660
is divided into the Exhaustive and Non-exhaustive.

1231
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,940
OK

1232
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,080
About Exhaustive, let me explain to you.

1233
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,920
Just like the FRIEND I mentioned just now,

1234
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,200
Just like the FRIEND I mentioned just now,

1235
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,080
there is a so-called price issue.

1236
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,760
Then why is there a FRIEND

1237
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,620
What do you think is reasonable?

1238
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,020
What do I think is unreasonable?

1239
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,020
In fact, one of them is the amount

1240
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,420
and the scope of authorization.

1241
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,740
Apple thinks that

1242
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,980
you sell me ModernChip today.

1243
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,700
OK, you provide me with ModernChip.

1244
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,020
The price of the sales

1245
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,860
should include the price of the patent.

1246
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,380
OK, this is a bit tricky.

1247
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,900
Let me say it again.

1248
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,840
Apple will think that

1249
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,520
you provide me with ModernChip today.

1250
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,440
OK, this is a price.

1251
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,440
Let's say it's $100.

1252
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,600
But it's not that cheap, $100.

1253
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,040
OK, maybe this $100

1254
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,240
already includes the price of the patent.

1255
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,000
OK, so when you sell it to me,

1256
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,600
there is a basic concept in the patent law.

1257
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
I simply emphasize this.

1258
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,880
You don't have to go into detail.

1259
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,000
There is a concept in the patent law.

1260
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,400
Once my patent is included in my product,

1261
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,300
it will be sold together.

1262
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,180
If this thing is bought by someone else,

1263
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,180
for example, I have already paid once for Apple.

1264
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,580
Do I have to pay again?

1265
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,700
No.

1266
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,140
Because Apple has already paid once.

1267
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,700
It has already sold me the patent.

1268
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,780
It has already sold me the price of ModernChip.

1269
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,860
So why do I have to pay again?

1270
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,220
Right?

1271
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,220
Of course not.

1272
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,500
So of course the core concept is

1273
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,760
The core concept of Exaustive is that

1274
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,760
there will be such a dispute because

1275
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,520
Apple thinks that when Qualcomm provides ModernChip to me,

1276
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,200
it already includes the price of all patents.

1277
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,320
You shouldn't add another patent price

1278
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,000
and raise it so high.

1279
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,080
OK.

1280
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,320
Qualcomm, of course, thinks no.

1281
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,720
I authorize you

1282
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,240
or I sell you ModernChip.

1283
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,600
The patent I include is only a small part of my patent combination.

1284
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,440
There are many patents.

1285
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,980
You didn't use it.

1286
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,620
So you have to pay extra.

1287
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,820
Everyone should understand this.

1288
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,860
Why do we design Exaustive and Non-Exaustive?

1289
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,900
The reason is here.

1290
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,260
Because this involves the business itself.

1291
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,140
Now in this industry,

1292
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,900
some of its game rules are played like this.

1293
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,100
Right?

1294
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:33,620
Because I originally supplied ModernChip to you.

1295
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,460
It should include all prices,

1296
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,100
including patent prices.

1297
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,380
This is Apple's idea.

1298
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,080
But Qualcomm doesn't think so.

1299
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,960
Qualcomm thinks that I only give you a part.

1300
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,760
There are many things you don't know.

1301
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,520
So you have to pay more.

1302
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,720
This is why I just said

1303
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,520
Qualcomm's so-called No License, No Chip is reasonable.

1304
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,000
Why does it dare to talk about this condition?

1305
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,240
Because it dares to say

1306
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,440
even if I supply ModernChip to you today,

1307
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,000
I still have other patents that you haven't used.

1308
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,280
So you have to pay more.

1309
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,360
Otherwise, it's gone.

1310
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:05,640
OK.

1311
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,120
This is the so-called One Stage Non-Exhaustive.

1312
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,140
Non-exhaustive is like a game.

1313
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,660
Exhaustive contract game

1314
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,580
is based on Apple's point of view.

1315
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,020
Non-exhaustive is based on Qualcomm's point of view.

1316
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,620
And then we go to the two-stage game.

1317
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,300
This is interesting.

1318
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,700
We go to the two-stage step

1319
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,020
to run this model,

1320
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,420
this Game Theory model.

1321
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,260
In Exhaustive Game,

1322
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,620
as we just mentioned,

1323
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,760
that is to say,

1324
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,400
because Apple thinks

1325
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,200
you give me ModernChip,

1326
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,040
it includes all patents.

1327
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,440
OK.

1328
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,760
Because it includes all patents.

1329
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,920
So

1330
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,040
the way it calculates

1331
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,240
is the percentage of each chip.

1332
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:53,880
That's it.

1333
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,840
Non-exhaustive,

1334
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,000
that may be because Qualcomm thinks

1335
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,600
the patents in ModernChip are just a part of me.

1336
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,320
OK.

1337
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,520
So I have many other patents

1338
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,460
that haven't been given to you yet.

1339
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,980
So the money I added

1340
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,900
is for the whole technology.

1341
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,020
This is what Qualcomm said.

1342
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,620
Qualcomm is very ambitious.

1343
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,580
He said that my patent

1344
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,220
laid out all the technical standards.

1345
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,220
So what does he think?

1346
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,260
What does he think Apple has to pay for?

1347
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,060
The basis for Apple to pay for money

1348
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,740
is the entire market value,

1349
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,380
the value of the entire market,

1350
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,740
not just the chip.

1351
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,020
OK.

1352
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,420
So this model

1353
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,720
is based on the price.

1354
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,640
The basic foundation of the price calculation method

1355
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,680
is different.

1356
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,200
OK.

1357
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,320
In this exhaustive,

1358
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,120
Apple's point of view

1359
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,520
is that the price of patents

1360
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,800
is calculated according to the percentage of each chip I sell.

1361
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,880
But Qualcomm thinks it's wrong.

1362
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,120
It should be calculated at the price of the entire market.

1363
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:58,640
OK.

1364
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:58,800
OK.

1365
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,560
This is the calculation price of our two different games.

1366
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,740
The price of the patent is different.

1367
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,180
What about the two-stage game?

1368
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:09,940
Intel,

1369
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,700
we assume that

1370
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,820
because Intel is a...

1371
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,940
Although we just mentioned that

1372
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,260
Intel is not a very good player

1373
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,860
in the modern chip industry.

1374
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,740
But it was mentioned in Qualcomm's petition.

1375
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,100
It's a funny point.

1376
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,140
Qualcomm's petition said

1377
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,700
I don't know if you remember

1378
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,820
that in 2016 or 2017,

1379
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,620
in 2015, 2016, and 2017,

1380
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,360
I forgot which year the iPhone 7 was launched.

1381
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:33,560
OK.

1382
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,560
In the past few years,

1383
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,440
Apple has done so-called recycling in the iPhone 7.

1384
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,920
They took the machine back.

1385
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,960
One of the reasons is that there are some

1386
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,920
problems with the quality of communication.

1387
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,400
Then it is said that

1388
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,440
this is what Qualcomm wrote in his petition.

1389
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,280
It is said that

1390
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,920
it is because Apple violated the contract.

1391
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,680
It violated the contract.

1392
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,920
It went to Intel

1393
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,160
to use Intel's modern chip.

1394
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,440
As a result, Intel's quality was not as good as Qualcomm's.

1395
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,100
So it led to some of these mobile phones,

1396
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,620
not all of them,

1397
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,740
some of the mobile phones with Intel's

1398
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,900
modern chip

1399
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,020
had poor quality of communication.

1400
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,100
It was bad.

1401
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,300
Then it caused some customers to be unhappy.

1402
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,860
So it was required to withdraw.

1403
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,300
It was really withdrawn.

1404
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:20,580
OK.

1405
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,060
So under such a fact,

1406
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,460
let's assume that

1407
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,560
in the future, is it possible for Intel to

1408
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,640
change its modern chip quality?

1409
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,120
Assuming that Intel,

1410
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,800
we assume that

1411
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,120
this is an assumption.

1412
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,320
Assuming that Intel

1413
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,200
at a certain point in the future,

1414
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,720
its product quality

1415
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,720
becomes very close to Qualcomm.

1416
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,200
OK.

1417
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,880
Then how will this game play?

1418
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,000
What will happen in the market?

1419
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,720
Will Apple accept

1420
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,600
this bundle rebate we just talked about?

1421
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,980
And Qualcomm,

1422
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,020
our most important role,

1423
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,300
does it have a reason to provide this rebate?

1424
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:00,580
OK.

1425
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,740
This is our basic game.

1426
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,180
Then,

1427
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,220
this

1428
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,300
mathematical model,

1429
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,460
in fact, we have a few assumptions.

1430
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,140
In fact, they are all based on the story we just heard.

1431
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,060
So in fact,

1432
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,780
they are all quite intuitive.

1433
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,060
OK.

1434
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,100
First, we assume that Qualcomm is a

1435
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,060
very

1436
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,820
high-quality in the market.

1437
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,900
Provided to

1438
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,460
and higher than Intel

1439
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,180
in the first stage.

1440
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,440
Everyone should be able to understand this.

1441
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:25,800
OK.

1442
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,280
And it has been like this in recent years.

1443
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:28,640
OK.

1444
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,960
And these manufacturers,

1445
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,160
that is, Apple,

1446
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,880
Apple and Qualcomm,

1447
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,360
are actually a

1448
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:41,440
measurement standard for their companies.

1449
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:41,840
That is to say,

1450
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,320
I want to get the maximum profit.

1451
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,160
I think everyone should be able to understand this.

1452
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:47,400
OK.

1453
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,520
Third,

1454
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,200
that is to say,

1455
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,920
the game we play is a bit like

1456
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,260
Apple is a follower.

1457
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,740
Because Apple does not produce the so-called modern chip,

1458
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,580
it does not make the modern chip.

1459
01:01:59,580 --> 01:01:59,860
OK.

1460
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:02,580
So it's a bit like

1461
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,340
this game is

1462
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,220
the first Qualcomm,

1463
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,420
it provides a contract

1464
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,180
clause,

1465
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,260
which includes the bundle rebate.

1466
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,100
OK.

1467
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:10,300
OK.

1468
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,260
Then Apple only has two options,

1469
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,260
accept or not.

1470
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,580
That's it.

1471
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:14,940
OK.

1472
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,220
So the game we play is like this.

1473
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,660
Apple accepts or not.

1474
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:17,860
OK.

1475
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,220
If you accept it,

1476
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,460
for Qualcomm,

1477
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,180
what is its profit?

1478
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,320
Then what is Apple's profit?

1479
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,400
If you don't accept it,

1480
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,920
how does Qualcomm's profit change?

1481
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,840
How does Apple's profit change?

1482
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,160
OK.

1483
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,640
So we use this pie

1484
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,400
to denote the entire profit.

1485
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,720
Then A, Q, and I are these players.

1486
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,000
OK.

1487
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,120
A is Apple,

1488
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,520
Q is Qualcomm,

1489
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,720
and I is Intel.

1490
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,720
OK.

1491
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:42,960
OK.

1492
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,320
Then a few numbers.

1493
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,920
In fact,

1494
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,080
I will simply report to you.

1495
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,600
It's a bit boring here.

1496
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:50,820
OK.

1497
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,340
That's just an assumption for everyone.

1498
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,140
Then this is Q.

1499
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,740
Q is this.

1500
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,460
Qualcomm's quality.

1501
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,020
Uh, yes.

1502
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,940
Qualcomm's

1503
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,860
Qualcomm chip quality.

1504
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,300
Then CQ like this.

1505
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,860
You can just look at it like this.

1506
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,780
In fact,

1507
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,180
the main thing is to explain to you that

1508
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,660
we set these functions.

1509
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,500
Then it also includes its demand function.

1510
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,260
Demand function,

1511
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,780
then its value,

1512
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,100
that is to say,

1513
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,860
we don't want it to be low.

1514
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,420
You can know that

1515
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,460
the demand function we set here

1516
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,280
is D equals A minus BP plus Gamma Q.

1517
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:22,600
OK.

1518
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,840
Then we have to let this

1519
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,160
A must be greater than or equal to zero.

1520
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:27,520
OK.

1521
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,840
So it's actually its demand function.

1522
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,640
Then its price and quality.

1523
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:32,880
OK.

1524
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,360
Then I set it to avoid this model.

1525
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:35,840
It's complicated.

1526
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,000
We must be greater than or equal to D.

1527
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,360
So A must be greater than or equal to the thing behind it.

1528
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,320
It must be A.

1529
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,200
Because A minus the back.

1530
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:42,680
OK.

1531
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,880
A, we set a market size here.

1532
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,320
Then you can think about it.

1533
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,920
Just be intuitive.

1534
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,320
That is to say,

1535
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,140
if A is the market size.

1536
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,940
Because you have three players today.

1537
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,020
So your market size must be greater than the two behind it.

1538
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,900
Apple and Qualcomm.

1539
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,460
Apple and Intel.

1540
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,180
And Qualcomm and Intel.

1541
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,220
The whole market share.

1542
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:06,260
The market share.

1543
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,820
And then what.

1544
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:09,340
OK.

1545
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,580
So simply put,

1546
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,140
that is to say,

1547
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,980
we set D to be greater than or equal to zero.

1548
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,300
Simply put, that's it.

1549
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:16,580
OK.

1550
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,100
So you see,

1551
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,720
so that's Maxima.

1552
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,720
And then BCQ.

1553
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,800
And then minus Gamma.

1554
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,080
And then this BC1 minus Q1.

1555
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,600
So the front is Qualcomm.

1556
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,000
The back is Intel.

1557
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,560
OK.

1558
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,080
So it must be greater than this.

1559
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,680
OK.

1560
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,200
And then we set this contract.

1561
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,000
OK.

1562
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,200
Then WQ, we set it to be a cheap price.

1563
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,560
OK.

1564
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,600
Then Alpha, we set it to be a royalty percentage.

1565
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,000
What's fun about us is that Alpha,

1566
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,980
it's set to this.

1567
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:50,260
Uh, we just said it was the condition of the front.

1568
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,540
So it has an interval,

1569
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,220
which means it's between 0 and 1.

1570
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,060
OK.

1571
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:55,580
OK.

1572
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,500
So W is his cheap side.

1573
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,220
I think this is basically what it is.

1574
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,940
So we just denote.

1575
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,180
OK.

1576
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,380
So we just,

1577
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,180
you might also mention,

1578
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:06,460
that is to say,

1579
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:08,140
what is that rebate?

1580
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,420
We will provide a rebate.

1581
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,340
That rebate is to provide a Gamma.

1582
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,380
Because it's a rebate.

1583
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,700
Why is it so fast to choose this Gamma?

1584
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,760
Because it's from,

1585
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,680
it's a fixed amount.

1586
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:17,960
That is to say,

1587
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,280
it's from the whole sale,

1588
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,560
from this WQ or WI.

1589
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,240
WQ is this Qualcomm chip.

1590
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,000
WI is Intel's chip.

1591
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,360
Because it's from this whole chip,

1592
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,040
the total sales,

1593
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,400
the total sales,

1594
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,680
to be deducted.

1595
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,360
So,

1596
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,360
this is also in line with the reality.

1597
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,400
Because the reality of this rebate,

1598
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:38,880
uh,

1599
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,120
the situation is also from this overall sales number,

1600
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,840
and then the total,

1601
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:43,500
and then to,

1602
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,700
to provide you,

1603
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,860
and then deduct a number.

1604
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,980
Then this number is deducted from the total.

1605
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,780
So we just set it to Gamma.

1606
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,780
OK.

1607
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,060
Uh,

1608
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:52,860
it should be R.

1609
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,340
R.

1610
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:53,620
OK.

1611
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:54,500
Set it to R,

1612
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,300
like this.

1613
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:55,860
OK.

1614
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,060
OK.

1615
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:56,660
So,

1616
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,460
uh,

1617
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,220
this is my good friend,

1618
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,380
my other partner's conclusion.

1619
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,340
Then I'll just show you,

1620
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,500
appreciate the beauty of this math.

1621
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,580
Because I really can't do this.

1622
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,380
OK.

1623
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:08,940
OK.

1624
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:10,460
So,

1625
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,500
actually, I'll tell you about it.

1626
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,080
The result of our run.

1627
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:13,320
OK.

1628
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,960
Let's stop for a moment.

1629
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,920
I think there should be no problem here.

1630
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,600
I think everyone should,

1631
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,720
I hope everyone is still awake.

1632
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:20,960
OK.

1633
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,520
It's just a mathematical model.

1634
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:22,840
OK.

1635
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,080
That's it.

1636
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,800
The main thing is to know how to play our game.

1637
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,160
I think everyone knows,

1638
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:29,400
that is,

1639
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,680
how our Game Theory model is set.

1640
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,720
OK.

1641
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,920
OK.

1642
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,240
I think there should be no problem.

1643
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,320
OK.

1644
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,660
No problem.

1645
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:43,100
Ah,

1646
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,020
I don't understand Game Theory at all.

1647
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:46,740
Crying.

1648
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,220
Actually,

1649
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:47,980
no,

1650
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:48,820
Game Theory is,

1651
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,100
you know,

1652
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,340
everyone actually understands Game Theory.

1653
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,020
Don't be too complicated.

1654
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,140
Game Theory is actually a math.

1655
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:54,540
So you can actually see it.

1656
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,060
In fact,

1657
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:56,380
it's actually a,

1658
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:56,860
uh,

1659
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,180
application of math.

1660
01:06:59,180 --> 01:06:59,500
OK.

1661
01:06:59,500 --> 01:06:59,700
So,

1662
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,020
in fact,

1663
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,500
it's not that much.

1664
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,260
I think it's quite intuitive.

1665
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,140
But I just,

1666
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,180
that is to say,

1667
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:06,580
I think,

1668
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,380
I hope I can make it clear to everyone.

1669
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,140
Because,

1670
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:10,780
to be honest,

1671
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,800
because of this PowerPoint,

1672
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:14,400
I have to tell other people in the legal department.

1673
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,800
The other people in the legal department,

1674
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,200
they are completely less sensitive to math.

1675
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,160
So I have to make it extremely simple.

1676
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:23,840
OK.

1677
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,720
If everyone,

1678
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,240
if it's a little difficult to listen to,

1679
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,920
maybe I have to review it.

1680
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,200
OK.

1681
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:28,760
Simply put,

1682
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,400
how to play this game?

1683
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,280
In fact,

1684
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:31,560
anyway,

1685
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,560
it's Qualcomm.

1686
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,000
I provide a contract.

1687
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,960
OK.

1688
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,880
Provide this contract.

1689
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,000
Then it has a rebate based on a certain price.

1690
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,820
And then this rebate,

1691
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,540
sorry,

1692
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,220
this rebate is a fixed amount.

1693
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:45,540
Like this,

1694
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,340
and then this amount,

1695
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,740
and then see if Apple wants to accept it.

1696
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:49,020
Like this,

1697
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,700
and then we look at the response of Intel.

1698
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,540
Let's look at the response of Apple.

1699
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,100
And then their profit maximization.

1700
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,380
And then what is the two-stage?

1701
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,500
Two-stage is good.

1702
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,220
Assuming that Intel is at a certain time point in the future.

1703
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,860
Its quality has risen to the same as Qualcomm.

1704
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:02,100
Okay,

1705
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,500
so let's look at that.

1706
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:03,860
Today,

1707
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,980
Apple provides this rebate.

1708
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,340
What is the change in its profit?

1709
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,420
What is the change in profit?

1710
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,640
What is the change in Apple's profit?

1711
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,400
What is the impact of Intel on this whole thing?

1712
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:12,880
OK,

1713
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,680
so the simple game is like this.

1714
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,000
OK.

1715
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,280
Okay,

1716
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,400
so what?

1717
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:17,640
In fact,

1718
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,760
the result we came up with at the end was that we found that it was fun.

1719
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,480
It's one-stage game.

1720
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,640
It's the so-called one-stage game.

1721
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,240
I just said that Qualcomm provides this bundle rebate.

1722
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:27,720
Okay,

1723
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,920
Apple accepts it or not.

1724
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,920
That's it.

1725
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,840
And then he set his quality to be much higher than Intel.

1726
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,360
Simply put,

1727
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,080
that's it.

1728
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:35,240
Okay,

1729
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,680
so you'll find that Qualcomm is actually intuitive.

1730
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:38,820
It's actually very easy to look at.

1731
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,500
Why?

1732
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,540
Just like I just said,

1733
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,380
Qualcomm is a market monopoly.

1734
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,820
No one has a better quality than him.

1735
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,420
Why does he provide rebate?

1736
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,100
It doesn't make sense.

1737
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:48,420
Why?

1738
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,500
Because he doesn't allow it at all.

1739
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,460
Because what does it mean to provide rebate?

1740
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,780
It means that he can't maximize the profit.

1741
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,020
Right?

1742
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,100
He provides an amount to Apple.

1743
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:57,860
What is he doing?

1744
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:58,380
Right?

1745
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,940
Because I don't provide it anyway.

1746
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:01,100
Apple has to pay for it.

1747
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,020
Yeah,

1748
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,420
so Apple has to pay for it.

1749
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,820
So why do I provide rebate to Apple?

1750
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,680
I just maximize the profit.

1751
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,520
So at the first stage,

1752
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,640
the results of the model we made showed that

1753
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,920
this is not necessary.

1754
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,680
Boundary rebate is not necessary.

1755
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,240
Okay,

1756
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:24,080
so non-exhaustive actually didn't change much.

1757
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,640
That's just because of this.

1758
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,080
Because Alpha is still in this range.

1759
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,480
So Alpha,

1760
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:27,920
I just said,

1761
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,040
it's the range of this Royalty.

1762
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,760
It hasn't changed.

1763
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:30,960
Okay,

1764
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,200
so no matter what you do today,

1765
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:32,640
this Alpha,

1766
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,640
you calculate the entire market value.

1767
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,700
It's the entire market value.

1768
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,980
It's still just modern chip.

1769
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,380
It doesn't actually affect high-speed communication.

1770
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,660
Why?

1771
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,460
High-speed communication still feels like I'm a market monopoly.

1772
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,700
Why do I provide a rebate?

1773
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,660
And then it affects my profit maximization.

1774
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,820
So one stage,

1775
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,460
and then non-exhaustive game is the same.

1776
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,260
It's from a high-speed point of view.

1777
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,460
He doesn't need to provide rebate to Apple at all.

1778
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,340
But it's fun.

1779
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,380
That's the third one.

1780
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:02,860
We found that from two-stage game,

1781
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,180
we found that Intel's quality has risen.

1782
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:06,420
Okay,

1783
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,240
but he's starting to have conditions.

1784
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:08,880
That is to say,

1785
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,360
it was not necessary before.

1786
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,720
Then we went to two-stage game.

1787
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,120
We found that this quality.

1788
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:16,000
This quality,

1789
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,560
when Intel's quality is close to high-speed communication,

1790
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,160
we found that,

1791
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:19,840
hey,

1792
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,680
high-speed communication to some extent,

1793
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,040
he has to provide rebate to Apple.

1794
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:26,840
Oh,

1795
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,280
okay,

1796
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,040
that's it.

1797
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:28,800
This is the red line.

1798
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,760
This is the condition that we came up with mathematically.

1799
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,840
That's the MQ.

1800
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,880
That's bigger than this.

1801
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:34,400
Okay,

1802
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:38,300
so we found that the appearance of mathematics.

1803
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:38,620
That is to say,

1804
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:43,820
he has a condition that he has to provide rebate to Apple.

1805
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,180
Otherwise,

1806
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,540
he can't maximize the profit.

1807
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:46,700
Okay,

1808
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,660
that's the problem.

1809
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:49,900
Okay,

1810
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,060
that's the problem.

1811
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,020
Why is there a condition?

1812
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:54,180
Okay,

1813
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:57,300
what about the business behind this condition?

1814
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,940
What is the commercial consideration?

1815
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:00,700
Okay,

1816
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,420
so we thought about it.

1817
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,320
We thought about it a lot.

1818
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:05,960
Okay,

1819
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,680
then we will find that,

1820
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,120
the first.

1821
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,680
In the two-stage game,

1822
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,360
we found that,

1823
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:17,080
if we assume that this cost of Intel,

1824
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,440
uh,

1825
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,200
not the cost,

1826
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:18,680
wrong,

1827
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,760
this quality,

1828
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,880
the quality of modern chip is very close to high-speed communication.

1829
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,240
If he is very close,

1830
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,400
it means that Apple's,

1831
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,280
this one plus one is high.

1832
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,040
Apple's one plus one is high for high-speed communication.

1833
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,160
This should be easy for everyone to think about.

1834
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:32,640
Because why?

1835
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,420
Because Apple has a choice.

1836
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,540
I said I would choose Intel.

1837
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:38,220
If you still provide that price,

1838
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,060
I don't need your modern chip.

1839
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,660
So in this case,

1840
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,940
if everyone's quality is very close,

1841
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,260
there will be a so-called price war.

1842
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,540
I think this should be easier for everyone to understand.

1843
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,620
When the price war occurs,

1844
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,140
it will cause profit loss.

1845
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,740
So in this inference,

1846
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,340
we,

1847
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,060
we boldly infer that,

1848
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,860
why is there this red condition in front of it?

1849
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,540
Why is this rebate produced?

1850
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:02,260
This R is produced.

1851
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,720
Why is there such a change in the two-stage game?

1852
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,840
Because the one-stage does not need it in the front.

1853
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,800
Why do you want two-stage?

1854
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,320
The reason is because we infer that,

1855
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,560
high-speed communication,

1856
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,040
because of the game,

1857
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,680
he has an assumption in this game.

1858
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,280
Because of this,

1859
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,880
we haven't learned the game theory.

1860
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,640
So I'll put it simply.

1861
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,240
This game theory,

1862
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,080
he has a lot of,

1863
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:21,880
he has an assumption.

1864
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,640
The premise is that both sides are actually in the case of knowledge or full knowledge.

1865
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,280
For market information,

1866
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,000
and for this information of both sides,

1867
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,280
it is a full-knowledge situation.

1868
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,360
OK.

1869
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,100
The so-called information includes the so-called patent information,

1870
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,060
including price information,

1871
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,100
including the case.

1872
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,580
These are all full-knowledge.

1873
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,660
Apple, Qualcomm, Intel all know.

1874
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,060
OK.

1875
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,260
In such a full-knowledge situation,

1876
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,540
Apple, he may be,

1877
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:44,220
not Apple,

1878
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,700
Qualcomm, he may be able to predict that,

1879
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,460
in the future, if,

1880
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:49,260
and in real society,

1881
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,420
I just mentioned that,

1882
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,500
that Apple is really careless,

1883
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,620
or whether it is careless,

1884
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,500
or deliberately,

1885
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,420
jump the bridge,

1886
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,380
secretly use Intel's modern chip,

1887
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,060
but the effect is not good.

1888
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,220
Well, just based on this fact,

1889
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,480
will there be a doubt?

1890
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:02,960
That is to say,

1891
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,040
Hey, Qualcomm will worry that,

1892
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,920
if Intel's modern chip quality rises,

1893
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,640
will it threaten my market,

1894
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,240
market leadership?

1895
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,040
It is possible.

1896
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,440
If it really threatens,

1897
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,920
then it will produce our previous,

1898
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,200
this mathematical model,

1899
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,960
will it produce such a result?

1900
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:21,720
Right?

1901
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,240
If it produces such a result,

1902
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,560
isn't it just to say,

1903
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,440
you can think about it.

1904
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,160
Then,

1905
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,320
why did he,

1906
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,240
at the beginning,

1907
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,560
regardless of his state,

1908
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,460
regardless of other people's state,

1909
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,380
regardless of Intel's state,

1910
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:34,100
I will propose a rebate first.

1911
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:34,700
What is the reason?

1912
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,900
Because he is worried that,

1913
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:36,300
in the future,

1914
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,620
if anyone comes in,

1915
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,740
Intel is just one of them,

1916
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,020
we think of the object,

1917
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,780
it may be Samsung,

1918
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,020
it may be Huawei,

1919
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:42,580
or others,

1920
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,220
or Ericsson,

1921
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,220
no matter.

1922
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,180
These potential investors,

1923
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:45,940
if his,

1924
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:48,020
the quality of this modern chip has risen,

1925
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,660
then it is possible to produce a price war.

1926
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,820
If in our model,

1927
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,860
the situation is like this.

1928
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,900
Then, in order to avoid this,

1929
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,380
the loss of the price war,

1930
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,660
then I might as well,

1931
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,700
at one stage,

1932
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:00,560
at the beginning,

1933
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,040
I will receive this rebate from Apple.

1934
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,520
In case,

1935
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,000
I am a bit like receiving a security fee,

1936
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,680
I am in case,

1937
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,200
in the future,

1938
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,720
if there is a price war,

1939
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,400
at least,

1940
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,160
this,

1941
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:10,640
this,

1942
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,600
the loss of this profit,

1943
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,360
I can make up for it from the previous rebate.

1944
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,440
OK, I provide such a rebate,

1945
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,280
I provide such a rebate to Apple,

1946
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:20,880
in the future,

1947
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,320
Apple will continue to use it,

1948
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:22,600
right?

1949
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,520
Because I provide such a rebate,

1950
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,920
everyone,

1951
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,400
although Apple is very happy,

1952
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,780
is to get one more money,

1953
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,380
but Qualcomm has a little loss,

1954
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,020
but there is no difference,

1955
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,340
why?

1956
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,860
My loss today,

1957
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:37,300
I am better than the future big loss.

1958
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,380
If I have a little loss today,

1959
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,140
but in the future,

1960
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,100
if you today,

1961
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,180
suppose we don't say that we can't breach the contract,

1962
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:47,060
this is because Apple's private breach,

1963
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,180
this is not good.

1964
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:50,140
Tell everyone that private breach is not good.

1965
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:52,500
If Qualcomm,

1966
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,180
if Apple does not violate the contract,

1967
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,200
it will continue to use Qualcomm chips in the future,

1968
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,320
otherwise it will violate the contract,

1969
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:00,920
right?

1970
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,560
In order to allow this thing to continue to occur,

1971
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,920
I will continue to provide rebate to you,

1972
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,320
I provide a little loss to Qualcomm,

1973
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,480
but I can always guard your Apple,

1974
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,560
I don't want Apple to jump to Intel.

1975
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,400
At least in the future,

1976
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,520
this price war will not occur,

1977
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,280
right?

1978
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,600
So its logic,

1979
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,840
the overall logic is like this,

1980
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,200
because price war will occur in the future.

1981
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,720
In order to avoid

1982
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,900
such a high price war for Apple,

1983
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,540
I might as well be in the first stage,

1984
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,980
when I was in the first stage of the game,

1985
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,340
I would lock you to death,

1986
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,420
I would use Bundle Rebate,

1987
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,020
I provide this Bundle Rebate Contract to force you to accept,

1988
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:36,900
what are the conditions to accept?

1989
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,500
I just mentioned that you can't jump to Intel,

1990
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,700
then you can't sue me,

1991
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:41,700
you can't jump to Intel,

1992
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:42,540
these two conditions,

1993
01:15:42,540 --> 01:15:47,140
then you have to pay me such a high power,

1994
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,540
Apple also has a loss,

1995
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,620
in fact, the mathematical model just said,

1996
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,420
that is, it actually has to deduct one,

1997
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,800
that is, you have to deduct that Alpha,

1998
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,160
the profit of Apple has to deduct that Alpha,

1999
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,360
OK, then the profit of Qualcomm has to be added to Alpha,

2000
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,200
because that is the Friend Royalty,

2001
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,680
then my Friend Royalty,

2002
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,160
if I charge a higher price,

2003
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,400
conversely,

2004
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,680
first, I charge a higher price,

2005
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,680
I can make up for the future loss,

2006
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,320
second, Qualcomm can also lock your Apple customers,

2007
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,640
so the whole model's implication,

2008
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,240
the core essence is here,

2009
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,420
so to put it simply,

2010
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,660
the essence of this model is here,

2011
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,980
but it's not enough to say that,

2012
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,980
this is just a business perspective,

2013
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,780
what other reasons do we think that

2014
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:36,940
Qualcomm can dare to keep doing this Boundary Bait?

2015
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,780
Back to the legal point of view,

2016
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,500
we just talked about this business point of view,

2017
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,420
it is to avoid future losses,

2018
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,380
so I have Boundary Bait here,

2019
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,340
I lock Apple,

2020
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,540
then collect a very high Friend rate,

2021
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,800
OK, a little higher,

2022
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,600
I don't know how high it is,

2023
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,200
a little higher rate,

2024
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,120
then lock you,

2025
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,400
then for the future loss,

2026
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,280
what about the law?

2027
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,080
In fact, it will be found that the fact,

2028
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,440
the fact of this case,

2029
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,200
that is, the fact of Qualcomm,

2030
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,200
in fact, with the previous six cases,

2031
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,960
I will report the conclusion to everyone,

2032
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,880
because I will not talk about the process,

2033
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,560
the conclusion is that

2034
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,640
Qualcomm's case

2035
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,840
is different from the previous six cases,

2036
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,160
OK, they are all different,

2037
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:20,500
if everyone has some basic common sense

2038
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,740
about American law,

2039
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:27,260
different facts can not be used,

2040
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,260
different facts will be compared,

2041
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,860
compared later found that it is not to be used,

2042
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,700
so that six cases,

2043
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,460
regardless of whether you are legal or illegal,

2044
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,820
can not be used in this case,

2045
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,340
OK, this is a point,

2046
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:41,060
the second split reasoning create possibility,

2047
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,700
I just said that

2048
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,860
there are red and black,

2049
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,500
there are legal and illegal,

2050
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,220
OK, Qualcomm sees this situation,

2051
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,760
the court itself has been arguing for a long time,

2052
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,960
you do not know at all,

2053
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,280
you do not know whether it is legal or illegal,

2054
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,800
the legal probability is 50%,

2055
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,600
the illegal probability is also 50%,

2056
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,200
but for business people,

2057
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,280
everyone thinks that

2058
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,560
whether I rush or not,

2059
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,680
of course, rush,

2060
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,160
right,

2061
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,320
of course, I care about him,

2062
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,080
anyway, there is a 50% chance that I will win,

2063
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:05,600
right,

2064
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,760
so then plus the previous few cases,

2065
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,400
the facts are different from me,

2066
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,360
then I have to rush,

2067
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,480
because those cases

2068
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,040
may not have anything to do with me,

2069
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,260
OK, so these facts are different,

2070
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:21,460
including the disagreement between the courts,

2071
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,020
resulting in my personal opinion,

2072
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,180
from the point of view of the law,

2073
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:25,940
Qualcomm,

2074
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,940
these situations also increased

2075
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,740
Qualcomm will continue to execute

2076
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:33,500
the right-hand man of Fund Rebate,

2077
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,740
from the business,

2078
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:37,340
he said that in order to make up

2079
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,700
or to prevent future losses,

2080
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:40,780
to the law,

2081
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,800
he is not in line with the past cases,

2082
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,120
OK,

2083
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,320
then the reason is not sufficient,

2084
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,440
nor is it consistent,

2085
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,920
so that he has such a

2086
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,800
legal right-hand man,

2087
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,840
although there is a legal risk,

2088
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,680
but this risk to him,

2089
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,920
he thinks he can control,

2090
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,880
so we found that

2091
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,680
this problem

2092
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,040
is that there is a business reason,

2093
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,200
there is a legal reason,

2094
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:07,880
OK,

2095
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,740
business is that I have to prepare for the future,

2096
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,700
for the future,

2097
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,460
the legal reason is that

2098
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,660
those six cases,

2099
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,620
whether legal or illegal,

2100
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,980
have nothing to do with him,

2101
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,380
because this is my brand new Fund Rebate,

2102
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:20,900
OK,

2103
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,660
then the different point is that

2104
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,820
the first six cases are all

2105
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,220
the combination of products and products,

2106
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,260
what is my product,

2107
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,700
what is the combination of patents,

2108
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,300
the first one has nothing to do with me,

2109
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,460
so based on the business and legal reasons,

2110
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,280
they all give me a very strong right-hand man,

2111
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,480
let me continue to execute Fund Rebate,

2112
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:44,160
even if he may also have a very high

2113
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,360
risk of anti-Thoracic,

2114
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:46,760
OK,

2115
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,160
so this paper is actually basically here,

2116
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,240
of course, when I concluded,

2117
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,040
my paper,

2118
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,680
when we concluded this paper,

2119
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,600
I also mentioned one point,

2120
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,240
that is,

2121
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,200
in the end,

2122
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:58,600
this case,

2123
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,160
because this case,

2124
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,120
if you are interested,

2125
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:00,800
you can check it,

2126
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,040
it is still in progress in the United States,

2127
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,400
there is no conclusion,

2128
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,500
that is,

2129
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,860
this question is actually my graduation,

2130
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,860
the real question of the graduation paper,

2131
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:09,180
OK,

2132
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,220
if you are interested,

2133
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,820
you can talk to me in private,

2134
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,700
because my graduation paper is from a different point of view,

2135
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,700
then my graduation paper point of view is this question,

2136
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,780
that is,

2137
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,380
the court as such a role,

2138
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,220
if he is judged to be legal,

2139
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,580
his influence on Apple,

2140
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:27,220
what is his influence on the public,

2141
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:31,300
and if it is illegal,

2142
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:31,700
right?

2143
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,700
Then I just mentioned that

2144
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,700
he is a

2145
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,200
law of the jungle,

2146
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,120
he may accidentally go the wrong way,

2147
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,120
it may affect a lot of people,

2148
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,240
yes,

2149
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,840
if he is

2150
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:42,680
very bold in the court,

2151
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,800
what is his influence on the public

2152
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,240
when he is judged to be illegal?

2153
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,760
This is the future study,

2154
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,040
that is,

2155
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:49,640
including my paper,

2156
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,400
I am also doing this thing,

2157
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,360
then this paper is the last stop here,

2158
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:53,880
that is,

2159
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:54,680
if you are interested,

2160
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,560
you are welcome to join in

2161
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,360
and do this kind of research.

2162
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:58,640
OK,

2163
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,000
so

2164
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,280
today my

2165
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,240
sharing

2166
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,100
is about to end here,

2167
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,460
then

2168
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:07,940
ah,

2169
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:08,580
OK,

2170
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:09,780
someone asked in the middle of the round,

2171
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:10,740
so

2172
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,340
my sharing is about to end here,

2173
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,220
then

2174
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,140
do I have to answer the question first?

2175
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,340
Or

2176
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:20,940
let us

2177
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,420
applaud and thank Louis for today's

2178
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,260
in-depth sharing,

2179
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,020
thank you,

2180
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,500
do you understand?

2181
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,780
Everyone should understand, right?

2182
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,440
I don't know what everyone's question is,

2183
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,640
I'm very worried,

2184
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,880
I think I want to talk about it,

2185
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,800
you are very lucky,

2186
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,720
because this is my first time talking,

2187
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,960
it should not be the first time,

2188
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,440
it seems a bit too much to say like this,

01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:47,840
my first time sharing something related to my graduate thesis,

2190
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,480
yes,

2191
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,440
the question,

2192
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,840
do I have to answer the question first?

2193
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,120
Or how?

2194
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,280
Louis,

2195
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,040
let me stop recording first,

2196
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,700
then we can start to answer the question,

2197
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:01,500
OK,

2198
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
no problem,
