0	8000	Hi, everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.
8000	14000	Today's Tarot Talk is very happy to invite Dr. Yu Zhejing.
14000	19000	Can I say this? Although half of my feet have already stepped into Ph.D.
19000	23000	Zhejing is a graduate of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.
23000	26000	He directly enrolled in the PhD class of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.
26000	29000	This year is the fourth year of the PhD class.
29000	34000	In the first three years of the PhD class, he conducted a cooperation experiment in Poland.
34000	37000	Last year, he applied for the Thousand Miles Project.
37000	39000	I want to say that I am in Caltech.
39000	43000	He conducted research on visiting in Caltech.
43000	46000	We have become very good friends this year.
46000	50000	He just returned to Taiwan and is expected to graduate this summer.
50000	51000	He is almost graduating.
51000	61000	He is interested in the study of nanoparticless materials and green energy and environmental governance through the application of light, vinegar, coal, blowing, and chemical engineering.
61000	65000	So far, he has published nearly ten articles.
65000	68000	Half of them are written by Ph.D.
68000	72000	Can you go back to the first page?
72000	73000	Yes.
73000	75000	You should be able to see the first video now.
76000	78000	Today's topic is very interesting.
78000	81000	It's called The Air We Breathe and The Water We Drink.
81000	83000	Without further ado, let's welcome Yu-Zhe Jin.
83000	84000	Oh, I'm sorry.
84000	86000	I forgot to say one thing.
86000	92000	When you applaud, you have to put the microphone down so that the speaker can hear your applause.
92000	94000	Yes, I heard it.
94000	96000	Please start.
96000	99000	Thank you, Tara, for inviting me to speak today.
99000	100000	I am Yu-Zhe Jin.
100000	109000	Today I am going to talk about how we use chemical engineering to manage our air and water.
109000	111000	The speech will be divided into two parts.
111000	117000	The first is to use light blowing to manage the toxic gas in the air.
117000	121000	The second part is to use electromagnetic methods to deal with our waste water.
121000	127000	I hope that if you have any questions, we can discuss them directly.
128000	131000	I will limit the time to about an hour.
131000	135000	Including Q&A, I will limit it to about an hour.
135000	137000	Sorry, let me interrupt.
137000	138000	Okay.
138000	139000	I have a question.
139000	144000	You can see a small microphone pattern on the right side of the screen.
144000	148000	You have to mute your own microphone to make a sound.
148000	149000	Don't forget.
149000	150000	Please continue.
150000	151000	Okay.
157000	163000	Okay.
163000	166000	In general, in the combustion process,
166000	170000	they will release a lot of toxic gases.
170000	178000	Among them, nitric oxide will release about 250 to 400 BPM.
178000	182000	What kind of harm will this cause?
182000	187000	The toxic gas of nitric oxide, after a series of light chemical reactions,
187000	193000	may produce carbon dioxide, NO2, or ozone.
193000	197000	These two things are actually toxic gases.
197000	202000	In fact, in the early days, there were some problems with light chemicals.
202000	204000	You can see that the air is orange.
204000	206000	They are the so-called light chemicals.
206000	213000	These light chemicals are produced by carbon dioxide and ozone produced by these oil reactions.
213000	217000	In the early 1952s in London and the 1980s in Los Angeles,
217000	223000	about tens of thousands of people died because of these light chemicals.
223000	228000	At the same time, carbon dioxide will also form acid rain with water.
228000	233000	The harm of acid rain is corrosion of buildings.
233000	242000	At the same time, the most recent problem is probably the air whirlpool we know, PM2.5.
242000	250000	Nitric oxide will form a whirlpool in the air after it is combined with some solvents in the air, such as dust.
250000	253000	These whirlpools are lighter in density.
253000	259000	For example, PM2.5 means that the particle diameter is less than 2.5 microns.
259000	262000	Carbon dioxide is lighter, so it will stay in the air.
262000	267000	When it is absorbed by the human body, it will harm the lungs.
267000	273000	So our research focus is to deal with nitric oxide in the air,
273000	279000	to prevent it from generating more harmful substances with other chemical reactions.
279000	288000	This chart is based on the air quality standards set by the US Department of Environment.
288000	293000	Among them, the air quality standards set six legal pollutants.
293000	301000	Three of them are the toxic gases we just mentioned, NO2, ozone, and air whirlpools.
301000	305000	These three will be generated by our carbon dioxide.
305000	309000	So this is why we have to solve the problem of carbon dioxide.
309000	319000	Q&A
319000	322000	They will be monitored in different ways.
322000	330000	For example, they will measure the concentration of carbon dioxide for 1 hour.
330000	335000	If the concentration is more than 35 ppm in 1 hour, it is not standard.
335000	339000	But for a long time, if you put the magnitude to 8 hours of monitoring,
339000	342000	8 hours is OK as long as it is below 9 ppm.
343000	349000	The short-term concentration should not be too high, and the long-term concentration should be a standard.
349000	363000	If my understanding is correct, is it possible to say that if I have a temporary or monotonous NO2 emission,
363000	366000	it is a shot and then it is over.
366000	372000	How long does it take to decay?
373000	381000	Or it should be said that some things, such as CO, may cause harm if absorbed in a short time.
381000	385000	So it will be set, for example, that it cannot exceed this concentration within 1 hour.
385000	388000	Otherwise, if the absorption exceeds this concentration, it will actually harm the human body.
388000	391000	But some things may be absorbed for a long time.
391000	394000	Even if the concentration is low, it will cause harm to the human body.
394000	397000	It will set a long-term standard.
397000	403000	Or it is set such a standard for the long-term toxicity of that substance and the short-term toxicity.
403000	406000	Does this answer your question?
406000	408000	Yes, I understand. Thank you.
408000	410000	OK, thank you.
410000	417000	The most commonly used method in the industry is called Selective Catalytic Reduction.
417000	420000	We often call it SCR.
420000	424000	We use the method of recovery to deal with our carbon monoxide.
425000	432000	The reason I put this picture is because you know that there is something in the car called a catalyst.
432000	441000	Because the car will actually burn those diesel or gasoline,
441000	444000	which will also produce a lot of carbon monoxide by burning.
444000	450000	This catalyst can turn carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.
451000	454000	Let me give you an idea.
454000	459000	If a car has been used for 10 years, it may have bought 50,000 yuan.
459000	462000	How much money do you think will be left after 10 years?
462000	464000	Does anyone want to guess?
470000	474000	If the car is used for 10 years, there are about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan left.
474000	478000	In fact, 2,000 to 3,000 yuan is the price of a catalyst.
478000	481000	Because the catalyst actually contains a lot of precious metals.
481000	485000	So the most important thing for a car is its catalyst.
485000	492000	Through this, we can turn our carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.
492000	496000	There are other methods, such as oxidation.
496000	503000	If carbon monoxide is added to its oxidizer, it will actually turn into a more toxic carbon monoxide.
503000	507000	Carbon monoxide will actually harm our lungs.
508000	510000	Carbon monoxide will even cause uric acid tears.
510000	516000	Uric acid tears will cause the function of the oxidizer to decrease, causing the oxidation of the uric acid.
516000	522000	This is why we need to use restoration, not oxidation, to deal with our carbon monoxide.
525000	526000	We are doing experiments.
526000	529000	In fact, we considered NOx.
529000	532000	NOx is actually the synthesis of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
533000	540000	Although our initial reaction was carbon monoxide, we do not want to produce more toxic gas after our reaction.
540000	551000	So if we are evaluating whether our air is handled well, we will use this indicator to confirm that all carbon monoxide has been removed.
551000	563000	The operating temperature of NOx is usually above 250 degrees Celsius, according to current research.
563000	575000	This is why we want to use light-supported SCR reaction, which is to use light blowing to support the restoration reaction just mentioned.
575000	579000	Sorry, I have a question.
579000	586000	You said that 200-300 degrees Celsius is assumed to be long-pressure, right?
586000	587000	Yes, long-pressure.
587000	593000	So basically you are heating NOx in the air.
594000	598000	Yes, because the exhaust pipe of the car is very hot.
598000	600000	So we are heating NOx in the exhaust pipe.
600000	606000	We need to reach the operating temperature of carbon monoxide to effectively remove NOx.
606000	615000	So if I use a pump to collect all these gases into a chamber to make it super high-pressure, but I don't need to heat it.
615000	619000	Isn't the energy density high enough?
619000	621000	Theoretically, yes.
621000	629000	But in the actual handling of the case, the flow rate is very fast.
629000	634000	So if you want to do this, you can't handle such a large amount of waste in time.
634000	636000	Oh.
636000	638000	Yes, because you have to collect it first.
638000	640000	Collect it in the cylinder and then process it.
640000	641000	Yes.
641000	643000	Then empty the cylinder and collect it and process it.
643000	644000	Oh, OK.
644000	647000	It's more impractical in the process.
647000	648000	OK.
648000	650000	Of course, it's not a problem.
650000	651000	OK.
651000	656000	So why do we use light to blow our reaction?
656000	659000	First, let's talk about the background of light emission.
659000	662000	Light emission is actually the use of light.
662000	666000	Then usually the material we choose is semiconductor material.
666000	669000	It will have its bearing and guide.
669000	675000	After using the light, it can illuminate the guide.
675000	682000	Then the electron will be magnetized from the next generation to the next generation.
682000	687000	Then it will form its electron and the remaining electric field.
687000	690000	The electron can actually participate in our chemical reaction.
690000	696000	For example, the reaction can turn our carbon dioxide into our gas.
696000	699000	So this study is actually using light to provide an energy.
699000	702000	Then use this energy to carry out our chemical reaction.
702000	708000	What advantages does it have compared to the traditional SCR reaction we just talked about?
708000	711000	It can be reacted at room temperature.
711000	715000	It doesn't need to be heated to, for example, 200 or 300 degrees.
715000	720000	At the same time, we think of light as an energy that can't be used or used.
720000	722000	So it's a green energy.
722000	729000	The third point is that the traditional SCR reaction must be operated at very limited temperatures.
729000	732000	For example, there is only 10 degrees of tolerance space.
732000	735000	Light can actually operate at a wider temperature.
735000	739000	So we don't have to design its reaction temperature so strictly.
739000	744000	Provide a better operating condition.
744000	748000	The top three points of the doctoral class are our cooperation with Poland.
748000	749000	I think I've been interrupting you.
749000	750000	I'm asking a small question.
750000	752000	I'm actually quite welcome to do this.
752000	754000	Otherwise, I might talk about it until the end.
754000	758000	So the bandgap of the semiconductor is about a few eV.
758000	761000	So the photon you're talking about is visible light.
761000	762000	Good question.
762000	765000	I'm using TiO2 here.
765000	768000	So it's actually not a visible light material.
768000	771000	Its bandgap is 3.2 eV.
771000	772000	3.2 eV?
772000	773000	Yes, and then...
773000	776000	Oh, is it a near-infrared?
776000	778000	Near-infrared.
778000	779000	Near-infrared.
779000	785000	So in fact, TiO2 can only absorb ultraviolet light.
785000	786000	OK.
786000	788000	So it's just eV level.
788000	789000	Yes.
789000	794000	So we have a lot of researchers who want to modify the material.
794000	796000	Make its bandgap smaller.
796000	800000	Then we can absorb the wavelength of ultraviolet light to the wavelength of visible light.
800000	803000	That is, it can really be used for solar energy.
803000	807000	Because only 4% of solar energy is ultraviolet light.
807000	812000	In fact, more than 90% is visible light or infrared light bandgap.
812000	813000	OK.
813000	814000	Got it.
814000	815000	OK, thank you.
815000	816000	OK, thank you.
816000	819000	OK, so we're working with Boron.
819000	822000	I'm just going to talk a little bit about what we did before.
822000	827000	Then we designed a large-scale light-emitting reaction.
827000	833000	Because before that, a lot of teams were lab-scale.
833000	834000	They only do it in the lab.
834000	840000	So we want to be able to test whether this thing can actually be used in practical.
840000	842000	So we designed a large-scale light-emitting reactor.
842000	844000	Its scale is about 1 meter.
844000	846000	We can see from this picture.
846000	850000	The picture on the right is about 1 meter.
850000	859000	So we filled our catalyst, which is our antifreeze, in the outer layer of the tube and the tube.
860000	864000	And then we see that we've actually installed a light tube.
864000	867000	And we're going to blow these reactions with these light tubes.
871000	875000	And then we're going to put the results we made before.
875000	878000	The y-axis is the concentration.
878000	881000	We reflect the concentration of the toxic gas NO.
881000	883000	The horizontal axis is the time.
883000	888000	At initial concentration, we can see that NO is about 250 to 200 ppm.
888000	894000	After the reflection of light, it does reduce our toxic gas.
894000	897000	It's about 50 ppm.
897000	902000	So we're going to calculate their NOx removal efficiency, which is about 75%.
902000	905000	That's what I'm talking about.
905000	909000	Because you can see that his NOx removal efficiency is only 75%.
909000	913000	So we want to be able to further improve its removal efficiency.
913000	916000	So what about this part?
916000	918000	How do you say?
918000	921000	If you meet someone who does the light brittle field today,
921000	923000	If you don't understand anything, it doesn't matter.
923000	926000	You just ask him, how much is your NOx?
926000	930000	That will make you feel that he thinks, oh, you might be an expert in this field.
930000	932000	That's why I'm going to put this thing on.
932000	938000	The definition of NOx is actually that it can absorb as much light as it can.
938000	943000	And then convert it into how many moles of electrons to participate in the reaction.
943000	948000	So, in theory, if a light can produce an electron to react,
948000	951000	This value will be at most one.
951000	956000	And then we're going to compare the light reflectors that we've tested in the lab before.
956000	961000	Compare it with the light reflectors in our factory.
962000	965000	Their quantum yaw is actually on a similar scale.
965000	968000	And then even the light reflectors in the factory,
968000	971000	His quantum yaw is better than him.
971000	974000	So we guess why he's better.
974000	977000	It's because in our design,
977000	980000	His light tube is actually in the reaction.
980000	982000	He's this box, he's going to be covered.
982000	986000	So he can effectively use all the functions to prevent the dissolution of light.
986000	989000	Okay, so the next study,
989000	994000	We're trying to make our materials better,
994000	997000	To make it more light efficient.
997000	1004000	So, someone came up with a thing called titanium dioxide nano sheets.
1004000	1007000	This is the most traditional integrated Tl2.
1007000	1010000	If you actually magnify it to a large size,
1010000	1013000	It looks like this under the microscope.
1013000	1016000	An octahedron.
1016000	1019000	What about this octahedron?
1019000	1022000	It's our traditional titanium dioxide.
1022000	1027000	But there are scientists who have found that.
1027000	1030000	Let's call this side this direction.
1030000	1033000	You can see the definition of this XYZ.
1033000	1036000	X is called 110.
1036000	1039000	Y is our 010.
1039000	1042000	It's the same as our previous mathematical definition.
1042000	1047000	So we're going to call the yellow side the gold side of 001.
1047000	1052000	And then the red side is the gold side of 101.
1052000	1055000	So we see that the traditional titanium dioxide,
1055000	1058000	It's not actually exposed to the gold side of 001.
1058000	1061000	It's mostly the gold side of 101.
1061000	1066000	Scientists have found that the gold side of 001 is more responsive than the gold side of 101.
1066000	1069000	But it's because it's more responsive.
1069000	1072000	So it's actually not stable in thermodynamics.
1072000	1075000	So it's not easy to synthesize.
1075000	1078000	That's why the gold side of the tradition is mainly 101.
1078000	1081000	And then it looks like this.
1081000	1084000	So in our research, we want to go.
1085000	1088000	So in our research, we want to go.
1088000	1091000	Let him expose more of this 001 side.
1091000	1094000	Let him be more reflective.
1094000	1097000	And then by computer calculations.
1097000	1101000	They found that when we put the gold of TiO2,
1101000	1104000	The gold of TiO2,
1104000	1107000	It's a different element that can reduce its stomach.
1107000	1110000	That's the stomach of each of their gold surfaces.
1111000	1114000	The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.
1114000	1117000	The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.
1117000	1120000	And then they found that if they mixed the Fu element,
1120000	1123000	It can make this gold of 001 the most stable.
1123000	1126000	You can see that the black dot represents the gold of 001.
1126000	1129000	The black dot represents the gold of 001.
1129000	1132000	You can see that the black dot is actually lower than the white.
1132000	1135000	It means that its stomach is actually more stable.
1135000	1138000	And then for other elements,
1139000	1142000	It doesn't have the same effect.
1142000	1145000	So we try to...
1145000	1148000	So we try to...
1148000	1151000	So we try to...
1151000	1154000	The one above you is the image of the electronic microscope, right?
1154000	1157000	So you are actually...
1157000	1160000	I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.
1160000	1163000	I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.
1163000	1166000	But you use this, what is it called?
1166000	1169000	It's a single crystal, not a big one.
1169000	1172000	It's a single crystal, not a big one.
1172000	1175000	You mean the Taisha and Danjing?
1175000	1178000	Because you look like a small piece now.
1178000	1181000	But if you grow a crystal today,
1181000	1184000	It's the Tetra Hyperion you just made.
1184000	1187000	Grow it to a super perfect and super big one.
1187000	1190000	It's a single crystal as big as a fist.
1190000	1193000	It's a single crystal as big as a fist.
1194000	1197000	Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,
1197000	1200000	Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,
1200000	1203000	It's going to have a very small surface area.
1203000	1206000	Because it means it's a very large particle.
1206000	1209000	For our good reaction,
1209000	1212000	Surface area is a very important thing.
1212000	1215000	Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed
1215000	1218000	Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed
1218000	1221000	under each grain of material.
1221000	1224000	The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.
1224000	1227000	The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.
1227000	1230000	But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.
1230000	1233000	But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.
1233000	1236000	So we care about the surface area.
1236000	1239000	It's better to be very fine.
1239000	1242000	So your question is,
1242000	1245000	If the particles are too large, it means the surface area is very low.
1245000	1248000	So we want the particles to be smaller and better.
1248000	1251000	So you want to know why people make nanoparticles.
1251000	1254000	Because nanoparticles means the particles are small.
1254000	1257000	And nanoparticles means the surface area is high.
1257000	1260000	Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,
1260000	1263000	Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,
1263000	1266000	the quantum efficiency can be up to 30% or 40% or something like that.
1266000	1269000	But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.
1269000	1272000	But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.
1272000	1275000	They are combined into a perfect crystal.
1275000	1278000	This is what they are doing.
1278000	1281000	But for practical use,
1281000	1284000	they hope that the smaller the particle, the better.
1284000	1287000	I see. I understand. Thank you.
1287000	1290000	I have another question.
1290000	1293000	Someone asked,
1293000	1296000	Fu and Xi are not all black below?
1296000	1299000	Fu and Xi are not all black below?
1299000	1302000	Yes. So it means that Xi is also good.
1302000	1305000	If you use Xi to synthesize,
1305000	1308000	it will be more than 101.
1308000	1311000	But Fu's overall energy is lower.
1311000	1314000	Its scale is less than 0.
1314000	1317000	So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.
1317000	1320000	So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.
1320000	1323000	Both are good,
1323000	1326000	but Fu is better.
1326000	1329000	But a follow-up question.
1329000	1332000	If the industry is so big,
1332000	1335000	the cost should be much lower, right?
1335000	1338000	That's right.
1338000	1341000	This is more of a fundamental research.
1341000	1344000	If it is applied,
1344000	1347000	there will be a difference in cost.
1347000	1350000	Various facilities,
1350000	1353000	factories,
1353000	1356000	the cost of handling Xi should be very low.
1356000	1359000	You can imagine that Fu's amount of friction
1359000	1362000	accounts for about 0.1% of the overall cost.
1362000	1365000	So Fu is very little.
1365000	1368000	It's mainly the process of friction.
1368000	1371000	So the cost is not bad.
1371000	1374000	Yes. TI2 is very cheap.
1374000	1377000	So it's still OK.
1377000	1380000	OK. I'll go on.
1380000	1383000	So we actually
1383000	1386000	added some Fu atoms during the synthesis
1386000	1389000	to form the Titanium Nanosheets we just talked about.
1389000	1392000	This is obvious from the appearance.
1392000	1395000	SG is actually a
1395000	1398000	carbon dioxide that is synthesized in a traditional way.
1398000	1401000	So it's actually a granule.
1401000	1404000	Here we just
1404000	1407000	control the ratio of their precursors.
1407000	1410000	So they are all nanosheets.
1410000	1413000	You can see that they are obviously a granule structure.
1413000	1416000	Then
1416000	1419000	how do we
1419000	1422000	explain that
1422000	1425000	this surface is 001?
1425000	1428000	We will use TEM to explain that this surface is 001.
1428000	1431000	Because you can't say that you set this 001,
1431000	1434000	it's 001. You have to explain something.
1434000	1437000	Our method is to continue to magnify TEM.
1437000	1440000	Then if you
1440000	1443000	magnify it for the area, you can actually see their
1443000	1446000	diameter, their despacing.
1446000	1449000	According to the measurement, we know that their diameter
1449000	1452000	is about 0.239 nanometers.
1452000	1455000	So the despacing corresponded to
1455000	1458000	is actually the same as their
1458000	1461000	calculation value of 0.235.
1461000	1464000	Then we can say for sure
1464000	1467000	that this direction is
1467000	1470000	our 001 side.
1470000	1473000	This picture is actually the side picture.
1473000	1476000	In fact, we will look like this
1476000	1479000	from the side of it.
1479000	1482000	B and C are actually its covers.
1482000	1485000	So we can see that the top is actually
1485000	1488000	the 001 side.
1488000	1491000	Then we will use
1491000	1494000	XRD to confirm that our
1494000	1497000	service source is really involved in it.
1497000	1500000	XRD is for their
1500000	1503000	diameter.
1503000	1506000	XRD is made up of the analysis material by the diameter.
1506000	1509000	You can see
1509000	1512000	about 25-26 degrees.
1512000	1515000	You can find that
1515000	1518000	SG and P25 are actually
1518000	1521000	a traditional TIL2,
1521000	1524000	a traditional granulated TIL2.
1524000	1527000	Then their wind is probably in this position.
1527000	1530000	Then I use the line to mark this part.
1530000	1533000	In fact, you can find that these three are our
1533000	1536000	nanometers of our synthesis.
1536000	1539000	Their wind is actually deviated.
1539000	1542000	This deviation can actually point out that
1542000	1545000	because its flux is involved in its diameter,
1545000	1548000	in fact, if its diameter is getting bigger,
1548000	1551000	we are based on our Bragg law.
1551000	1554000	You can know that if the diameter is getting bigger,
1554000	1557000	the D spacing is getting bigger,
1557000	1560000	it will change its theta value,
1560000	1563000	so that the wind is deviated.
1563000	1566000	So we use XRD to confirm that
1566000	1569000	its flux is involved in its diameter.
1569000	1572000	Then this is
1572000	1575000	XRD's light-electromagnetic chart.
1575000	1578000	We can use this to analyze its
1578000	1581000	TIL.
1581000	1584000	Because TIL is an excess metal,
1584000	1587000	so in fact, TIL may exist in 2, 3, 4.
1587000	1590000	We want to know how many of them
1590000	1593000	exist in our carbon dioxide.
1593000	1596000	From this chart, we can find that
1596000	1599000	TIL is mainly a 4-car.
1599000	1602000	In fact, in our carbon dioxide plate,
1602000	1605000	we will find that it has more TIL.
1605000	1608000	This wind actually represents
1608000	1611000	TIL's wind.
1611000	1614000	Then after our calculation,
1614000	1617000	we can know that TIL's wind,
1617000	1620000	TIL's content is probably
1620000	1623000	about 20% for the plate.
1623000	1626000	Then we can find that
