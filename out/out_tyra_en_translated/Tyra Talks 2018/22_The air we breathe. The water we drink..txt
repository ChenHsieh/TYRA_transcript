Hi, everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.
Today's Tarot Talk is very happy to invite Dr. Yu Zhejing.
Can I say this? Although half of my feet have already stepped into Ph.D.
Zhejing is a graduate of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.
He directly enrolled in the PhD class of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.
This year is the fourth year of the PhD class.
In the first three years of the PhD class, he conducted a cooperation experiment in Poland.
Last year, he applied for the Thousand Miles Project.
I want to say that I am in Caltech.
He conducted research on visiting in Caltech.
We have become very good friends this year.
He just returned to Taiwan and is expected to graduate this summer.
He is almost graduating.
He is interested in the study of nanoparticless materials and green energy and environmental governance through the application of light, vinegar, coal, blowing, and chemical engineering.
So far, he has published nearly ten articles.
Half of them are written by Ph.D.
Can you go back to the first page?
Yes.
You should be able to see the first video now.
Today's topic is very interesting.
It's called The Air We Breathe and The Water We Drink.
Without further ado, let's welcome Yu-Zhe Jin.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to say one thing.
When you applaud, you have to put the microphone down so that the speaker can hear your applause.
Yes, I heard it.
Please start.
Thank you, Tara, for inviting me to speak today.
I am Yu-Zhe Jin.
Today I am going to talk about how we use chemical engineering to manage our air and water.
The speech will be divided into two parts.
The first is to use light blowing to manage the toxic gas in the air.
The second part is to use electromagnetic methods to deal with our waste water.
I hope that if you have any questions, we can discuss them directly.
I will limit the time to about an hour.
Including Q&A, I will limit it to about an hour.
Sorry, let me interrupt.
Okay.
I have a question.
You can see a small microphone pattern on the right side of the screen.
You have to mute your own microphone to make a sound.
Don't forget.
Please continue.
Okay.
Okay.
In general, in the combustion process,
they will release a lot of toxic gases.
Among them, nitric oxide will release about 250 to 400 BPM.
What kind of harm will this cause?
The toxic gas of nitric oxide, after a series of light chemical reactions,
may produce carbon dioxide, NO2, or ozone.
These two things are actually toxic gases.
In fact, in the early days, there were some problems with light chemicals.
You can see that the air is orange.
They are the so-called light chemicals.
These light chemicals are produced by carbon dioxide and ozone produced by these oil reactions.
In the early 1952s in London and the 1980s in Los Angeles,
about tens of thousands of people died because of these light chemicals.
At the same time, carbon dioxide will also form acid rain with water.
The harm of acid rain is corrosion of buildings.
At the same time, the most recent problem is probably the air whirlpool we know, PM2.5.
Nitric oxide will form a whirlpool in the air after it is combined with some solvents in the air, such as dust.
These whirlpools are lighter in density.
For example, PM2.5 means that the particle diameter is less than 2.5 microns.
Carbon dioxide is lighter, so it will stay in the air.
When it is absorbed by the human body, it will harm the lungs.
So our research focus is to deal with nitric oxide in the air,
to prevent it from generating more harmful substances with other chemical reactions.
This chart is based on the air quality standards set by the US Department of Environment.
Among them, the air quality standards set six legal pollutants.
Three of them are the toxic gases we just mentioned, NO2, ozone, and air whirlpools.
These three will be generated by our carbon dioxide.
So this is why we have to solve the problem of carbon dioxide.
Q&A
They will be monitored in different ways.
For example, they will measure the concentration of carbon dioxide for 1 hour.
If the concentration is more than 35 ppm in 1 hour, it is not standard.
But for a long time, if you put the magnitude to 8 hours of monitoring,
8 hours is OK as long as it is below 9 ppm.
The short-term concentration should not be too high, and the long-term concentration should be a standard.
If my understanding is correct, is it possible to say that if I have a temporary or monotonous NO2 emission,
it is a shot and then it is over.
How long does it take to decay?
Or it should be said that some things, such as CO, may cause harm if absorbed in a short time.
So it will be set, for example, that it cannot exceed this concentration within 1 hour.
Otherwise, if the absorption exceeds this concentration, it will actually harm the human body.
But some things may be absorbed for a long time.
Even if the concentration is low, it will cause harm to the human body.
It will set a long-term standard.
Or it is set such a standard for the long-term toxicity of that substance and the short-term toxicity.
Does this answer your question?
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
OK, thank you.
The most commonly used method in the industry is called Selective Catalytic Reduction.
We often call it SCR.
We use the method of recovery to deal with our carbon monoxide.
The reason I put this picture is because you know that there is something in the car called a catalyst.
Because the car will actually burn those diesel or gasoline,
which will also produce a lot of carbon monoxide by burning.
This catalyst can turn carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.
Let me give you an idea.
If a car has been used for 10 years, it may have bought 50,000 yuan.
How much money do you think will be left after 10 years?
Does anyone want to guess?
If the car is used for 10 years, there are about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan left.
In fact, 2,000 to 3,000 yuan is the price of a catalyst.
Because the catalyst actually contains a lot of precious metals.
So the most important thing for a car is its catalyst.
Through this, we can turn our carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.
There are other methods, such as oxidation.
If carbon monoxide is added to its oxidizer, it will actually turn into a more toxic carbon monoxide.
Carbon monoxide will actually harm our lungs.
Carbon monoxide will even cause uric acid tears.
Uric acid tears will cause the function of the oxidizer to decrease, causing the oxidation of the uric acid.
This is why we need to use restoration, not oxidation, to deal with our carbon monoxide.
We are doing experiments.
In fact, we considered NOx.
NOx is actually the synthesis of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.
Although our initial reaction was carbon monoxide, we do not want to produce more toxic gas after our reaction.
So if we are evaluating whether our air is handled well, we will use this indicator to confirm that all carbon monoxide has been removed.
The operating temperature of NOx is usually above 250 degrees Celsius, according to current research.
This is why we want to use light-supported SCR reaction, which is to use light blowing to support the restoration reaction just mentioned.
Sorry, I have a question.
You said that 200-300 degrees Celsius is assumed to be long-pressure, right?
Yes, long-pressure.
So basically you are heating NOx in the air.
Yes, because the exhaust pipe of the car is very hot.
So we are heating NOx in the exhaust pipe.
We need to reach the operating temperature of carbon monoxide to effectively remove NOx.
So if I use a pump to collect all these gases into a chamber to make it super high-pressure, but I don't need to heat it.
Isn't the energy density high enough?
Theoretically, yes.
But in the actual handling of the case, the flow rate is very fast.
So if you want to do this, you can't handle such a large amount of waste in time.
Oh.
Yes, because you have to collect it first.
Collect it in the cylinder and then process it.
Yes.
Then empty the cylinder and collect it and process it.
Oh, OK.
It's more impractical in the process.
OK.
Of course, it's not a problem.
OK.
So why do we use light to blow our reaction?
First, let's talk about the background of light emission.
Light emission is actually the use of light.
Then usually the material we choose is semiconductor material.
It will have its bearing and guide.
After using the light, it can illuminate the guide.
Then the electron will be magnetized from the next generation to the next generation.
Then it will form its electron and the remaining electric field.
The electron can actually participate in our chemical reaction.
For example, the reaction can turn our carbon dioxide into our gas.
So this study is actually using light to provide an energy.
Then use this energy to carry out our chemical reaction.
What advantages does it have compared to the traditional SCR reaction we just talked about?
It can be reacted at room temperature.
It doesn't need to be heated to, for example, 200 or 300 degrees.
At the same time, we think of light as an energy that can't be used or used.
So it's a green energy.
The third point is that the traditional SCR reaction must be operated at very limited temperatures.
For example, there is only 10 degrees of tolerance space.
Light can actually operate at a wider temperature.
So we don't have to design its reaction temperature so strictly.
Provide a better operating condition.
The top three points of the doctoral class are our cooperation with Poland.
I think I've been interrupting you.
I'm asking a small question.
I'm actually quite welcome to do this.
Otherwise, I might talk about it until the end.
So the bandgap of the semiconductor is about a few eV.
So the photon you're talking about is visible light.
Good question.
I'm using TiO2 here.
So it's actually not a visible light material.
Its bandgap is 3.2 eV.
3.2 eV?
Yes, and then...
Oh, is it a near-infrared?
Near-infrared.
Near-infrared.
So in fact, TiO2 can only absorb ultraviolet light.
OK.
So it's just eV level.
Yes.
So we have a lot of researchers who want to modify the material.
Make its bandgap smaller.
Then we can absorb the wavelength of ultraviolet light to the wavelength of visible light.
That is, it can really be used for solar energy.
Because only 4% of solar energy is ultraviolet light.
In fact, more than 90% is visible light or infrared light bandgap.
OK.
Got it.
OK, thank you.
OK, thank you.
OK, so we're working with Boron.
I'm just going to talk a little bit about what we did before.
Then we designed a large-scale light-emitting reaction.
Because before that, a lot of teams were lab-scale.
They only do it in the lab.
So we want to be able to test whether this thing can actually be used in practical.
So we designed a large-scale light-emitting reactor.
Its scale is about 1 meter.
We can see from this picture.
The picture on the right is about 1 meter.
So we filled our catalyst, which is our antifreeze, in the outer layer of the tube and the tube.
And then we see that we've actually installed a light tube.
And we're going to blow these reactions with these light tubes.
And then we're going to put the results we made before.
The y-axis is the concentration.
We reflect the concentration of the toxic gas NO.
The horizontal axis is the time.
At initial concentration, we can see that NO is about 250 to 200 ppm.
After the reflection of light, it does reduce our toxic gas.
It's about 50 ppm.
So we're going to calculate their NOx removal efficiency, which is about 75%.
That's what I'm talking about.
Because you can see that his NOx removal efficiency is only 75%.
So we want to be able to further improve its removal efficiency.
So what about this part?
How do you say?
If you meet someone who does the light brittle field today,
If you don't understand anything, it doesn't matter.
You just ask him, how much is your NOx?
That will make you feel that he thinks, oh, you might be an expert in this field.
That's why I'm going to put this thing on.
The definition of NOx is actually that it can absorb as much light as it can.
And then convert it into how many moles of electrons to participate in the reaction.
So, in theory, if a light can produce an electron to react,
This value will be at most one.
And then we're going to compare the light reflectors that we've tested in the lab before.
Compare it with the light reflectors in our factory.
Their quantum yaw is actually on a similar scale.
And then even the light reflectors in the factory,
His quantum yaw is better than him.
So we guess why he's better.
It's because in our design,
His light tube is actually in the reaction.
He's this box, he's going to be covered.
So he can effectively use all the functions to prevent the dissolution of light.
Okay, so the next study,
We're trying to make our materials better,
To make it more light efficient.
So, someone came up with a thing called titanium dioxide nano sheets.
This is the most traditional integrated Tl2.
If you actually magnify it to a large size,
It looks like this under the microscope.
An octahedron.
What about this octahedron?
It's our traditional titanium dioxide.
But there are scientists who have found that.
Let's call this side this direction.
You can see the definition of this XYZ.
X is called 110.
Y is our 010.
It's the same as our previous mathematical definition.
So we're going to call the yellow side the gold side of 001.
And then the red side is the gold side of 101.
So we see that the traditional titanium dioxide,
It's not actually exposed to the gold side of 001.
It's mostly the gold side of 101.
Scientists have found that the gold side of 001 is more responsive than the gold side of 101.
But it's because it's more responsive.
So it's actually not stable in thermodynamics.
So it's not easy to synthesize.
That's why the gold side of the tradition is mainly 101.
And then it looks like this.
So in our research, we want to go.
So in our research, we want to go.
Let him expose more of this 001 side.
Let him be more reflective.
And then by computer calculations.
They found that when we put the gold of TiO2,
The gold of TiO2,
It's a different element that can reduce its stomach.
That's the stomach of each of their gold surfaces.
The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.
The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.
And then they found that if they mixed the Fu element,
It can make this gold of 001 the most stable.
You can see that the black dot represents the gold of 001.
The black dot represents the gold of 001.
You can see that the black dot is actually lower than the white.
It means that its stomach is actually more stable.
And then for other elements,
It doesn't have the same effect.
So we try to...
So we try to...
So we try to...
The one above you is the image of the electronic microscope, right?
So you are actually...
I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.
I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.
But you use this, what is it called?
It's a single crystal, not a big one.
It's a single crystal, not a big one.
You mean the Taisha and Danjing?
Because you look like a small piece now.
But if you grow a crystal today,
It's the Tetra Hyperion you just made.
Grow it to a super perfect and super big one.
It's a single crystal as big as a fist.
It's a single crystal as big as a fist.
Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,
Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,
It's going to have a very small surface area.
Because it means it's a very large particle.
For our good reaction,
Surface area is a very important thing.
Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed
Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed
under each grain of material.
The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.
The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.
But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.
But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.
So we care about the surface area.
It's better to be very fine.
So your question is,
If the particles are too large, it means the surface area is very low.
So we want the particles to be smaller and better.
So you want to know why people make nanoparticles.
Because nanoparticles means the particles are small.
And nanoparticles means the surface area is high.
Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,
Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,
the quantum efficiency can be up to 30% or 40% or something like that.
But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.
But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.
They are combined into a perfect crystal.
This is what they are doing.
But for practical use,
they hope that the smaller the particle, the better.
I see. I understand. Thank you.
I have another question.
Someone asked,
Fu and Xi are not all black below?
Fu and Xi are not all black below?
Yes. So it means that Xi is also good.
If you use Xi to synthesize,
it will be more than 101.
But Fu's overall energy is lower.
Its scale is less than 0.
So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.
So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.
Both are good,
but Fu is better.
But a follow-up question.
If the industry is so big,
the cost should be much lower, right?
That's right.
This is more of a fundamental research.
If it is applied,
there will be a difference in cost.
Various facilities,
factories,
the cost of handling Xi should be very low.
You can imagine that Fu's amount of friction
accounts for about 0.1% of the overall cost.
So Fu is very little.
It's mainly the process of friction.
So the cost is not bad.
Yes. TI2 is very cheap.
So it's still OK.
OK. I'll go on.
So we actually
added some Fu atoms during the synthesis
to form the Titanium Nanosheets we just talked about.
This is obvious from the appearance.
SG is actually a
carbon dioxide that is synthesized in a traditional way.
So it's actually a granule.
Here we just
control the ratio of their precursors.
So they are all nanosheets.
You can see that they are obviously a granule structure.
Then
how do we
explain that
this surface is 001?
We will use TEM to explain that this surface is 001.
Because you can't say that you set this 001,
it's 001. You have to explain something.
Our method is to continue to magnify TEM.
Then if you
magnify it for the area, you can actually see their
diameter, their despacing.
According to the measurement, we know that their diameter
is about 0.239 nanometers.
So the despacing corresponded to
is actually the same as their
calculation value of 0.235.
Then we can say for sure
that this direction is
our 001 side.
This picture is actually the side picture.
In fact, we will look like this
from the side of it.
B and C are actually its covers.
So we can see that the top is actually
the 001 side.
Then we will use
XRD to confirm that our
service source is really involved in it.
XRD is for their
diameter.
XRD is made up of the analysis material by the diameter.
You can see
about 25-26 degrees.
You can find that
SG and P25 are actually
a traditional TIL2,
a traditional granulated TIL2.
Then their wind is probably in this position.
Then I use the line to mark this part.
In fact, you can find that these three are our
nanometers of our synthesis.
Their wind is actually deviated.
This deviation can actually point out that
because its flux is involved in its diameter,
in fact, if its diameter is getting bigger,
we are based on our Bragg law.
You can know that if the diameter is getting bigger,
the D spacing is getting bigger,
it will change its theta value,
so that the wind is deviated.
So we use XRD to confirm that
its flux is involved in its diameter.
Then this is
XRD's light-electromagnetic chart.
We can use this to analyze its
TIL.
Because TIL is an excess metal,
so in fact, TIL may exist in 2, 3, 4.
We want to know how many of them
exist in our carbon dioxide.
From this chart, we can find that
TIL is mainly a 4-car.
In fact, in our carbon dioxide plate,
we will find that it has more TIL.
This wind actually represents
TIL's wind.
Then after our calculation,
we can know that TIL's wind,
TIL's content is probably
about 20% for the plate.
Then we can find that
TIL is mainly a 4-car.
