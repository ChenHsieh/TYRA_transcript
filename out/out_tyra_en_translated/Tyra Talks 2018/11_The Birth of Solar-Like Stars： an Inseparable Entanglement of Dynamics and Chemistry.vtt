00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are approaching the end of the year, so we may not have a speech next week.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Yang Yaolun to tell us about his doctoral research.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is now a doctoral candidate for the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
In fact, he is about to graduate.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
When he was in college, he graduated from the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin, and then came to the United States to study astronomy.

00:42.000 --> 00:55.000
His specialties and research interests include early-phase star formation, including observations and simulations.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
In his doctoral research career, he has used various telescopes such as Herschel, ALMA, and SOFIA to do his research.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
What is interesting is that he is also the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
What kind of event is this?

01:14.000 --> 01:25.000
They will regularly give speeches to the public on astronomy at the bar.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
They have now grown to more than 250 people attending each time.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

01:36.000 --> 01:49.000
Today, he will talk about the topic of the birth of solar-like stars and the inseparable entanglement of dynamics and chemistry.

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
Let's welcome Dr. Yang Yaolun to give a speech.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Thank you.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I have been involved in this project for a long time.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Over the past few years, I have been doing research on star formation at UT Austin.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
I am a 6th-year PhD student at UT Austin.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
My main advisor is Neil Evans.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
We mainly do various observations on star formation.

02:36.000 --> 02:47.000
We use models to explain the physical and chemical phenomena observed in early star formation.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Dr. Yang mentioned SOFIA observations.

02:51.000 --> 03:00.000
What is SOFIA?

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observations for Infrared Astronomy.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
It is an astronomical observatory for infrared.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Why do we use SOFIA for infrared observation?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Because there are a lot of water vapors in the atmosphere.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
These water vapors emit a lot of infrared rays.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
When we observe on the ground, we only observe the water vapors on the earth.

03:27.000 --> 03:37.000
So, many times, we use a telescope, such as Spitzer or Hubble, to observe infrared rays.

03:37.000 --> 03:48.000
If I remember correctly, we can avoid 95% to 99% of water vapors by using a telescope.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
This is SOFIA.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
You can see that SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
You can see that there is a bulge in the middle section of the tail of the plane.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
It is not very clear here.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It is a hole in the middle section.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
A 2.7-meter telescope is placed in the hole.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
When the telescope flies up, the door will open.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
This is how it is observed.

04:21.000 --> 04:40.000
Astronomers and technicians discuss how to make the observation easier to achieve and adjust the strategy in time.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
This is how my advisor and I are going to get on the plane.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
It is very different.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
This is a military airport.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
When you enter the airport, you will go up the stairs.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
There is a B-2 bomber in the same airport.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
This is the inside of SOFIA.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
The blue part is the instrument.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
The other side of the closed cabin is the telescope.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
The other side of the telescope is the mirror.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
The other side is the instrument.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
There is a balance on the weight on both sides.

05:27.000 --> 05:42.000
Different instruments, telescopes, and mission operators monitor the observation on these stations.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
This is a very complicated task.

05:45.000 --> 06:00.000
NASA considers every flight of SOFIA as a mission.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
There is a mission director.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
There is a mission briefing before departure.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
This is the route we flew that day.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
We flew from Palmdale, California, about an hour and a half north of LA.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You can see that the route is very strange.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
Basically, the route is determined by each arc.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
One arc is for a target.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Here we have six or seven targets.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
The longer, the longer you stay on the celestial body.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Let's move on to today's topic.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Today's topic is mainly about star formation.

06:43.000 --> 06:54.000
How do we understand the dynamics of early planetary orbits and the corresponding chemical changes?

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
This is a picture of our galaxy.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
You can see a lot of these black irregularities in the middle.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
This is what we call Darkland.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
It has a lot of dust.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It is also a higher density place.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It is also an area where stars are forming.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
If we zoom in to one of them, the Molecular Cloud,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
It is mainly a star-forming place.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
These black areas are also the so-called dust gathering areas.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
It is a place where stars form early.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
If we switch to infrared light,

07:36.000 --> 07:45.000
You can see that there are a lot of these pillars or even what we call filamentary structures.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
These are from what we imagine as a celestial sphere on Earth.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
It's like a sphere in the sky, but it's not a ball or even a block here.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
It's more like a texture or a filamentary structure.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Then through these filaments,

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Then pull to the middle and then reach a high enough density.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Then trigger the activity of this star formation.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
This is when the star formation occurs.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
You will have a lot of.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Basically, the density will be from 10 to 3 or 10 to 5.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
This is the mole per cubic centimeter.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
It will be quickly multiplied by 10 to the power of 9 to the power of 10 to the power of 4.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
This is a very large number of changes.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
In the process, if you have, um.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
At the beginning, um.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
When the collapse, um.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You're going to have a little bit of, uh.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The angular momentum is in the outermost part.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
If you have this smaller angular momentum, it's in a very small area.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
At this time, the degree of rotation is likely to make this.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
The collapse of the star formation is not very effective.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That is to say, your, uh.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The gas becomes itself to rotate there, not to continue.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Continue, uh.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's sucked into the middle of the star.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
In the process, there will be a lot of.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
We call outflow, and then go.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Go to these, um.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
The high-speed rotation of the matter is released.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And then go in to reduce.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
The angular momentum of the whole system.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
You see the green ones here.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
The matter that looks like a jet is the outflow.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, this is a simulation.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That is, um, a simulation.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Roughly describe that we are from a filament.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
And then slowly, uh, develop into.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It will start with a filament, and then zoom in.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And then you'll see a star.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
The early shape of the star.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
The situation is a lot of molecules.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Very, very fatal molecules.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
How to be in that state.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And then, um.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Collapse and then erupt.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
That's what you saw in the picture just now.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
This kind of outflow.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
OK, so you can see this whole process.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Is very, very.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Very big change, and then, um.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Irregular structure.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
So.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
We also found in observation.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
That's what it is.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You can see here, this one.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The picture behind this black and white picture is.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Uh, the distribution of molecules.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
This is.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And then the different symbols in front of it.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
It means that we are directly observed.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Early star.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Uh, where it appears.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You can see most of it.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Early stars are in, um.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
These molecules.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Uh, it's also a more fatal place, so it's produced.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So, um.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
We can probably get one of these.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Uh, scenario is to say that you first have a lot of very fatal clouds and dust.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then through.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Um, these clouds and dust may slowly or even quickly.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Um.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
It will collapse to the middle and then become.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Uh, a star or a few stars, I don't know.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
So in this process, a very important thing is to say.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, this is probably a very simple one.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Uh, cartoon pattern to express the words is that we have a, uh, a core at the beginning.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
We call pre-stereo core.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Simply put, it's the core before the stellar.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So it's called pre-stereo core.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And then you start to collapse.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
These core collapse to the middle and become, uh.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Uh, in the early days, it was called pro-star.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
So we called this core pro-stereo core.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
At the same time, it may, uh.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Um.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
It produces a lot of, uh, these.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
These flow, this orange side is called the flow.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
What about the evolution?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
These substances.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
The surrounding matter is either sucked into the middle and becomes a part of the star.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Or.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It will be affected by a lot of feedback.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
And then it just.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It's just slowly, uh, dissipated.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And then the rest of you are left with a disk.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Because.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
There's still a lot of matter, um, in the middle.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The middle part of the high-speed rotation.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
There's no way it's very direct.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It's sucked into the middle, uh, on the planet.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So there's a disk.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
What about this side?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
This disk is, um, planet.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
It's where the stars are produced.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So gradually, this disk will slowly evolve into, uh.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Generally, we recognize the planter system.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Just like.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Our solar system, we may be somewhere here.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Okay, um.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So we, uh.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
There's a pretty important one.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Uh, the question is, is this.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
In the early days of this info, from this.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
When you want to produce a pro star.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
What?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Uh, it's like a process like this.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
How much is his time scale?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay, um.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
In the pre-status evolution, it's not quite certain now.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So basically.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Um.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
If a core starts to collapse.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Production process to become, uh.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Just from, uh.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Core pre-status.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
This is probably.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
2 million years.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Relatively short.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Then it disappears from disk to disk.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
It's probably 10 million years.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
And then one, one, for example, like our sun, our sun.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
About 10 million years.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
So this is probably their time.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
It's 1% and 1%.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Then I have another question.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Uh, that's it.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
That's one of these.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Uh, how do you say this?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
One of these processes.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
With the limit, for example, is the model universe.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Or, for example.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Z equals 3, z equals 5.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Or something like that.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Or these things will only happen in the near future.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So there is no difference.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I'm talking about the near future.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, the near future is actually.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
It's just that it happens, but it happens in the early days.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
That even has a lot of.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
A lot of active research areas are doing the so-called first star.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
It's the first star that starts the earliest.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That's one of the biggest differences.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Uh.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
It's in the core.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Um.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
This core, a dance core, he wants to collapse.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
He doesn't need to, uh.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It doesn't have to be dynamic.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
If he is, uh.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
The temperature is very high, he is very.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
His thermal motion is very strong, so he.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
His thermal pressure, he can.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
It's easy to be greater than this.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
This gravity gives him this middle attraction, so.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Um, when the temperature is very high, it's not easy to collapse.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
That's why he has to be cold enough to collapse.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
What about in the early universe?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Um, I should say, um.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Um, how do you make this?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
This core becomes very cold.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Usually a very important mechanism is called, uh.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Basically, uh.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Your energy, uh, is absorbed by molecules, and then molecules.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Decay.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Decay, and then it becomes radiation.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
The radiation goes out, and the energy leaves the system.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
So you, you will slowly become cold.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
That molecule or.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Um.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
It's just more.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
In addition to hydrogen, these atoms are more useful for cooling.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
That's relative to the early universe.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
This cool will be weaker.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
So, in the early universe, everyone will think that your core can become.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
It can grow very big, and then.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
And then it's easy to form a super big quality.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
And so on.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
I believe that now we have not yet observed anything.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
But there should be a lot of simulation to do this part.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Ok, thank you.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Ok, so, um.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
So, from an observational point of view, we want to know.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Hey, how does this collapse happen?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
What kind of mold does this material go through?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
From the outside of this core.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
The outer region is transferred to the inner region.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
That's like in this simulation, which is simulating.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
How does this core collapse?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
And then.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
In the end.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
You can see that the middle of this collapse is very, very short at the beginning.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Compared to the time after that.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
So, you can see the same thing as the previous one.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You can see that it is very irregular.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
And so it means that there may be a lot of structures in it.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Different structures, different modes.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
It depends on the angle you look at.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It may be outflow.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Other places may see it as info.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
So, um.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
For the measurement of this info.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
We mainly want to know how this info started.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
And then how he did it.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
For example, how far is he?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
How big is the size scale?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
How do you start?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
For example, how big does this core need to grow at what temperature?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
He will start to have info.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
How is his process?

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
How fast does he increase as the radius gets smaller and smaller?

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Or even not increase, so the radius gets smaller and smaller.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It may be slower or faster.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
So how did he evolve in the end?

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
This rotation dominant region.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
It's more like a disc.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
An early disc.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
A region like that.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
How did he go from the original radio motion to the rotation?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So, um.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Through this view, we want to know.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
What is the model of this info?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
We have a way to write a very good model.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
To simulate this part.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
And then there's the chemical change.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
How do you change with this info?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I'll talk more about this later.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Let's talk about it now.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And then in a bigger structure.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Um.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This info is actually.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
For our so-called initial mass function.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Very important.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
What is the initial mass function?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
It's a bit like.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Um.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
We're going to build a galaxy now.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Build a star system.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
My inside.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Various quality stars.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
What's the ratio?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
This is called the initial mass function.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
There may be smaller mass stars, smaller mass stars, more.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
That's one.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Uh.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Mass distribution is the initial mass function.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
That.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
But these initial mass functions are mainly refers to.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Uh, already generated stars.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
So we.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
In the early days, in the space travel, we really want to know.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Okay, if we have.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
This kind of big and small.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Different sizes of core.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
What kind of stars will these cores become?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Between them.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Core mass distribution and initial mass distribution.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Uh, what is the mass distribution of the star?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Change.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
So we hope that in the future, through this understanding, this info model can.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Can.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
There are some hints that say, OK, if we have a core, it may be.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
A solar mass.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
That may be how many percent will become.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Uh.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
How much will the middle star be?

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Is that what we want?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I can go through this model.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
This research.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Go to approach.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Ultimately approach this problem.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
How do we go from this blue core mass function to this?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Dashboard, all kinds of different dashboards.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Uh, initial mass function.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
The other thing is that we are now in the early days.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Uh, these are also seeing a lot of binary systems.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And in the general, uh.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Already formed a star, we also know.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Uh.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Most of the stars are binary, that is.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Uh, double star or more.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Uh, multiple system.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Then we also saw this situation in the early days.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
That.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
You want to know how this early star.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Uh, how can it form such a binary system?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Then this.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
This binary system is for this info or what impact.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
Or say, what kind of criterion do you want to reach for the mass of your info?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
What kind of threshold will trigger such fragmentation?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Fragment into.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Different 2 or 3 or more sources.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
So we want to know.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Uh.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
This initial condition, what is it?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
How big is it?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Then it is, how much is its quality?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Then I hope we can get to know how much.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
How much mass will be in the middle?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
How much will be retained in the middle?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
OK, this is another, uh, this is a very.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
The system has three, three, three stars in the middle.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
So we still don't know why it's like this.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
OK, the other part is.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Hey, we're like this, this.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
MWC480, this, this disk, you see a lot of this kind of structure.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
But in addition, we also see a lot of different.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Uh, more complex, like this.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Or this is different.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Um.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Uh, more large molecules of organic compounds.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
That, uh, we were in the early, uh.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Uh, the core stage also saw a lot of these, uh.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Organic chemicals, these.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Organic chemicals, because organic chemicals, ultimately, they will become.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
It will enter the interstitial atmosphere, and then it may be.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Trigger, uh.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
The main part of the life cycle, because these organic chemicals may be.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
In addition to speaking more broadly, it may even be the first step of life.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Or even the seed of life.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So we want to know that in the early stage of this core evolution.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
How do these chemicals change with the information?

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Um, the same, I'm going to do a lot of explanation in the back.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
OK, so our goal is to find out how this information happened.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Then we are in the way we are currently using it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
We are, uh, trying to measure, uh.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
To measure, uh.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Uh, the performance of, uh.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Kinematic structure is simply through his.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
The shape of the line to analyze that in the end, his.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Uh, we look at this line of sight inside.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
What is the path of the movement of the gas?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
So.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Here, if we look at it from this antenna,

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
On the left, this is a very simplified one.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Core of the information.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
One of the more common models is the middle of the information.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
The velocity is higher than the outside of the information.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
So you can simplify this thing.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Like this picture on the right.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
This, uh, red is, uh.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
We look at the path.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Because he only has this radio motion.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
So you can, uh, you can draw a circle like this.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
And then they, uh.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
The line of sight above the two points is exactly the same.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
It means that you will have two, you will have two groups of gas.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
And then they, for you, his, uh.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
What is it called?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Uh, the cutoff speed is the same.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Uh, but they are in different places.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Then this will cause, uh.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Simplified, it will cause a double profile like this on the left.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
That.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Um.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Right, that's it.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And then you have this middle absorption.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
This is from a relatively cold gas on the outside.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Maybe it's a cold gas in front of you.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
And then the stronger radiation that comes in behind the absorption.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Because you're cold in front of you.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
So you're easier to get excited, and then your radiation is absorbed by this colder material.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
You look at this.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
So, um, if you have a higher resolution.

23:46.000 --> 23:55.000
You can see, uh, like this, like this, if this purple area is our telescope beam.

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
Uh, you can see the cold gas out there, but it's still moving to the center.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
It's still falling on to the center.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
So, uh, this kind of, uh, cold gas will give you one.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
It's not in, it's not in, uh, source velocity, an absorption.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
It's a redshift because it's far away from you.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
And then it's going to cause this redshift, this absorption, and it's going to change like this.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
So this is basically the profile we want to see.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
We want to measure a profile like this.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And then, um.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
And then when you, uh, in the back, we have this in the middle.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
There's a, um, continuous source in the middle of every collapsing star.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
It might be, uh, the hottest part of the disk.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
The temperature is very high.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
It might be a few thousand degrees.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
And then it just gives you a very strong blackbody radiation.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
So if you put it on, this radiation, this, um.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
Radiation, continuous radiation will also be absorbed by the colder material in front of it.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It's going to be absorbed.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
So in the end, you're going to get something like this.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Continuous originally your continuous may be flat, but in the middle of the part.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Uh, because you have a material that's far away from you, you're in this velocity, so you're going to be absorbed by a part of it.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
So what you actually see, uh, observation in your telescope, observation of the profile will probably look like this.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Just simply add the two just now.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
So when you, if we're in, uh, according to this, uh, two.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
The front and back of the continuum, the level to correct it, uh, take the continuum away, you'll get this.

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
A strange one, uh, line profile is simply that you, we'll see, uh, the middle absorption is less than 0.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You have two radiations less than 0.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
That's not really because we assume the continuum in the middle.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Still, uh.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
It's the same level as other places, but it's actually partially absorbed.

25:50.000 --> 25:57.000
So, uh, we basically want to measure a line profile like this, and then analyze the line profile like this.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
To understand that we, uh.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
I've seen this line of sight before.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Uh.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
What is the model of the gas movement?

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
I want to ask a question.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Hey, that.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
Why is that profile?

26:17.000 --> 26:23.000
That is, these profiles are not symmetrical to that.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
Okay, okay, this is the part I just skipped.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Uh.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Okay, if we go back to the two circles on the right, this picture.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
Um, in the middle, I write this high high temperature, which is more central.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
And then on both sides, which is, uh.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
Large radius is the place where the temperature is lower.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
Then you can think of it as, um, in this.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Uh.

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
In your foreground, in front of you, your foreground is your red foreground material, which is red shift.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
It's just that it's falling to the center, so it's red shift to you.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
But in this red shift, this part.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
You will have, uh.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
High temperature in the back, low temperature in the front.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
It means that you are more like you have a cold thing in front of a hot thing.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So this cold thing will absorb the back.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
The hot gas gives you the radiation.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Uh, but in the blue shift part, which is on the back side of the envelope.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You will, you, you don't have this situation.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
It's just that the cold stuff is behind the hot stuff.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
So you don't have this kind of self-absorption.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
So that's why the red shift peak is lower.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Then continue.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Why is it the same shape over there?

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
Because the continuum is in the middle.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
Imagine a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
So continue.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
Only in the red part.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
It's going to be absorbed because the front of the continue doesn't have any blue shift.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Oh, I see.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Ok, thank you.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Um.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, so about 20 years ago, people started measuring this kind of profile.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And then this is usually measured with a wireless telescope.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
That was usually used in the past.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's like this.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
Uh, we usually think of this little ear or bigger.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Maybe it's a 10 meter telescope or a 10 meter dish.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
Then go to measure these different molecules, and then try to measure the profile.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
But you can see here, the first one, in addition to the sensitivity.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Uh, it's not very good.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
There are a lot of different structures.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
He has a lot of this kind of broad line.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Or even you don't have a very obvious absorption.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
Even the most important thing is that you don't have less than 0.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
So no less than 0.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
The most important thing is that this absorption is very likely to be.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Uh, you're in front of this source.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Other completely unrelated to you.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
You have no way to say.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Um, this absorption is not true.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It belongs to what you see now.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
If you can see this absorption.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Uh.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Drop to 0.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
It becomes negative.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
You can find a way to move your telescope.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
And then you can say, okay, if I move away from the middle, this has a continuous source.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
See if there's any change in this absorption.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
You can be more.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Uh, sure.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Make sure that this absorption material is really associated.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The key is that it really belongs to what you see.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
This kind of course.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
So, because of the relationship between Resolution and Sensitivity.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
Uh, this question was broadly studied about 20 years ago.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
Maybe 5 to 10 years later, everyone thought, okay, it's almost done.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
You can't do it yourself anymore.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
So just wait.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Um.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
Uh, the new generation of this Auma wireless wave array.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
Uh, there's no way to have a better observation result.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
So what is Auma?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Auma is, uh.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Uh, Akitama large millimeter sub array.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
It is a wireless wave array on the Akitama desert plateau in Chile.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
And then.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
It's mainly.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
There should be 66 antennas.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
It's probably like this bigger antenna on the outside.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Each antenna is a 12 meter antenna.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
There's a smaller one in the middle.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Another, uh, separate array.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Uh, it's 7 meters.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Then it is.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
Uh, it's basically a collaboration around the world.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
The United States is NRAO.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Oh, that's not NRAO.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
That's NRC.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
NRC is Canada's National Research Council.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
And then Japan's NLJ.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Europe's ESO.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Taiwan is A, uh, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Uh, there's participation.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And then there's Chile.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
And then this is open to the world.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Um.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Astronomers can apply to observe.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
That he mainly.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Uh, the biggest bonus is that he can have a very, very good resolution.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
His.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
He can see very, very small things.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
So basically the array is.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
Uh, the telescope is, uh, your resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Uh, you.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The diameter of your telescope.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
The wireless wave array is simply a mirror.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Cut.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Cut into a lot of little ones.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Uh, a different telescope.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
So you can pull the two telescope very far.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
As a telescope to use.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
So this is the biggest.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
This.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Uh, baseline is called baseline.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Simply put, his diameter can be up to 15, 15 kilometers.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Yeah, it can be analyzed to a very small area.

31:27.000 --> 31:38.000
Ok, so at the beginning of this, we started with two more similar profiles that we just drew at the beginning.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Like the left side, this is a.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
This is a, uh.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Organic molecules.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Uh, what is the Chinese name?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
The English is.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Uh.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
This, this.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.000
You can see if we take it off, you can see this.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
Go below 0, and then you can see that his absorption is in the red.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
You've lost it.

32:00.000 --> 32:08.000
And then the same thing, in this other source, and then we've seen something similar, but in these two cases.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
These are all relatively small, because the first one on the left is an organic molecule, so his.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
He may be in those early stars.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Uh, the abundance is not so high.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Uh, not much, so the image is relatively weak.

32:23.000 --> 32:32.000
Then, like the one on the right, this is a relatively dark source, so it's not so high, so its absorption is relatively small.

32:33.000 --> 32:41.000
That's what I'm doing, and I'm mainly using it, uh, to give another source, which is this.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
And then go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Uh, uh.

32:50.000 --> 33:01.000
And then go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
It's all about, uh, different different dust and gas.

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
Uh, in the infographic, you can see he has a beautiful outflow, radio, you can see the beautiful outflow.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
It actually has two sources in the middle.

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
So, here, we're just focusing on irs1, which is the main source.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
Okay, so when we were in alma cycle 4, we proposed, and then we got our data.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
It looks like this on the right.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
It's very much like the way it was drawn before, especially this hcl plus.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
This curve is basically the same as the one you saw earlier.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Then you can see here, although, um.

33:38.000 --> 33:46.000
This absorption is very wide, but you can see that he's actually in, uh, redshift.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Velocity still has more absorption, which means that he's actually part of it.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
It comes from, um, the gas that's falling in the middle.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Absorption.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Um.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Okay, so to analyze this curve, we actually need to use one.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
We can't just read it out of this.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
Okay, this absorption is in, maybe it's in 0.5 kilometers per second.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
And then you'll know.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
Uh, you might know there's something in 0.5 kilometers per second falling in.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
But you don't know if he's in the place where you're looking at this line of sight.

34:26.000 --> 34:32.000
That's because you have absorption and emission mixed together, so we have to, um.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
Use a very common technique in astronomy, which is ready to transfer the calculation to find a way.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
Um, to model the way we see it.

34:42.000 --> 34:49.000
That's a simple way to say, uh, if I'm here every time, this is a function.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
It's a, it's a gas.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
You might have radiation coming in on the left.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
So what about the radiation?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
It's going to be in this gas.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
He may be absorbed by the gas.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
You're going to become weak.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
Or after you've been absorbed, or you've been in this gas, it's actually very hot, so he's got some.

35:06.000 --> 35:12.000
Uh, he's got some black radiation, or he's got some of his own radiation, so he's probably going to have an emission.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
So, in the transition of these energies, he's probably going to be part of it.

35:17.000 --> 35:23.000
It's the temperature of this gas, or, uh, it's the level population of different molecules in the inside.

35:23.000 --> 35:30.000
He's probably going to turn it from a high-frequency state to a high-frequency state, and then it's going to be a high state.

35:30.000 --> 35:38.000
The high state will even put some molecules, just break up the molecules into smaller molecules, or even into atoms or even into particles.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
So you can do this in your mother's face.

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
And then you can go in and say, I've got a line coming in, and it's going to cause some kind of result to my gas and dust, and then you go to the end.

35:52.000 --> 35:59.000
In the end, you put each of your mother's from the beginning to the end, and then you can know what comes out of it.

35:59.000 --> 36:08.000
Uh, radiation to the end, uh, we observed what it should look like, and then, uh, through, uh.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
The process of more than once, and then to get a better model to explain what we saw in front of us.

36:14.000 --> 36:24.000
So, in fact, what we do is very tedious, but it's also, um.

36:25.000 --> 36:31.000
Um, it's actually okay, it's actually not that tedious, but it's a lot of iteration, uh, a lot of iterative process.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
Basically, after we have a model, we can get it, we can say, okay, our, our.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
What does it look like? Um.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Info this, uh, velocity should look like.

36:42.000 --> 36:49.000
We can throw it into, uh, different radio transfer models to do, uh, here we put gas and.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Separate because basically.

36:52.000 --> 36:59.000
Um, first of all, we use, uh, uh, continuous part of the rain.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
To go to, uh.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
To constrain this whole envelope structure, for example, this envelope.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Um, his, uh.

37:08.000 --> 37:18.000
What is the density, so what changes with the radius, how much of his outflow area, his, uh, angle is, how much is his angle.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Then, when we determine this envelope structure.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Let's put it in and then calculate it.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
Okay, if we follow this structure, follow this kinematic, what should the spectrum we get look like?

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Okay, so, um, this is what we did before, uh, the model.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Here, uh, you can see this is, uh.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
This is.

37:42.000 --> 37:42.500
This is.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
The spectrum behind this.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
The gray line is the spectrum, and then this is about.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
Uh, 2 microns, 3 microns, up to 1 millimeter range.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
Then.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Fang, uh.

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
The blue circle is our model, and then the red square is observation.

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
You can see that most of us are going to fit through this, and we're going to fit our model to this observation.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
And then we'll get a better model to describe this envelope.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
For example, like I'm drawing here, but in fact, how do we construct it like this?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
What is the angle of his outflow?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
What is the density distribution of the envelope?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Okay, so you don't want to show off.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
It's more like it's coming out of the outflow, and then it's coming out of the envelope.

38:37.000 --> 38:46.000
Okay, so, um, I mentioned earlier that we're going to take this envelope structure, and we're going to add kinematics, and we're going to figure out how to model this.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
Uh, but in fact, one of the very, very important, uh, factors is chemistry.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
So chemistry is not.

38:53.000 --> 38:59.000
Uh, well, so chemistry is not just thinking, okay, what molecules are you going to have in there, but molecules like this.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Is it possible to exist in that condition?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
In the atmosphere, you can see it, especially in.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
Um, these dense core, the density in the middle is very high, and the temperature is quite low.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
So it's possible to be frozen on top of these dust.

39:14.000 --> 39:21.000
If it freezes, you, you, you, you, you can't see it in the atmosphere.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
So here's the different chemical abundance profile.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
You might be out there, you might have, uh, the radiation from other places.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

39:32.000 --> 39:41.000
You might have to separate it and make it two different things, or maybe he's in there, and he'll be that ice will be frozen on the dust, or he'll be in here.

39:41.000 --> 39:47.000
It interacts with some electrically charged molecules, and then it generates other particles, and then it disappears.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
So you don't measure it.

39:48.000 --> 39:56.000
And in the middle of that, we're going to go to the main thing I've been doing a lot of time lately, and then we're going to say, what do we want to do?

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
A better abundance profile to explain our data.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
So, uh, basically, we need to understand this info profile.

40:06.000 --> 40:14.000
Uh, we're going to take our dust model to get density, temperature, and velocity, and then we're going to add our chemical bonus.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
Uh, we're going to find a way.

40:17.000 --> 40:25.000
Uh, get a hat spectrum, compare it, if you don't feel good, we'll go back and change it. So this is a very.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Uh, a long process.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Uh, this is us.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Uh, hey.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Um, uh, yeah, that's good.

40:35.000 --> 40:48.000
My question is, um, like this, in this kind of small system, uh, that kind of info or the final outflow of the gravity distribution is all considered.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Is it just normal?

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
That matter is good.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
If there's a dark matter, he can't say anything about it.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It doesn't really matter.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
And.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
I'm not sure if it's going to be in the early universe.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
But at least in the modern universe.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
Uh, the general assumption is that dark matter is mainly in the outer galaxy.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
So I rarely.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I heard that.

41:15.000 --> 41:24.000
Uh, dark matter will affect the evolution of these, at least in the region.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
So I don't think there's much of an impact.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Because that's what I think.

41:32.000 --> 41:39.000
If today, in some kind of dark matter, with their own strong interacting, then there will be some small structures.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
For example, it's a clumpy phenomenon.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Maybe it's possible, but I don't think I can see it.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Yes, it should be impossible to see.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
If you have a dark matter, it should be a very, very small scale.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
That might be something like microlensing.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
So, uh.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
So, in a system like this, it should be impossible to see.

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
The current observation should be very far away.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Maybe there will be, but it's hard.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Okay, thank you.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
OK, so, uh.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
This is like this, this is like me.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
This is our latest profit.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
The latest model is actually about two days ago.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
Uh, on the right side, uh, blue is our data.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Orange is our current model.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
And then you see our model.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Roughly captured data.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
The feeling but you can see, for example, in Russian, we still miss a lot of emissions.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So, uh.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
This is actually our status now.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
In the future, we should continue to do more.

42:50.000 --> 42:57.000
Uh, different tuning, and then even to understand that there is no way to make up for this part of the missing mission.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
And then.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
To understand that it is possible to say, um.

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
Well, of course, our current model is very, very symmetrical, so basically it is a symmetric model.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
That, um.

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
The first one is to understand that, OK, if in this very strong assumption, we have no way to make this model.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Make this model better.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
What if it doesn't work?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
How do we break this?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
This assumption.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
And it's not going to create too much freedom.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
And it becomes, OK, you can say whatever you want.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Um.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
So, uh, this is probably the main thing I'm going to do in the next month or two.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
And on the left side of the show, this picture is.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
Uh, basically, it's like.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Uh, if you look.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
This is a map.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
Then if you take the middle continuous source, it will be like this.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
This dark place in the middle is the continuous source.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
After being removed, it causes a very strong absorption.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
It's like you see this very strong absorption on the right.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
So when you get close to it, it becomes negative.

43:57.000 --> 44:04.000
And then the two bright spots up and down are because you have an outflow, so the outflow is up.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Uh, up and down in this direction, so there's an outflow.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Uh.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
Uh, the density is relatively low, so it's easier to be heated, so it's brighter.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
OK, so why does this info affect this chemistry?

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
That is to say, uh, simply put, if there's a group of gas, now it's going to come from the outside of this envelope.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
It's travel, you're affected by the infogravity, and you can't travel to the middle.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
And then falling to this star or disk.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
It will pass through different temperatures in the middle.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's getting hotter and hotter in the middle.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Basically, it's getting hotter and hotter because there's a pro star in the middle.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Pro star is emitting a very strong emission.

44:45.000 --> 44:52.000
So, but this info can manage is determined by saying, OK, I have this group of gas.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
This gas will take a long time in different temperature ranges.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
If it's very slow, it might take a long time in every place.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
Well, or even if it's in a relatively low temperature, it takes a long time.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Or in a relatively high temperature, it will take a long time.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
That will affect, uh, at different temperatures, it will affect, uh.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
It should be said that at different temperatures, the chemical reaction that you can generate is different.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
And the time scale of each chemical reaction is different.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
If you're in a low temperature, although you have a lot of low temperature chemical reactions,

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
But if you only spend a short time in a low temperature,

45:27.000 --> 45:35.000
Then those reactions won't cause any changes to the chemical state of those molecules.

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
So, another way to see is to say, uh, we're actually using these molecules.

45:42.000 --> 45:49.000
The radiation to track the dynamic in this envelope.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Well, if we don't know where these molecules are going to be,

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
our interpretation is going to be incorrect.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
So, the other thing I was talking about earlier,

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
these, uh, these dynamic evolution will also affect the chemical reactions that you can produce.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
So, these two are a bit like interaction.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
It's like being bundled together.

46:09.000 --> 46:15.000
It's hard for you to separate one from each other.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
So, here's what I'm talking about.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
For example, in the first question, you might have a lot of free.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
You know, you have a lot of deterioration.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Your H will become very low.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
And then, in the so-called medium tension,

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
you're going to have a lot of different chemical reactions on the surface of this dust.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
And that's going to cause the chemistry, the chemistry, the chemistry model.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
People will tell you that this is going to produce a lot of different species.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
And now, when it's high temperature, when it's 100 Kelvin,

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
uh, you're going to have a lot of different species on top of this dust.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Maybe it's because the temperature is getting higher, so it's coming out.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So, it's going to affect what you're seeing.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
These different bonds are going to be at different temperatures, and there's going to be different changes.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
So, basically, uh, in the early days, there were two.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
So far, we've observed that there are two different kinds of, uh, source.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
One is called Hocker.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
You know, and then there's Warren Carpenter Molecule Source.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
Uh, Warren Carpenter Molecule Source is a, uh,

47:43.000 --> 47:54.000
uh,

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
uh,

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
uh,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
uh,

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
uh,

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
uh,

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
uh,

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
uh,

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
uh,

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
uh,

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
uh,

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
uh,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
uh.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
Warren Carpenter Molecule Source is, uh,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
a,

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
