Q&A

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello, I am today's representative host, Zhang Yanyong, because our host, Zhang Jianyuan, he is actually more suitable, because he is doing Qubits, doing condensed matter, but he is now stuck on the road, he has no time for transportation, so I will represent the host.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me introduce our speaker today. Our speaker today is Dr. Zeng Yuqing. The topic he is going to talk to us today is ... I want to read it right, wait a minute, I suddenly can't find it, wait a minute, wait a minute.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Topological quantum phase transitions in Haldane spin chains. This is a very popular topic, because in 2016 or 2017, Topological Matter won the Nobel Prize, so we have always hoped that we could invite an expert to introduce to us what topological phases are.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then, Zeng Yuqing, in 2005, got a college degree from Donghai University, a physics major, right? Then he went to serve in the military, and then served in the military for 1.5 years, but he served in the military at Donghai University. Why?

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
After I served in the military, I returned to Donghai University as a research assistant.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then there is a published paper in PRB, if you are interested, because I don't have that number, so you can directly ask our speaker for this thing. Then he transferred to Central University and completed his Ph.D. degree. The main function is also condensed matter theory.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:46,000
At present, Zeng Yuqing is at the University of Kent in the UK, and he is now focusing on numerical study on the time-reversal invariant fractional topological insulator. This is a very hot topic, so we don't have much to say, we applaud and welcome today's speaker. Oh, if you want to applaud or ask a question, remember to turn on the microphone.

9
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's get started. Today I prepared some props.

10
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have some props. You can play with some props later.

11
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will talk about some of the things I have done before, which will be more professional. First of all, what is physics?

12
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What we mainly learn in physics is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is like classical mechanics, which is mechanics, or kinetic mechanics of electricity, quantum mechanics, thermal mechanics, and statistical mechanics.

13
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This whole thing is actually studying the interaction between time, space, and matter. The interaction between matter has, for example, strong, weak, electromagnetic, or gravity.

14
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can take the whole world, these substances, as if they were actors on stage. The stage is the background between time and space, and there will be some interaction between the actor and the actor.

15
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The whole thing will form a movie or a stage play.

16
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What about matter? This is from when I was very young, for example, in high school or elementary school, I learned that we can classify matter in this way.

17
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:45,000
First, divide it into solid matter or mixtures. Mixtures, such as beer, milk tea, or air, are mixtures.

18
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
For example, alcohol, water, and many other substances, such as beer, flowers, and so on.

19
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
For example, most of the air is 4 out of 5 gas, and 1 out of 5 oxygen, for example.

20
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Pure matter can be divided into elements and mixtures. For example, the elements in the cycle table, such as gold, iron, oxygen, and O2.

21
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For example, the previously well-known graphene, which is basically carbon.

22
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:45,000
For example, alcohol is a mixture of alcohol and water.

23
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Alcohol has a chemical form, such as CH3CH2OH, which is alcohol.

24
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Chlorine is also a mixture of pure matter.

25
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oxygen is also a mixture of pure matter.

26
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For example, ice is water, which is the solid of water.

27
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ice is also pure matter, which is H2O.

28
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This classification is probably a little bit of preliminary understanding of matter.

29
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
To understand this understanding further, we can see that matter has many states.

30
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This state is called phase.

31
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There is a change between the phase and the phase, which is called phase change.

32
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:01,000
For example, the ice or water we just talked about is under pressure in the horizontal axis and temperature in the vertical axis.

33
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, at the bottom of atmospheric pressure, below 0 Â° C, it is solid.

34
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This side will be liquid and this side will be gas.

35
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The red line is from here, it will pass through a waste point and then become water vapor.

36
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
From here, it will pass through this ice point and solidify into ice.

37
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For example, this picture.

38
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Of course, you can't see the water vapor with your naked eye.

39
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because the water vapor is transparent and colorless.

40
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If it is connected to this water drop on the glass, it will become a liquid.

41
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can see that this is water.

42
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the water we usually see.

43
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ice is solid.

44
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This picture is in our present.

45
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's snowing in the UK recently, and it's cold.

46
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
After the snow, many people want to do an experiment.

47
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Put the liquid nitrogen on the snowman and then destroy it.

48
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
See what the result is.

49
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In short, this picture of water should have been seen in elementary school.

50
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know if there is any problem.

51
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If not, I want to emphasize that there is a critical point here.

52
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The meaning of this critical point is that if the temperature and pressure are very high from here to the critical point, you will not be able to distinguish whether the water is a liquid or a gas.

53
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After this critical point, there is no red line.

54
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The red line on the left has been extended.

55
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This point stops at this critical point.

56
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So if this side is gas, this side is liquid, this side is solid.

57
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This line completely separates solid and liquid.

58
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But here you can adjust the temperature and pressure appropriately.

59
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then let it slowly go around this critical point from here.

60
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then enter another item.

61
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In other words, the phase of the liquid and the phase of the gas are the same phase.

62
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The three-dimensional picture of water here is actually only two phases.

63
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There are only two images like this.

64
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There should be no problem.

65
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is a relaxing video.

66
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:59,000
A few days ago, we put the liquid and gas on the snowman.

67
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Many people came to see.

68
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are about 100 people here.

69
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Other dramas have come to see.

70
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think this is interesting.

71
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You can see that gas is also a pure material.

72
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Pure materials have three-dimensional pictures of water like just now.

73
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now pour out the liquid and gas.

74
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The liquid and gas are about 70K.

75
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's about 100 degrees below zero.

76
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The temperature of the ice is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.

77
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The temperature of the liquid and gas is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.

78
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It turned the ice into a lower temperature.

79
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If you look at the image of the water just now, it is still solid.

80
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's about it.

81
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What is a phase?

82
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What does this material mean?

83
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You have an external parameter.

84
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For example, you just saw that there is temperature and pressure.

85
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Under the external parameter, the material is in a huge state, a macro state.

86
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are the external parameters?

87
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,000
For example, temperature pressure, magnetic field, or external control, external control.

88
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
For example, you add a power plant.

89
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or you use other elements to replace these compounds.

90
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You do some mixing.

91
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This mixing can also be regarded as an external parameter.

92
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Mainly these parameters, you do these modifications.

93
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It will affect these, because the material is composed of those atoms.

94
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It is composed of those particles.

95
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If you modify these external parameters, it will affect the interaction between the particles.

96
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If it affects the interaction between the particles, it will have different phases.

97
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The higher the temperature, the more chaotic the material is.

98
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But if you have an interaction, the material may have a different order.

99
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What is a macro state?

100
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
For example, the three-phase change just now.

101
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That is, the liquid, solid, and gas.

102
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But it is not that only the liquid, solid, and gas are a macro state.

103
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
For example, conductivity.

104
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Conductivity is also a macro state.

105
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Magnetic field is also a macro state.

106
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
For example, mercury.

107
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In 1911, it was discovered by Ernst that when the temperature dropped very low, it suddenly became a superconductor.

108
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This conductivity is its conductor.

109
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
For example, the horizontal axis is the temperature.

110
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,000
When the temperature is very high, the temperature is absolute.

111
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
From this place, you can see that there is a conductor here to meet the Ohm's law.

112
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The lower the temperature, the smaller the conductor, but there is still a conductor.

113
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But when the temperature is about 4K or 4.2K, the conductor suddenly disappears to almost none.

114
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It is completely none.

115
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This can be regarded as a phase change.

116
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because this is a macro state, the whole change.

117
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Because there is a conductor here, there is no conductor here at all.

118
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Here is the general conductor.

119
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
On the left side, it suddenly becomes a superconductor.

120
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The superconductor has great application value.

121
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:07,000
For example, later we found that mercury is a pure element, but other compounds may also become superconductors.

122
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like these high-temperature superconductors.

123
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
High-temperature superconductors can become superconductors as long as they are at the temperature of the liquid atom.

124
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
For example, these same compounds.

125
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You will see that there is an X in these different compounds.

126
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There is an X here, right?

127
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This X is when you synthesize this compound.

128
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How much ratio do you want to put in?

129
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How much ratio do you put in?

130
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then you go to burn this compound.

131
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then you mean that this X is your external parameter.

132
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Your center axis is your temperature.

133
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Different temperatures and different cross-sections.

134
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The horizontal axis is the cross-section.

135
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Write a P on the right is that you are in the electric field.

136
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's what this X means.

137
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Write a N on the left is that you are in the electron field.

138
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Here is electron dot and hole dot.

139
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This place is when you are not involved.

140
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Here is a superconductor.

141
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When you are involved to a certain extent, when you drop to a low temperature, it becomes a superconductor.

142
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So this place, this range is a superconductor phase.

143
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This range is a superconductor phase.

144
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What is a superconductor?

145
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then go on.

146
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Magnetic.

147
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
In fact, there are many kinds of magnetic.

148
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What we usually see is a magnet.

149
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like this magnet.

150
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
When we were in elementary school, we would take the magnet and sprinkle some magnetic powder to look at the magnetic field.

151
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The magnetic nature of this magnet is called magnetism.

152
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That is to say, there are many magnetic fields inside the magnet.

153
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Many small magnetic fields.

154
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If these magnetic fields are originally messy,

155
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If the temperature is very high, then these magnetic fields will be randomly arranged.

156
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
After randomly arranged, the whole is not magnetic.

157
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But if the temperature drops,

158
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Then there will be some interaction between this magnetic field and the magnetic field.

159
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
These interactions will make these magnetic fields align in the same direction.

160
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
When everyone is lined up in roughly the same direction,

161
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The overall magnetic nature will be displayed.

162
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You will see that it is a magnet.

163
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It is the overall direction.

164
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
For example, this arrow is N-level, this is S-level.

165
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If everyone is messy, then the whole is offset.

166
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I found a YouTube video.

167
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Probably like this.

168
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Can you see it now?

169
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There should be no problem, right?

170
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes, I can see it.

171
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There is a piece of iron on the top.

172
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
After the magnet is burned red,

173
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The red magnet will be messy.

174
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Then there is no magnetic nature.

175
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But after it slowly cools down,

176
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
When the temperature is low enough,

177
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Because it has an interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic field,

178
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When the temperature is low enough,

179
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It will align everyone in the same direction.

180
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
In the same direction, there is a magnetic field.

181
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
If there is a magnetic field, it becomes iron magnetic nature.

182
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Iron magnetic nature is the meaning of this magnet.

183
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
There should be no problem.

184
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Another one is that it is well arranged,

185
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But it does not have the magnetic force of the seed.

186
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The magnet of the seed.

187
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Although the magnet is iron magnetic nature,

188
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What does iron magnetic nature mean?

189
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That is to say,

190
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How does this magnetic force come from?

191
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Part of it is the orbital momentum of the electron.

192
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And the other part is the magnetic field.

193
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If these magnetic fields are interspersed,

194
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
For example, here is up, down, up, down, up, down, up,

195
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Intersected and arranged,

196
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It is also well arranged,

197
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But it does not have the iron magnetic nature of the magnet just now.

198
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But it still has a magnetic field.

199
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Although this iron magnetic nature does not have the magnetic force of the seed,

200
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But it is completely different from the iron that was completely messed up just now.

201
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because the magnetic field of the burning iron is messy.

202
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This iron magnetic nature is very well arranged.

203
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:21,000
After that, I will mainly talk about the magnetic fields of one-dimensional.

204
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What if it is arranged into a chain?

205
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Of course, this is the intention below.

206
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Because you are not taking a magnet,

207
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because there are countless magnetic fields in a magnet itself.

208
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Or there are many magnetic fields inside.

209
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Then we will discuss later.

210
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The magnetic field is arranged into one-dimensional.

211
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Then this magnetic field has some interaction with the magnetic field next door.

212
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Will this cause a whole?

213
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Will there be a state of order?

214
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or is it a whole?

215
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What is the order?

216
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Simply put, everything has an order.

217
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
For example, electronics also has an order.

218
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Light also has an order.

219
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Paper also has an order.

220
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Quark also has an order.

221
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Everything has an order.

222
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The order is a basic physical nature.

223
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Light also has an order.

224
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The order of light is 1.

225
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The z-direction of light can only be positive or negative 1.

226
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So we see that light has a polarizing direction.

227
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
There is a left-handed light and a right-handed light.

228
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Light has an order.

229
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The order of light is 1.

230
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The order of light should be divided into two categories.

231
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:32,000
One is 1 in 2, 3 in 2, 5 in 2, 7 in 2.

232
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This kind of half-order should be half-order.

233
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This kind is called Phenol.

234
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Another kind is the order of the whole.

235
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
For example, the order is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

236
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This kind is called Phosphorus.

237
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Light has an order of 1, so it is Phosphorus.

238
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Electronics has an order of 1 in 2, so it is Phenol.

239
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sorry, go on.

240
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's right.

241
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Can I?

242
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes, you can.

243
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So the spin-chain discussed later is related to the order of the whole or half-order.

244
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
These are two very different types.

245
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Before talking about these orders,

246
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
let's talk about symmetry.

247
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What is asymmetry?

248
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What is asymmetry?

249
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Asymmetry means that after you have done a certain operation, the result does not change.

250
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
For example, as I just said,

251
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,000
parallel symmetry, rotation symmetry, mirror symmetry, time parallel, time inverse, any operation.

252
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Can you see me now?

253
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes, I can see you.

254
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
For example, I take this.

255
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If you don't look at the pattern on this ball,

256
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
if they are all the same color,

257
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
if I turn 360 degrees like this,

258
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll cover it up first,

259
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
then I'll turn a little bit,

260
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and then I'll show you.

261
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Then you don't know,

262
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
you will never be able to tell whether I have turned or not.

263
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Right?

264
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So it means that this ball has the symmetry of this rotation.

265
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But there is already a pattern on it.

266
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Of course, this pattern will destroy its rotation.

267
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Because I turn like this,

268
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
you recognize this pattern,

269
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you know I have turned.

270
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But if this is all blue,

271
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
then I can turn this three-dimensional corner,

272
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
this three-dimensional corner.

273
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
This is a rotation symmetry.

274
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
This apple,

275
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
this apple, you have an imagination first,

276
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
there is a meme here,

277
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and then go down here.

278
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So if I turn like this,

279
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
then you will find that it is different.

280
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But if I turn like this along this axis,

281
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
suppose its shape is perfect,

282
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
then you will see that it also has the symmetry of this rotation.

283
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But the symmetry of this rotation,

284
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
only with this Z axis as the rotation axis,

285
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
you have this symmetry.

286
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I can turn like this.

287
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I can also turn like this, right?

288
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I can also turn like this.

289
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I can also turn like this.

290
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The symmetry of this apple is less than the symmetry of this ball.

291
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because it only rotates like this.

292
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This ball can rotate in any way.

293
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If this is the case,

294
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
you will see that this and this ring,

295
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I made a finger ring,

296
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
this finger ring is the same,

297
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that is, I turn like this,

298
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the result does not change.

299
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
With this bagel,

300
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
this is also.

301
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But if I turn like this,

302
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
you will not know that I have turned.

303
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
In this case,

304
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
if I put a sticker on it,

305
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
do you know that I have turned?

306
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
For example, I am very hungry now,

307
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
let me take a bite.

308
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Now after being bitten by me,

309
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
it has lost the symmetry of this rotation.

310
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This is also.

311
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This bagel is also.

312
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If I don't bite too big,

313
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I'll take a bite first.

314
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I bought a lot today.

315
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I bite a little bit.

316
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't bite this hole.

317
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Then it has no symmetry of this rotation.

318
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
In other words,

319
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
what does this bite cause?

320
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Caused a defect.

321
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Caused a defect.

322
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This defect will affect a lot of things.

323
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What I'm going to talk about later is TORP.

324
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
TORP,

325
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
play a little game first.

326
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I have a finger ring here.

327
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
This finger ring.

328
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
If I use a pen,

329
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
many people should know this.

330
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If I go from here,

331
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
then follow this ring,

332
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
go around like this.

333
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Go, go, go,

334
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
go around,

335
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
go around and pick it up.

336
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wait for the paper to turn 360 degrees,

337
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'll go back to the original point.

338
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
These two are not the same.

339
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
One,

340
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I also do this.

341
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Like this.

342
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I also go back to the original point.

343
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But this is not.

344
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
When doing this,

345
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
this ring is very different from these two rings.

346
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This ring is just like this finger ring.

347
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This finger ring is actually the same.

348
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I twisted it a little bit.

349
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
In fact, this ring is just like this.

350
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This ring is like this.

351
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So you see,

352
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm drawing black here.

353
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If there is,

354
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
usually there is an ant walking on it.

355
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
After going around,

356
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
you will go back to the original place.

357
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
This ring is like this.

358
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
This ring is not.

359
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
This ring is the so-called Mobius ring.

360
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If I have an ant here,

361
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
go like this,

362
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
go like this,

363
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
go, go, go,

364
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
go, go, go,

365
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
go around,

366
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
go,

367
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
go around,

368
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
it will,

369
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
it actually,

370
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm going around now.

371
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Go around,

372
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
the result is that this path runs to the back of this ring.

373
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's not the same as this.

374
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
After two laps,

375
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I will go back to the original point.

376
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This is a

377
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
completely different thing from a few boxes.

378
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Oh,

379
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
go back to the video.

380
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That

381
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I just said,

382
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
this is symmetrical.

383
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This is symmetrical.

384
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That

385
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This is

386
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The symmetry has been destroyed.

387
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That

388
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
with

389
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What does symmetry have to do with it?

390
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because we know

391
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that

392
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
if you

393
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
if

394
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
you have a

395
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
energy or

396
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
free energy,

397
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
if it is a certain parameter

398
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
of the function,

399
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
then you basically

400
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
free energy should be like

401
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
energy is like the lower the better

402
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
stability

403
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
that if your

404
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
first

405
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
your function is like this

406
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
that

407
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
you have a ball here,

408
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
then it is of course symmetrical.

409
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Because this is the point of symmetry.

410
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The point of symmetry is of course

411
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
the lowest point of energy.

412
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But if your external parameters

413
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
change,

414
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
for example, your temperature

415
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
temperature changes

416
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
temperature decreases,

417
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
your temperature is getting lower and lower,

418
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
which causes this function to change.

419
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
At this time,

420
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the lowest energy state

421
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
will not be in

422
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
this

423
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
symmetrical state.

424
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And it may

425
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
choose

426
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
in

427
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
a certain

428
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
more

429
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
free energy

430
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
lower place

431
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
that this place

432
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
that of course

433
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
every place

434
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
this place

435
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
or this place

436
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
free energy

437
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
energy is as low

438
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
as it should be

439
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
on the left or

440
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
on the right

441
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
do not know

442
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
it may

443
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
it is

444
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
it may

445
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
it

446
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
has a little bit of

447
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
orientation

448
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
to the left

449
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
or a little bit

450
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
to the right

451
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
when it is very natural

452
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
it will soon

453
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
run to

454
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
this stable place

455
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
that like

456
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
this place

457
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
that

458
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
if it is like this

459
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
you will find

460
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
it is not symmetrical

461
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you were

462
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
originally

463
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
left and right

464
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
this has a

465
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
mirror symmetry

466
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
that is now

467
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
not symmetrical

468
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
that is not symmetrical

469
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
represents

470
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
a

471
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
order

472
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
occurred

473
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
that is

474
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
occurred

475
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
that is

476
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
a certain

477
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
like

478
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
for example,

479
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
we just

480
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
looked at

481
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
that

482
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
that

483
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
distance temperature

484
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
experiment

485
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that

486
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
burning red

487
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
iron

488
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
there is no

489
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
magnetic

490
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
burning red

491
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
iron

492
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
it

493
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
its magnetic

494
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
is messy

495
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that

496
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
very messy

497
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
when

498
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
magnetic

499
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
although

500
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
it has magnetic

501
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
in every place

502
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
it has a lot of

503
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
this

504
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that

505
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
order or

506
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
magnetic

507
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
for example,

508
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
this magnetic

509
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that

510
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but the temperature

511
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
is very high

512
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
it

513
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
every

514
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
magnetic

515
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
are

516
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
constantly

517
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
doing

518
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
this

519
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
is

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it looks messy

while the correct values

533
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
that

546
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
how to say

547
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
it is

548
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
symmetric

549
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
it

550
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
magnetic

551
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
that

552
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
moment

553
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it

554
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
hands

555
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
is very messy

556
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
or

557
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
you have a camera

558
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
you you you this camera

559
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
to observe

560
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and then you

561
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
shift this camera

562
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
that you find

563
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
it still messy

564
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
as just

565
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the same mess

566
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
is that

567
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you can not see what it is

568
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
you can not tell

569
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
you have no rotation

570
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I did not

571
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I did a shift

572
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
or did a

573
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
rotation

574
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
you can not tell

575
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
so

576
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
it

577
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
in the previous

578
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
film

579
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that burning red iron

580
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
has what symmetry

581
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
it has

582
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
symmetry

583
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
also has

584
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
symmetry

585
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
rotation

586
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
after the temperature

588
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
is reduced

589
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
it

590
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because

591
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
magnetic

592
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
magnetic

593
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
between

594
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
its interaction

595
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
between

596
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
the

597
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
more

598
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
more

599
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
strong

600
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
more obvious

601
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
that

602
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
hot

603
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
hot

604
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
hot

605
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
not enough

606
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to make it

607
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
to make it messy

608
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
so it will

609
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
cause the

610
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
overall

611
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
overall

612
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
magnetic

613
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
direction

614
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
a

615
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
direction

616
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
that

617
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
this time

618
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
if everyone

619
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
in the same direction

620
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
when it

621
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
that you

622
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
this time

623
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
you will find

624
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that I have

625
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
no

626
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
this

627
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
rotation

628
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
symmetry

629
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
is that I

630
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
rotate

631
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
symmetry

632
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
that

633
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I

634
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
that

635
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
just that direction

636
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
originally pointed up

637
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
everyone pointed up

638
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
that I rotate

639
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
everyone

640
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
in one direction

641
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
you will find that it

642
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
has changed

643
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
that

644
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
is not symmetrical

645
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
that

646
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
this is called

647
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
a

648
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
symmetrical

649
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
symmetry

650
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
symmetry

651
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
symmetry

652
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that

653
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
symmetry

654
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is that it

655
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
has a sequence

656
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
that you say

657
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
it is

658
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
a change

659
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
that

660
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
this is

661
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
our most

662
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
traditional

663
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
ah

664
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
material

665
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
to

666
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
occur

667
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that

668
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the

669
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
most

670
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
most

671
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
ah

672
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
a

673
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
a

674
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
a

675
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
recognition

676
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
is that

677
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
this is the

678
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
theory of

679
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the

680
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
blue

681
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
path

682
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that

683
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
it

684
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
should

685
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
be that

686
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
we have

687
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
a

688
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
is that

689
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
there is a

690
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
sequence of

691
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
this

692
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
is that

693
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
there is a

694
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
sequence

695
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that

696
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
means that

697
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
it occurred

698
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
a change

699
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that

700
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but like just

701
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
ah

702
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
sorry

703
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
interrupt

704
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
that

705
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
sequence of

706
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
English

707
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
what

708
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
sorry

709
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I just

710
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
want to

711
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
continue

712
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that

713
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
that

714
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
ah

715
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
that

716
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
some things

717
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
are not

718
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
like this

719
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ah

720
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
that

721
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
that

722
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
later

723
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
later

724
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
will continue to talk about

725
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
that

726
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
that

727
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
later found

728
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
ah

729
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
there is a

730
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
change

731
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
ah

732
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
it

733
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
is the earliest

734
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
a

735
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Russian

736
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
ah

737
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
he called

738
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Brzezinski

739
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
he found

740
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
he was

741
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
he was

742
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
a model

743
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
that

744
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
later

745
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
because he

746
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
seems to be

747
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
published in

748
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
this story

749
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
is written

750
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
in Russian

751
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and then

752
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
earlier than

753
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Kostelits and

754
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Soles

755
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that later

756
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
no one knows

757
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that later

758
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Kostelits and

759
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Soles

760
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
they also

761
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
counted a

762
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
thing

763
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and then

764
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
found that

765
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it actually

766
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
has a

767
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000

768
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but

769
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
this model

770
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it did not

771
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
occur symmetrical

772
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
they do

773
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
this model

774
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
is like this

775
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
just

776
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
talk about

777
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
that one

778
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that

779
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
seems to be

780
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
here

781
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
this amount

782
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
as

783
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
this amount

784
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000

785
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
a

787
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
is a

789
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
a quantity

791
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000

he

794
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
will talk about

795
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the amount

796
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000

797
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
is this amount

798
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
is

799
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
a

801
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
you have

805
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and then

806
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
you have

807

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
put a

do

823
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
just write

827
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that

828
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
this model

829
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
to see

830
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
it did not

831
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
destroy the

833
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
because

834
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I

835
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
put

the

842
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I

843
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
just rotate

844
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
a few degrees

degrees

849
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I just

850
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
turn a little

851
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
or turn a

853
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
just turn a

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000

855
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
any angle

856
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
you

857
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
will

858
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
say this

859
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
model

860
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
this energy is

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000

unchanged

864
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
so

865
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
there

866
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
is such a

870
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
that

871
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
there was a

872
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000

873
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
called

874
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Mermin

theorem

877
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
is that

878
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
if you

879
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
only have

880
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
the corresponding

interaction

882
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
then

883
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
you

884
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
have

885
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
a

891
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
the

896
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000

897
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
they found

898
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
in fact

900
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000

903
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
it

905
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000

907
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000

908
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
mean that

909
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
it will not

910
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000

911
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000

913
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000

914
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
by

915
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Kosterlitz

916
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and Thorez

917
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
later

918
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
we called

919
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000

921
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000

922
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000

923
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000

925
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
first of all

926
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
because it

927
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
will not occur

928
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000

929
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000

931
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
so

932
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
as long as

933
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
you have a

940
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000

length

967
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
of this

968
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
symbol

969
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
multiplied by

970
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
another

971
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
symbol

972
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
multiplied

973
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
by

974
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
cos

975
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
theta

976
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
if theta

977
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
is 0

978
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
if the

979
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
theta

980
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
is

981
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
0

982
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
then

983
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
this is

984
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
vertical

985
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
is 0

986
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
so

987
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
there is a

988
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
symbol in front

989
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
of it

990
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
so if the

991
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
energy is

992
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
lower,

993
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
of course,

994
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
it is best

995
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
to have

996
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
the same

997
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
amount

998
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
for each

999
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
symbol.

1000
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
If it is

1001
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
the opposite,

1002
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
the

1003
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
energy is

1004
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
the highest

1005
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
, so

1006
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
the

1007
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
same

1008
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
energy is

1009
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
the lowest

1010
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
, so

1011
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
it is

1012
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
the lowest

1013
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
energy

1014
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
in the

1015
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
ground state

1016
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
.

1017
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Of course,

1018
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
of course,

1019
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
there is order,

1020
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
but as long as

1021
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
you have a little

1022
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
temperature, as long as

1023
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
there is a little

1024
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
temperature,

1025
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
it will not be

1026
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
the direction,

1027
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
it will not

1028
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
be all

1029
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
the same

1030
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
direction,

1031
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
it is

1032
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
absolutely

1033
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that is

1034
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
that is

1035
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
that is

1036
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
not

1037
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
not

1038
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
destroy this

1039
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
if everyone

1040
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
is the same direction,

1041
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
then of course

1042
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
the symmetry

1043
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
is destroyed,

1044
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
then there is no

1045
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
symmetry,

1046
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
but there is a

1047
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
change in

1048
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
that

1049
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
is what

1050
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
the situation

1051
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
is high

1052
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
temperature

1053
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
when it

1054
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
is

1055
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
a little

1056
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
when

1057
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
there is a little

1058
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
temperature

1059
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
that

1060
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
these

1061
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
will not

1062
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
these

1063
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
these

1064
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
quantities

1065
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
will not be

1066
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
the same

1067
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
direction

1068
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
that

1069
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
will not be the same

1070
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
that can only

1071
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
can only

1072
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
form some

1073
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
called vortex

1074
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
is

1075
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
some

1076
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
whirlpool

1077
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
like this

1078
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
at a very high

1079
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
temperature

1080
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
when

1081
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
these

1082
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
vortex

1083
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
like this

1084
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
regardless of

1085
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
any temperature

1086
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
these

1087
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
vortex

1088
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
because you

1089
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
have to

1090
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
you have to

1091
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
have to

1092
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
be in

1093
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
line

1094
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
you have a

1095
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
vortex

1096
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
is

1097
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
that

1098
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
in fact,

1099
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
in fact,

1100
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
this

1101
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
is the first

1102
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
example of

1103
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
this

1104
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
is that

1105
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
you have a

1106
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
vortex

1107
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
that you have

1108
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
another

1109
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
opposite

1110
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
vortex

1111
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
that

1112
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
this

1113
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
positive

1114
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
positive

1115

1116
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
with

1117
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
opposite

1118
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000

1120
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
low

00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
temperature

1122
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
is

1123
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
two

1125
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
tied together

1126
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
but

1127
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
if the

1128
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
high-temperature

1129
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000

1130
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
is a

1132
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
solution

1133
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
is

1134
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
every

vortex

1138
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
are

1139
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
free

1140
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000

1143
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
or

1144
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
this

1145
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
quantity

around

1150
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
so

1151
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
that

1152
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
is

1153
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000

a

1157
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000

1159
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I remember

1160
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
when I was

1161
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
learning xy

1162
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
mother, he

1163
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
said that

1164
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
it was not

1165
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
a waste

1166
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
to

1167
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
calculate

1168
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
its

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
one is

1173
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
power

1174
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
decay,

1175
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
one is

1176
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
exponential

1177
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
decay,

1178
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
then how

1179
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
to connect

1180
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
that thing

1181
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
to

1182
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
your

1183
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
side

1184
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
?

1185
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Well

1186
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
,

1187
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
well

1188
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
,

1189
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
if the

1190
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
coherence

1191
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
length

1192
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
,

1193
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
because

1194
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
the first

1195
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
is the

1196
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
definition of

1197
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Mermin

Wegener

1199
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
,

1200
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
first of all,

1201
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
if it

1202
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
doesn't

1203
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
have

1204
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
order,

1205
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
its

1206
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
coherence

1207
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
length

1208
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
must be

1209
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
decayed

1210
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
to

1211
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
zero,

1212
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
but

1213
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
it

1214
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
is

1215
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
very

1216
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
slow

1217
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
power

1218
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
decay

1219
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
,

1220
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
well

1221
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
,

1222
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
well

1223
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
,

1224
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I think

1225
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I think

1226
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
this may

1227
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
be carefully

1228
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
inferred

1229
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
to see

1230
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
its

1231
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
connection here

1232
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
,

1233
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I think

1234
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
it seems

1235
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that there is

1236
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
no way to

1237
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
directly use

1238
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
a very

1239
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
intuitive

1240
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
way to

1241
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
see that

1242
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
this place

1243
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
is a

1244
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
power-low

1245
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
decay

1246
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
that you

1247
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
have this

1248
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
picture,

1249
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
for example,

1250
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
you have to use

1251
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
math to

1252
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
represent,

1253
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
for example,

1254
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
the physical amount

1255
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
is different

1256
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
on the

1257
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
left and

1258
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
right

1259
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
,

1260
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
which

1261
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
is to

1262
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
use

1263
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
what

1264
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
things

1265
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
to

1266
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
say

1267
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
there is

1268
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
no

1269
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
similar

1270
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
things

1271
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
all the

1272
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
parameters

1273
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
well

1274
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
well

1275
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
well

1276
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
,

1277
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
the

1278
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
problem

1279
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
is that

1280
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
you can not

1281
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
define a

1282
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
thing,

1283
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
for example,

1284
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the left

1285
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
side of the

1286
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
back

1287
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
is still

1288
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
zero,

1289
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
the

1290
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
right side

1291
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
is

1292
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
zero,

1293
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the

1294
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
left

1295
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
side

1296
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
is

1297
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
zero.

1298
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
In

1299
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
fact,

1300
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
the

1301
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
left

1302
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
side

1303
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
is

1304
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
zero,

1305
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
the

1306
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
right

1307
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
side

1308
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
is

1309
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
one,

1310
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
so

1311
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
they are

1312
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
different,

1313
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
so

1314
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
we can

1315
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
not

1316
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
say

1317
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
that

1318
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
is the

1319
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
old

1320
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
parameter,

1321
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
but

1322
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
here

1323
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
well

1324
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
here

1325
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
you can

1326
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
only

1327
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
calculate

1328
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
its

1329
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000

1331
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
so

1332
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
you

1333
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
can

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
that

1337
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
is the

00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000

parameter,

1340
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
but

1341
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
you can

1342
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
only

1343
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000

,

1346
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
so

1347
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
you

1348
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
can

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
