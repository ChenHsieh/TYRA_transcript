00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm very happy to have you all here today for Lin Bo-xuan's talk.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Let me first introduce our speaker, Lin Bo-xuan.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
She studied economics at NTU, and is now a sophomore at NTU Economics.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Currently, she is an intern at a startup company called ModLab in Pasadena, California.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Her main topic is game-related data analysis.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Today, we are very happy to invite Lin Bo-xuan to give a talk

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
about how to use class experiment data to test the stability of the final window match

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and the results of the double-sided auction experiment.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Let's welcome Lin Bo-xuan to start her talk.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you, Director Lin.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Without further ado, I'll get started.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Today's topic is very simple.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'll just ask one question.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Are the results of the economic experiment we see on paper stable?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
To be honest, in the field of economic experiments,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
people are the ones doing the research.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
So, if you want to say that a result is stable,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
you can't just say,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
if I were in Taiwan, I'd do this result.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Or, if I were in a victim group, I'd do that.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Often, we need to do a lot of different victim groups.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
If we were to say that this result is right for all humans,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
then it should be right to take the same result

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
and do the same experiment in every place.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
But in fact, we often know that

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
this situation is often not necessarily right.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
For example, let's say we measure the risk.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
In Taiwan alone,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
if you only measure the risk for men or women,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
the set of risks may be different.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
So, in fact, if we want to measure stability,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
that is, if we want to do the same experiment

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
in many places, the result is wrong.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
But often,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
what we want to do

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
is actually very difficult in the experiment.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
First, because economists know

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
that our research funds are limited.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Second, our time is limited.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So, often, it's hard for us to think about

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
whether we can do the same experiment

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
in every corner of the world.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So, this is a very difficult thing.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Because, mainly, there is a big limitation in economic experiments.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
In fact, we hope to provide real benefits to consumers.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Because of this,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
we need a lot of money and a lot of time.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We need to have a good enough time design.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Basically, it will be impossible to measure in every place in the world.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
So, because of this,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
we did not give up

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
to test whether our experiment results are stable or not.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
So, there are two main ways

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
to do this on our website.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
First,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
for example,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
in the case of Ultraman Game,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
in fact, in the past 50 years,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
there have been a lot of studies on the series of Ultraman Game.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So, basically,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
there is a method

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
that we take the previous experimental data

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
and break it into a very large database

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
to do some meta-analysis here.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Just like what Usterbeck did in 2004.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
But, like this,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
there is a problem.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
In fact, many times,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
all the previous studies of Ultraman Game

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
are the same game,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
but their context is a bit different.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So, in practice,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
many times, your usage is different,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
or your context is different,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
which may affect the result of the experiment.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So, when we use this method,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
we have already lost the control

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
of our experimental design.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Although this method

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
can make our database very rich.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The other way is that

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
we control the same experimental design,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
but go to other places

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
to do the same experiment.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Just like Roth,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
he has been to four countries in the world.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
One is the United States,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
one is Slovenia,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
one is Israel,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
and the other is Japan.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
He went to these four countries

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
to do the same final analysis

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
and market game

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
to see if the results of these four countries

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
were stable or not.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
This is the largest experiment

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
so far.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
But, from this point of view,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
even so,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
we can only do it in a small number of places.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So, in this way,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
although you can

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
control your experimental design,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
but you can't make

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
your database very large.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
So, today,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
what we are doing is

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
using the third method.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
It's like

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
you want to test the stability

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
of a result of an experiment.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
There are three things to do.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
One is the real sound,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
and the third is to have a large enough sample.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
The first two methods

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
are to give up

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
and control the experimental design.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
The other is to give up a large enough database.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But what we are going to do today

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
is to have a large enough database,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and the design

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
is exactly the same.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
But what we give up today is to give up

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
and control the sound.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
In this case,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I can only say that we are the first article

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
to do this.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
We have a lot of data.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
But when we give up

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
and control the sound,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
our experiment

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
will be done in a very

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
no-easy situation.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So, if we can

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
reproduce

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
all the experimental results

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
in the lab,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
it means that the experimental results

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
are very stable.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
As I said,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
what we are going to use today

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
is MobLab.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
MobLab is an experimental platform

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
for all class economics experiments.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
If we take all the data from the class,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
it is actually good and bad.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Of course, the two biggest concerns are

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
that all the students in the class

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
do not use money

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
to provide their sound.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Most of the time, they just use

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
the grade of the course

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
or other random numbers

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
to provide their sound.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
This is what we have lost control of.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
The two biggest concerns are

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
that many students in class

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
may not necessarily be

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
the representative sample

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
of the culture.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
However, there are still

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
a lot of benefits

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
for us to try this method.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
First of all,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
there is no publication bias

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
in our database.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
For example,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
if you take the results

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
of the previous article

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
as a meta-analysis,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
you may get too good results.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
This is called publication bias.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
However,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
all the results, good or bad,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
are recorded in our database.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Another thing is that

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
our company is

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
at least in the class of

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
experimental economics.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
If you want to do a class experiment

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
in the world,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
you basically use our company.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
In fact, our sample is very diverse.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
There are many different areas.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
This gives us a lot of

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
variation to test.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Thirdly,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
the environment in which our data is generated

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
is exactly the same.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The interface, language,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
and the entire experiment process

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
are exactly the same.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
This means that we have

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
completely controlled

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
the process of their game.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
These are the three advantages

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
that we think

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
are very important.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Before talking about these two areas,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I would like to talk about

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
how big our dataset is.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
First of all,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
we can see that

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
this table is a total of

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
10 areas in our dataset.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You can see that

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
this data is across North America,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Europe, and Asia.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
In Ultraman Game,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
we have more than

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
15,000 sample points.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
For those of you who do not know

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
the economics of time,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
the data in Ultraman Game

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
is about 10 times more than

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
a normal article,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
or 0 to 2.0.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
In DoubleAction,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
there are basically 2.0 more.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
This is a very large sample

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
that we can test.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Next,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I will talk about these two areas.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
These two areas are actually very simple.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
The first is Ultraman Game.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
In addition,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
why do we choose these two areas?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
The first is because these two areas

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
are the most abundant in our database.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
The second is that these two areas

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
are basically the origin of

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
the economics of time.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In Ultraman Game,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
there are two people in this game.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
One is Proposer,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
the other is Responder.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Proposer can decide

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
how much to give to the other party.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
This game is very simple.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
There is a ball in the middle.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You can decide how much to give to the other party.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You can pull the ball

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
and decide how much to give to the other party.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
If you decide,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
you can press Submit.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
In this way, the other party can see

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
how much you gave to the other party.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Next,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
suppose I decide to give the other party $45.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
In this way,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
the other party can see

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
that this is

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
a Proposer you have provided.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Proposer is

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I take $55, you take $45.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Do you want to accept it?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
If you are Responder,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
if you decide to accept it,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
you take $45, he takes $55.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
If you refuse,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
you both take $0.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
This is a very simple environment.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
It's like the simplest negotiation

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
in simulation life.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
For example, when you go to the night market to buy vegetables,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
you often say

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
that you might say in the last round

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
don't pull the ball.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It's like simulating such a concept.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
This is the game interface

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
of our Ultraman Game.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Next, I want to talk about

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
double-sided auction.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
The most classic example

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
of double-sided auction is

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
like Wall Street.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
They are selling stocks.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You often see some pictures and news photos

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
that there may be a lot of machines

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
with a lot of stations.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Many traders are raising their hands

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
and shouting loudly.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It's like everyone is shouting at the same time.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
How much do I want this? How much do I want this?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It's like buyers and sellers are arguing there at the same time.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So double-sided auction is

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
compared to Ultraman Game.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Ultraman Game has only one side.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I propose a proposal to you.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
In double-sided auction,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
no matter which side, buyer or seller,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
they can call at the same time.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
So in double-sided auction,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I will introduce what this game is playing now.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
One is a buyer and the other is a seller.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
So if you are a buyer today,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
you want to buy something.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
We are buying oranges here.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
In this game interface,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
the first thing you can see is

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
how much satisfaction you will get when you buy an orange.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
This is called value.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Next, you have to raise a price.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You can pull a slider bar here.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
You can move left and right

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
to decide how much you want to bid

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
to bid for this orange.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
If you buy an orange,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
your advantage is

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
your value today is

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
how much you spent to buy it.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
OK.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
If you are buying,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
you have two ways to buy.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
One is to bid here.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
The other one is

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
if there are a lot of buyers in front,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
they have already asked for a price.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
So you can also buy directly at the lowest price.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
OK.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
The next one is

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
seller.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We have the same interface.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
If you sell an orange today,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
you have a cost.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So you will see your cost here.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
OK.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Next,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
you can pull a slider bar here

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
to decide how much you want to bid.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
You can ask for a price here.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Or you can decide

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
to sell the highest price here.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
So I can sell it here.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Then pay attention here.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
There is a special design in our game interface.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
When you decide to

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
ask for a price here,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
if you ask for a price,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
if the transaction

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
makes you pay a negative price,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I will make it red

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
to warn you

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
that

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
this transaction may bring you

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
a negative price.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
So this is a double option

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
game interface.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Let me introduce

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
our game settings here.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
This is because

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
in such a simple game interface,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
many teachers

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
can adjust the game parameters

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
themselves.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
But in most cases,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
many teachers use our preset options.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
In Ultimatum Game,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
you can divide the money

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
into 100 yuan.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
In the case of double option,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
there are five buyers in total.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Then each person

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
can have three products to buy.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
That is to say, there are a total of

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
15 things in the market to buy and sell.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
If we draw this value,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
this is our black line.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
This is our demand curve.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Then the gray line

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
is our supply curve.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Before I start,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I want to talk a little bit

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
about the theoretical prediction

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
of these two games.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
In Ultimatum Game,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
the theoretical prediction is very simple.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
If we look at it

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
from the perspective of the respondent,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
we say that

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
the balance of a game is basically

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
that if I do this option,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
the reward is higher than the other option,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
then I should do this.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
So if you look at the responder,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
no matter what positive reward he sees,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I should accept it.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
For example, if I take 1 yuan,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
it is still better than 0 yuan.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So in this case,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
if I get a positive reward,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I should accept it.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
If I get a negative reward,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I should accept it.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
If I get a positive reward,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I should accept it.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
So this is the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Game.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
But in fact,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
in the past 50 years of research,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
we all know that

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
this theory is basically written to be overturned.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
This is because many times

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
when we do research,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
we will find that

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
basically all the recipients

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
will not only give the other party 1 yuan.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
This is Ultimatum Game.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Then in Double Option,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
this is like a high school science textbook,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
you will see Supply and Demand Curve.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
If you want to solve this game,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
it is actually very simple,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
you have to find a price

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
to clear all the markets.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So if you are here,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
this gray curve is the price

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
of our theoretical prediction.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It just happens to be the intersection

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
of Supply and Demand Curve.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
If the price is higher,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
it means that

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
there are more sellers who want to sell things at this time,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and fewer sellers want to sell.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So if the supply and demand are uneven at this time,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
this force will force the price down.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
But if the price is lower,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
then there are more people who want to sell,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
and fewer people want to sell.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So this force will push the price back.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
This is also the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
This is our equilibrium price.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Then in our prediction market,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
the number of equilibrium is 13,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
and the price of equilibrium is 112 yuan.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
So this is our game setting.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I want to stop here for a while.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Is everyone OK?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
If there is no problem,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I will continue to talk about the results.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Wait a minute,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
let me confirm first.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
So the buyer's

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
willing price here is

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
150,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
the prediction is 150,145,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
140, and so on?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
From 150 to 115.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So from 150 to minus 3,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
how much is the last one?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The last one is about

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
112 or 117.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Then the other side is from 50,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and then keep adding up.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Yes.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Thank you.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
OK, then I have no problem.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I want to continue.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Let's talk about

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
the overall results.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
First of all, I want to show you

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
this table.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Let me summarize first.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
We mainly looked at five outcome variables.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
What are some of its numerical statistics?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
First of all, in the Ultimation Game,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
we mainly looked at two outcome variables.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
One is how much proposal you give the other party.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
The other is how much your acceptance rate is.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
First of all, we see the first one.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
In the case of 100 yuan,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
on average,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
you will give the other party about 36 yuan.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
This number is actually

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
very close to the result of our experiment.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
For example, if we take

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Rock's article in 1991 as a benchmark,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
the average of the article

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
is 40.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
In fact, our gap is only 4%,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
so I think it's a very close result.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Then the second one

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
we look at is the acceptance rate.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
What we are looking at now is unconditional.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
If we look at

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
the unconditional acceptance rate,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
the acceptance rate is 66%.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Rock's result is about 73%.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So the gap is only 6% or 7%.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
But because our offer

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
is relatively low,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I think our result

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
is able to reproduce

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Rock's result at the aggregate level.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Hello, I have a question.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
You just said

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
he made 40 and then 36.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Or let's just say

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
how much is the experimental

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
and how much is the theoretical expectation.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I think it's very close.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
What I want to ask is

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
what do you think?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Because you didn't show

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
your uncertainty range.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Maybe it's actually a very stable difference,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
so it's not very close.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This is

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
what I will continue to talk about later.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Because I'm going to show you a statistic now.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Show you an approximate

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
rapid statistics.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
If you're right,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I should do some statistics

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
to see if there is a significant difference.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But in fact,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
the first one is

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
this is one point.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
If I want to do an assessment,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
there is another problem.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Our sample number is very unbalanced.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Very unbalanced.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
So it means that our sample number

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
is about more than 10,000 points,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and their sample number is only more than 1,000 points.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So in fact, many times,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
when you do an assessment like this,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
sometimes there are some

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
things that you need to pay attention to.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
But in fact,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
at least in the case of showing data now,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I can only say it out loud.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
What I can only say now is

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
to see if it's close or not.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Next,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
the other three are

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
the results of the double option.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
For the double option, I'm going to use three indexes

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
to talk about whether this market

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
has been able to

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
refine

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
the prediction of the theory.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
The first three indexes we look at

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
are the average error.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
The definition of the average error is actually below.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
DQ is the price of

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
each unit

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
of each contract.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Subtract.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This means

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
how much is the difference

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
from our theoretical prediction.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Next, I look at the average.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Because we often have

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
about 800 different market configurations.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So in order to make everyone

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
comparable, I use

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
the average price to standardize it.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So we can actually use this index

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
to see how much our accuracy is.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The next one is

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
our

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Smith Alpha.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Smith is to commemorate

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Brown-Smith.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
This index is actually very simple.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
It is the distance

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
between my price

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
and

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
the price of my theoretical prediction.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So I take the square here.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Then I take another one.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Next, I look at the average distance.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Then I open a number.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
So it's actually like my standard error.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
But

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
what I'm doing today is not average.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
What I'm doing today is

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
theoretical prediction.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Next, I still use

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
my average price to standardize it.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
So I can use this index

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
to measure the fluctuation of price.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
The next

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and the third index is Efficiency.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
For Efficiency, I want to use

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
the above picture to explain.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
So in this

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
market equation,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
if this seller

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
makes a deal with this buyer,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
then it shows

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the above section

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
in the middle

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
is the profit I made.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
It's the buyer's profit.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
The following section is the seller's profit.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
So it tells me

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
the total length of this section

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
is the

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
profit I can make

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
from this deal.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
That is to say,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I sum up the area of

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
the supply curve and demand curve.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
In theory,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
this is the total

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
surplus I can get.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So this year's efficiency

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
definition is

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
the efficiency I achieve

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
in this market

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
and the efficiency

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I expect in theory.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
The following

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
can be seen as

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
the first one is

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
my average error is about 6%.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
That is to say, my average price

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
is about 6% higher than the theory.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
The next one is

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
my Smith Alpha.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
The fluctuation rate

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
is about 30%.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
The efficiency

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
is about 84%.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
In fact,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
these numbers are

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
significantly different from the theory.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
However,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
this is related to another problem.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
In our lab,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
we often let our customers

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
play the same game for 10 or 20 rounds.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
At this time,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
after more than 10 rounds,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
the price will become very stable.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
But here,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
if we play for 10 rounds,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
the customer may have gone up to level 3.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
This is why the price

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
here is unstable.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
However,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I will try to show

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
if our students

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
can play enough rounds,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
where will they end up?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
This is the result

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
of the double option.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Let's continue to see

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
the whole distribution.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I don't know

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
which computer

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I used to jump out.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I don't know

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
what to do now.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Thank you for reminding me.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I hope you don't

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
knock on my door anymore.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I don't want to leave the group.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Thank you.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Let's continue.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
First, let's see

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
the whole distribution of Proposal Offer.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Because

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
in our game design,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
the teacher can decide

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
whether to play one round, two rounds,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
or several rounds.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
If you play more than two rounds,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
it will become a repeat game.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
If we divide the data

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
into a repeat game and a single game,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
we can see

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
that

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
the first point

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
is

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
theoretical prediction.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
This is theoretical prediction.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
This is theoretical prediction.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
So here,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
whether it is a one-shot game or a repeat game,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
only about 10% of the audience

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
played on the theoretical prediction.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Next, we have seen

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
50% of the audience

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
played on the theoretical prediction.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Next, we have seen

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
50% of the audience

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
played on the theoretical prediction.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The first observation

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
is that we have a lot of Proposal Offer

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
on the natural focal point.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
So I played 0,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
10, 20, 30.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
This is the first observation.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
The second observation is that

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
only 6% of the audience

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
gave themselves

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
less than the Proposal Offer.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
I gave myself more.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
In this game,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
there should be a first mover advantage.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I should give you 50% if I'm great.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
According to the theory, I should not give you 10%.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
But only 6% of the audience

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
gave more than the Proposal Offer.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
This is the first observation.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Next, let's compare

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
the distribution with ROF.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
This is ROF's distribution

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
in 1991.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
As Mr. Zhang said,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
we did not do a statistical analysis.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
So we can only see

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
the distribution characteristics.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
The first observation is that

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
the density is

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
about 50% to 40%.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
The density is about 50% to 40%.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
But this is

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
ROF's distribution.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So we can

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
give them the result.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
In addition,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
the biggest difference

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
between ROF and ROF

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
is that almost no one

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
played in the theoretical prediction.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
But about 10% of the audience

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
played in the theoretical prediction.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
In fact,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
at least I and Colin

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
are not sure.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
This may be the reason for the prediction option.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
In the beginning of a game,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
the prediction ball

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
is placed on the theoretical prediction.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
So if the students

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
press the button

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
without thinking,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
it means that

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
there is no strategy at all.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
So 10% of the audience

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
may play in the theoretical prediction.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Of course, it may also be affected by the prediction option.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
But this is...

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Do you have the response time here?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I will fix it later.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
According to your hypothesis,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
the response time should be the lowest.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
But the response time is actually very high.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
But I will show the result later.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So it may not be the result of the prediction option.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Yes.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
But...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Sorry, Bo-Xuan.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Can you show the previous video?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
OK.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Because I just thought

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
if you said it was because of the default option,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
then you should see...

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Because the information of ROF

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
is very rare.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Almost none.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Yes.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
But the people who chose 1

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
seem to be more likely than 0.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Yes.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
So...

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Although 0 is so high,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
it may be the effect of the default option.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
But it seems that there are more people

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
who are more likely.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
If you look at the balance

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
as 0 or 1,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
there are more people who chose 1.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Yes.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
That's what I think.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Thank you for this comment.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
But it is indeed...

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
It should be...

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
In this...

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
There should be a lot of people who play with the theory.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
But it is indeed the default option.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
This effect is indeed a confirmation.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
But I will continue to talk about it.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Then here is

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
our acceptance rate.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Because I think this result is very cool.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
So it doesn't matter if I talk about it later.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I will talk about it later.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
First of all, because what we talked about earlier

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
is the unconditional acceptance rate.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
What is more interesting now

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
is to measure the conditional acceptance rate.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Unconditional...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
What is the number of offers I see?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
That is to say, because we measure

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
the expected value of the conditions.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Then this is actually

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
a function of an offer.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
So on this graph,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
my X-axis shows

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
how many proposal offers I see.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
What is the acceptance rate?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
OK.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
In this graph, the black dot represents the information of one-shot game.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
The orange dot represents the information of repeat game.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Next,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
the size of each point

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
represents

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
the density of the histogram

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
we saw earlier.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
So if you put the size of this ball

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
projected to the X-axis,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
it becomes the entire histogram.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
OK.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Next, because when I was checking the data,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
between 49 and 50,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
there is actually a jump of about 20%.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
So I thought it was strange.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So I used a specification

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
to measure

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
the P-splice linear

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
specification.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
So what you can see

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
is that I think it is quite special.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
If you are less than 50,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
you see

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
that your acceptance rate is this curve.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
When it is greater than 50,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
there will be a big break here.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
This is completely obvious.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It is very obvious.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
When we measure the standard error,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
we also use

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
a cluster.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
We have a cluster at the session level.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
So we use the most conservative estimation

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
to estimate our variability.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So in this case,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
it is also very obvious.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
If we put all the data together,

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
there is a jump of about 20% to 21%.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
If we divide it into one-shot game

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
and repeat game,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
the jump is about 16%.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
If we divide it into one-shot game

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
and repeat game, the jump is about 26%.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
First of all,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
this phenomenon has not been seen

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
in the first 50 years.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
So I think it is a very cool discovery.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Next, let's talk about 1.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
First of all,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
this interpretation is actually very complicated.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Because we have a lot of confounds here

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
that our database cannot detect.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
But what we can be sure is that

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
at least the source of this break

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
is the difference in payoffs.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Because you can see that

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
when we come in from the left B,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
you can come in from 49.99999.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Then the next is coming in from the right B,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
it is about 50.0000001.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
In fact, this gap is less than

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
how small your Epsilon is.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
So this effect is definitely not

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
from monetary payoffs.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Or even if you are in a hypothetical state,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
it is basically not from

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
how much your payoff is.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
So it is very possible that

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
you have to consider

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
how other people

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
distribute the whole proposal.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Next, there are many interpretations here.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
We can't uniquely pin down.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
It may be like

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
because you are from 49.999 to 50.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
There is a big gap here,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
which is equality.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Because this paragraph can also mean

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
that I may be very, very care.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Am I equal to you?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Or this is the first one.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Or another one is that

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
if you don't give me 50,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I may punish you.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So this is why this paragraph

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
may be 10% more in the repeated game.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It may be that this 10% is more

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
that I want to punish you.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Or I may care about my fairness.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Or I simply

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
since we are not playing real money,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I just don't want to lose you.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
So it means that

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
my acceptance rate is relatively low.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
But when I can at least not lose you,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
my acceptance rate is about the same.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
This is what we see

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
in the data.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I want to ask

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
what is your idea?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I don't know.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Before you do this,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
there is a problem.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Although you know a lot,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
you just showed us

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that there are very few offers above 50.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
There are about 600.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
So

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
your estimate of acceptance rate

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
is because

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
you are not using strategy method.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
You are showing an offer.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
So it means that

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
the point of return you are running now

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
when it is below 50

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
the variation

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
is relatively good.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
But when it is above 50,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
your estimate may not be stable.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
But this point

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
is really interesting.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Because

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
let me think about it.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Have you ever tried

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
not to use

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
a linear return when it is below 50?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
I haven't tried it yet.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
But I want to try quadratic.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
There is another possibility.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
It is not like a breakpoint.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
It is a

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
more complicated non-linear.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Because you fit linear,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
it looks like a breakpoint.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
If you look at the data directly,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
it looks at least

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I think it is quite linear.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
If you look at the

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
orange repeating game,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
it looks like

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
it is a

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
falling down.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
But it is stable

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
when it is above 40.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It is like quadratic.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
If you only look at

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
black,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
it looks like

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
it is

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
between 20 and 50.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
It is a steep drop.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
But

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
it is stable

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
when it is below 20.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
So

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
there is a possibility here.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
It's just because

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
you fit a

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
straight line relationship.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Anyway, I will try quadratic.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
But this is

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
what I estimated.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I think it is quite interesting.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
If this is true,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
how do we

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
reproduce this

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
breakpoint in the lab?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Let's look at

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
the result of ROS.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
If we look at the data of ROS,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
this breakpoint is completely invisible.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
I think this result

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
is quite special.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
We have a lot of work hypothesis

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
running at the same time.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
But we have tried

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
a power test.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
If we only draw the data,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
the sample number is about 0.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
So if we only draw 10% of the data,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
can we estimate this breakpoint?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
In our data, we can still estimate this breakpoint.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So it may not be because

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
of the problem of power in statistics.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Then another

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
work hypothesis is

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
hypothetical stake.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Is it because it's all

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
not about making money?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So I care more about the ranking between you and me.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
At least I don't want to lose you.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
So

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
this is my current work hypothesis.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
This may be

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
the next article to do

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
is how to reproduce this breakpoint in the lab.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I think it's quite interesting.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Can you remind us

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
again

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
the population composition of your data?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
For example,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
the proportion of each state.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
We have

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
seen that

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
the United States has the West,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
the Middle West,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
the Northeast,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
the South America,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Canada,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
the United Kingdom,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Spain,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
China, Japan,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
and Singapore.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
What about the proportion?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
About 80% of the data is in the North,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
about 10% in Europe,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
and 10% in Asia.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
OK.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So overall,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
this result

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
is more conservative.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
It's based on the North America,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
right?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Yes.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
OK, I just want to ask.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But I want to add

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
that the problem is

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
all the results in the lab

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
are not in the North America.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Yes.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
That's true.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
OK.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Then I'll...

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Bo-Xuan,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
if you want to compare

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
with Ross's article,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Ross's article is mainly not in the North America,

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
but the data of

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
other works

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
such as Automaton Game

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
can be observed.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I have almost never seen any shortcomings.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Yes.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
OK.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Because of the time...

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
You can go first.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
I'll go first.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I have a question.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Because the article was written

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
about 20 years ago,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
right?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yes.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Do you think the change of time

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
has a big impact on the data?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Of course it's possible.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Because a lot of social preferences

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
may change with time.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
For example, the value of Taiwanese

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
may change every few years.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
So it's true that

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
there may be a difference.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
But we can see that

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
there is a difference.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
If we look at it simply,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
if it has any impact on the shortcomings,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
maybe it's okay.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Because the shortcomings may be a mirror effect.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
But this is a big problem.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
We can talk about it later.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Then I'll go on.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Finally, the teacher just said

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
to show the reaction time.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Because our server does record

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
the reaction time.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Then I look here.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Because in one-shot game and repeated game,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
the reaction time is very similar.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So I only use one-shot game

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
to demonstrate the result.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
First of all, the black line,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
the y-axis is the reaction time.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
The black line represents the reaction time.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Then the black line is

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
our lowest estimation.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Then the orange line,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
the y-axis is my acceptance rate.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Then this is

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
also my lowest estimation.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Then below me,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
the x-axis is

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
my offer.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
If you don't have any concept,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
you can think of it as

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
doing a return in each section

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
to measure it.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
This means that

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I'm fitting the data

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
when it's close to infinity.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
It's very close.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
So what the teacher saw at the beginning

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
was at zero.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
It actually took a lot of time.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
It actually took almost 20 seconds

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
to make a decision.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
However,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
at 50,

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
there was a very sharp drop.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It only took about 8 seconds

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
to make a decision.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
This means that

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
50-50 may be

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
a very special allocation.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
At least for them,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
if I see 50-50,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I don't have to think too much

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and I can decide to accept it.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Another thing is

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
we see a very sharp kink

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
at 50-50.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
It's true that

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
no matter how

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
qualitative you are,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
at least we can still see something.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
This is the data

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
on the reaction time.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
However,

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
the interpretation is quite special.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
At least for Show,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
at 50-50,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
we can spend very little time

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
to make a decision.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
You can't record

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
the proposal time

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
to enter the game.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Because if you want to see

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
if it's default...

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
We can see

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
the time it takes

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
to enter the game.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
If you want to see

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
if it's the default option

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
that causes a lot of people to raise their hands,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
you should look at the proposal time.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Yes, you're right.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
We did look at the proposal time.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
But I remember

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
it took a lot of time here.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Hello?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Let me respond.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
At the close to 0,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
you said

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
it took a lot of time.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
You mentioned

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
that

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
you were thinking

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
that

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
at 0,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
there would be a lot of people raising their hands.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
At that time,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I was wondering

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
if it was because the starting point

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
of the slider bar was 0.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
However,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
if they spent a lot of time

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
to think about it,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I don't think

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
it's because...

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I think it's a bit like

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
negating

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
the explanation you mentioned

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
at the beginning.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I just accepted it casually.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
That's right.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
But it took a lot of time here.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
It took a lot of time

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
to respond.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
But I should show you

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the proposal time.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
But it's true.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
It's funny to explain the coding.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It took a lot of time

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
to look at this.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
A lot of people didn't want to accept it.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
It took me a long time

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
to accept it.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That's right.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Bo-xuan, you can

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
split the responder into

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
accepting and not accepting.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Okay.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
This point is quite special.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I'll split it.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I'll write it down.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Next,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I still have some time.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I'm going to talk about the result of double option.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Double option, first of all...

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Bo-xuan, before you enter the double option,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
let's talk about the

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Automatic Game breakpoint.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I was just thinking,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
you just said that one possibility of the breakpoint

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
is that everyone cares about fairness.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
The other possibility is that

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
everyone cares about

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
not counting you.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Is there a way to look at

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
the 50 proposed

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
in your data?

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Is the acceptance rate

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
particularly high?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Or is it the whole breakpoint

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
after the breakpoint is raised

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
to form a frequency curve?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Because if you care about fairness,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
maybe after 50 is particularly high,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
there will be another breakpoint

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
after 51 and 52.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
One-shot game is like this.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
There is no repeated game.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Okay.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I'll keep talking.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
The next double option is...

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
The first thing I want to show here

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
is what the data looks like.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
This is our predicted market.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
The next one is

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
the price fluctuation.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
This is just an example.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I have 10 regions here.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I choose a market for each region.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I draw it out to show you

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
what it looks like.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
You can see that I only draw four periods.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Because the length is about four periods.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
If you look at the first period,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
everyone may be very noisy.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Then look at the second and third periods.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
In fact, the price fluctuation

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
becomes less.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Then look at the fourth period.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
The more they play, the more stable they become.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
So what we want to see here is

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
that under the double option market mechanism,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
as long as they play about three or four times,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
consumers can find

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
a balanced price, even if I don't tell them anything.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
The next thing is

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
what I said earlier.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Because our bidders play very short,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
we want to estimate

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
what it is like.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
If it can play a lot of games,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
where will it end up?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
We spent about a month

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
with Alex

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
to figure this out.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
First of all, let's talk about intuition.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Don't think about intuition.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Let me give you an example.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Let's say

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
a lot of people here have the same experience.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
When you apply for a PhD,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I want to know

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
how this student

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
will perform in the next career.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But the only information I can know

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
is his GPA for the next four years.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
So

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
at this time,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
if a student wants to estimate

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
what will happen next,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
the only thing he can do is to increase his GPA

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
in different periods of time.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
So it's possible that

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I put more players in the last GPA

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
and fewer players in the first GPA.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
So in this market,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
you can look at two parts.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
First, the left side is our dependable variable.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
On the right side,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
if T is 1,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
that means I'm in the first period.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
In this case,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
it's back to the simplest way to go back.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
This is very common.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
In the first period,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
if you use the example of GPA,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
it means that in the first semester,

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
there may be a lot of variables.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Maybe it's because you're a middle school student

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
or you're from another school,

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
so it will affect your GPA in the first semester.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
But in the second semester,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I only put you at the starting point.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Maybe you're a middle school student

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
or something like that to explain this.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I only give you a quarter of the weight.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I also give you a quarter of the weight

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
of your GPA at that time.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
It means that your GPA at this time

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
may be only half,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
and it can be attributed to

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
the population composition in front of you.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
In the third period,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
I put your GPA at two-thirds of the weight.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
In this case,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I only give you one-third of the weight

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
of the starting point.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
In other words,

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
if I can make T

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
converge to infinity,

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
then my beta2

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
is actually the progressive estimate

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
of our dependent variable.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
In other words,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
if we put this y

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
on all the indicators of the first three markets,

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
it means that this market

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
will converge to where

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
if consumers can play enough.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
If we put this value

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
in front of our three dependent variables,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
this is the mean error deviation.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
The final price is only

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
1% higher than the average price.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
It is not significantly different

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
from the theoretical estimation.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
The final price change

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
is reduced to 11%.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Although the point estimate is a bit big,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
it is also not significantly different

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
from the theoretical estimation.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Finally, we can reduce the efficiency

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
to 97%,

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
which is not significantly different from 1%.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
So these results are basically

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
the same.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
At least we can prove that

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
double option is a very stable

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
price mechanism

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
to achieve 100% efficiency.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
At that time, we saw that

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
our data also showed the same thing.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
When our students can play enough,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
all of our waffers

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
should be exhausted.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
The last word is

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Can I go back to the last page?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Yes, you can.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I want to confirm

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
why there is no variable

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
next to beta 2

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
in the model?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Because this means that

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I want to see where your final GPA

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
is. I bring a constant here.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I multiply here

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
by a constant.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
This means that I am adding

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
your GPA

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
to your original

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
demographic variation.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Is it OK?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It doesn't matter.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
If you don't understand,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I will discuss with you later.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I will continue.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
What we see at the end is that

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
although there are some

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
theoretical estimates,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
if there are still some gaps,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
where are they?

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
What we see at the end is the amount of transactions.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
The horizontal axis

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
is the amount of theoretical estimates.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
The vertical axis is the amount of theoretical estimates.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
The horizontal axis is the amount of theoretical estimates.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Here is the real

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
amount of observations.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
You can see that

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
if the market is not balanced,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
we are often under-traded.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
This is because

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
the last 1-2 transactions

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
may bring us 1-2%

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
of the efficiency gap.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
In this case,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I am too lazy to make the last 1-2 cents.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
I am too lazy to make the last 1-2 cents.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
This is the main result of the double option.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
We still have about 10 minutes.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I want to talk about

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
what I said earlier.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
We have a lot of

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
transactions in different countries.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I want to use

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
some metanonysis tools

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
to analyze

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
the composition

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
of these transactions.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
The first thing we look at

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
is the transactions between countries.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
The first thing we look at

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
is the transactions between countries.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
This is a

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
calculation in metanonysis.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
This is a calculation in metanonysis.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
It is called I-square.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
If you look at the graph,

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
you can see that

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
these are

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
the average transactions

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
of the proposal offer.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Next,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
we have all the transactions.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
We have the transactions between countries.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Of course, we also have the transactions within the country.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
What we want to know is

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
the proportion of transactions

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
between countries.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Let's calculate I-square.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Since we don't have much time,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I won't talk about how to calculate I-square.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
However,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
the proportion of I-square is

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
the number of transactions

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
from between regions.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
We can see that

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
the result of the calculation is

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
86.6% of the proposal offer.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
This is a very significant transaction.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Although we dare not say this is a cultural difference,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
what we can say is

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
at least we can see that

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
the transactions between countries are very significant.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
From the same perspective,

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
we look at the acceptance rate.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
The acceptance rate is special

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
because we want to look at the acceptance rate of conditions.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
What we have to do is

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
to compare the shape of the whole probability function.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
In order to make it

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
comparable,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
what we can do is

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
we ask for a logic regression.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
On the left,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
we put 0 or 0.1.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
On the right,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
we put 10 countries' dummy variables.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
On the right,

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
we put 10 countries' dummy variables.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The result of the calculation is

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
the coefficient of the dummy variable

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
is the shape of the whole probability function.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
We use this coefficient

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
to measure the variation between countries.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We can see that

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
only 30% of the variation

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
comes from countries.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
This is not significant.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
On the right,

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
we can see that

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Proposal Offer has a significant variation

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
between countries.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
The acceptance rate is not significant.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
This is in response to

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Roth's conjecture in 1991.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
In 1991,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Roth proposed a hypothesis

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
that the cultural difference

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
between countries

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
should be

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
influenced by

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Proposal Offer.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
However,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
the acceptance rate is not affected.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
This is a good evidence

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
to respond to

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Roth's initial hypothesis.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
This is a good evidence to respond to

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Roth's initial hypothesis.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Finally, we look at the variation

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
between double options.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
We look at the first round

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
of the market.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Then we look at

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
the first price

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and the last price

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
between them.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
We want to know

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
how the market price

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
is balanced.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
This is the first price

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
of each market.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
We can see that

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
only 27.3% of the variation

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
comes from countries.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
This is not significant.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
We can see that

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
the first price

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
between countries

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
is very noisy

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
because of

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
the standard error.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
However,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
the standard error bar

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
is quite large in other countries.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
In the first round,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
you may be wondering

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
what the price is.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
In the last price,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
the standard error bar

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
is very small.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Basically,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
every country

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
can predict the price.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
If we look at

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
the overall price distribution,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
the first price

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
is about 0.33%.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
In the last price,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
the overall price is only 14%,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
so the standard error bar is 60%.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
This tells us that

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
in the beginning,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
you may not know

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
what the price is,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
but in the end,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
you can get the balance

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
very stable.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
The market will tell you

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
what the balance looks like.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
In the end,

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I will summarize

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
with this video.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
In this project,

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
we tested

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
the stability of

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
the final purchase.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
In the Ultimate Game,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
we can see that

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
more than 94% of the proposals

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
are offered at 50%.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Many of the proposals

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
will be offered

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
at the natural breakpoint.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
In terms of acceptance rate,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
we saw a 20% breakpoint.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
In the repeat auction,

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
we saw 10% more

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
breakpoints.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
In terms of response time,

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
it is basically the lowest

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
at 50%.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
In the double auction,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
no matter which of the three indicators

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
we use, accuracy,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
fluctuation, or efficiency,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
we can predict

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
when our students

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
can play enough.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
In the end,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
we tested

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
all the variations.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
In the Ultimate Game,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
the proposal offer

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
has more variables

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
than the acceptance rate.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
This corresponds to

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Roth's contracture in 1991.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
In the Ultimate Game

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
and the double auction,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
we saw a big difference

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
between the two countries.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
This corresponds to the fact that

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
the double auction is a very stable mechanism

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
in every country.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I think this is

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
all I have.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I will show my email.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
If you have any questions,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
you can email me or contact me on Facebook.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
We have about 5 minutes left.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Let's see what questions you have.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Do you have any comments?

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Thank you.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Please comment.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Do you have

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
any questions?

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I will ask first.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Wait a minute.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The first question is for you.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
You have to estimate the long-term result.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
There is a way.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
You can show us

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
the data

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
in the lab.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
If you only use the first few rounds,

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
then you can estimate

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
the long-term result.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
In this way,

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
people may understand better.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I'm not sure

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
how long

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
the gap

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
is.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
How do you estimate the long-term result?

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Let me explain first.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I mean

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
what you want to verify.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
If it is a double auction,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
then

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
why...

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You mean Asians are more polite?

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
No, I mean

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
double auctions

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
in different parts of the world

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
are closer to each other.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
However,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
there is a big difference

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
between each country.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That's what I want to say.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Okay.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Let me think about it.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Because...

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
There is a problem here.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
You mean

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
the market is

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
universal,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
and

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
there is no

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
final

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
negotiation.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
However,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
there is a problem here.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
If you don't use

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
the strategy method,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
you can't see the

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
strategy of the

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
mutual fund.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
So,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
what you see

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
is that

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
in terms of

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
acceptance or not,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
you can only explain

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
the 30% variation.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
However,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
in terms of

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
the actual strategy,

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I'm not sure

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
how far you can go.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Maybe

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
it's because

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
different countries

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
have already explained

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
most of the proposal.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
So,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
it means

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
that everyone

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
has proposed

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
social norms

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
based on that culture.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
So, there is not much difference

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
in terms of acceptance or not.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Maybe it's because

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
it's not in the proposal.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
This is also

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
what I want to point out.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Ok, that's all.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Can I ask a question?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Sure.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Hi.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
In the Ultimatum game,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
0 and 100

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
have more than 2.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I agree with what Meng just said.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
According to the proposal,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
the default reaction time

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
might be

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
a factor

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
in the outcome.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
But you said

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
you have an instruction

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
for the experiment,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
right?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
So, can you tell

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
what is

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
the incentive

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
to give

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
the same result

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
as the proposal?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Usually,

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
the incentive is

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
how many points you get

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
if you participate in the experiment.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
But I don't know

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
what their design is like.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Maybe some of them

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
are related to the outcome

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
and give you points in proportion.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Some of them

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
just participate in the experiment and give points.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
If they participate in the experiment

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
and give points,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
the proposal or the result

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
basically have no effect on them.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
If you compare the outcome

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
with Ralph's experiment,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
it's normal to have more than 100 points.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Because the result

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
is just a result.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
He didn't think of anything else.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
As for the fact that

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
there are more than 0 points,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I think

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
it's just a question.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
In general,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
people who do the experiment

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
should be

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
from the economics department.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't know if this hypothesis is right.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But this is what I imagine.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And then...

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
There is also a postgraduate school.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yes, postgraduate school.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It's a class

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
teaching the ultimate game theory.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It may teach the game theory

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
or something like that.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The problem here

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
is that

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
some classes

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
teach the ultimate game theory

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
and the theoretical prediction is 0.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Or

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
they do the experiment

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
before the theoretical prediction.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
There is a gap.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because if you do the experiment

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
after the theoretical prediction is given,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
the default of many people

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
will be 0.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Let me respond to this.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
We have seen different classes.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The smallest class

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
is the game theory class.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
This is a response.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
OK.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Can you see

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
the degree

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
of the class

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
related to the game theory?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Can you see this?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Yes.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
We can see it.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Because we have the name of the class,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
so we probably know.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
What we can't see is

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
that they teach the theoretical prediction

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
before the game theory.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
OK.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
For 0 and 100,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
there is a big difference

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
between these two classes.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So I think

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
if you can

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
clear the data,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
or find the way

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
like just now,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
then compare with the kink.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
OK.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Maybe it will be closer.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I don't know if this will affect.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
OK.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I have notes.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Thank you.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Hello.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
OK.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
You ask first.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
OK. Thank you.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
This is not a problem.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
It's more like a comment.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Since

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
you have the default option

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
bias,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
it seems to be a serious thing.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
It will make your two curves

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
different from the theoretical one.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
My idea is

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
can you...

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Will it be too difficult?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Can you change the program

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and make the starting point

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
different every time?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You can choose a starting point

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
to solve the problem.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Let me respond.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
This is technically

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
easy to do.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
But there is another problem

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
in economics.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I'm afraid there will be

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
the result of anchoring.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So...

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Sorry.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
If your starting point

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
is a very high offer,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
you may be affected

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
by that point.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
If your starting point

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
is low,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
you may be affected by that point.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So we can't

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
control

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
the most

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
standard time.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Usually,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the way to control

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
is to put $100

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
directly on the desktop.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Don't put it on both sides.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Put it one by one.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
But

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
in their

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
operation,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
they choose

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
to put it directly at the beginning.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So there will be a prediction effect.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But in terms of response time,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
the prediction effect should be small.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I have a response.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Or just change the interface

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
and just fill in the numbers.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Don't use Labar.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Of course,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
this is also possible.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But you may have to

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
talk to the engineer.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But this is also possible.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
But we want to change Labar.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
We want to use Labar mainly

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
to make the picture interesting

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
and make consumers want to buy it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Make students have fun.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I don't know why.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Everyone thinks Labar is fun.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I like Labar.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Yes, but there will be a lot of problems.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Of course.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Many people

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
operate with a tablet.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Yes, that's right.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I have a question.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Hello, can you hear me?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
This question is like this.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Because you know

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Zhang Anping is studying

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
social psychology.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
He often plays

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
the game of the game.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
But they like to do one thing.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
That is to manipulate the victim.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
For example, let you play the game first.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Then teach you Game Theory.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Then let you play the game and look at the difference.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
But what they do more often is

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
let you play the game first.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Then let you watch Hitler's documentary.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Then let you play the game and see if there is any difference.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Have you ever tried to manipulate the victim?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
This is what we can't do.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Because you are

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
giving the victim different treatments.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We can compare the experimental group and the control group.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But we are basically

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
because we don't have an experimental group and a control group.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So this is

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
what we can't do.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
But of course, if we are in the lab,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
we can do it completely.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But you can sell the product to the psychology department.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I'm sure of this.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
This is

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So we are now

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
going to hire a psychologist.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I think it will be an interesting tour.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Because they are writing.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And they have to write by themselves.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
In fact, I think

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
it's ugly to meet.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
That's what you're doing.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I think there is a marketing potential.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I should tell the boss about this.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And science

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
is also interesting.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I want to tell the boss about this.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Then Bozun

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
ask again.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
As long as you can see

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
in each area,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
you should be able to see which schools use

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I can.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Then you have

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
the education level or

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
income level

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
proposal or acceptance.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
But we have

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
each school.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I want to say that the school itself is an income proxy.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It must be some

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
I can.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I haven't connected yet.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I haven't connected with the income area.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You can

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
take a look.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You now have income data.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You have similar income or education

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
level data.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You should be able to find it.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But don't give me homework, please.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
If you have any questions,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
you can write an email to me.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Or you can find me on Facebook.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The small question I just wanted to ask

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
is that you said that

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
ROTH

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
between Proposer and Responder

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
is a hypothesis

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
of ROTH.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Is this hypothesis

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
from his data observation?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It is

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
from his data observation.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
In short,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
there are only four countries.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You can't compare the last round of data.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
You are discussing

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
100 data points.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
He can't do

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
statistical analysis.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
He can only say what the four distribution

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
look like and

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
what my observation looks like.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Are there any questions

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
from the audience?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It's time to

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
wrap up.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Can you stay for a while?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I want to have a talk with you.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Sure.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That's all for today.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Thank you.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Thank you.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Let's give him a big hand.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'll pause the recording.
