0	10000	Welcome to the Terra Talks on September 8th.
10000	17000	Today's topic is Non-Verbal Applications of Hyperbolic Metamaterials.
17000	27000	We are honored to have Dr. Lin Hong-Yi, a Ph.D. student at NTU.
27000	30000	Let me briefly introduce Dr. Hong-Yi's background.
30000	35000	Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
35000	53000	She is a non-verbal application of hyperbolic metamaterials.
53000	57000	Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
57000	65000	She is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
65000	74000	Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
74000	84000	Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
84000	94000	Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
94000	107000	Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.
108000	111000	First, let me introduce what metamaterials are.
111000	116000	You may have heard of metamaterials before.
116000	125000	Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.
125000	135000	Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.
135000	143000	Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.
143000	149000	Some people even use the concept of positive reflection.
149000	158000	Some people even use the concept of positive reflection.
159000	165000	The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.
165000	171000	The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.
171000	178000	The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.
178000	182000	Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.
183000	187000	The direction I made is called Hyperbody Metamaterial.
187000	191000	It is a Metamaterial, another one of the branches.
191000	193000	What is Hyperbody?
193000	195000	Hyperbody is the color curve.
195000	197000	The Metamaterial color curve is like this.
197000	200000	You can see, like this, double-curve.
200000	203000	Up and down, or it is left and right.
203000	206000	If you open up and down, it is Type I.
206000	207000	Type I like this.
207000	211000	The circle is basically a general material.
211000	216000	My Hyperbody Metamaterial is this up and down, Type I or Type II.
216000	221000	How to achieve the color curve of this Type I material?
221000	223000	There are some simple ways.
223000	225000	Basically, there are two components.
225000	228000	The first one is metal, and the second one is a catalyst.
228000	233000	Metal is a metal nanofiber in a dielectric environment.
233000	236000	This metal nanofiber needs a regular arrangement.
236000	241000	If it is random, its color curve distribution will not be so uniform.
241000	243000	The distribution of Hyperbody.
243000	251000	So, like this metal nanofiber, it can be like a metal nanorod.
251000	256000	Or a metal nanorod in a dielectric, like a polymer environment.
256000	261000	I have seen some people say that this is also the Hyperbody Metamaterial of Type I.
262000	268000	Another Type II Hyperbody Metamaterial is like this multi-layer film.
268000	271000	Multi-layer film is like a multi-layer film of metal and catalyst.
271000	272000	Convex structure.
272000	275000	Then it needs a lot of pairs.
275000	279000	About three or four pairs, five or six pairs or more.
279000	282000	Of course, I have seen some people do more than ten or twenty pairs.
282000	288000	In this case, the quality of the coating is very good.
288000	295000	Otherwise, the coating is not the distribution of Hyperbody Metamaterial.
295000	301000	Basically, HMM is called Hyperbody Metamaterial.
301000	304000	HMM has these two structures.
304000	306000	I often do this kind of multi-layer film.
306000	307000	Because this is very simple.
307000	310000	We use thermal to coat.
310000	313000	Then coat some metal film and catalyst film.
313000	315000	This is a cross-layer film.
315000	319000	There are other ways to achieve this kind of multi-layer structure.
319000	322000	I will also introduce this thing in addition today.
322000	325000	What are the benefits of this HMM?
325000	326000	What are the features?
326000	328000	You can see that this is its Wave Vector.
328000	332000	So it will have a lot of Wave Vector Modes in it.
332000	339000	What are the benefits of having a Wave Vector Mode?
339000	342000	The biggest benefit is that its Density of State is very large.
342000	345000	You can take a look at the Fermi's Golden Rule.
345000	346000	I'll just mention it a little bit.
346000	352000	Fermi's Golden Rule's Transition Rate is proportional to my Density of State.
352000	354000	The Density of State is also proportional to my Wave Vector.
354000	357000	So my Wave Vector Mode is very high.
357000	359000	My Density of State is large.
359000	362000	If the Density of State is large, it means that my Transition Rate is high.
362000	364000	What does Transition Rate mean?
364000	366000	You can take a look at it.
366000	369000	It's like if my PO is a fluorescent molecule.
369000	371000	It can make my radiation more.
371000	376000	So if a fluorescent molecule is placed on top of my HMM, it will radiate more.
376000	378000	Because it's in my Excited State.
378000	379000	Jump to Ground State.
379000	381000	It can store more energy.
381000	388000	So what it means is that it consumes less radiation.
388000	390000	Because it stores more radiation.
390000	393000	Basically, we put some fluorescent molecules or fuels.
393000	397000	There will be a stronger trend on this HMM base.
398000	402000	Let's compare HMM with other materials.
402000	406000	What is the concept of HMM and other materials?
406000	408000	What is the concept of HMM and other materials?
408000	410000	Usually, we have some diagrams.
410000	412000	For example, SL2 or TL2.
412000	417000	Its radiation curve is a very regular linear radiation curve.
417000	422000	Its Isofrequence Surface is like what you just saw.
422000	425000	It's a circle.
425000	429000	Its Density of State is like this.
429000	432000	It's not so much.
432000	434000	You can see this picture.
434000	436000	The phenomenon of Metal Directory is like...
436000	438000	This base is the Directory.
438000	441000	I may have some metal nanoparticles on it.
441000	445000	You may have seen the enhancement of POSMONICS.
445000	450000	It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.
450000	452000	Gold particles or silver particles.
452000	454000	It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.
454000	456000	It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.
456000	458000	It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.
458000	463000	It's because the interface of metal and solid electrons will have a very strong local field.
463000	469000	This local field is called Surface POSMON Polariton.
469000	476000	This Surface POSMON can only be activated at a certain ray light and frequency.
476000	479000	So, like this metal or solid electrons.
479000	483000	Enhancement behavior on these large electrons.
483000	489000	This is what we call Surface POSMON Polariton Enhancement.
489000	493000	The one on the far right is Metal Nanoparticle.
493000	495000	This is a metal nanoparticle.
495000	500000	There will be different field enhancement behaviors after the light hits.
500000	504000	But this kind of field enhancement behavior also has a certain frequency.
504000	509000	Or a certain direction can trigger more energy.
509000	513000	So this kind of enhancement behavior is also a kind of separation.
513000	515000	It's not a very broadband enhancement.
515000	519000	The reason why I chose HMM is like this.
519000	526000	The third column is because HMM has a lot of Density of State.
526000	531000	Then different angles can also trigger different modalities.
531000	535000	So it can make my luminous molecules above.
535000	537000	Or other materials or dyes.
537000	539000	It hits the PL enhancement.
539000	541000	PL is Photoluminescence Enhancement.
541000	543000	Or hit the laser enhancement.
543000	545000	All have a certain effect.
545000	548000	I will also introduce you a little bit in the following video.
548000	552000	This is the basic concept of material.
552000	557000	I listed a little bit about what HMM has to do.
558000	566000	HMM has a High Wave Vector Mode.
566000	568000	So the light that comes into the factory can be transmitted to the original factory.
568000	570000	Instead of the electromagnetic wave.
570000	573000	Instead of the evanescence field disappear.
573000	577000	So HMM's early application is to do this.
577000	579000	Far Field Image.
579000	581000	For example, the light that comes into the factory can be transmitted to the original factory.
581000	584000	Not like ordinary metal or other materials.
585000	587000	Decay at the front.
587000	590000	Because the light can be transmitted in this multi-layer film.
590000	594000	So some people used to do waveguide.
594000	598000	I have seen some people do some patterns on the multi-layer film.
598000	601000	Then the pattern is retained.
601000	603000	This is IN and this is OUT.
603000	605000	Can be used as a biosensor.
605000	611000	Then they put some detectors.
612000	614000	Then use the form of light.
614000	616000	Can measure the change of different penetrations.
616000	618000	Then come to a biosensor.
618000	621000	This is published on Natural Material.
621000	627000	Then there are people who use simulation to calculate.
627000	629000	This kind of ring multi-layer film.
629000	631000	It can be INVISIBLE COAT.
631000	633000	For example, the things inside me can be covered.
633000	635000	So I come in from here.
635000	637000	My scattering things go out from here.
637000	640000	The electromagnetic wave will not be affected at all.
640000	644000	So some people use this concept to do INVISIBLE COAT.
644000	646000	But this concept is only at a certain frequency.
646000	649000	May be at a certain frequency.
649000	652000	Can achieve this INVISIBLE COAT behavior.
652000	654000	That may not work in a broadband.
654000	658000	So this is just a simulation result.
660000	663000	I have seen some people use this to say.
663000	667000	This kind of HM energy can be transmitted inside.
667000	670000	So some people say this kind of HM structure.
670000	672000	Like this is a multi-layer film structure.
672000	674000	Then this is the NETWORK.
674000	676000	Plugged in the Type-1 structure.
676000	680000	It is said that it can be used as a light communication behavior.
680000	682000	Because the energy can be transmitted inside.
682000	684000	So they say this.
684000	685000	Maybe this can be used in the future.
685000	687000	Is an optical transmission behavior.
687000	690000	Let's look at the top here.
690000	693000	The top here is this year.
693000	696000	Cai Dingming Laboratory published on Advanced Material.
696000	698000	They use Pattern HM structure.
698000	700000	This is a multi-layer film structure.
700000	702000	Then use FOX-3B to make Pattern.
702000	704000	You can see this kind of tofu-like structure.
704000	708000	Then the top is Multicorner Well.
708000	712000	Then I use a short-wave 266 pumping laser to fight.
712000	714000	Then there will be a long-wave 289.
714000	718000	A long-wave 289 laser comes out.
718000	720000	That 289 is a Deep UV.
720000	723000	So this thing is 266 Pump.
723000	726000	Then 289 Lacing is a Deep UV laser.
726000	729000	The width is only about 2-3 nm.
729000	733000	The result of this HM Pattern.
733000	735000	It can also be regarded as an enhanced behavior of LED.
735000	738000	This is published on Nano Energy.
738000	741000	It was also published by Cai Dingming Laboratory this year.
741000	745000	Because this HM has a large Density of State.
745000	749000	So it can enhance this Light Matter Interaction.
749000	752000	So it can reach the enhancement of laser or LED.
752000	755000	In the early days, there were only two PL enhancements.
755000	758000	PL enhancement is...
758000	761000	This is published on the Nature Nano Technology Shop in 2014.
761000	763000	For example, I patterned a multi-layer film structure.
763000	766000	Then the top is mixed with some dye.
766000	768000	Like R6G or PMMA.
768000	772000	Because the concept of PL enhancement is spontaneous radiation.
772000	774000	Spontaneous Emission.
774000	778000	This year is to achieve Stimulant Emission.
778000	781000	This is published by Cai Dingming Laboratory.
781000	785000	Because of its high purity rate.
785000	788000	So this pattern structure, multi-layer film structure.
788000	791000	I saw someone use it as a color film emitter.
791000	794000	Basically, this is the application of HM.
794000	795000	It's quite a wide range.
795000	798000	It's not just a simple theoretical application.
798000	801000	So now, in addition to doing Biosensor and Laser.
801000	804000	And PL enhancement.
804000	805000	Now more and more people.
805000	808000	Will also use this HM to do different applications.
808000	812000	So now I see that the main thing is to publish this trend.
812000	817000	How to design a good HM?
817000	820000	Usually HM is with me.
820000	823000	Because my HM multi-layer structure.
823000	826000	It's about the thickness of my metal and solder.
826000	830000	First of all, let's take a look at what Feofixion is.
830000	832000	Feofixion is the thickness of metal.
832000	835000	The thickness of metal is the thickness of metal and solder.
835000	837000	This is the thickness of a pair.
837000	839000	So different Feofixion.
839000	842000	In different wavelengths, this is the wavelength.
842000	843000	What you see is different.
843000	846000	This is the fun part of HM.
846000	849000	If it's like this one, for example.
849000	851000	Feofixion is at 0.5.
851000	853000	Its short wavelength is Type 1.
853000	855000	Type 1 is the color curve is up and down.
855000	857000	Type 2 is left and right.
857000	861000	If Feofixion is a little less.
861000	863000	Because Feofixion is less.
863000	865000	It means that the metal component is less.
865000	866000	The metal component is less.
866000	869000	Overall, what it sees is a capacitance.
869000	871000	So it's not HM.
871000	873000	It's elliptical metameter.
873000	875000	Elliptical is elliptical.
875000	877000	It's like the general kind of material.
877000	879000	We call it EMF.
879000	881000	If the metal component is more.
881000	884000	It's a metal material compared to it.
884000	885000	Not HM.
885000	887000	So it's also a type of EMF.
888000	891000	Does EMF have a lot of difference in optical measurement?
891000	894000	Sometimes it's a few times worse.
894000	899000	This is ACS Photonics.
899000	902000	In 2007, it also measured some of Peo's enhancements.
902000	904000	It also put the fuel molecule.
904000	907000	On my multi-layer HM board.
907000	909000	You can see that on the HM board.
909000	911000	Its enhancement is quite strong.
911000	913000	It can be more than 1,000.
913000	916000	If it's on EMF, it's about 400.
916000	921000	So if it's the same multi-layer HM board.
921000	925000	But my metal and fuel molecule thickness ratio is wrong.
925000	927000	The behavior of my enhancement is much worse.
927000	930000	This type of EMF will also enhance.
930000	931000	The reason it will also enhance.
931000	935000	Because it may be the enhancement of effective metal.
935000	938000	That is to say, at least my board will reflect a little.
938000	941000	So it will also enhance a little.
941000	944000	But it's not as much as HM.
944000	947000	This is 2012's Photoscience.
947000	952000	EMF will have a longer lifetime.
952000	955000	HM will have a shorter lifetime.
955000	957000	For a fluorescent molecule.
957000	963000	The longer the lifetime, the longer it will stay in the activation state.
963000	964000	It will jump out.
964000	966000	It will jump to the ground state for a longer time.
966000	968000	For example, if it jumps to the ground state for a longer time.
968000	971000	It means it may be damaged by some other heat energy.
972000	975000	So if I want to enhance PO.
975000	977000	The shorter my lifetime, the better.
977000	980000	That is to say, the shorter it stays in the activation state, the better.
980000	984000	Then it can achieve a lot of PO enhancement purposes.
984000	988000	So when we look at this kind of light-metal interaction.
988000	990000	We all look at the first PO.
990000	991000	Is it enhanced?
991000	993000	Second, does it have a shorter lifetime?
993000	996000	That is usually the EMF's lifetime will be longer.
996000	998000	Then its PO will be less.
999000	1004000	This is the basic concept of light-metal interaction.
1006000	1008000	I'm here with Mr. Chen Yongfang.
1008000	1012000	Mainly do something called random laser.
1012000	1015000	Let me mention a little bit about what random is.
1015000	1017000	Sorry, I have a question.
1017000	1022000	I guess you're going to talk more specifically about your lab.
1022000	1025000	So I want to ask a more out-of-the-box question.
1025000	1028000	Because I don't make materials.
1032000	1034000	Basically, from the point of view of electronics.
1034000	1037000	Now the focus of metal materials is on.
1037000	1041000	For example, you are now showing these hundreds of nanometers of wavelength.
1041000	1044000	Because basically you have to have a wavelength.
1044000	1047000	Far greater than a field, a pair, right?
1047000	1052000	So you are equal to the unequality of the material.
1052000	1054000	Then it becomes that you can adjust it.
1054000	1057000	Then let the light see an average effect.
1058000	1060000	If I want to operate today.
1060000	1063000	For example, if it is a wave, I can.
1063000	1066000	For example, a layer is 100 nanometers.
1066000	1068000	Then pass two or three layers.
1068000	1070000	Will it have the same effect of metal material?
1070000	1073000	I have seen this kind of thing at the beginning.
1073000	1075000	Their thickness is very thick.
1075000	1077000	You can see it with your eyes.
1077000	1079000	This kind of multi-layer film.
1079000	1082000	Unlike our film is more than 10, 20, 30 nanometers.
1083000	1086000	Unless you have seen, for example, sub-micron.
1086000	1088000	100 nanometers or something.
1088000	1090000	Yes, I have seen a very thick one.
1090000	1093000	Then it may not be the way to grind.
1093000	1097000	Because the grinding may be 1-2 nanometers at a time.
1097000	1101000	Because they are all 1-second ENSO.
1101000	1103000	1 ENSO is 0.1 nanometer.
1103000	1106000	If I want to do 1000 nanometers.
1106000	1108000	Then you have to do a lot of pairs.
1108000	1110000	That is to be very high-strength.
1110000	1113000	Of course, I have seen someone like Weibo or Terahertz.
1113000	1115000	Use the same concept to explain.
1115000	1117000	Then it will also have an effect.
1117000	1118000	Also have.
1118000	1120000	Because it was in the early stage.
1120000	1122000	Such a long wave.
1122000	1125000	Now everyone is more interested in visible light.
1125000	1128000	The structure of visible light multi-layer film is very small.
1128000	1130000	OK.
1130000	1132000	So there is still such a feature.
1132000	1135000	I have a second question.
1135000	1137000	The second question is.
1138000	1141000	Your metal is basically operating at a constant temperature.
1141000	1146000	So its skin depth is basically 1 over the square root of the wavelength.
1146000	1148000	That's right.
1148000	1150000	If today.
1150000	1152000	For example, the metal you grind up.
1152000	1155000	It will become a super conductor at a very low temperature.
1155000	1157000	That super conductor.
1157000	1160000	Its skin depth is 1 over the length.
1160000	1162000	Not.
1162000	1163000	Wait a minute.
1163000	1165000	1 over the wavelength.
1165000	1168000	Anyway, it will not be the same.
1168000	1170000	But it will have the same effect.
1170000	1173000	If I want to operate at a very low temperature.
1173000	1176000	There will also be the effect of metamaterial.
1176000	1178000	I haven't seen this yet.
1178000	1180000	But because.
1180000	1182000	This may also be a good research direction.
1182000	1183000	Right.
1183000	1184000	Measure at a very low temperature.
1184000	1186000	See what will happen.
1186000	1188000	I guess.
1188000	1189000	It will be different in terms of brightness.
1189000	1191000	But it should still have some effect in terms of straightness.
1191000	1193000	Because it is basically a skin depth.
1193000	1195000	Here.
1195000	1197000	Not sure.
1197000	1199000	Because standing at such a low temperature.
1199000	1200000	The concept of super conductor.
1200000	1201000	I remember this HMM.
1201000	1204000	I don't think I've done this yet.
1204000	1205000	Because it may be limited to experiments.
1205000	1208000	I guess this low temperature is also the kind of ethyl chloride.
1208000	1210000	Very low, very low temperature.
1210000	1211000	I guess.
1211000	1212000	OK.
1212000	1215000	I haven't seen this yet.
1215000	1218000	But I guess it should be a good topic.
1218000	1219000	OK.
1220000	1223000	Basically, this is the concept of my HMM.
1223000	1225000	Then I will skip a little bit.
1225000	1226000	Another topic is.
1226000	1229000	Random laser.
1229000	1230000	What is random laser?
1230000	1232000	Then we first introduce.
1232000	1234000	What is a general laser?
1234000	1235000	General laser.
1235000	1237000	I need a fixed rectifier.
1237000	1239000	Then my quality.
1239000	1240000	The quality must be very good.
1240000	1241000	It's a game medium.
1241000	1242000	In a.
1242000	1243000	A.
1243000	1244000	A.
1244000	1245000	A.
1245000	1246000	In a rectifier.
1246000	1248000	Then when I pass the light inside.
1248000	1249000	Back and forth.
1249000	1251000	The round trip.
1251000	1252000	Uh.
1252000	1253000	Uh.
1253000	1254000	Propagate.
1254000	1255000	When the gain is greater than the loss.
1255000	1257000	Will be from a certain direction.
1257000	1258000	Specific frequency.
1258000	1259000	Then.
1259000	1260000	Lacing out.
1260000	1262000	Then this is the general concept of laser.
1262000	1265000	It can be applied to a lot of things like a laser pen.
1265000	1266000	Visography.
1266000	1267000	Cutting.
1267000	1268000	And light.
1268000	1269000	A lot of surgery.
1269000	1270000	This kind of.
1270000	1271000	Behavior.
1271000	1272000	On the application.
1272000	1273000	This is the general concept of laser.
1273000	1274000	What is it called?
1274000	1275000	I am now mainly.
1275000	1276000	Focus on.
1276000	1277000	HM.
1277000	1278000	Combined.
1278000	1279000	The concept of random laser.
1279000	1281000	What is that random laser?
1281000	1282000	Random laser.
1282000	1284000	Also want this kind of game medium.
1284000	1285000	Like ZMO.
1285000	1286000	This.
1286000	1287000	Very irregular.
1287000	1288000	Uh.
1288000	1289000	Nanoparticle.
1289000	1290000	In this.
1290000	1291000	That.
1291000	1292000	In this environment.
1292000	1294000	Then when I am very focused.
1294000	1295000	Very.
1295000	1296000	Uh.
1296000	1297000	Hit me this.
1297000	1299000	On top of the game medium.
1299000	1300000	It will be here.
1300000	1302000	A process of multiple scattering.
1302000	1303000	Just like this.
1303000	1304000	That is.
1304000	1305000	Multiple scattering.
1305000	1307000	When it comes to this kind of game.
1307000	1308000	When it's bigger than Rose.
1308000	1309000	It will also be.
1309000	1310000	Very.
1310000	1311000	Very wide.
1311000	1313000	To reach a type.
1313000	1315000	The level of laser.
1315000	1317000	That kind of laser.
1317000	1318000	Uh.
1318000	1319000	Because it's this kind of random laser.
1319000	1320000	So it's light.
1320000	1321000	Will be inside.
1321000	1322000	Scattering everywhere.
1322000	1324000	So the direction it comes out.
1324000	1325000	Is.
1325000	1326000	Uh.
1326000	1327000	We call it both.
1327000	1328000	Angular.
1328000	1329000	Or.
1329000	1330000	Angle free.
1330000	1331000	This kind of emission.
1331000	1332000	Unlike general laser.
1332000	1333000	Only in a specific direction.
1333000	1334000	Will come out.
1334000	1335000	So he.
1335000	1336000	We are this kind of random laser.
1336000	1337000	It's a different angle.
1337000	1338000	Can be lighted up.
1338000	1339000	This kind of laser signal.
1339000	1341000	So it's a little bit like the general laser.
1341000	1342000	Not the same.
1342000	1343000	That's it.
1343000	1344000	Uh.
1344000	1345000	General laser.
1345000	1346000	With random laser.
1346000	1347000	Concept.
1347000	1348000	That.
1348000	1349000	What.
1349000	1350000	That.
1350000	1351000	Mechanism.
1351000	1352000	The random laser.
1352000	1353000	Is.
1353000	1354000	It's just like I just said.
1354000	1355000	It's me.
1355000	1356000	A pump laser.
1356000	1357000	And then.
1357000	1358000	Hit me this.
1358000	1359000	On top of the game medium.
1359000	1360000	Then.
1360000	1361000	When it's bigger than Rose.
1361000	1362000	So.
1362000	1363000	There will be a laser effect.
1363000	1364000	Come out.
1364000	1365000	That.
1365000	1366000	We will say.
1366000	1367000	This is called.
1367000	1368000	Cross loop.
1368000	1369000	And then.
1369000	1370000	Represents its light.
1370000	1371000	In some places.
1371000	1372000	The game medium.
1372000	1373000	Will.
1373000	1374000	Be very strong.
1374000	1375000	So he.
1375000	1376000	The probability of getting bigger than Rose.
1376000	1377000	Will be greater.
1377000	1378000	So he.
1378000	1379000	Can be received from different angles.
1379000	1380000	That.
1380000	1381000	We usually discuss with randomness.
1381000	1382000	When.
1382000	1383000	We will discuss.
1383000	1384000	Say he's a.
1384000	1385000	Scattering.
1385000	1386000	One thing.
1386000	1387000	That.
1387000	1388000	Random laser.
1388000	1389000	Signal.
1389000	1390000	That.
1390000	1391000	Random laser.
1391000	1392000	Signal.
1392000	1393000	Probably like this.
1393000	1394000	This is me.
1394000	1395000	Peel.
1395000	1396000	I.
1396000	1397000	Generally.
1397000	1398000	If it's like.
1398000	1399000	I.
1399000	1400000	I hit it with a laser.
1400000	1401000	Will get a peel.
1401000	1402000	A bag.
1402000	1403000	A bag of peel.
1403000	1404000	Signal.
1404000	1405000	That.
1405000	1406000	When I'm strengthening my power.
1406000	1407000	I will get.
1407000	1408000	Amplify.
1408000	1409000	Spontaneous emission.
1409000	1410000	It's like this green thing.
1410000	1411000	That.
1411000	1412000	I'm strengthening my power.
1412000	1413000	I will get this.
1413000	1414000	Random laser.
1414000	1415000	Peak.
1415000	1416000	This is a typical.
1416000	1417000	Random laser.
1417000	1418000	Peak.
1418000	1419000	It's like this.
1419000	1420000	The peak I measured with the next second.
1420000	1421000	It's a little bit different.
1421000	1422000	Because he.
1422000	1423000	The last second and the next second.
1423000	1424000	Light in there.
1424000	1425000	Scattering everywhere.
1425000	1426000	The process is different.
1426000	1427000	That.
1427000	1428000	Not all.
1428000	1429000	The material.
1429000	1430000	Will hit this.
1430000	1431000	Random laser.
1431000	1432000	That.
1432000	1433000	Need.
1433000	1434000	Like my material.
1434000	1435000	Need to have a certain.
1435000	1436000	Scattering things.
1436000	1437000	Or scattering.
1437000	1438000	He will hit this.
1438000	1439000	Random laser.
1439000	1440000	The.
1440000	1441000	Peak out.
1441000	1442000	That.
1442000	1443000	The advantage of random laser.
1443000	1444000	Is that I measure different angles.
1444000	1445000	You can take a look.
1445000	1446000	I might be 30 degrees.
1446000	1447000	Or 45 degrees.
1447000	1448000	Or 60 degrees.
1448000	1449000	Different angles of light.
1449000	1450000	I can get this.
1450000	1451000	Random laser.
1451000	1452000	Peak.
1452000	1453000	Out.
1453000	1454000	That.
1454000	1455000	This kind of random laser.
1455000	1456000	He has his own.
1456000	1457000	Advantage.
1457000	1458000	If applied to this kind of lighting.
1458000	1459000	He is from different angles.
1459000	1460000	You can have this.
1460000	1461000	Very strong signal.
1461000	1462000	And.
1462000	1463000	Uh.
1463000	1464000	And he's a very.
1464000	1465000	Wide-angle behavior.
1465000	1466000	That's it.
1466000	1467000	Uh.
1467000	1468000	Typical.
1468000	1469000	Random laser.
1469000	1470000	A feature.
1470000	1471000	He's a board.
1471000	1472000	Angle.
1472000	1473000	Uh.
1473000	1474000	Emission.
1474000	1475000	That.
1475000	1476000	My first.
1476000	1477000	The first thing I do is.
1477000	1478000	Here is the combination of the teacher.
1478000	1479000	HMM.
1479000	1480000	The board.
1480000	1481000	There's this mess on it.
1481000	1482000	This kind of.
1482000	1483000	Uh.
1483000	1484000	Zin-R-Side.
1484000	1485000	Nanoparticle.
1485000	1486000	His size is very irregular.
1486000	1487000	It's maybe 50 nanometers.
1487000	1488000	To.
1488000	1489000	Maybe.
1489000	1490000	Two or three hundred nanometers.
1490000	1491000	There are.
1491000	1492000	So I use the green light.
1492000	1493000	If.
1493000	1494000	I'm going to be in my.
1494000	1495000	This.
1495000	1496000	ZMO nanoparticle.
1496000	1497000	A scattering process.
1497000	1498000	Then.
1498000	1499000	Will be different angles.
1499000	1500000	Uh.
1500000	1501000	Random laser.
1501000	1502000	Out.
1502000	1503000	That.
1503000	1504000	You can.
1504000	1505000	Right.
1505000	1506000	I've seen it before.
1506000	1507000	The first one.
1507000	1508000	Uh.
1508000	1509000	Cai Liming.
1509000	1510000	It's already been used.
1510000	1511000	Uh.
1511000	1512000	Payton.
1512000	1513000	HMM.
1513000	1514000	Stemming emission.
1514000	1515000	He's a single.
1515000	1516000	That.
1516000	1517000	I'm using this.
1517000	1518000	Uh.
1518000	1519000	ZMO nanoparticle.
1519000	1520000	On the HMM board.
1520000	1521000	To achieve a random laser.
1521000	1522000	Behavior.
1522000	1523000	That.
1523000	1524000	This is what I compared.
1524000	1525000	Different.
1525000	1526000	HMM sample.
1526000	1527000	There's my EMA sample.
1527000	1528000	And my reference.
1528000	1529000	Reference is.
1529000	1530000	Control.
1530000	1531000	Simple.
1531000	1532000	That's ZMO nanoparticle.
1532000	1533000	On the general.
1533000	1534000	Silicon.
1534000	1535000	That's his original.
1535000	1536000	ZMO nanoparticle.
1536000	1537000	He's going to have some.
1537000	1538000	Random laser.
1538000	1539000	Peak.
1539000	1540000	That's what I want.
1540000	1541000	Uh.
1541000	1542000	Intensity.
1542000	1543000	It's going to be a little bit bigger.
1543000	1544000	He's going to have.
1544000	1545000	That.
1545000	1546000	Power.
1546000	1547000	A little bit.
1547000	1548000	He's just a general PL signal.
1548000	1549000	That.
1549000	1550000	If I zoom in here.
1550000	1551000	He's just a general PL signal.
1551000	1552000	That.
1552000	1553000	EMA sample.
1553000	1554000	Uh.
1554000	1555000	I designed this work.
1555000	1556000	Two.
1556000	1557000	Different.
1557000	1558000	Multi-layer model ratio.
1558000	1559000	One is.
1559000	1560000	He's in this.
1560000	1561000	HMM.
1561000	1562000	The other one is.
1562000	1563000	He's in this.
1563000	1564000	EMF.
1564000	1565000	You can also.
1565000	1566000	You can see that he's in this.
1566000	1567000	When this wave section.
1567000	1568000	His brilliance.
1568000	1569000	Stronger is a bit weaker.
1569000	1570000	But he was in hours.
1570000	1571000	Of this.
1571000	1572000	amp Wave.
1572000	1573000	Of the word.
1573000	1574000	Of his.
1574000	1575000	Scare him.
1575000	1576000	Lazys effect.
1576000	1577000	Is very powerful.
1577000	1578000	You can see this.
1578000	1579000	There's a lot of it.
1579000	1580000	This kind of prickles.
1580000	1581000	Speak.
1581000	1582000	The signal.
1582000	1583000	That is.
1583000	1584000	La RES一樣不好就是也不重要
1584000	1585000	It's like this one.
1585000	1586000	That.
1586000	1587000	That.
1587000	1588000	I'm in this design.
1588000	1589000	At.
1589000	1590000	AM.
1590000	1591000	This is just to.
1591000	1592000	Task.
1592000	1593000	I'm on this side.
1593000	1594000	It's at 45 degrees.
1594000	1595000	Uh.
1595000	1596000	Angle on both sides.
1596000	1597000	That.
1597000	1598000	You can see this intensity.
1598000	1599000	With.
1599000	1600000	Uh.
1600000	1601000	Power density is.
1601000	1602000	Uh.
1602000	1603000	Uh.
1603000	1604000	Uh.
1604000	1605000	Uh.
1605000	1606000	Uh.
1606000	1607000	Uh.
1607000	1608000	Uh.
1608000	1609000	Uh.
1609000	1610000	Uh.
1610000	1611000	Uh.
1611000	1612000	Uh.
1612000	1613000	Uh.
1613000	1614000	Uh.
1614000	1615000	Uh.
1615000	1616000	Uh.
1616000	1617000	Uh.
1617000	1618000	Uh.
1618000	1619000	Uh.
1619000	1620000	Uh.
1620000	1621000	Uh.
1621000	1622000	Speak.
1622000	1623000	At.
1623000	1624000	AndPlayback.
1624000	1625000	If it is probably, it doesn't matter.
1625000	1626000	Uh.
1626000	1627000	Speaker.
1627000	1628000	What's going on?
1628000	1629000	The force should not be heavy.
1629000	1630000	Once under massage together.
1630000	1631000	I don't want to fall every time.
1631000	1632000	Uh.
1632000	1633000	Uh.
1633000	1634000	Uh.
1634000	1635000	Come on those days.
1635000	1636000	Power use guy.
1636000	1640000	That's all I'm saying wait.
1640000	1642000	Don't get that.
1642000	1643000	Just lazer.
1643000	1644000	Speak.
1644000	1645000	Scientist.
1645000	1646000	What's on Picachin night?
1646000	1647000	That doesn't sound like it's working.
1647000	1648000	There's my alligator.
1648000	1649000	And that's how deep it is.
1649000	1650000	That data is.
1650000	1653000	You can see that I'm usually different.
1653000	1654000	That.
1654000	1655000	I'm different.
1655000	1656000	Power.
1656000	1657000	Uh.
1657000	1658000	In the measurement test, my HM machine board.
1658000	1659000	He's two.
1659000	1660000	It.
1660000	1662000	The enhancement is stronger than the men and the reference.
1662000	1667000	That we can even see an additional.
1667000	1669000	What are you looking at?
1669000	1670000	There will even be a.
1670000	1673000	The phenomenon of a child on the HMS board.
1673000	1674000	That I'm a little bit.
1674000	1678000	I'm going to use a little bit of simulation to explain why this thing is there.
1679000	1680000	That.
1680000	1683000	We have different angles of measurement.
1683000	1686000	Maybe this is the color of the road.
1686000	1689000	The angle of the road is 30 degrees.
1689000	1691000	The other one is 60 degrees.
1691000	1693000	That's basically what my HMS is.
1693000	1695000	Enhancement will be stronger than others.
1695000	1697000	That's what this is.
1697000	1699000	Because it's a random laser.
1699000	1702000	So I measured it in the last second.
1702000	1704000	Emission stability.
1704000	1706000	It's going to be a distribution of the curve.
1707000	1708000	In other words, HMS.
1708000	1710000	He may be from more than 800 to about 1100.
1710000	1711000	That.
1711000	1712000	We measured it several times.
1712000	1713000	It's probably a.
1713000	1715000	It's kind of a stable.
1715000	1716000	That.
1716000	1717000	So, on behalf of me, this random laser.
1717000	1718000	This one.
1718000	1719000	Zero nanoparticle.
1719000	1721000	And my whole material.
1721000	1722000	He won't because.
1722000	1724000	Uh, the longer it takes.
1724000	1725000	Uh, uh.
1725000	1727000	So his, uh, intensity will drop.
1727000	1730000	So it's basically a very stable emission process.
1731000	1733000	That's what I'm going to do with a little bit of power.
1733000	1735000	The laser to measure.
1735000	1738000	He's going to have a P.O. signal.
1738000	1741000	That's why I'm going to use the stronger power to measure.
1741000	1743000	He's going to have a random laser.
1743000	1744000	You can see his.
1744000	1746000	Uh, I'm going to measure it with a 3G4 laser.
1746000	1747000	His.
1747000	1749000	Well, the energy is.
1749000	1751000	More than 100 millijoules.
1751000	1752000	That's what I'm looking for.
1752000	1753000	The energy is used.
1753000	1755000	More than 20 millijoules.
1755000	1756000	Oh, I'm sorry.
1756000	1758000	This is more than 100 microjoules.
1758000	1760000	This is more than 20 millijoules.
1760000	1762000	So he's a very large number.
1762000	1764000	So I'm going to have to be stronger.
1764000	1767000	I'm going to be able to get a random laser signal.
1767000	1769000	So this is the behavior of measuring my life.
1769000	1771000	So you can see that my HM machine.
1771000	1774000	My life is probably more than 2 nanoseconds.
1774000	1777000	That's going to be shorter than my EMM.
1777000	1779000	The shorter the life.
1779000	1780000	His.
1780000	1781000	Uh, uh.
1781000	1782000	Uh.
1782000	1785000	That's going to be bigger.
1785000	1788000	The resolution Ray will be bigger.
1788000	1791000	That's the shortest I can get.
1791000	1794000	It's easier to get a random laser behavior.
1797000	1799000	So this is my FD numerical FDD.
1799000	1801000	A little run simulation.
1801000	1803000	This is my input signal.
1803000	1804000	I can take a look at my.
1804000	1806000	This is where I put a ZN or NaN particle.
1806000	1808000	This is my HM machine.
1808000	1810000	Let's take a look at how he affects the overall.
1810000	1813000	Uh, what's the effect of the barfield?
1813000	1815000	You can see my HM machine.
1815000	1817000	In this area, there is a relatively strong.
1817000	1820000	A strong barfield.
1820000	1822000	That's a little bit weaker.
1822000	1823000	This is what I'm doing.
1823000	1825000	After a normalization.
1825000	1827000	So you can see it clearly.
1827000	1829000	If it's a real machine.
1829000	1832000	My ray beam will go under me.
1832000	1834000	That's my HM machine.
1834000	1836000	He's going to my positive.
1836000	1838000	A very strong scattering phenomenon.
1838000	1841000	So this is a very strong scattering phenomenon.
1841000	1843000	It will also be conducive to my.
1843000	1845000	A random laser behavior.
1849000	1851000	So this is the continuation of the simulation.
1851000	1853000	This is my original distribution map.
1853000	1855000	So you can see my.
1855000	1858000	0 to 180 is my positive.
1858000	1860000	180 to 360 is.
1860000	1862000	Go down.
1864000	1866000	So you can see my HM machine.
1866000	1868000	He's a lot more.
1868000	1870000	It's going to my original direction.
1870000	1872000	Positive direction.
1872000	1873000	It's ZMO.
1873000	1875000	It's going to ZMO.
1875000	1877000	So it's going to help me.
1877000	1879000	One of the ZMO.
1879000	1881000	Uh, the scattering process.
1881000	1882000	So this is me.
1882000	1884000	I ran some simulations from different angles.
1884000	1886000	So you can see my.
1886000	1888000	Red is HM.
1888000	1890000	The red HM.
1890000	1892000	It's basically stronger than the green EMM.
1892000	1894000	Scattering is even stronger.
1894000	1896000	The blue is my reference board.
1899000	1900000	So I.
1900000	1901000	Because random laser.
1901000	1903000	It's a scattering process.
1903000	1904000	So I did some math.
1904000	1906000	Scattering efficiency.
1906000	1908000	So first of all, I.
1908000	1910000	I put a ZMO nanoparticle first.
1910000	1912000	It may be a 40 nanometer radius.
1912000	1914000	The height is 100 nanometers.
1914000	1916000	Put it on my different HM board.
1916000	1918000	Or EMM board.
1918000	1920000	Or reference board.
1920000	1922000	You can see my HM board.
1922000	1924000	His scattering efficiency.
1924000	1926000	It's going to be a lot higher than my EMM.
1926000	1928000	It's going to be a lot higher.
1928000	1930000	And my HM board.
1930000	1931000	He's in.
1931000	1933000	Especially in the 389 long-wave field.
1933000	1934000	This one will be more.
1934000	1935000	So.
1935000	1937000	I jumped back here to explain.
1940000	1941000	Here.
1941000	1942000	I have more long-wave fields.
1942000	1943000	So.
1943000	1945000	I was thinking about this thing.
1945000	1947000	In addition, there will be a phenomenon of redness.
1947000	1949000	It's because my HM is on the long-wave field.
1949000	1950000	It's stronger.
1950000	1952000	Scattering is more likely to result in.
1952000	1954000	Of course I.
1954000	1955000	I have a simulation.
1955000	1956000	ZMO nanoparticle.
1956000	1958000	If it's round.
1958000	1959000	He's on different boards.
1959000	1960000	His scattering.
1960000	1962000	The effect is probably like this.
1962000	1963000	Of course.
1963000	1965000	With this ZMO nanoparticle.
1965000	1967000	It's hexagonal.
1967000	1968000	It's a little bit like that.
1968000	1970000	It's just that the real situation is different.
1972000	1973000	So this is my.
1973000	1976000	The distribution of the scattering curve of this HM.
1976000	1977000	So you can see.
1977000	1979000	I have this.
1979000	1980000	ZMO nanoparticle.
1980000	1982000	The lacing place is probably in this area.
1982000	1983000	Then I.
1983000	1985000	I'm on this HM board.
1985000	1987000	I'm set to be 300.
1987000	1989000	After 375 nanometers.
1989000	1990000	It's a.
1990000	1992000	It's a.
1992000	1994000	Hyperbody dispersion curve.
1994000	1996000	So this kind of thing.
1996000	1997000	He will be in.
1997000	1999000	So my multi-layered board.
1999000	2001000	He can be in my ZMO nanoparticle.
2001000	2002000	Lacing time.
2002000	2003000	There will be.
2003000	2005000	There will be a stronger lacing effect.
2007000	2008000	Then I.
2008000	2009000	In addition, I ran some more.
2009000	2011000	Like Persil Factor.
2011000	2012000	Persil Factor is.
2012000	2014000	The value of Persil Factor is.
2014000	2016000	I have this thing with me.
2016000	2017000	I have this dipole.
2017000	2019000	When ZMO shines.
2019000	2020000	In this environment.
2020000	2022000	With me in FreeSpace.
2022000	2023000	FreeSpace.
2023000	2025000	It's when you don't have this board.
2025000	2026000	To get along.
2026000	2027000	Made a pen.
2027000	2029000	Then you can see my HM.
2029000	2031000	Especially in the long wave field.
2031000	2032000	38.
2032000	2034000	The place of 390 will be longer.
2034000	2036000	That's with my EMM.
2036000	2038000	It's going to be a little bit weaker in this place.
2039000	2040000	In fact, this.
2040000	2043000	This multi-layered strengthening concept.
2043000	2044000	He is a.
2044000	2046000	An action of exponential decay.
2046000	2048000	The black line is HMM.
2048000	2050000	That red is EMM.
2051000	2052000	That.
2052000	2053000	If it's blue, it's Riffen.
2053000	2055000	It's a line lying on the ground.
2056000	2057000	Then you can see.
2057000	2058000	In fact, this kind of strengthening.
2058000	2060000	You can see that this is.
2060000	2061000	Uh.
2061000	2062000	Within 50 nanometers.
2062000	2063000	Within 50 nanometers.
2063000	2064000	It's probably.
2065000	2066000	Uh.
2066000	2067000	For HMM.
2067000	2068000	It's about four times.
2068000	2069000	That's EMM.
2069000	2070000	EMM.
2070000	2071000	It's about twice.
2071000	2072000	That.
2072000	2074000	But if I put this whole thing together.
2074000	2075000	It's an average.
2075000	2076000	For HMM.
2076000	2077000	HMM.
2077000	2078000	The proportion of enhanced.
2078000	2079000	Can be up to.
2079000	2080000	More than 30 times.
2080000	2081000	But because he.
2081000	2082000	Enter the field.
2082000	2083000	The main.
2083000	2084000	The main.
2084000	2085000	The most enhanced contribution is still in the field.
2085000	2086000	That.
2086000	2087000	The original factory is about 50 nanometers.
2087000	2088000	In terms of words.
2088000	2089000	It's about four times.
2090000	2091000	But the previous few nanometers.
2091000	2093000	It's very, very, very strong.
2093000	2094000	That I have calculated.
2094000	2095000	Denser loop state.
2095000	2096000	That his.
2096000	2097000	The density.
2097000	2098000	Will be.
2098000	2099000	In terms of HMM.
2099000	2100000	His density.
2100000	2101000	It's higher than EMM.
2101000	2102000	So he.
2102000	2103000	Can reach the optiogame.
2103000	2104000	Will be more.
2104000	2105000	That I have calculated.
2105000	2106000	His decay rate.
2106000	2107000	Decay rate.
2107000	2108000	In contrast to.
2108000	2109000	Lifetime.
2109000	2110000	So my lifetime is shorter.
2110000	2111000	My decay rate is higher.
2111000	2112000	This means he's in.
2112000	2113000	Excited state.
2113000	2114000	Jump down.
2114000	2115000	Time.
2115000	2116000	Faster.
2116000	2117000	That's what decay rate means.
2117000	2118000	That's what decay rate means.
2118000	2119000	That's what decay rate means.
2119000	2120000	That's what decay rate means.
2120000	2121000	That's what decay rate means.
2121000	2122000	That's what decay rate means.
2122000	2124000	So.
2124000	2125000	That I have run for a while.
2125000	2127000	For a while.
2127000	2129000	That's what I'm getting at.
2129000	2130000	It's.
2130000	2131000	It's relatively new.
2131000	2132000	That's what EMM does.
2132000	2133000	And that's what we're talking about.
2133000	2134000	It's bigger.
2134000	2137000	More about.
2137000	2138000	With.
2138000	2141000	VVV is the power factor.
2141000	2142000	There.
2142000	2143000	The power main quantity is coming.
2143000	2144000	Uh.
2144000	2145000	If it's bigger.
2145000	2147000	Good for him.
2147000	2148000	The space was getting smaller.
2148000	2149000	Well.
2149000	2150000	Power machine causes.
2150000	2151000	In other words.
2151000	2153000	The greater the power of the largest power plant.
2153000	2154000	The meaning is.
2154000	2155000	I.
2155000	2157000	My light can be very strong.
2157000	2159000	Localize in my.
2159000	2160000	HMM.
2160000	2161000	Near the zeo nanoparticle.
2161000	2162000	It's not like EMM.
2162000	2164000	Or reference board.
2164000	2166000	It's harder to get my light.
2166000	2167000	Uh.
2167000	2169000	In the local unit area.
2169000	2170000	It's going to be stronger.
2170000	2171000	So.
2171000	2172000	The less I touch you.
2172000	2173000	The smaller.
2173000	2175000	The stronger I get.
2175000	2177000	Because the smaller the touch.
2177000	2178000	The bigger my Perseverance is.
2178000	2180000	So this is also a.
2180000	2182000	It's also a concept that can be explained to each other.
2184000	2185000	Uh.
2185000	2186000	Then I.
2186000	2187000	This thing.
2187000	2188000	The following.
2188000	2189000	Is.
2189000	2190000	I can look at me.
2190000	2192000	I looked at my TV.
2192000	2193000	In my EMM.
2193000	2195000	On top of my HMM.
2195000	2197000	It's going to be a little longer.
2197000	2199000	And the strength of the resonance is going to be longer.
2199000	2201000	This is after I've normalized it.
2201000	2203000	So you can see a clear comparison.
2203000	2205000	That's what it is.
2205000	2207000	It's gone in a second.
2207000	2208000	EMM.
2208000	2209000	It's also going to be a resonance.
2209000	2211000	But it's gone in a second.
2211000	2213000	This time scale is.
2213000	2214000	The level of Phenosecond.
2214000	2216000	And then HMM.
2216000	2217000	Its resonance strength.
2217000	2219000	Of course, it's going to be better than the other.
2219000	2220000	Uh.
2220000	2221000	The other two are basically stronger.
2221000	2222000	This is.
2222000	2223000	This is.
2223000	2224000	One of mine.
2224000	2226000	The first work in the PhD class.
2226000	2229000	It's the concept of Random Laser Combined HMM.
2229000	2232000	That was accepted by ACS Photon at the end of last year.
2232000	2234000	That's what we saw this year.
2234000	2235000	So if you're interested.
2235000	2236000	You can take a look at this one.
2236000	2238000	And the above.
2238000	2240000	The above data are all in.
2240000	2242000	On this work.
2242000	2245000	So this is my.
2245000	2247000	The first work of the PhD class.
2247000	2249000	So I'm the first one.
2249000	2251000	It's the first one.
2251000	2252000	It's the first one.
2252000	2254000	Combine HMM and Random Laser.
2254000	2255000	Concept.
2255000	2256000	And then to achieve a.
2256000	2257000	Lacing enhanced.
2257000	2259000	Random Lacing enhanced behavior.
2261000	2264000	So let me just sum up my work.
2264000	2266000	So my work is a little bit.
2266000	2268000	It's a little bit new.
2268000	2269000	Because he's.
2269000	2271000	We're using the first one to use HMM.
2271000	2272000	Random Laser Concept.
2272000	2274000	Then we'll think it's interesting.
2274000	2276000	It's because we can enhance.
2276000	2278000	Random Laser Peak.
2278000	2280000	And then our measurement came out.
2280000	2281000	Lifetime is short again.
2281000	2283000	Then we'll think this is a very.
2283000	2285000	A very useful concept.
2285000	2287000	Because we can.
2287000	2289000	Reduce the Lacing demand.
2289000	2290000	And then this.
2290000	2291000	Concept.
2291000	2293000	This Random Laser is a board.
2293000	2294000	Angular emission.
2294000	2295000	Just like me.
2295000	2298000	This is what I showed you a long time ago.
2298000	2300000	The work.
2300000	2302000	Well, basically, this is my PhD.
2302000	2303000	The first one.
2303000	2304000	I.
2304000	2308000	Combine HMM and Random Laser.
2308000	2310000	So I'm going to give you a little bit of an introduction.
2310000	2312000	We have other in our lab.
2312000	2313000	Random Laser.
2313000	2314000	In this year.
2314000	2317000	The article published.
2317000	2319000	So this is a few months ago.
2319000	2320000	In.
2320000	2321000	It should be last month.
2321000	2322000	Or the last month.
2322000	2323000	Advanced Optical Material.
2323000	2324000	Accept.
2324000	2325000	It looks like.
2325000	2326000	Work.
2326000	2327000	He's a.
2327000	2328000	One of our labs.
2328000	2329000	After a PhD.
2329000	2331000	That's what he's doing now.
2331000	2332000	Change to two teachers.
2332000	2334000	Two labs to continue.
2334000	2336000	Continue to finish this work.
2336000	2337000	That's it.
2337000	2338000	Finished.
2338000	2339000	Published.
2339000	2340000	That's his concept.
2340000	2341000	It's also very simple.
2341000	2342000	That is.
2342000	2343000	They are using PurpleSky.
2343000	2345000	And then use the combined.
2345000	2346000	Graphene Nanowall.
2346000	2349000	Graphene Nanowall.
2349000	2350000	And then sprinkle some.
2350000	2351000	Like silver granite.
2351000	2352000	As a scattering.
2352000	2353000	So why do this?
2353000	2354000	The graphene that stands up.
2354000	2356000	It's because of my light.
2356000	2358000	It's even more scattering inside.
2358000	2360000	It's a three-dimensional structure.
2360000	2362000	And then you can get to.
2362000	2364000	And then you can get to.
2364000	2365000	A very low level of laser.
2365000	2366000	A very low level of laser.
2366000	2367000	A very low level of laser.
2367000	2368000	So you can see.
2368000	2369000	This is in.
2369000	2370000	Nanogel.
2370000	2371000	You can even get to the laser.
2371000	2373000	Because I'm using the graphene that stands up.
2373000	2374000	The concept of three-dimensional.
2374000	2375000	Random Laser.
2375000	2376000	Random Laser.
2376000	2377000	So you can see.
2377000	2378000	This is a lot of peaks.
2378000	2379000	This is a.
2379000	2380000	This is some random CIs this year.
2380000	2381000	Random Laser Peaks.
2381000	2385000	Random Laser Peaks.
2385000	2387000	What about last month?
2387000	2388000	This is a covered paper.
2388000	2390000	What about last month?
2390000	2391000	This is a covered paper.
2391000	2392000	Then this is another one we have in the laboratory.
2392000	2393000	This is another one we have in the laboratory.
2393000	2394000	An article recently published.
2394000	2395000	An article recently published.
2395000	2397000	This article was taken last year.
2397000	2398000	This article was taken last year.
2398000	2401800	Last year the end was accepted to publish
2401800	2403000	In scientiFLEport.
2403000	2405000	This article is also a very simple concept.
2405000	2406000	We put three RGBs.
2406000	2407000	Different materials.
2407000	2408000	And then the laser meets in the middle.
2408000	2412000	So it will hit a white laser.
2412000	2415000	Then I put down the YouTube video.
2415000	2416000	Then I put down the YouTube video.
2416000	2419000	What is the situation when measuring?
2419000	2421000	So when the RED light hits
2421000	2423000	The middle piece will hit a white light.
2423000	2424000	The middle piece will hit a white light.
2424000	2426000	Random Laser Peak.
2426000	2432000	Put another one.
2432000	2434000	So it's like this.
2434000	2435000	The middle is white light.
2435000	2437000	If the focus is here.
2437000	2440000	It's green and blue mixed out.
2440000	2442000	If the focus is here.
2442000	2445000	It's red and green mixed out.
2445000	2448000	What is the selling point of this concept?
2448000	2450000	If I want to make a lot of pixel.
2450000	2452000	If I want to make a lot of pixel.
2452000	2454000	Overall, it's a white light.
2454000	2455000	Overall, it's a white light.
2455000	2456000	Random laser.
2456000	2459000	Then we just mix the demo RGB first.
2459000	2461000	Mixed into this shape.
2461000	2462000	Then hit the middle.
2462000	2464000	It is also a white light signal.
2464000	2468000	This is the laser peak on both sides.
2468000	2471000	If I turn on the power,
2471000	2474000	Of course, my RGB peaks will be displayed.
2474000	2478000	If we mix out the CIE image.
2478000	2482000	You can see that it is very, very close to the white light.
2482000	2483000	You can see that it is very, very close to the white light.
2483000	2485000	This one is also a good one.
2485000	2488000	This one is also a good one.
2488000	2492000	In fact, I have another topic for today's report.
2492000	2494000	This is my HMM.
2494000	2495000	This is my HMM.
2495000	2497000	To combine the concept of up-switching.
2497000	2499000	In fact, because I will introduce first.
2499000	2501000	What is the concept of up-switching?
2501000	2504000	The concept of up-switching energy is.
2504000	2506000	My YB nanoparticle.
2506000	2508000	My YB nanoparticle.
2508000	2510000	It may have a lot of different chemical elements.
2510000	2513000	It may have a lot of different chemical elements.
2513000	2515000	Like my YB.
2515000	2516000	To absorb the long-wave field.
2516000	2517000	Like 980.
2517000	2520000	We usually use 980 or 8080.
2520000	2521000	We usually use 980.
2521000	2523000	So after YB absorbs 980.
2523000	2527000	It will give the energy to other materials.
2527000	2530000	The other materials are absorbed several times.
2530000	2533000	After YB gives the long-wave field energy.
2533000	2537000	It will jump out in a relatively short-wave form.
2537000	2542000	Because the short-wave field is more powerful.
2542000	2545000	The long-wave field is less energy.
2545000	2549000	So this energy transfer process is called up-switching.
2549000	2551000	Because in general.
2551000	2555000	The PL or type on both sides are down-switching.
2555000	2559000	Down-switching is that I give a short-wave field.
2559000	2561000	The short-wave field means that the energy is more powerful.
2561000	2563000	The short-wave field is like 266 laser.
2563000	2564000	Hit my ZMO.
2564000	2566000	It releases 388.
2566000	2567000	About 388.
2567000	2569000	The up-switching is.
2569000	2571000	Hit 980 and put the visible light.
2571000	2573000	4500, 300 can be.
2573000	2577000	It depends on the ratio of my friction.
2578000	2580000	Basically, the up-switching nanoparticle is.
2580000	2581000	Different friction ratios.
2581000	2583000	I just hit 980.
2583000	2585000	Of course, this is the paper of others.
2585000	2586000	Just hit 980.
2586000	2589000	I can see different colors.
2589000	2591000	The signal of different colors comes out.
2591000	2593000	So this up-switching nanoparticle.
2593000	2595000	Everyone is.
2595000	2598000	It will look like this.
2598000	2600000	These are all TM photos.
2600000	2602000	Between different layers.
2602000	2604000	Because I need different.
2604000	2609000	A distinction between different elements.
2609000	2612000	So if you synthesize different dyes.
2612000	2615000	I need to connect with different ligands.
2615000	2617000	So that my different elements.
2617000	2620000	It will be very close together.
2620000	2622000	Basically, this is a concept of up-switching.
2622000	2624000	This is the light of 980.
2624000	2625000	Put visible light.
2627000	2629000	In fact, my work.
2629000	2631000	The work I focused on today is also this one.
2631000	2632000	But because of this work.
2632000	2634000	This work is still under review.
2634000	2635000	In ACS content.
2635000	2638000	I am a co-author with an Indian doctor.
2638000	2640000	In fact, I thought this work.
2640000	2642000	Can be accepted in my report today.
2642000	2645000	But now it's the second time.
2645000	2646000	So wait a minute.
2646000	2649000	Because our first reviewer.
2649000	2651000	There are four reviewers on the first floor.
2651000	2653000	Later on the first floor.
2653000	2655000	When we revised.
2655000	2657000	The editor sent it to reviewer 4.
2657000	2658000	Reviewer 4.
2658000	2661000	He said we answered all the questions.
2661000	2663000	But he suggested that we turn to Advanced Material.
2663000	2666000	So the editor is looking for the fifth reviewer.
2666000	2669000	We are now replying to the fifth reviewer's questions.
2669000	2671000	So wait for it to be accepted later.
2671000	2673000	I'll show it to you again.
2673000	2676000	Basically, this work is still under review in ACS content.
2676000	2679000	In fact, the concept of this work is very simple.
2679000	2682000	So I didn't show my Lacing Peak today.
2682000	2684000	Then I'll talk a little bit about it.
2684000	2686000	How did I do this work?
2686000	2688000	Also, I need a multi-layer model.
2688000	2689000	Then put on top of it.
2689000	2691000	Upgraded Nanoparticle.
2691000	2693000	Then the upgraded Nanoparticle.
2693000	2698000	He himself has to have RGB light.
2698000	2700000	Then we actually want this work.
2700000	2703000	I want to get a white laser thing out.
2703000	2705000	Then we actually have three designs.
2705000	2706000	HM board.
2706000	2709000	Put it in the same way.
2709000	2711000	Upgraded material.
2711000	2713000	That simple upgrade.
2713000	2717000	He would have his own RGB light.
2717000	2720000	But he would be more blue light here.
2720000	2724000	For example, blue light and red light here.
2724000	2726000	If I want to hit the white light.
2726000	2727000	I need to go up.
2727000	2731000	I need a little bit more green.
2731000	2734000	Then I designed different boards.
2734000	2736000	The closest to the HM1 board.
2736000	2738000	HM1 is already very, very close.
2738000	2741000	This 0.333 0.333 place.
2741000	2745000	Because 0.333 0.333 is a pure white place.
2745000	2747000	Because it hasn't been accepted yet today.
2747000	2750000	So I didn't show the data.
2750000	2753000	The upgrade mechanism is the same as mine.
2753000	2755000	As I said in the last video.
2755000	2756000	I need a YB.
2756000	2758000	Need different.
2758000	2761000	Can put out RGB.
2761000	2763000	These three kinds of dye.
2763000	2766000	This kind of material.
2766000	2768000	Then my upgrade is to ask.
2768000	2771000	Taiwan Chemicals.
2771000	2774000	YT-TEN laboratory cooperation.
2774000	2777000	That is also looking for a doctor in India.
2777000	2780000	Chen Yichong laboratory.
2780000	2784000	Then there are ER, TM, and EU.
2784000	2786000	All three will put RGB.
2786000	2792000	It's hard to get a white light through synthesis.
2792000	2794000	It's hard because this kind of jumping process.
2794000	2795000	It's all a nonlinear.
2795000	2798000	Assuming that my green light is already weaker.
2798000	2800000	I want to enhance my green light behavior.
2800000	2803000	Once I can enhance my green light.
2803000	2806000	I may eat other light.
2806000	2809000	A thing that eats other light.
2809000	2812000	That synthesis is also not an easy thing.
2812000	2815000	But as long as we use this kind of HM1.
2815000	2816000	This kind of basic enhancement.
2816000	2818000	It can be very, very close to white light.
2818000	2821000	That kind of HM1.
2821000	2823000	You can see that this is my Perseverance simulation.
2823000	2826000	HM1, then there will be more places to enhance the green light.
2826000	2829000	Compared with other HM2 or HM3 places.
2829000	2833000	So I combine this top conversion.
2833000	2834000	And HM.
2834000	2837000	I can make my green light stronger.
2837000	2839000	Then it's very, very close to white light.
2839000	2841000	This is my other work.
2841000	2843000	With an Indian.
2843000	2844000	Now in ACS Neo.
2844000	2847000	I'll have a chance to show it to you later.
2850000	2853000	But I want to say.
2853000	2855000	Since it's not convenient to show too much information to everyone.
2855000	2857000	I'll show you another one.
2857000	2860000	This is a topic that the doctoral class has already published.
2860000	2863000	In fact, this is also last summer.
2863000	2864000	At this time.
2864000	2866000	With a student in the math class.
2866000	2868000	The topic that came to mind in Xiaofu.
2868000	2870000	Because the math class is mainly to do.
2870000	2871000	Tension.
2871000	2873000	This kind of flexible thing.
2873000	2875000	The photo detector.
2875000	2877000	Tension.
2877000	2879000	There is also a flexible photo detector.
2879000	2881000	On the base of Kerala.
2881000	2883000	Then I was wondering if I could use this concept.
2883000	2885000	To do my one.
2885000	2887000	This is the concept of the novel HM.
2887000	2889000	This HM.
2889000	2890000	I did it last summer.
2890000	2891000	I did it for two or three months.
2891000	2893000	Then I wrote it.
2893000	2895000	Then I went to the scientific report.
2895000	2896000	Do you still remember?
2896000	2897000	This is my HM.
2897000	2900000	I need a metal and a lithium-ion base.
2900000	2902000	A multi-layer.
2902000	2903000	This is very simple for me.
2903000	2905000	I use gold and PVA.
2905000	2906000	As a base.
2906000	2908000	HM's base.
2908000	2909000	My PVA.
2909000	2911000	It's also a polymer.
2911000	2912000	Its detection rate is 1.5.
2912000	2913000	Like.
2913000	2915000	Just like the general material.
2915000	2917000	That's just the advantage of PVA.
2917000	2918000	It is durable.
2918000	2919000	The first one.
2919000	2920000	It can be melted.
2920000	2921000	For example, if it is put in water.
2921000	2923000	It will melt.
2923000	2924000	So we want to say.
2924000	2925000	Can you do a tension.
2925000	2927000	There is also a flexible HM.
2927000	2929000	That's it.
2929000	2931000	This is what I have done.
2931000	2932000	Materials.
2932000	2933000	I do four pairs.
2933000	2934000	Because in fact, every pair.
2934000	2936000	I need to grind once.
2936000	2938000	Then break the cavity.
2938000	2939000	Spin coating again.
2939000	2940000	So in fact.
2940000	2942000	After a lot of pairs.
2942000	2944000	This material is not easy to do.
2944000	2946000	This is the material I just finished.
2946000	2947000	Put it in the water.
2947000	2949000	Then after 1.5 hours.
2949000	2950000	It's gone.
2950000	2951000	So I.
2951000	2953000	Tension HM.
2953000	2955000	This thing is flexible again.
2955000	2958000	Published this year's scientific report.
2958000	2959000	This topic is actually.
2959000	2960000	Last year, with a math class.
2960000	2964000	Studied together.
2964000	2965000	Why do tension?
2965000	2967000	Because tension.
2967000	2968000	In the early days.
2968000	2969000	A few years ago.
2969000	2970000	At that time.
2970000	2971000	It was also very fierce.
2971000	2972000	Especially in 2012.
2972000	2973000	This piece of science.
2973000	2975000	Is tension electronics.
2975000	2976000	Is this kind of.
2976000	2977000	Electronics.
2977000	2979000	Its material is made of like coal.
2979000	2981000	The coal melts in the water.
2981000	2983000	The coal is melted in the water.
2983000	2984000	So you can see this.
2984000	2985000	Tension electronics.
2985000	2987000	Is my one-time.
2987000	2988000	Or short-term use.
2988000	2989000	After using it, throw it away.
2989000	2990000	That.
2990000	2991000	I see.
2991000	2993000	I see their old paper.
2993000	2994000	The introduction says.
2994000	2995000	This can be used in the future.
2995000	2996000	Some military use.
2996000	2998000	For example, after I use it.
2998000	2999000	I don't want to take it away.
2999000	3000000	Or what?
3000000	3001000	Just throw it on the ground.
3001000	3002000	Solved.
3002000	3003000	That kind of thing.
3003000	3005000	Because it can be melted by water.
3005000	3006000	That.
3006000	3007000	I see some people are using.
3007000	3008000	In vivo.
3008000	3009000	In vivo.
3009000	3010000	In vivo.
3010000	3011000	The experiment.
3011000	3012000	He.
3012000	3013000	He can point it at me.
3013000	3014000	One.
3014000	3015000	A human body or machine.
3015000	3016000	Uh.
3016000	3017000	Inside the organ.
3017000	3018000	Then measure.
3018000	3019000	After the test.
3019000	3020000	I don't have to open it again.
3020000	3021000	Until I take this material out.
3021000	3022000	He.
3022000	3023000	In this material.
3023000	3024000	In this environment.
3024000	3025000	In the biological body.
3025000	3027000	It will disappear on its own.
3027000	3029000	So this is the concept of tension electronics.
3029000	3030000	Concept of tension optics.
3031000	3032000	That.
3032000	3033000	The concept of horizontal optics.
3033000	3036000	We first issued one in hs-nano last year.
3036000	3038000	He is very simple here.
3038000	3040000	That's.
3040000	3041000	Disori balalasporsp.
3041000	3042000	Publicity.
3042000	3044000	Also, we use.
3044000	3045000	We do this with the topic.
3045000	3047000	We use PVA.
3047000	3049000	PVA is.
3049000	3050000	Shh.
3050000	3051000	Soil melt.
3051000	3052000	Ah.
3052000	3053000	Is the magnification is 1.
3053000	3056000	Then we mix it with PBA.
3056000	3057000	Anyway, there are other problems.
3057000	3058000	Zn or nanoparticle.
3058000	3059000	There are other.
3059000	3060000	Uh.
3060000	3061000	Tl2 nanoparticle.
3061000	3063000	Then measure the light.
3063000	3064000	Then this.
3064000	3066000	This device to measure the light.
3066000	3067000	The.
3067000	3068000	The data.
3068000	3070000	After that, this thing.
3070000	3071000	You can melt it.
3071000	3074000	That's basically the concept of this spring.
3074000	3075000	Spring concept.
3075000	3076000	That we.
3076000	3078000	Last year, we put it together first.
3078000	3079000	Uh.
3079000	3080000	This kind of random laser.
3081000	3082000	Then I told the teacher class.
3082000	3083000	The junior thought.
3083000	3084000	Can you.
3084000	3085000	Do a spring.
3085000	3086000	Spring spring HMM out.
3086000	3090000	This is my ASEAN photo.
3090000	3092000	Corsasia ASEAN photo.
3092000	3094000	I designed a different HMM sample.
3094000	3096000	The first one is HMM1.
3096000	3098000	HMM1 is gold and PVA.
3098000	3100000	Is 25 and 42 nanometers.
3100000	3102000	That gold.
3102000	3104000	That's because PVA.
3104000	3105000	This is more difficult.
3105000	3108000	Is that he needs to test his parameters.
3108000	3110000	So we're testing out about four different speeds.
3110000	3112000	Can reach 42 or 49 nanometers.
3113000	3115000	Then I can design different HMM.
3115000	3117000	The color curve.
3117000	3119000	The sample comes out.
3119000	3122000	Then we do four pairs.
3122000	3124000	Then you can see this HMM1.
3124000	3125000	It's a different wavelength.
3125000	3128000	It's also this kind of hyperbolic dispersion.
3128000	3130000	That HMM2.
3130000	3132000	It's HMM in different wavelengths.
3132000	3134000	Then he is also EMM.
3134000	3135000	This is EMM.
3135000	3137000	So his PL is in this 530.
3137000	3140000	He will be weaker.
3141000	3145000	Then we have this kind of HMM.
3145000	3148000	Sample to measure different fuels.
3148000	3150000	Then you can find HMM1.
3150000	3151000	In different fuels.
3151000	3153000	Because HMM1 is in this place.
3153000	3155000	He belongs to me.
3155000	3157000	He's stronger.
3157000	3160000	Will HMM be a little weaker?
3160000	3163000	Then you can see this HMM.
3163000	3167000	It's basically weaker than reference.
3167000	3169000	So my HMM concept.
3169000	3171000	I use it here.
3171000	3172000	Lifetime.
3172000	3173000	For Lifetime.
3173000	3175000	It's also a relatively short trend.
3178000	3180000	Of course, I also calculated the Skeleton cross-section.
3184000	3186000	Then I also calculated.
3186000	3187000	I have different wavelengths.
3187000	3189000	Perceived effect enhancement behavior.
3190000	3193000	Of course, the closer to the base.
3193000	3195000	My enhancement ratio will be larger.
3195000	3197000	The farther he will be weaker.
3200000	3201000	That.
3202000	3204000	This is a little demo.
3204000	3207000	I'm in this trend HMM.
3207000	3209000	In different like silicon base.
3209000	3212000	Then the other is like glass glass base.
3212000	3213000	He put it in the water.
3213000	3215000	He will melt the same.
3215000	3216000	In fact, you can see.
3216000	3219000	After putting it in the water for five minutes.
3219000	3222000	He will be a little bit broken.
3222000	3223000	After 1.5 hours.
3223000	3227000	His material will be melted in the water.
3227000	3228000	Just like this.
3228000	3229000	Next to the water.
3229000	3232000	It's the kind of metal that's broken.
3232000	3233000	That kind of metal.
3233000	3235000	The components come out like this.
3235000	3237000	Of course, we have.
3237000	3239000	Demo some of his work.
3239000	3241000	Or on the PET base.
3241000	3244000	Then he can even stick it on his hand.
3244000	3245000	As a bending.
3246000	3248000	Then we even want to say in the future.
3248000	3250000	This concept can be combined.
3250000	3251000	That smart phone.
3251000	3253000	For the future to do this.
3253000	3255000	Lens may be helpful.
3255000	3258000	That's just a demo of this concept.
3260000	3262000	Then we also did some bending test.
3262000	3265000	That's on a different bending base.
3266000	3268000	He can also measure a.
3268000	3269000	Strengthening behavior.
3269000	3270000	Uh, it's not like that.
3270000	3271000	He still has a certain.
3271000	3273000	PL signal out.
3273000	3274000	That's Fred.
3274000	3275000	Of course, it will be stronger.
3275000	3278000	That's in different bending radius.
3278000	3281000	This is the signal we measured.
3281000	3282000	That.
3282000	3283000	That.
3283000	3285000	This kind of polymer-made.
3285000	3287000	What are the benefits of HM?
3287000	3289000	It's that he can bend.
3289000	3291000	That's not like the usual SL2.
3291000	3292000	Or what?
3292000	3293000	Uh, pick a rabbit.
3293000	3295000	If it's an electrolyte.
3295000	3297000	He could bend a few times.
3297000	3298000	It's broken.
3298000	3300000	It's not a good mold.
3301000	3302000	That.
3302000	3304000	This is our bending cycle.
3304000	3306000	This is a motor that looks like a four-wheel drive.
3306000	3307000	Give him one.
3307000	3308000	Go on.
3308000	3309000	Give him a bending.
3309000	3310000	That.
3310000	3312000	After a few thousand times of bending.
3312000	3313000	He.
3313000	3315000	His PL signal still exists.
3316000	3319000	So we feel like this kind of polymer-based.
3319000	3320000	Uh, HM.
3320000	3321000	He's a future.
3321000	3323000	Maybe in Flexible Electronics.
3323000	3325000	Or Flexible Optics.
3325000	3326000	It's also one of the moves.
3326000	3328000	That's what we did before.
3328000	3330000	He can do this thing.
3330000	3331000	That.
3332000	3333000	That.
3333000	3334000	I.
3334000	3335000	This is.
3335000	3337000	I proved that he could.
3338000	3339000	That is.
3339000	3341000	Uh, put it in the water for five minutes.
3341000	3342000	And then take out the sample.
3342000	3343000	Blow dry.
3343000	3344000	After taking it out and drying it.
3344000	3345000	And then the first dye.
3345000	3346000	Five minutes later.
3346000	3348000	He's actually going to be DK.
3348000	3349000	Because the general R6G.
3349000	3351000	His enhancement is about 100.
3351000	3352000	More than 100.
3352000	3353000	More than 100.
3353000	3354000	So strong.
3354000	3355000	That.
3355000	3356000	Soak for 30 minutes.
3356000	3357000	Take it out in 30 minutes.
3357000	3358000	Two more PO.
3358000	3360000	He's a little bit weaker.
3360000	3361000	He's a lot weaker.
3361000	3363000	Okay, so I'm going to conclude a little bit.
3363000	3365000	Uh, I'm just going to conclude a little bit.
3365000	3366000	This is.
3366000	3367000	This is.
3367000	3369000	It's the first one to make spring.
3369000	3370000	And then again.
3370000	3371000	Flexible HM.
3371000	3372000	Then he is.
3372000	3373000	Polymer.
3373000	3374000	The main material.
3374000	3375000	That.
3375000	3376000	We'll find it interesting.
3376000	3377000	Because he.
3377000	3378000	It still retains the HM.
3378000	3379000	The general kind of metal.
3379000	3380000	The characteristics of the metal film.
3380000	3381000	That.
3381000	3382000	This kind of thing.
3382000	3383000	It's kind of interesting.
3383000	3384000	Because he might have used it.
3384000	3385000	After a while.
3385000	3386000	It's still there.
3386000	3387000	It's still there.
3387000	3388000	It's still there.
3388000	3389000	It's still there.
3389000	3390000	It's still there.
3390000	3392000	Maybe it will melt after a while.
3392000	3393000	That's the future.
3393000	3394000	First of all.
3394000	3395000	Yeah.
3396000	3397000	Environmental friendly.
3397000	3398000	One concept.
3398000	3399000	Then he can also retain.
3399000	3400000	If there is any.
3400000	3401000	Data in there.
3401000	3402000	He can.
3402000	3403000	Uh, go away.
3403000	3404000	ERS4201
3404000	3405000	That's the CONCLSIR stream.
3405000	3406000	It's a flexible.
3406000	3407000	The conception of optoelectron.
3407000	3408000	That's the relationship.
3408000	3409000	So we.
3409000	3411000	Would you think this is a good job for the future.
3411000	3412000	I see a lot of things.
3412000	3413000	A group like Stanford.
3413000	3416000	Someone calling ESKEET electronic feat.
3416000	3417000	Then we're going to do this maybe.
3417000	3419000	In the future, we can do electron.
3419000	3421000	Optical electronic skin.
3421000	3422000	An application.
3422000	3423000	Then this work.
3423000	3424000	Just a little demo.
3424000	3425000	This concept.
3425000	3426000	So this work.
3426000	3427000	It actually took about 30.
3427000	3428000	Later.
3428000	3429000	Uh.
3429000	3431000	It took about two or three months.
3431000	3432000	It's over.
3432000	3433000	Because in fact, this time.
3433000	3434000	It's all very simple.
3434000	3436000	Then we're going to measure.
3436000	3437000	P2 enhance.
3437000	3438000	Then melt.
3438000	3439000	Bending.
3439000	3440000	So this work.
3440000	3441000	It's almost like this.
3444000	3445000	Hey.
3445000	3446000	That's basically my work.
3446000	3448000	It's probably like this.
3448000	3450000	Let's see what's wrong with everyone.
3450000	3451000	That's our lab.
3451000	3452000	This was taken last year.
3452000	3455000	Then we are actually a very large team.
3455000	3456000	The teacher is here.
3456000	3457000	Then there are other Indians.
3457000	3460000	Then we will cooperate with other labs.
3462000	3463000	Mainly like this.
3463000	3464000	Because.
3464000	3465000	I'm sorry.
3465000	3467000	Because this time I didn't introduce too much.
3467000	3468000	My.
3468000	3469000	This work.
3469000	3472000	Because this work is still under review.
3472000	3474000	So I'll just show you a little bit.
3474000	3476000	How did we achieve this concept?
3479000	3481000	And then the next one.
3485000	3486000	My question is.
3486000	3487000	That's it.
3487000	3488000	He is.
3488000	3490000	You put it in a flexible.
3490000	3491000	It's kind of like a substrate.
3491000	3493000	Anyway, it's a flexible film.
3493000	3494000	PET or something, right?
3494000	3495000	That's right.
3495000	3497000	You have a concept.
3499000	3500000	Your response.
3500000	3503000	How sensitive is the deformation of this film?
3505000	3506000	You mean the deformation?
3506000	3507000	Correct.
3508000	3509000	In fact.
3510000	3511000	Uh.
3511000	3512000	Wait a minute.
3512000	3513000	Let me see.
3515000	3516000	In fact, if it is.
3516000	3518000	Let me see you like this.
3520000	3521000	Let's say it's like this.
3523000	3525000	Suppose he's in a bend.
3525000	3526000	He might have some angles.
3526000	3527000	It's not H.
3527000	3528000	M.
3528000	3529000	Some angles.
3531000	3532000	Because my concept of H.
3532000	3533000	M.
3533000	3534000	To be in.
3534000	3535000	Uh.
3535000	3536000	Specific direction.
3536000	3537000	Specific frequency.
3537000	3538000	If he bends.
3538000	3539000	He might not be H.
3539000	3540000	M.
3540000	3542000	As for how to bend.
3543000	3544000	Uh.
3544000	3546000	I'm not going to prove this thing.
3546000	3547000	Correct.
3548000	3550000	Because like this bending.
3550000	3551000	If you measure the side.
3551000	3552000	We are bending.
3552000	3553000	When the surface.
3553000	3555000	Measure the signal above.
3555000	3556000	How is it?
3556000	3558000	See if this thing will be.
3558000	3560000	Because of the process of bending.
3560000	3561000	And affect.
3561000	3562000	My light.
3562000	3563000	Come out.
3563000	3564000	It looks okay.
3564000	3566000	But if I bend.
3566000	3567000	Like this.
3567000	3569000	Because what I think of is.
3569000	3570000	That is.
3570000	3571000	You are equal to.
3571000	3572000	It's kind of like.
3572000	3573000	Just to prove that he said.
3573000	3574000	You bend.
3574000	3575000	Do 500 times.
3575000	3576000	1000 times.
3576000	3577000	3000 times.
3577000	3578000	And then put it back.
3578000	3579000	He will have the effect.
3579000	3580000	So he can.
3580000	3581000	He can bear it.
3581000	3582000	Such.
3582000	3583000	Is bending.
3583000	3584000	But.
3584000	3585000	What I think of is.
3585000	3586000	For example.
3586000	3587000	If you take this thing.
3587000	3588000	Can replace.
3588000	3589000	For example.
3589000	3590000	Like a pressure material.
3590000	3591000	Or.
3591000	3592000	Like that.
3592000	3593000	That kind of thing.
3593000	3594000	You can become.
3594000	3595000	Super sensitive.
3595000	3596000	The pressure.
3596000	3597000	Pressure sensor.
3597000	3598000	Or.
3598000	3599000	The change of the sensor.
3599000	3600000	Uh.
3600000	3601000	I think maybe.
3601000	3602000	Just.
3602000	3603000	It depends on you.
3603000	3604000	Because you are doing light.
3604000	3605000	So.
3605000	3606000	Your sensitivity.
3606000	3607000	To change.
3607000	3608000	Just like you just said.
3608000	3609000	Maybe a little bit of deformation.
3609000	3610000	He.
3610000	3611000	Uh.
3611000	3612000	He didn't have that effect in an instant.
3612000	3613000	Then you know he's deformed.
3613000	3614000	You know what I mean.
3614000	3615000	Then if you choose.
3615000	3616000	More correct.
3616000	3617000	For example.
3617000	3618000	Your substrate.
3618000	3619000	The material.
3619000	3620000	Let him.
3620000	3621000	Hardness.
3621000	3622000	Just.
3622000	3623000	That.
3623000	3624000	It's equal to.
3624000	3625000	Hardness is high enough.
3625000	3626000	Then he won't deform so much.
3626000	3627000	You may be able to slightly increase your.
3627000	3628000	Dynamic.
3628000	3629000	Is that you can measure things.
3629000	3630000	Dynamic window.
3630000	3631000	Then you.
3631000	3632000	You can become a super sensitive.
3632000	3633000	The shape of the sensor.
3633000	3634000	I think.
3634000	3635000	I guess.
3635000	3636000	I don't know.
3636000	3637000	It must be calculated.
3637000	3638000	Correct.
3638000	3639000	Oh.
3639000	3640000	OK.
3640000	3641000	Because this is also a direction.
3641000	3642000	Correct.
3642000	3643000	Just combine this.
3643000	3644000	My this.
3644000	3645000	Flexible concept.
3645000	3646000	To combine.
3646000	3647000	This kind of.
3647000	3648000	Uh.
3648000	3649000	Uh.
3649000	3650000	Uh.
3650000	3651000	Uh.
3651000	3652000	Uh.
3652000	3653000	The software.
3653000	3654000	The whole thing.
3654000	3655000	So I'm going to combine the concept.
3655000	3656000	Uh.
3656000	3657000	It's piezo.
3657000	3658000	This.
3658000	3659000	incidence of kind of concept.
3659000	3660000	Yeah.
3660000	3662000	Okay, so.
3662000	3663000	Basically, this.
3663000	3664000	I will introduce you to my previous ones.
3664000	3665000	And this one.
3665000	3666000	PH.
3666000	3667000	verbs.
3667000	3668000	Back to a Louis bonneture.
3668000	3669000	9889,
3669000	3670000	says,
3670000	3671000	Yeah.
3671000	3672000	Then.
3672000	3673000	What are the other questions?
3673000	3674000	Questions.
3674000	3675000	I am.
3675000	3676000	Comment.
3676000	3677000	That word.
3677000	3678000	That worrit.
3678000	3679000	Then, later.
3679000	3680000	I'll tell you about it again if I have a chance.
3680000	3681000	Because we.
3681000	3682000	We actually have more.
3682000	3683000	Do other.
3683000	3684000	White laser.
3684000	3685000	Come out.
3685000	3686000	Then this is still on both sides.
3686000	3687000	Then we have a work.
3687000	3688000	Will be this.
3688000	3689000	The surface is still.
3689000	3690000	We think it's still cool.
3690000	3691000	The structure.
3691000	3692000	Then this is still on both sides.
3692000	3693000	Yeah.
3693000	3694000	Tomorrow will be on both sides.
3694000	3695000	Yeah.
3695000	3696000	And it is expected to be white light.
3696000	3697000	Then.
3697000	3698000	What else do you have?
3698000	3699000	Questions.
3699000	3700000	I have a question.
3700000	3701000	Or.
3701000	3702000	Yo, yo, yo.
3702000	3703000	Uh.
3703000	3704000	Just.
3704000	3705000	I want to ask.
3706000	3707000	Is.
3707000	3708000	Generally put a.
3708000	3709000	Is.
3709000	3710000	Something that glows.
3710000	3711000	Put it on.
3711000	3712000	Metal surface.
3712000	3713000	It was.
3713000	3714000	Will be coupled to.
3714000	3715000	Surface plasma.
3715000	3716000	Oh, right.
3716000	3717000	Then.
3717000	3718000	Its.
3718000	3719000	Decay rate.
3719000	3720000	Will be faster.
3720000	3721000	That's right.
3721000	3722000	Is.
3722000	3723000	How do you make sure.
3723000	3724000	Is.
3724000	3725000	Uh.
3725000	3726000	Because.
3726000	3727000	Because your material.
3727000	3728000	The top is also a layer of gold.
3728000	3729000	Metal.
3729000	3730000	How do you make sure.
3730000	3731000	That is.
3731000	3732000	That is.
3732000	3733000	That is.
3733000	3734000	That is.
3734000	3735000	How do you make sure.
3735000	3736000	That is.
3736000	3737000	Not because of this reason.
3737000	3738000	But because it has.
3738000	3739000	HMM.
3739000	3740000	What caused it.
3740000	3741000	In fact.
3741000	3742000	Like doing this experiment.
3742000	3743000	We will.
3743000	3744000	With.
3744000	3745000	Simple.
3745000	3746000	The same thickness.
3746000	3747000	Mirror.
3747000	3748000	Like gold.
3748000	3749000	To compare.
3749000	3750000	That.
3750000	3751000	You can.
3751000	3752000	If it is gold.
3752000	3753000	It is.
3753000	3754000	Where it is strong.
3754000	3755000	It won't be like HMM.
3755000	3756000	It is a.
3756000	3757000	Boehming.
3757000	3758000	That.
3758000	3759000	I have seen.
3759000	3760000	If I.
3760000	3761000	If I use the same thickness of metal.
3761000	3762000	Count.
3762000	3763000	In this case.
3763000	3764000	Then strengthen.
3764000	3765000	If it is possible.
3765000	3766000	It's like this.
3766000	3767000	It's a very strong.
3767000	3768000	A rumor.
3768000	3769000	It's in other waves.
3769000	3770000	Zengqian.
3770000	3771000	Just no.
3771000	3772000	It's not as strong as HMM.
3772000	3773000	So of course it's right.
3773000	3774000	Like Xu Yang.
3774000	3775000	You just said.
3775000	3776000	It mirrors.
3776000	3777000	Gold.
3777000	3778000	The general metal.
3778000	3779000	Neutron.
3779000	3780000	It's also a strength.
3780000	3781000	But if I want to do one.
3781000	3782000	Boehm.
3782000	3783000	Different wavelengths.
3783000	3784000	That is.
3784000	3785000	For metal.
3785000	3786000	The particles.
3786000	3787000	May be impossible.
3787000	3788000	That.
3788000	3789000	I can still control this.
3789000	3790000	It.
3790000	3791000	Strengthen a rumor of different wavelengths.
3791000	3792000	About.
3792000	3793000	Is there any strength?
3793000	3794000	That's right.
3794000	3795000	The main thing is to look.
3795000	3796000	The main thing is to look at the application.
3796000	3797000	See what kind of application you want.
3797000	3798000	That's like me.
3798000	3799000	It's the strength of white light.
3799000	3800000	So I need to design this.
3800000	3801000	Different.
3801000	3802000	Different wavelengths.
3802000	3803000	Strengthening behavior.
3803000	3804000	That's simple.
3804000	3805000	The same thickness of metal.
3805000	3806000	Uh.
3806000	3807000	Gold.
3807000	3808000	It just can't reach.
3808000	3809000	It's close to a white light.
3809000	3810000	A strength.
3810000	3811000	The light.
3811000	3812000	So simple metal.
3812000	3813000	It will also strengthen.
3813000	3814000	Then the other question is.
3814000	3815000	Is it possible.
3815000	3816000	It's not.
3816000	3817000	It's not.
3817000	3818000	It's not.
3818000	3819000	It's not.
3819000	3820000	It's not.
3820000	3821000	It's not.
3821000	3822000	Then the other question is.
3822000	3823000	This kind of metal material.
3823000	3824000	Usually the problem is absorption.
3824000	3825000	That's.
3825000	3826000	That's.
3826000	3827000	In.
3827000	3828000	In these.
3828000	3829000	Uh.
3829000	3830000	Lacing.
3830000	3831000	Or.
3831000	3832000	You started with.
3832000	3833000	Enhance this.
3833000	3834000	These.
3834000	3835000	In the work.
3835000	3836000	Will this absorption.
3836000	3837000	Have caused some problems.
3837000	3838000	Hey.
3838000	3839000	I hope your question is.
3839000	3840000	Will the base be absorption?
3840000	3841000	Or.
3841000	3842000	It's still.
3842000	3843000	It's still.
3843000	3844000	It's still.
3844000	3845000	It's still.
3845000	3846000	It's still.
3846000	3847000	It's still.
3847000	3848000	It's still.
3848000	3849000	It's still.
3849000	3850000	It's still.
3850000	3851000	Is it.
3851000	3852000	It's still.
3852000	3853000	Does it carry a lot of metal?
3853000	3854000	Uh.
3854000	3855000	Yeah.
3855000	3856000	Because he will absorb some things himself.
3856000	3857000	But as a whole.
3857000	3858000	It will make me.
3858000	3859000	The top.
3859000	3860000	The top.
3860000	3861000	Medial.
3861000	3862000	Medial.
3862000	3863000	The.
3863000	3864000	Memory function will become higher.
3864000	3865000	The.
3865000	3866000	It's basically a little bit of absorption.
3866000	3867000	That's right.
3867000	3868000	So that's.
3868000	3869000	A little bit.
3869000	3870000	It's.
3870000	3871000	It's a little bit.
3871000	3872000	It's a little bit.
3872000	3873000	It's.
3873000	3874000	It's a little bit.
3874000	3875000	So.
3875000	3876000	How much.
3876000	3877000	But the reflection is OK.
3877000	3878000	Reflection is OK.
3878000	3879000	It won't absorb everything.
3879000	3880000	Of course, I can also design.
3880000	3881000	At some stages.
3881000	3882000	It absorbs very strongly.
3882000	3883000	At some stages.
3883000	3884000	Its reflection is very strong.
3884000	3885000	It can rely on me.
3885000	3886000	Different.
3886000	3887000	Like.
3887000	3888000	Uh.
3888000	3889000	A little bit.
3889000	3890000	Like.
3890000	3891000	Different.
3891000	3892000	Feel Fiction.
3892000	3893000	Can reach.
3893000	3894000	Wait a minute.
3894000	3895000	Like.
3895000	3896000	Like this.
3896000	3897000	I can.
3897000	3898000	Through different.
3898000	3899000	Feel Fiction.
3899000	3900000	To adjust.
3900000	3901000	So.
3901000	3902000	Not to say.
3902000	3903000	I.
3903000	3904000	This one.
3904000	3905000	HMM comes out.
3905000	3906000	For all the materials.
3906000	3907000	Perfect.
3907000	3908000	I want.
3908000	3909000	Case by case.
3909000	3910000	To design.
3910000	3911000	So.
3911000	3912000	Basically.
3912000	3913000	I.
3913000	3914000	HMM.
3914000	3915000	If it's different.
3915000	3916000	If it's different.
3916000	3917000	My thickness ratio.
3917000	3918000	It's a little bit different.
3918000	3919000	Just.
3919000	3920000	Case by case.
3920000	3921000	To design.
3921000	3922000	I.
3922000	3923000	I have a question.
3923000	3924000	Is that.
3924000	3925000	Is that.
3925000	3926000	How much is the mold volume?
3926000	3927000	How much is the mold volume?
3927000	3928000	And that.
3928000	3929000	Why.
3929000	3930000	Mold volume.
3930000	3931000	Mold volume.
3931000	3932000	Mold volume.
3932000	3933000	Mold volume.
3933000	3934000	Mold volume.
3934000	3935000	Mold volume.
3935000	3936000	Mold volume.
3936000	3937000	Just.
3937000	3938000	Generally its.
3938000	3939000	MOLD.
3939000	3942000	How much is the mold volume.
3942000	3943000	It's like you said it.
3943000	3944000	It is.
3944000	3945000	She is very small.
3945000	3947000	But I don't know how little she is.
3947000	3948000	Ah.
3948000	3949000	Right.
3949000	3950000	I see you here.
3950000	3951000	HMM.
3951000	3952000	Um.
3952000	3953000	But uh.
3953000	3954000	This is a plane.
3954000	3955000	So.
3955000	3956000	That plane.
3956000	3957000	The height of the.
3957000	3958000	What is it?
3958000	3959000	This.
3959000	3960000	The unit.
3960000	3961000	What is it?
3961000	3962000	This unit is.
3962000	3963000	Uh.
3963000	3964000	The height of the plane.
3964000	3965000	The height of the plane.
3965000	3966000	Uh.
3966000	3967000	I think.
3967000	3968000	UM3.
3968000	3970000	It's changed to NANO3.
3970000	3971000	It's ten.
3971000	3974000	Multiplied by ten to the ninth.
3974000	3975000	It should be.
3975000	3977000	Or ten to the sixth.
3977000	3978000	So it's this thing.
3978000	3980000	Multiply it by ten to the sixth.
3980000	3981000	Or ten to the sixth.
3981000	3982000	It is.
3982000	3983000	How many MM3.
3983000	3984000	So it's actually.
3984000	3986000	It's a very small thing.
3986000	3987000	That.
3987000	3988000	This kind of thing.
3988000	3989000	My question is.
3989000	3990000	This thing is a plane.
3990000	3991000	Yeah.
3991000	3992000	It's a plane.
3992000	3993000	If it's a plane.
3993000	3994000	You.
3994000	3995000	That.
3995000	3996000	Uh.
3996000	3997000	Volume should be a length.
3997000	3998000	The length.
3998000	3999000	It's a length.
3999000	4000000	That.
4000000	4001000	Unit.
4001000	4002000	Oh.
4002000	4003000	Because actually we.
4003000	4004000	Is.
4004000	4005000	It's a plane.
4005000	4006000	But we.
4006000	4007000	I.
4007000	4008000	When using.
4008000	4009000	Calculation.
4009000	4010000	It also needs a.
4010000	4011000	The volume to surround it.
4011000	4012000	A.
4012000	4013000	An overall calculation.
