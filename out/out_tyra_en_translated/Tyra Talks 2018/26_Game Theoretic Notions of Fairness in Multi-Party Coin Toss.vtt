00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Tera Talk.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
We're honored to have Lin Weikai with us today.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Lin Weikai has been a good friend of mine for many years.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
Lin Weikai is now a third-year PhD student at Cornell,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
majoring in Computer Science.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Lin's research focuses on cryptography.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
His main focus is on Oblivious algorithm.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
This allows the algorithm to store data without revealing the content.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
He majored in Chemistry when he was a college student.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
He majored in Computer Science when he was a master's student.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
He majored in Computer Science when he was a master's student.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Before his PhD,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
he worked as a software engineer at Chengxin.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
He also worked as a research assistant at the Central Academy of Sciences.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
What Lin is going to talk about today is the concept of Oblivious algorithm.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
But today, he's going to talk about a new definition of

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
the fairness of multiparty coin tossing.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's give him a round of applause.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
By the way, remember to turn on the microphone when you clap.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Let's give him a round of applause.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Thank you for such a wonderful introduction.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
The title is complicated,

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
but I assume most of you have heard of the theorem of the game.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Today's topic is

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
the concept of coin toss.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm going to talk about the relationship between coin toss and the theorem of the game.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
This work was done by Zhong Kaimin at the Central Academy of Sciences.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Guo Yue, Rafael, and I are both at Cornell.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
Cornell Tech is a campus at NYC.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
Cornell has a new campus at NYC.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
Let's talk about the topic of coin toss today.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
The motivation of this research is very realistic.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Although I usually do theoretical research,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
our motivation is very realistic.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
What is the motivation?

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Trump and Xi want to hold a summit.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Where will it be held?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Trump wants to hold it in DC.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Xi wants to hold it in Beijing.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
If these two people can't get along,

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
what should they do?

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
The easiest way is to make a decision by tossing a coin.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
If these two people can't get along,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
how can they toss a coin?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
This is a tricky question we are going to discuss today.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
If these two people can't get along, how can they toss a coin?

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Let's not talk about whether the coin toss will be fair or not.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
If they can't get along,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
if Trump tosses a coin here,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Xi won't believe it even if he doesn't see it.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
So what should they do?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
If I have a way to toss a coin,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
a way to toss a coin remotely,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
if the coin tosses out,

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Xi is in DC,

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Xi is in Beijing.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
If the coin tosses out remotely is fair,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
everyone will be happy.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Half and half chance.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
In the game,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
someone will tell you that there is a payoff.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
What is the coin toss?

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
Which side has how many payoffs or utilities?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
But let's not talk about this.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
In history,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
there is a hotline between the United States and the Soviet Union.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Maybe there is also a hotline between Trump and Xi.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
If they don't meet, they can talk on the phone.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
If there is a question in the middle,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
you can interrupt me at any time.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
I hope everyone can understand what I am talking about today.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
If you don't understand,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
don't be afraid.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Try to ask.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
The purpose of the hotline is that

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
you say one sentence, I say one sentence,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
and the other party can hear what I say.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Then there is nothing else.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
So the hotline can't help you directly

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
toss a coin.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It's not such a good thing.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
But what can the hotline do?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
The hotline can communicate on both sides.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
After the communication,

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
the hotline may have an output.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
B is equal to 0 or B is equal to 1.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
It's the same side.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The hotline can do this.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
It can help you create a random variable.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Its value is 0 or 1.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
The probability is 0.5 or 0.5.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
What I want is to get a random variable.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
It's a random variable defined by math.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
If you are familiar with the random variables defined by math,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
or you've heard of it in class,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I have a way to get the two sides to toss a coin.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
How do you do it?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Trump throws a coin first.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
The coin is 1.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Then Trump says to Xi on the phone,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
my coin is 1.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Then Xi says,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I got it.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Your coin is 1.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Then both sides agree that the coin is 1.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
If Trump throws a fair coin,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
this method may work.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
But Xi is obviously not happy.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
If Trump is a bad guy,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
and he didn't throw the coin at all,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
it's not a good thing for Xi.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
He won't agree with the result of the coin toss.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
Don't say that Trump made a mistake at the beginning,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and made it unfair.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Even if he made a very complicated LeTouJi,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
and recorded it,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and sent it to Xi through a hotline,

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Xi won't believe it.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
If Trump didn't cheat,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
it may work.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
But neither side believes each other.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
This is a common problem in cryptography.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
If neither side doesn't believe each other,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
what should we do?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
A long time ago,

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
there was a technology called commit.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
Trump first calculated a number X

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
using SHA.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Then he told Xi.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
This thing is called commit.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Xi said,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
you calculated X, I calculated Y,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
and then E.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Then Trump said,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
my X is below E,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
and then he made a mess.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
In order to hide the E at the beginning.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Then these two sides,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
X and Y, XOR,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
is the result of the coin toss.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
In cryptography,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
these two things are simplified

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
into commit and open.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
That is,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
he wrote an X,

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
and then sealed it in the envelope to Xi.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
After Xi received it,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
he opened the envelope.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
The purpose of the envelope

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
is to prevent the person

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
who wrote the envelope from changing.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
The person who received the envelope

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
can't see it for the time being.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
This is called commit and open.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
In the past...

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I have a question.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Does this hotline

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
have a rule

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
that you have to do it one by one?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Can't you say it at the same time?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
If you say it at the same time,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
everyone says 1, 2, 3,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
and I say 1 or 0,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and everyone says XOR.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
This is a very good question.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
But because everyone doesn't believe it,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
they might say it slowly.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
So...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
This hotline

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
has a rule

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
that you have to do it one by one.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You can't say it at the same time.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You can't say it at the same time.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I should say that

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I didn't assume

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
that this hotline

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
had to do it one by one.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But Trump and Xi agreed

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
and...

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
If someone says it slowly,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
what should you do?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Do it again?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes, yes.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Then it will be endless.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Okay, good.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Also,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
when we imagine a hotline,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
we can't judge

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
who says it slowly.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Because of the message delay,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
we can't be sure

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
who says it slowly.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
If we do it one by one,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
we can be sure of the order.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Okay, got it.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
at the same time,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
on the internet,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
it's hard to judge.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
This is a good question.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Let's say

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
all the protocols

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
are one by one.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And the order is...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Okay,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
then,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
this thing,

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
this commit and open,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
if you have a good commit,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
when you commit,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
the other side can't be opened.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And the other side of the bus

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
can't be tampered with.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Then this thing,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
this coin toss thing,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
can be done fairly.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Because when it commits to x in advance,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
it doesn't know what will happen to y.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
And when it commits to y,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
it doesn't know what x is.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
So,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
the result will be

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
fair.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
we can be sure

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
the other side can't tamper with the result.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Then,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
this thing,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
we've been talking about fairness.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
What kind of fairness

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
do we want?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The formal definition of

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
mathematics is

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
the expected value is 0.5.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
The result of the commit is only 0 and 1.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And the probability is 0.5.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So the expected value is

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
0.5 times 0 plus 0.5 times 1

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
equals 0.5.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I want the expected value

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
to be exactly 0.5.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Then,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
if you look at this thing carefully,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
it's not exactly 0.5.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I'll talk about this later.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
So it usually adds

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
a very small fraction,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
negligible.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But let's leave it alone.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I just want 0.5.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Then,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
this thing,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
unfortunately,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
in the

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
previous result,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
a long time ago,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
about 30 years ago,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
what can't we do?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
adversary,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
like Trump or Xi,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
can end

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
earlier.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
This protocol is not finished yet.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He said I'm not going to play like this.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
this adversary

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
is

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
only when there is a limited

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
computing power,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
this

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
protocol,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
this is easier for the protocol

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
to do.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Let's assume that Trump and Xi

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
have limited

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
computing power.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
It's all polynomial time

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
algorithm.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
This polynomial time,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
you may not be familiar with it,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
but

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
you can make a decision

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
within a few seconds.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Then

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
any

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
protocol like this,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
in the result of this cliff,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
it can design

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
an attacker to crack

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
any protocol.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
So

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
to achieve the expected value

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
is exactly 0.5,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
no protocol can do it.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
The result is

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
such a strong impossibility.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
That is to say,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
no protocol can do this.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
In this way,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
let's take a look at this example.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Just

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
commit and open this example.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Here,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
we are using the

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
new hash function.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
It's not new, it's about

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
more than ten years.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
So far, everyone still believes that SHA-256

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
is difficult to crack.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
For example,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Bitcoin is still in use.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
How to

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
crack it?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
If

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Xi's

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
computing power is

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
infinite,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
he can easily

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
decrypt SHA-256x

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
which is equal to a certain number.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
As long as he violently

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
tries all the x,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
he can decrypt the x.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
After Xi knows

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
the value of x,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
he can choose a relative y

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
so that the result is what he likes.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
For example, he likes 0.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
0 represents Beijing.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
So when he sees that the value of x is 1,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
he chooses a y

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
so that the result is Beijing.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Trump doesn't know

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
that he was fooled.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
He can only delete 1.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
The result is what Xi wants.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
This is

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
if

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
one of them

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
has

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
infinite computing power,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
something may happen.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
But

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
what I said last time

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
is even stronger.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Even if Xi only has

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
limited computing power,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
he can still attack.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
How effective

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
this attack method

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
can be?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It can make the expectation value

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
deviate

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
to any

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
deviation

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
to any

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
deviation

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
to any

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
deviation

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
to any

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
1 in three rounds.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
So

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
1 in three rounds.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The number of attacks

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
is about 1 in three rounds.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
This is a very powerful attack.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
For example,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
For example,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
For example,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
the attacker

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
has infinite computing power.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
He can make

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
his expectation value

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
deviate to 0.5.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
He can choose

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
what he wants.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But if he only has

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
limited computing power,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
he can't

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
make the expectation value

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
deviate so much, but he can

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
deviate to a certain number,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
which is 1 in three rounds.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I just gave a random number,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
but according to this protocol,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
it is about 1 in three rounds.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
The expectation value is 1 in three rounds.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
From 0.5 to 0.5 plus 1 in three rounds

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
is 0.8.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
the result of

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
cleave is very strong.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
You can't make a fair copy.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Because no matter what protocol,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
it can create an attacker.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Then

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
make an effective attack in a limited time.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Then

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
here

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
There is another thing

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
to talk about this attack.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
This

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
What kind of

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
impact will it have at the beginning and end?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
For example,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
at the beginning, I talked about the simplest

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
protocol.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Trump threw a copper plate,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and Xi Jinping received it and

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
admitted that it was a copper plate.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
He admitted the result of the copper plate.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This thing

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
has a fail-stop.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
If one of them

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
can end early

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
and not late,

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
it is difficult to achieve

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
a fair result.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
For example, Trump threw a copper plate,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
and he saw this copper plate

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
was not what he liked.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
He said, then I won't play.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Then

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
this

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
If you don't play, Xi Jinping

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
So far

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
we still assume that he is

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
honest

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
to follow the game rules at the beginning.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
He received

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
a copper plate message

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
and then he

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
admitted that the message of the copper plate

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
was their consensus.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
But

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
one of them is not late,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
what is the other party's consensus?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
This is

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
difficult to say.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
In order to have a consensus,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
we usually have to define

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
one of them

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
is not honest and not late.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
What should the other party say?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Xi Jinping

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
threw a copper plate

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
and it was 0.5.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Or he has to

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
fix the output

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
0 or 1

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
It's hard to say.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Trump

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
can see what he is doing

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
honestly

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and decide

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
when to end

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
and when not to end.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
The entire output

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
is completely controlled

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
by the dishonest

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
party.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Then

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
there is no fairness

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
or

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
security.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
The result of this copper plate

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
output

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
its fairness is the security

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I want.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
So

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
the focus here is

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
this

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
computationally bounded

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
the attacker's

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
computing power is limited

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
and it can end early

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
these two things.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
If one of them is missing

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
we all know

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
we all know

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
it can be done

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
If I assume

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
the attacker will never

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
end early

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
then this copper plate

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
can be played

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
up to 0.5

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
but these two conditions

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
these two computationally bounded

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
and failstop

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
when these two conditions exist at the same time

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
we can't do it.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And the proof that we can't do it

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
is to really build a

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
attacker

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
and then target

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
any protocol

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
to attack.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
So

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
but

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
but

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
when you look at the first page

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
you may find it

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
strange

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
if Trump can't end early

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
then Xi Jinping can

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
say I like to be in Beijing

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
then I will be in Beijing.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
This is

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
another definition

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
of

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
the focus

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Hello

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Hello

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Is my connection broken?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I can't hear you.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Ok

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
So

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Can you hear me?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
I can't hear you.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I can hear you.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
But

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I can't hear the speaker.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Ok

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Ok

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
So the connection is broken.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Let me contact him.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Hello

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Can you hear me?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I can hear you.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I can hear you.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I can hear you.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
How are you?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I can't hear you.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I am scared.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
I can't hear you.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I can't hear you.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.020
So

22:09.020 --> 22:11.020
I call you

22:11.020 --> 22:13.020
because

22:13.020 --> 22:15.020
I can't hear you.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.020
I can't hear you.

22:17.020 --> 22:19.020
I can't hear you.

22:19.020 --> 22:21.020
I can't hear you.

22:21.020 --> 22:23.020
Can you hear me?

22:27.020 --> 22:29.020
I can hear you.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.020
I can hear you.

22:31.020 --> 22:33.020
I think my internet is down.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.020
I don't know where I am.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.020
I just

22:37.020 --> 22:39.020
talk about

22:39.020 --> 22:41.020
the commit and open

22:41.020 --> 22:43.020
protocol can

22:43.020 --> 22:45.020
protect

22:45.020 --> 22:47.020
good people.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.020
And

22:49.020 --> 22:51.020
why this protocol

22:51.020 --> 22:53.020
can protect good people?

22:53.020 --> 22:55.020
If

22:55.020 --> 22:57.020
one side

22:57.020 --> 22:59.020
can't finish early,

22:59.020 --> 23:01.020
the other side

23:01.020 --> 23:03.020
will be happy to say

23:03.020 --> 23:05.020
the other side is bad

23:05.020 --> 23:07.020
so I can

23:07.020 --> 23:09.020
protect my own interests

23:09.020 --> 23:11.020
to protect the interests of good people.

23:11.020 --> 23:13.020
So I will

23:13.020 --> 23:15.020
produce the result

23:15.020 --> 23:17.020
that good people like.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.020
Because

23:19.020 --> 23:21.020
the other side can't finish early.

23:21.020 --> 23:23.020
And

23:23.020 --> 23:25.020
this

23:25.020 --> 23:27.020
is just

23:27.020 --> 23:29.020
one example.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.020
Of course, you can also

23:31.020 --> 23:33.020
let the other side finish early

23:33.020 --> 23:35.020
and Trump

23:35.020 --> 23:37.020
will choose the result he likes.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.020
This is another case.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.020
In short,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.020
the commit and open

23:43.020 --> 23:45.020
protocol

23:45.020 --> 23:47.020
can

23:47.020 --> 23:49.020
guarantee

23:49.020 --> 23:51.020
the

23:51.020 --> 23:53.020
previous definition.

23:55.020 --> 23:57.020
Even if

23:57.020 --> 23:59.020
one side is attacking

23:59.020 --> 24:01.020
and the other side's expectation

24:01.020 --> 24:03.020
is still over 0.5,

24:03.020 --> 24:05.020
the payoff is still over 0.5.

24:05.020 --> 24:07.020
Because

24:07.020 --> 24:09.020
the basic idea

24:09.020 --> 24:11.020
is simple.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.020
If one side can't finish early,

24:13.020 --> 24:15.020
the other side will be happy

24:15.020 --> 24:17.020
to choose the result he likes.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.020
He can choose.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.020
So

24:21.020 --> 24:23.020
if one side can't finish early,

24:23.020 --> 24:25.020
the other side is

24:25.020 --> 24:27.020
a good person.

24:27.020 --> 24:29.020
If a good person chooses the result he likes,

24:29.020 --> 24:31.020
his expectation value will not be

24:31.020 --> 24:33.020
reduced by bad people.

24:35.020 --> 24:37.020
Is it okay

24:37.020 --> 24:39.020
to go this far?

24:39.020 --> 24:41.020
If it's okay,

24:41.020 --> 24:43.020
it will be a little more complicated later.

24:43.020 --> 24:45.020
But

24:45.020 --> 24:47.020
the most important thing to define here

24:47.020 --> 24:49.020
is to protect the expectation value of good people.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.020
And the payoff

24:51.020 --> 24:53.020
is the most important point.

24:53.020 --> 24:55.020
First,

24:55.020 --> 24:57.020
we need to define

24:57.020 --> 24:59.020
what a good person is.

24:59.020 --> 25:01.020
Second,

25:01.020 --> 25:03.020
what a payoff is.

25:03.020 --> 25:05.020
The payoff is

25:05.020 --> 25:07.020
the protocol.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.020
After running the result,

25:09.020 --> 25:11.020
I look at the result and decide

25:11.020 --> 25:13.020
how much benefit this result will bring me.

25:13.020 --> 25:15.020
Then

25:15.020 --> 25:17.020
I define

25:17.020 --> 25:19.020
that I want to protect the interests of good people.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.020
The expectation value is greater than a certain number.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.020
Of course,

25:23.020 --> 25:25.020
if I say a little more here,

25:25.020 --> 25:27.020
the payoff

25:27.020 --> 25:29.020
is completely

25:29.020 --> 25:31.020
restricted to

25:31.020 --> 25:33.020
the payoff function

25:33.020 --> 25:35.020
defined by this example.

25:37.020 --> 25:39.020
The payoff function itself is very simple.

25:39.020 --> 25:41.020
But

25:41.020 --> 25:43.020
in Game Theory,

25:43.020 --> 25:45.020
there are many strange payoffs

25:45.020 --> 25:47.020
that will make

25:47.020 --> 25:49.020
these results strange.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.020
But we won't discuss those today.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.020
Even in my paper,

25:53.020 --> 25:55.020
there is no way to discuss so much

25:55.020 --> 25:57.020
because there are too many strange payoffs.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.020
But the simplest

25:59.020 --> 26:01.020
payoff function

26:01.020 --> 26:03.020
is the focus

26:03.020 --> 26:05.020
of this paper.

26:07.020 --> 26:09.020
Okay,

26:09.020 --> 26:11.020
next,

26:11.020 --> 26:13.020
next,

26:13.020 --> 26:15.020
well,

26:15.020 --> 26:17.020
well,

26:17.020 --> 26:19.020
well,

26:19.020 --> 26:21.020
what you see here

26:21.020 --> 26:23.020
is that there are only two players

26:23.020 --> 26:25.020
and two parties

26:25.020 --> 26:27.020
playing.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.020
The two parties

26:29.020 --> 26:31.020
can achieve

26:31.020 --> 26:33.020
the fairness

26:33.020 --> 26:35.020
in this

26:35.020 --> 26:37.020
fairness in interest.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.020
The result

26:39.020 --> 26:41.020
may not be fair,

26:41.020 --> 26:43.020
but the interest is fair.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.020
Then we start.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.020
But a very natural question is

26:47.020 --> 26:49.020
when

26:49.020 --> 26:51.020
you add one more person,

26:51.020 --> 26:53.020
is there any way

26:53.020 --> 26:55.020
to achieve

26:55.020 --> 26:57.020
the fairness?

26:57.020 --> 26:59.020
So we just

26:59.020 --> 27:01.020
add one more person.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.020
Then

27:03.020 --> 27:05.020
I don't know if the third person

27:05.020 --> 27:07.020
is Jin Xiaopang or

27:07.020 --> 27:09.020
Putin.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.020
Anyway, it's A, B, C.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.020
Then

27:13.020 --> 27:15.020
we assume the simplest

27:15.020 --> 27:17.020
is

27:17.020 --> 27:19.020
what kind of output

27:19.020 --> 27:21.020
do these three people like

27:21.020 --> 27:23.020
is public.

27:23.020 --> 27:25.020
It's also public

27:25.020 --> 27:27.020
who aborts early and

27:27.020 --> 27:29.020
doesn't play early.

27:29.020 --> 27:31.020
So if C aborts early

27:31.020 --> 27:33.020
and doesn't play,

27:33.020 --> 27:35.020
A and B will not play

27:35.020 --> 27:37.020
sooner or later.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.020
So let's assume

27:39.020 --> 27:41.020
all the messages are public.

27:41.020 --> 27:43.020
Maybe you can imagine

27:43.020 --> 27:45.020
three hotlines or something.

27:45.020 --> 27:47.020
Or

27:47.020 --> 27:49.020
now this very popular

27:49.020 --> 27:51.020
blockchain

27:51.020 --> 27:53.020
messages are all public.

27:53.020 --> 27:55.020
So if one of them doesn't play

27:55.020 --> 27:57.020
or if one of them sends

27:57.020 --> 27:59.020
a message, the other two can

27:59.020 --> 28:01.020
know at the same time.

28:01.020 --> 28:03.020
One of the possible applications

28:03.020 --> 28:05.020
may be

28:05.020 --> 28:07.020
eating dumplings and tigers

28:07.020 --> 28:09.020
on the blockchain.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.020
But how do these three people define

28:11.020 --> 28:13.020
eating dumplings and tigers?

28:13.020 --> 28:15.020
You can also say

28:15.020 --> 28:17.020
the result of

28:17.020 --> 28:19.020
eating dumplings and tigers

28:19.020 --> 28:21.020
is 1.

28:21.020 --> 28:23.020
If the person who chose 1

28:23.020 --> 28:25.020
is 1,

28:25.020 --> 28:27.020
then he won.

28:27.020 --> 28:29.020
If the person who chose 0 is 0,

28:29.020 --> 28:31.020
he also won.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.020
Of course, this payoff is not

28:33.020 --> 28:35.020
0.3. So in some cases,

28:37.020 --> 28:39.020
the seller of

28:39.020 --> 28:41.020
eating dumplings and tigers may lose money.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.020
And the loser is not ABC.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.020
It's the one who

28:45.020 --> 28:47.020
opened the casino.

28:47.020 --> 28:49.020
This is just

28:49.020 --> 28:51.020
one example.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.020
But

28:55.020 --> 28:57.020
in terms of game theory,

28:57.020 --> 28:59.020
there are many

28:59.020 --> 29:01.020
forms of this game.

29:01.020 --> 29:03.020
But for now,

29:03.020 --> 29:05.020
let's focus

29:05.020 --> 29:07.020
on this

29:07.020 --> 29:09.020
simplest example.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.020
I just want to

29:11.020 --> 29:13.020
ask

29:13.020 --> 29:15.020
to protect the

29:15.020 --> 29:17.020
real

29:17.020 --> 29:19.020
interest.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.020
Can we do this?

29:21.020 --> 29:23.020
Then

29:23.020 --> 29:25.020
this definition

29:25.020 --> 29:27.020
we call it Maximin.

29:27.020 --> 29:29.020
Maximin is also

29:29.020 --> 29:31.020
a terminology borrowed

29:31.020 --> 29:33.020
from game theory.

29:33.020 --> 29:35.020
In the game,

29:35.020 --> 29:37.020
Maximin means

29:41.020 --> 29:43.020
everyone

29:43.020 --> 29:45.020
maximizes

29:45.020 --> 29:47.020
their own

29:47.020 --> 29:49.020
interest.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.020
I want to

29:51.020 --> 29:53.020
minimize

29:53.020 --> 29:55.020
my own interest.

29:55.020 --> 29:57.020
Basically,

29:57.020 --> 29:59.020
it means

29:59.020 --> 30:01.020
when others maximize

30:01.020 --> 30:03.020
their interest,

30:03.020 --> 30:05.020
I want to maximize

30:05.020 --> 30:07.020
my own interest.

30:07.020 --> 30:09.020
Why is it called Maximin?

30:09.020 --> 30:11.020
Because if one side is maximized

30:11.020 --> 30:13.020
and the other side is minimized.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.020
Anyway,

30:15.020 --> 30:17.020
intuition

30:17.020 --> 30:19.020
means

30:19.020 --> 30:21.020
I want to protect good people.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.020
Good people

30:23.020 --> 30:25.020
are people who play according to the rules of the game.

30:25.020 --> 30:27.020
The interest of good people

30:27.020 --> 30:29.020
should be greater than or equal to 0.5.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.020
This is the expectation value.

30:31.020 --> 30:33.020
After this thing is defined,

30:33.020 --> 30:35.020
the first question we ask is

30:35.020 --> 30:37.020
whether it can be done.

30:37.020 --> 30:39.020
Of course, there are other definitions

30:39.020 --> 30:41.020
of Maximin.

30:41.020 --> 30:43.020
Some are very natural.

30:43.020 --> 30:45.020
Some may seem

30:45.020 --> 30:47.020
unnatural in some scenarios.

30:47.020 --> 30:49.020
But we'll talk about it

30:49.020 --> 30:51.020
later.

30:51.020 --> 30:53.020
For now,

30:53.020 --> 30:55.020
let's focus on

30:55.020 --> 30:57.020
the definition of

30:57.020 --> 30:59.020
protecting good people's interests.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.020
Let's pause here.

31:03.020 --> 31:05.020
Is this definition clear?

31:05.020 --> 31:07.020
My definition is

31:07.020 --> 31:09.020
that my protocol

31:09.020 --> 31:11.020
should protect good people's interests.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.020
This is my definition.

31:13.020 --> 31:15.020
Then I ask

31:15.020 --> 31:17.020
whether this protocol

31:17.020 --> 31:19.020
can be constructed

31:19.020 --> 31:21.020
to protect good people's interests.

31:21.020 --> 31:23.020
I have a question.

31:23.020 --> 31:25.020
You said

31:25.020 --> 31:27.020
we should protect

31:27.020 --> 31:29.020
according to the rules of the game.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.020
This is a starting point

31:31.020 --> 31:33.020
of your research.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.020
I can understand this.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.020
The concept of

31:37.020 --> 31:39.020
protecting good people's interests

31:39.020 --> 31:41.020
is translated to

31:41.020 --> 31:43.020
greater than or equal to 0.5

31:43.020 --> 31:45.020
for the expected payoff

31:45.020 --> 31:47.020
of honesty.

31:47.020 --> 31:49.020
You said your game

31:49.020 --> 31:51.020
is not zero-sum.

31:51.020 --> 31:53.020
Is greater than or equal to 0.5

31:53.020 --> 31:55.020
greater than or equal to 0.5?

31:55.020 --> 31:57.020
You asked

31:57.020 --> 31:59.020
a good question.

31:59.020 --> 32:01.020
I don't write

32:01.020 --> 32:03.020
a quantifier here.

32:03.020 --> 32:05.020
For example,

32:05.020 --> 32:07.020
A, B, C are all honest.

32:07.020 --> 32:09.020
They all follow the rules of the game.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.020
Then

32:11.020 --> 32:13.020
everyone's

32:13.020 --> 32:15.020
expected value is 0.5.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.020
So you will ask

32:17.020 --> 32:19.020
the total expected value is 0.5.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.020
So I

32:21.020 --> 32:23.020
don't have a quantifier here.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.020
It's just that

32:25.020 --> 32:27.020
every honest is greater than 0.5.

32:29.020 --> 32:31.020
Oh, I see.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.020
I define

32:33.020 --> 32:35.020
it as

32:35.020 --> 32:37.020
A, B, C

32:37.020 --> 32:39.020
all follow the rules of the game.

32:39.020 --> 32:41.020
But they

32:41.020 --> 32:43.020
may not

32:43.020 --> 32:45.020
care about each other.

32:45.020 --> 32:47.020
They may not like each other.

32:47.020 --> 32:49.020
But they all follow the rules of the game.

32:49.020 --> 32:51.020
They are all good people.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.020
So the better way

32:53.020 --> 32:55.020
is that

32:55.020 --> 32:57.020
if I follow the rules of the game,

32:57.020 --> 32:59.020
it's my best choice

32:59.020 --> 33:01.020
among the players.

33:05.020 --> 33:07.020
This question

33:07.020 --> 33:09.020
will become another definition.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.020
What you just said will become another definition.

33:13.020 --> 33:15.020
So we'll

33:15.020 --> 33:17.020
discuss it later.

33:17.020 --> 33:19.020
OK, thank you.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.020
OK, so

33:21.020 --> 33:23.020
if

33:23.020 --> 33:25.020
this definition

33:25.020 --> 33:27.020
is not a problem,

33:27.020 --> 33:29.020
then we can

33:29.020 --> 33:31.020
discuss

33:31.020 --> 33:33.020
a simple example.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.020
When everyone

33:35.020 --> 33:37.020
wants the result to be

33:37.020 --> 33:39.020
1, or everyone

33:39.020 --> 33:41.020
wants the result to be 0,

33:41.020 --> 33:43.020
then

33:43.020 --> 33:45.020
this thing

33:45.020 --> 33:47.020
is extremely simple.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.020
This thing

33:49.020 --> 33:51.020
is extremely simple.

33:51.020 --> 33:53.020
As long as

33:53.020 --> 33:55.020
everyone sees

33:55.020 --> 33:57.020
the same side number,

33:57.020 --> 33:59.020
then everyone outputs

33:59.020 --> 34:01.020
the same side number.

34:01.020 --> 34:03.020
As long as everyone sees

34:03.020 --> 34:05.020
the same side number,

34:05.020 --> 34:07.020
then everyone outputs 1.

34:07.020 --> 34:09.020
Then everyone is happy.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.020
For example,

34:11.020 --> 34:13.020
if everyone wants the result

34:13.020 --> 34:15.020
to be 1,

34:15.020 --> 34:17.020
then everyone outputs 1.

34:17.020 --> 34:19.020
The dealer

34:19.020 --> 34:21.020
in the casino is not happy,

34:21.020 --> 34:23.020
but the rules of the game

34:23.020 --> 34:25.020
are set.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.020
The players are happy

34:27.020 --> 34:29.020
because everyone can win.

34:29.020 --> 34:31.020
But this example is not very interesting.

34:31.020 --> 34:33.020
Because

34:33.020 --> 34:35.020
if

34:35.020 --> 34:37.020
Trump, Xi and Putin

34:37.020 --> 34:39.020
all want to go to DC,

34:39.020 --> 34:41.020
then

34:41.020 --> 34:43.020
they don't need to discuss this thing.

34:43.020 --> 34:45.020
They are happy to go to DC.

34:45.020 --> 34:47.020
So

34:47.020 --> 34:49.020
this case is not interesting.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.020
Let's change to

34:51.020 --> 34:53.020
a more complicated one.

34:53.020 --> 34:55.020
If one of the players

34:55.020 --> 34:57.020
has a different side number,

34:57.020 --> 34:59.020
he is a minority.

34:59.020 --> 35:01.020
But

35:01.020 --> 35:03.020
I assume

35:03.020 --> 35:05.020
the bad guy who doesn't follow the rules of the game

35:05.020 --> 35:07.020
can only do one thing,

35:07.020 --> 35:09.020
which is

35:09.020 --> 35:11.020
he can't play earlier.

35:11.020 --> 35:13.020
I also have

35:13.020 --> 35:15.020
a slightly more complicated

35:15.020 --> 35:17.020
rule of the game

35:17.020 --> 35:19.020
that can protect

35:19.020 --> 35:21.020
the interests of good people.

35:21.020 --> 35:23.020
How to do this rule of the game?

35:23.020 --> 35:25.020
It's very simple.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.020
Let the minority throw the coin.

35:27.020 --> 35:29.020
After throwing the coin,

35:29.020 --> 35:31.020
he tells the result of the coin

35:31.020 --> 35:33.020
to the other two players.

35:33.020 --> 35:35.020
Then the other two players

35:35.020 --> 35:37.020
are very happy to receive the coin.

35:37.020 --> 35:39.020
Then the game is over.

35:39.020 --> 35:41.020
Why

35:41.020 --> 35:43.020
can this rule of the game

35:43.020 --> 35:45.020
protect the interests of good people?

35:45.020 --> 35:47.020
Because

35:47.020 --> 35:49.020
this game only forces

35:49.020 --> 35:51.020
one person to speak from the beginning to the end,

35:51.020 --> 35:53.020
which is the minority.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.020
If the minority

35:55.020 --> 35:57.020
speaks,

35:57.020 --> 35:59.020
he follows the rules of the game.

35:59.020 --> 36:01.020
If he wants to speak,

36:01.020 --> 36:03.020
he must follow the rules of the game.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.020
Otherwise, he will shut up.

36:05.020 --> 36:07.020
If he speaks,

36:07.020 --> 36:09.020
it means he follows the rules of the game.

36:09.020 --> 36:11.020
This coin is also

36:11.020 --> 36:13.020
fair.

36:13.020 --> 36:15.020
After the other two players

36:15.020 --> 36:17.020
receive the coin,

36:17.020 --> 36:19.020
they follow the rules of the game.

36:19.020 --> 36:21.020
Because

36:21.020 --> 36:23.020
everything is fair

36:23.020 --> 36:25.020
according to the rules of the game.

36:25.020 --> 36:27.020
If the only person

36:27.020 --> 36:29.020
who speaks

36:29.020 --> 36:31.020
does not follow the rules of the game,

36:31.020 --> 36:33.020
how can he not follow the rules of the game?

36:33.020 --> 36:35.020
He can only

36:35.020 --> 36:37.020
shut up.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.020
He does not say what he should say.

36:39.020 --> 36:41.020
This is his only way

36:41.020 --> 36:43.020
not to follow the rules of the game.

36:43.020 --> 36:45.020
When A and C see B

36:45.020 --> 36:47.020
do not follow the rules of the game,

36:47.020 --> 36:49.020
they are happy to decide that B is a bad person.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.020
A and C can be happy to say

36:51.020 --> 36:53.020
that we do not care

36:53.020 --> 36:55.020
about the loss of the bad person.

36:55.020 --> 36:57.020
We just follow our happiness.

36:57.020 --> 36:59.020
So

36:59.020 --> 37:01.020
what I just

37:01.020 --> 37:03.020
talked about

37:03.020 --> 37:05.020
is to prove

37:05.020 --> 37:07.020
that the rules of the game

37:07.020 --> 37:09.020
can easily protect

37:09.020 --> 37:11.020
the interests of good people.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.020
So

37:13.020 --> 37:15.020
if the only thing

37:15.020 --> 37:17.020
bad people can do

37:17.020 --> 37:19.020
is not to play,

37:19.020 --> 37:21.020
this thing is also easy to do.

37:21.020 --> 37:23.020
Just

37:23.020 --> 37:25.020
as I just said,

37:25.020 --> 37:27.020
throw a coin, send a message,

37:27.020 --> 37:29.020
and it's over.

37:29.020 --> 37:31.020
But

37:31.020 --> 37:33.020
these examples

37:33.020 --> 37:35.020
of Trump and Xi

37:35.020 --> 37:37.020
or Putin

37:37.020 --> 37:39.020
are not like this.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.020
They may

37:41.020 --> 37:43.020
not follow the rules of the game,

37:43.020 --> 37:45.020
not throw a coin,

37:45.020 --> 37:47.020
so

37:47.020 --> 37:49.020
the previous one, B

37:49.020 --> 37:51.020
threw a coin and sent a message,

37:51.020 --> 37:53.020
this thing is

37:53.020 --> 37:55.020
that the bad guy

37:55.020 --> 37:57.020
may not follow this rule at all.

37:57.020 --> 37:59.020
And

37:59.020 --> 38:01.020
if he doesn't follow this rule,

38:01.020 --> 38:03.020
then

38:03.020 --> 38:05.020
he can't protect

38:05.020 --> 38:07.020
the interests of good people.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.020
This is what we call

38:09.020 --> 38:11.020
random

38:11.020 --> 38:13.020
input.

38:13.020 --> 38:15.020
This is what we call

38:15.020 --> 38:17.020
random input.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.020
This is what we call

38:19.020 --> 38:21.020
random input.

38:21.020 --> 38:23.020
Everything is not fair

38:23.020 --> 38:25.020
when it is tampered with.

38:25.020 --> 38:27.020
And

38:27.020 --> 38:29.020
And

38:29.020 --> 38:31.020
And

38:31.020 --> 38:33.020
the main difficulty

38:33.020 --> 38:35.020
of this project is

38:35.020 --> 38:37.020
to discuss

38:37.020 --> 38:39.020
whether this case

38:39.020 --> 38:41.020
is fair

38:41.020 --> 38:43.020
to Maximin.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.020
And

38:45.020 --> 38:47.020
And

38:47.020 --> 38:49.020
We

38:49.020 --> 38:51.020
We

38:51.020 --> 38:53.020
spent a lot of time

38:53.020 --> 38:55.020
We spent a lot of time

38:55.020 --> 38:57.020
discussing whether he can do it or not.

38:57.020 --> 38:59.020
We can't think of a way

38:59.020 --> 39:01.020
to really do this thing

39:01.020 --> 39:03.020
to protect

39:03.020 --> 39:05.020
honest players.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.020
But we can't prove

39:07.020 --> 39:09.020
that he can't do it.

39:09.020 --> 39:11.020
So we can't do this thing.

39:11.020 --> 39:13.020
At the beginning,

39:13.020 --> 39:15.020
we thought he could do it.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.020
The reason is

39:17.020 --> 39:19.020
The reason is

39:19.020 --> 39:21.020
The reason is

39:21.020 --> 39:23.020
When bad guys

39:23.020 --> 39:25.020
When bad guys

39:25.020 --> 39:27.020
are restricted,

39:27.020 --> 39:29.020
there is a solution.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.020
There are

39:31.020 --> 39:33.020
many technologies

39:33.020 --> 39:35.020
on traditional documents

39:35.020 --> 39:37.020
that allow

39:37.020 --> 39:39.020
that allow

39:39.020 --> 39:41.020
a simple example

39:41.020 --> 39:43.020
that allows a simple example

39:43.020 --> 39:45.020
to resist

39:45.020 --> 39:47.020
the restricted bad guys.

39:47.020 --> 39:49.020
And then,

39:49.020 --> 39:51.020
we get a

39:51.020 --> 39:53.020
cryptographic operation

39:53.020 --> 39:55.020
and get a

39:55.020 --> 39:57.020
protocol that

39:57.020 --> 39:59.020
the bad guys are not restricted

39:59.020 --> 40:01.020
but still safe.

40:01.020 --> 40:03.020
This is called the game rule.

40:03.020 --> 40:05.020
Because

40:05.020 --> 40:07.020
there are a lot of experiences in our documents,

40:07.020 --> 40:09.020
we can upgrade

40:09.020 --> 40:11.020
this security

40:11.020 --> 40:13.020
in different situations.

40:13.020 --> 40:15.020
So when we first

40:15.020 --> 40:17.020
saw this problem,

40:17.020 --> 40:19.020
we can upgrade

40:19.020 --> 40:21.020
the security

40:21.020 --> 40:23.020
with what we already know

40:23.020 --> 40:25.020
or what we already know

40:25.020 --> 40:27.020
in the documents.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.020
But

40:29.020 --> 40:31.020
later on,

40:31.020 --> 40:33.020
we moved more documents

40:33.020 --> 40:35.020
and finally proved that

40:35.020 --> 40:37.020
it can't be done.

40:37.020 --> 40:39.020
And

40:39.020 --> 40:41.020
especially

40:41.020 --> 40:43.020
the bad guys

40:43.020 --> 40:45.020
can't be done

40:45.020 --> 40:47.020
like

40:47.020 --> 40:49.020
what I said earlier

40:49.020 --> 40:51.020
about the result of cleave.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.020
We really built

40:53.020 --> 40:55.020
a

40:55.020 --> 40:57.020
limited time attacker

40:57.020 --> 40:59.020
a polynomial time attacker

40:59.020 --> 41:01.020
to attack

41:01.020 --> 41:03.020
any

41:03.020 --> 41:05.020
protocol like this.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.020
And

41:07.020 --> 41:09.020
the middle proof is more complicated.

41:09.020 --> 41:11.020
I won't talk about it.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.020
But

41:13.020 --> 41:15.020
the point is

41:15.020 --> 41:17.020
these protocols

41:17.020 --> 41:19.020
can't be done

41:19.020 --> 41:21.020
in a lot of situations.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.020
And the proof

41:23.020 --> 41:25.020
is

41:25.020 --> 41:27.020
the proof

41:27.020 --> 41:29.020
taught in high school or

41:29.020 --> 41:31.020
university math class.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.020
The technical details

41:33.020 --> 41:35.020
in the middle

41:35.020 --> 41:37.020
are skipped.

41:37.020 --> 41:39.020
But I think

41:39.020 --> 41:41.020
this

41:41.020 --> 41:43.020
thing

41:43.020 --> 41:45.020
should be

41:45.020 --> 41:47.020
conveyed.

41:47.020 --> 41:49.020
I defined

41:49.020 --> 41:51.020
a

41:51.020 --> 41:53.020
so-called

41:53.020 --> 41:55.020
fair board

41:55.020 --> 41:57.020
for a

41:57.020 --> 41:59.020
specific payoff function.

41:59.020 --> 42:01.020
This is very specific.

42:01.020 --> 42:03.020
I have countless payoff functions.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.020
Only this

42:05.020 --> 42:07.020
payoff function

42:07.020 --> 42:09.020
can't be

42:09.020 --> 42:11.020
fair.

42:11.020 --> 42:13.020
Maybe other payoff functions can.

42:13.020 --> 42:15.020
Because

42:15.020 --> 42:17.020
some payoff functions

42:17.020 --> 42:19.020
are easy to do.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.020
For example, if everyone's payoff looks the same,

42:21.020 --> 42:23.020
it may

42:23.020 --> 42:25.020
degenerate to a

42:25.020 --> 42:27.020
case I just discussed.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.020
And

42:29.020 --> 42:31.020
the so-called

42:31.020 --> 42:33.020
profit of the city

42:33.020 --> 42:35.020
is defined

42:35.020 --> 42:37.020
in this way.

42:37.020 --> 42:39.020
So there must be

42:39.020 --> 42:41.020
some way to define

42:41.020 --> 42:43.020
the profit.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.020
But even in such a simple way

42:45.020 --> 42:47.020
to define

42:47.020 --> 42:49.020
the profit,

42:49.020 --> 42:51.020
there is still

42:51.020 --> 42:53.020
no way to

42:53.020 --> 42:55.020
protect the profit.

42:55.020 --> 42:57.020
This is the message

42:57.020 --> 42:59.020
I want to convey.

42:59.020 --> 43:01.020
And

43:01.020 --> 43:03.020
one more thing.

43:03.020 --> 43:05.020
Even if

43:05.020 --> 43:07.020
the attacker has limited computing power,

43:07.020 --> 43:09.020
it still can't be protected.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
If your attacker

43:11.020 --> 43:13.020
has very limited

43:13.020 --> 43:15.020
computing power,

43:15.020 --> 43:17.020
you still can't

43:17.020 --> 43:19.020
protect the city's

43:19.020 --> 43:21.020
profit.

43:21.020 --> 43:23.020
So

43:23.020 --> 43:25.020
what I just said

43:25.020 --> 43:27.020
is back to the first example.

43:27.020 --> 43:29.020
Where should

43:29.020 --> 43:31.020
Trump and Xi meet?

43:31.020 --> 43:33.020
They can decide.

43:33.020 --> 43:35.020
But

43:35.020 --> 43:37.020
when one person becomes the third person,

43:37.020 --> 43:39.020
and Putin is added,

43:39.020 --> 43:41.020
there is no way to

43:41.020 --> 43:43.020
protect the city's profit.

43:43.020 --> 43:45.020
This is the

43:45.020 --> 43:47.020
biggest message

43:47.020 --> 43:49.020
I want to convey.

43:49.020 --> 43:51.020
There must be

43:51.020 --> 43:53.020
one or two people

43:53.020 --> 43:55.020
whose profits will be damaged.

43:55.020 --> 43:57.020
And

43:57.020 --> 43:59.020
the witness here

43:59.020 --> 44:01.020
is very complicated.

44:01.020 --> 44:03.020
But

44:03.020 --> 44:05.020
it's just a simple

44:05.020 --> 44:07.020
expected value calculation.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.020
But there are a few more turns.

44:09.020 --> 44:11.020
But

44:11.020 --> 44:13.020
I won't

44:13.020 --> 44:15.020
talk about

44:15.020 --> 44:17.020
the details.

44:21.020 --> 44:23.020
So

44:23.020 --> 44:25.020
to sum up,

44:25.020 --> 44:27.020
more than three people

44:27.020 --> 44:29.020
can be grouped

44:29.020 --> 44:31.020
into

44:31.020 --> 44:33.020
a larger

44:33.020 --> 44:35.020
organization.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.020
For example,

44:37.020 --> 44:39.020
if I have

44:39.020 --> 44:41.020
ten people,

44:41.020 --> 44:43.020
I can group

44:43.020 --> 44:45.020
them into

44:45.020 --> 44:47.020
three large groups.

44:47.020 --> 44:49.020
If

44:49.020 --> 44:51.020
the three large groups

44:51.020 --> 44:53.020
correspond to

44:53.020 --> 44:55.020
what I just said,

44:55.020 --> 44:57.020
they still can't

44:57.020 --> 44:59.020
do it.

44:59.020 --> 45:01.020
Or if I can

45:01.020 --> 45:03.020
correspond to two people,

45:03.020 --> 45:05.020
I can tell you

45:05.020 --> 45:07.020
the result of

45:07.020 --> 45:09.020
Cliff earlier.

45:09.020 --> 45:11.020
So

45:11.020 --> 45:13.020
this...

45:13.020 --> 45:15.020
Actually I was going to ask

45:15.020 --> 45:17.020
if you keep saying

45:17.020 --> 45:19.020
you have three parties

45:19.020 --> 45:21.020
and you want to generalize

45:21.020 --> 45:23.020
what N-Party will do.

45:23.020 --> 45:25.020
Intuitively,

45:25.020 --> 45:27.020
it makes sense.

45:27.020 --> 45:29.020
If you can group them

45:29.020 --> 45:31.020
into three parties,

45:31.020 --> 45:33.020
you can reduce the problem.

45:33.020 --> 45:35.020
But if you say

45:35.020 --> 45:37.020
the bad guys

45:37.020 --> 45:39.020
can be grouped

45:39.020 --> 45:41.020
into a group of bad guys,

45:41.020 --> 45:43.020
you still have to assume

45:43.020 --> 45:45.020
the bad guys

45:45.020 --> 45:47.020
are good to each other.

45:47.020 --> 45:49.020
They are honest.

45:49.020 --> 45:51.020
So the shared information

45:51.020 --> 45:53.020
is what they are doing.

45:53.020 --> 45:55.020
They know

45:55.020 --> 45:57.020
each other is breaking the rule.

45:57.020 --> 45:59.020
Yes.

46:03.020 --> 46:05.020
Your question is very good.

46:05.020 --> 46:07.020
So I will

46:07.020 --> 46:09.020
jump a little bit

46:09.020 --> 46:11.020
to talk about

46:11.020 --> 46:13.020
high-level.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.020
I assume

46:15.020 --> 46:17.020
the bad guys

46:17.020 --> 46:19.020
I mentioned

46:19.020 --> 46:21.020
are

46:21.020 --> 46:23.020
good guys

46:23.020 --> 46:25.020
and bad guys.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.020
The bad guys

46:27.020 --> 46:29.020
have

46:29.020 --> 46:31.020
a common...

46:31.020 --> 46:33.020
What is it called?

46:33.020 --> 46:35.020
For example,

46:35.020 --> 46:37.020
they have

46:37.020 --> 46:39.020
a bad guy

46:39.020 --> 46:41.020
controlling them.

46:41.020 --> 46:43.020
So your question is

46:43.020 --> 46:45.020
maybe

46:45.020 --> 46:47.020
the bad guys A

46:47.020 --> 46:49.020
and bad guys B

46:49.020 --> 46:51.020
have different interests.

46:51.020 --> 46:53.020
So they

46:53.020 --> 46:55.020
control each other.

46:55.020 --> 46:57.020
So far,

46:57.020 --> 46:59.020
I assume

46:59.020 --> 47:01.020
the bad guys A

47:01.020 --> 47:03.020
and bad guys B

47:03.020 --> 47:05.020
have a bad guy leader.

47:05.020 --> 47:07.020
Maybe he is not

47:07.020 --> 47:09.020
in the game.

47:09.020 --> 47:11.020
But he is the leader of the bad guys.

47:11.020 --> 47:13.020
He controls all the bad guys.

47:13.020 --> 47:15.020
All the bad guys

47:15.020 --> 47:17.020
cooperate with each other.

47:19.020 --> 47:21.020
So

47:21.020 --> 47:23.020
for the

47:23.020 --> 47:25.020
bad guys

47:25.020 --> 47:27.020
or good guys

47:27.020 --> 47:29.020
two or three

47:29.020 --> 47:31.020
should be

47:31.020 --> 47:33.020
easy to explain.

47:33.020 --> 47:35.020
Did I answer your question?

47:35.020 --> 47:37.020
Yes.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.020
It's the same as I thought.

47:39.020 --> 47:41.020
OK. Thank you.

47:41.020 --> 47:43.020
I will talk about

47:43.020 --> 47:45.020
the bad guys A

47:45.020 --> 47:47.020
and bad guys B.

47:47.020 --> 47:49.020
Sometimes,

47:49.020 --> 47:51.020
the bad guys A and bad guys B

47:51.020 --> 47:53.020
don't always

47:53.020 --> 47:55.020
have the same leader.

47:55.020 --> 47:57.020
But

47:57.020 --> 47:59.020
to sum up,

47:59.020 --> 48:01.020
most examples

48:01.020 --> 48:03.020
can't be used

48:03.020 --> 48:05.020
to protect

48:05.020 --> 48:07.020
the good guys.

48:07.020 --> 48:09.020
Unless

48:09.020 --> 48:11.020
the problem is simple.

48:11.020 --> 48:13.020
Only one

48:13.020 --> 48:15.020
person has different preferences.

48:15.020 --> 48:17.020
And the bad guy is very limited.

48:17.020 --> 48:19.020
He can only

48:19.020 --> 48:21.020
play. He can't do anything else.

48:21.020 --> 48:23.020
Only a small piece

48:23.020 --> 48:25.020
can be

48:25.020 --> 48:27.020
justified.

48:27.020 --> 48:29.020
The justification defined

48:29.020 --> 48:31.020
under Maximine

48:31.020 --> 48:33.020
can only be justified

48:33.020 --> 48:35.020
by a small piece.

48:35.020 --> 48:37.020
The rest can't be justified.

48:37.020 --> 48:39.020
It's quite sad.

48:39.020 --> 48:41.020
Just now,

48:41.020 --> 48:43.020
the host

48:43.020 --> 48:45.020
asked

48:45.020 --> 48:47.020
some good questions.

48:47.020 --> 48:49.020
For example,

48:49.020 --> 48:51.020
I defined

48:51.020 --> 48:53.020
that the good guys' interests can't be damaged.

48:53.020 --> 48:55.020
My starting point is to protect the good guys' interests.

48:55.020 --> 48:57.020
The other starting point

48:57.020 --> 48:59.020
is more like

48:59.020 --> 49:01.020
game theory's

49:01.020 --> 49:03.020
Nash Equilibrium.

49:03.020 --> 49:05.020
The so-called bad guys

49:05.020 --> 49:07.020
or corrupt parties

49:07.020 --> 49:09.020
must have

49:09.020 --> 49:11.020
a certain economic motivation

49:11.020 --> 49:13.020
to do bad things

49:13.020 --> 49:15.020
to break the rules.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.020
This is

49:17.020 --> 49:19.020
another

49:19.020 --> 49:21.020
definition.

49:21.020 --> 49:23.020
This definition is very natural.

49:23.020 --> 49:25.020
For example,

49:25.020 --> 49:27.020
I defined a set of game rules

49:27.020 --> 49:29.020
in a certain game.

49:29.020 --> 49:31.020
Even if

49:31.020 --> 49:33.020
there is a

49:33.020 --> 49:35.020
bad guy controlling

49:35.020 --> 49:37.020
certain people,

49:37.020 --> 49:39.020
he becomes a bad guy.

49:39.020 --> 49:41.020
But the bad guys

49:41.020 --> 49:43.020
controlled by the boss

49:43.020 --> 49:45.020
don't have to

49:45.020 --> 49:47.020
listen to the boss.

49:47.020 --> 49:49.020
They have to

49:49.020 --> 49:51.020
listen to

49:51.020 --> 49:53.020
the boss

49:53.020 --> 49:55.020
to increase

49:55.020 --> 49:57.020
their own interests.

49:57.020 --> 49:59.020
Then,

49:59.020 --> 50:01.020
Nash Equilibrium

50:01.020 --> 50:03.020
requires

50:03.020 --> 50:05.020
the boss

50:05.020 --> 50:07.020
to increase

50:07.020 --> 50:09.020
the interests of the bad guys.

50:09.020 --> 50:11.020
This is

50:11.020 --> 50:13.020
very difficult

50:13.020 --> 50:15.020
for the boss.

50:15.020 --> 50:17.020
Especially,

50:17.020 --> 50:19.020
for example,

50:19.020 --> 50:21.020
what I said

50:21.020 --> 50:23.020
from the beginning is that

50:23.020 --> 50:25.020
the output is only 0 or 1.

50:25.020 --> 50:27.020
Your preference

50:27.020 --> 50:29.020
is only 0 or 1.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.020
If the boss

50:31.020 --> 50:33.020
controls both

50:33.020 --> 50:35.020
0 and 1,

50:35.020 --> 50:37.020
the boss

50:37.020 --> 50:39.020
can't

50:39.020 --> 50:41.020
satisfy

50:41.020 --> 50:43.020
both sides.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.020
Because

50:45.020 --> 50:47.020
one side's interest increases,

50:47.020 --> 50:49.020
and the other side's interest decreases.

50:51.020 --> 50:53.020
So,

50:53.020 --> 50:55.020
this definition is

50:55.020 --> 50:57.020
called Strong Nash.

50:57.020 --> 50:59.020
Strong Nash is borrowed

50:59.020 --> 51:01.020
from Nash Equilibrium.

51:01.020 --> 51:03.020
But in fact,

51:03.020 --> 51:05.020
this definition is easier

51:05.020 --> 51:07.020
to achieve than Maximine.

51:07.020 --> 51:09.020
Because the boss

51:09.020 --> 51:11.020
can do less

51:11.020 --> 51:13.020
and receive more restrictions.

51:19.020 --> 51:21.020
So,

51:21.020 --> 51:23.020
it's very easy

51:23.020 --> 51:25.020
to be fair

51:25.020 --> 51:27.020
under this definition.

51:27.020 --> 51:29.020
I don't know

51:29.020 --> 51:31.020
if the boss is a bad guy,

51:31.020 --> 51:33.020
or a good guy.

51:33.020 --> 51:35.020
As long as the two sides

51:35.020 --> 51:37.020
have different preferences,

51:37.020 --> 51:39.020
let them play

51:39.020 --> 51:41.020
what I said at the beginning.

51:41.020 --> 51:43.020
One side commits

51:43.020 --> 51:45.020
X,

51:45.020 --> 51:47.020
the other side

51:47.020 --> 51:49.020
decides a random Y,

51:49.020 --> 51:51.020
and the other side

51:51.020 --> 51:53.020
commits at the beginning,

51:53.020 --> 51:55.020
opens the envelope

51:55.020 --> 51:57.020
and decides what X1 and X2 are.

51:57.020 --> 51:59.020
Everyone

51:59.020 --> 52:01.020
listens to them.

52:01.020 --> 52:03.020
No matter how many people are there,

52:03.020 --> 52:05.020
10, 100, 1000,

52:05.020 --> 52:07.020
as long as two people

52:07.020 --> 52:09.020
are working.

52:09.020 --> 52:11.020
This thing

52:11.020 --> 52:13.020
is easy to prove.

52:13.020 --> 52:15.020
Just list all the conditions

52:15.020 --> 52:17.020
and it can be proved that

52:17.020 --> 52:19.020
this game rule

52:19.020 --> 52:21.020
can achieve

52:21.020 --> 52:23.020
Strong Nash.

52:23.020 --> 52:25.020
The boss can't

52:25.020 --> 52:27.020
increase

52:27.020 --> 52:29.020
the benefits of the boss.

52:37.020 --> 52:39.020
Let's go back to the first page.

52:41.020 --> 52:43.020
If you think about it,

52:43.020 --> 52:45.020
you will find

52:45.020 --> 52:47.020
these two definitions

52:47.020 --> 52:49.020
are exactly the same

52:49.020 --> 52:51.020
in 2Party.

52:51.020 --> 52:53.020
Because in 2Party,

52:53.020 --> 52:55.020
there are only two people.

52:55.020 --> 52:57.020
In 2Party,

52:57.020 --> 52:59.020
under this payoff,

52:59.020 --> 53:01.020
it is a completely zero-sum game.

53:01.020 --> 53:03.020
The situation of the two people

53:03.020 --> 53:05.020
is symmetrical.

53:05.020 --> 53:07.020
So the payoff of the bad guy

53:07.020 --> 53:09.020
is equal to

53:09.020 --> 53:11.020
the payoff of the good guy.

53:11.020 --> 53:13.020
This was established

53:13.020 --> 53:15.020
in Zero-sum.

53:15.020 --> 53:17.020
In the case of two people,

53:17.020 --> 53:19.020
there is only one bad guy

53:19.020 --> 53:21.020
and one good guy.

53:21.020 --> 53:23.020
So these two definitions are exactly the same.

53:23.020 --> 53:25.020
But in 3 or 4 people,

53:25.020 --> 53:27.020
or more people,

53:27.020 --> 53:29.020
these two definitions are completely different.

53:29.020 --> 53:31.020
One is

53:31.020 --> 53:33.020
almost impossible.

53:33.020 --> 53:35.020
The other is

53:35.020 --> 53:37.020
almost possible.

53:37.020 --> 53:39.020
This is a big difference.

53:43.020 --> 53:45.020
In addition to these two definitions,

53:45.020 --> 53:47.020
in my paper,

53:47.020 --> 53:49.020
I will consider

53:49.020 --> 53:51.020
other definitions.

53:51.020 --> 53:53.020
Maybe more natural, maybe more complicated,

53:53.020 --> 53:55.020
I don't know.

53:55.020 --> 53:57.020
The first one is

53:57.020 --> 53:59.020
the benefits of good people alone.

53:59.020 --> 54:01.020
In the case of Group,

54:01.020 --> 54:03.020
I don't consider the benefits alone.

54:03.020 --> 54:05.020
I consider the benefits of all good people

54:05.020 --> 54:07.020
to be added.

54:07.020 --> 54:09.020
The benefits of good people

54:09.020 --> 54:11.020
to be reduced

54:11.020 --> 54:13.020
or the benefits of bad people

54:13.020 --> 54:15.020
to be added.

54:15.020 --> 54:17.020
There may be different

54:17.020 --> 54:19.020
situations.

54:19.020 --> 54:21.020
For example,

54:21.020 --> 54:23.020
when the boss controls

54:23.020 --> 54:25.020
a group of bad guys,

54:25.020 --> 54:27.020
he may add all the benefits of the bad guys

54:27.020 --> 54:29.020
and divide them.

54:29.020 --> 54:31.020
This may be

54:31.020 --> 54:33.020
a suitable

54:33.020 --> 54:35.020
model for discussion.

54:35.020 --> 54:37.020
For example,

54:37.020 --> 54:39.020
the feasibility of these two

54:39.020 --> 54:41.020
is between Maximin

54:41.020 --> 54:43.020
and StrongNash.

54:43.020 --> 54:45.020
These four definitions

54:45.020 --> 54:47.020
are a bit complicated,

54:47.020 --> 54:49.020
so I won't talk about them all.

54:51.020 --> 54:53.020
Anyway,

54:53.020 --> 54:55.020
in the case of

54:55.020 --> 54:57.020
only two people,

54:57.020 --> 54:59.020
these definitions are equivalent.

54:59.020 --> 55:01.020
In the case of two people,

55:01.020 --> 55:03.020
the total is equal to the individual.

55:03.020 --> 55:05.020
In the case of zero-sum,

55:05.020 --> 55:07.020
the increase of bad people

55:07.020 --> 55:09.020
is equal to the decrease of good people.

55:09.020 --> 55:11.020
So these four definitions

55:11.020 --> 55:13.020
are the same

55:13.020 --> 55:15.020
in the case of two people.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.020
However,

55:17.020 --> 55:19.020
they are completely different

55:19.020 --> 55:21.020
in the case of more than three people.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.020
If you have learned

55:25.020 --> 55:27.020
or seen

55:27.020 --> 55:29.020
some game theory,

55:29.020 --> 55:31.020
you will

55:31.020 --> 55:33.020
immediately think of

55:33.020 --> 55:35.020
the question just asked by the host.

55:35.020 --> 55:37.020
There are

55:37.020 --> 55:39.020
various settings in game theory,

55:39.020 --> 55:41.020
such as the payoff function.

55:41.020 --> 55:43.020
Maybe the payoff function

55:43.020 --> 55:45.020
I just gave is not the most natural.

55:45.020 --> 55:47.020
In some cases,

55:47.020 --> 55:49.020
the payoff of zero-sum is more natural.

55:51.020 --> 55:53.020
Or in some cases,

55:53.020 --> 55:55.020
what kind of outcome

55:55.020 --> 55:57.020
does everyone like?

55:59.020 --> 56:01.020
What kind of outcome

56:01.020 --> 56:03.020
does everyone like?

56:03.020 --> 56:05.020
Where does Trump like to meet?

56:05.020 --> 56:07.020
Where does Xi like to meet?

56:07.020 --> 56:09.020
Maybe

56:09.020 --> 56:11.020
the payoff function

56:11.020 --> 56:13.020
is not the most natural.

56:13.020 --> 56:15.020
Maybe it's private.

56:15.020 --> 56:17.020
Everyone doesn't know.

56:17.020 --> 56:19.020
This is a more natural setting.

56:19.020 --> 56:21.020
In some cases,

56:21.020 --> 56:23.020
it may be like this.

56:23.020 --> 56:25.020
Of course,

56:25.020 --> 56:27.020
from the beginning to the end,

56:27.020 --> 56:29.020
I only talked about

56:29.020 --> 56:31.020
throwing a coin.

56:31.020 --> 56:33.020
Then this coin has only two sides,

56:33.020 --> 56:35.020
0 or 1.

56:35.020 --> 56:37.020
Then the coin becomes a dice.

56:37.020 --> 56:39.020
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

56:39.020 --> 56:41.020
Or I want to do something more complicated.

56:41.020 --> 56:43.020
For example,

56:43.020 --> 56:45.020
Trump and Xi want to

56:45.020 --> 56:47.020
add their salaries together.

56:47.020 --> 56:49.020
Something like this.

56:51.020 --> 56:53.020
These are all questions

56:53.020 --> 56:55.020
that can be discussed in depth.

56:57.020 --> 56:59.020
But there are a lot of questions

56:59.020 --> 57:01.020
that can be studied.

57:01.020 --> 57:03.020
This paper

57:03.020 --> 57:05.020
only discussed a small part of

57:05.020 --> 57:07.020
the blue ones.

57:07.020 --> 57:09.020
So this is

57:09.020 --> 57:11.020
the coin toss I talked about today.

57:11.020 --> 57:13.020
Thank you everyone

57:13.020 --> 57:15.020
for taking the time to listen to me.

57:15.020 --> 57:17.020
Thank you.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.020
Please turn on the microphone.

57:21.020 --> 57:23.020
Let's give a round of applause

57:23.020 --> 57:25.020
to our speaker today.

57:29.020 --> 57:31.020
Do you have any questions?

57:33.020 --> 57:35.020
No.

57:39.020 --> 57:41.020
Let me ask you a question.

57:41.020 --> 57:43.020
This question is not

57:43.020 --> 57:45.020
related to the content of the lecture.

57:45.020 --> 57:47.020
Did you publish this paper?

57:47.020 --> 57:49.020
Or did you throw it away?

57:49.020 --> 57:51.020
Do you want to

57:51.020 --> 57:53.020
write down the title of the paper

57:53.020 --> 57:55.020
and some other information

57:55.020 --> 57:57.020
that we can find,

57:57.020 --> 57:59.020
such as the date of the paper

57:59.020 --> 58:01.020
and so on.

58:01.020 --> 58:03.020
Then it will be recorded.

58:03.020 --> 58:05.020
If you are interested,

58:05.020 --> 58:07.020
you can look for it.

58:07.020 --> 58:09.020
How can I write it?

58:09.020 --> 58:11.020
I don't know.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.020
You can jump back to your PowerPoint.

58:13.020 --> 58:15.020
Okay.

58:15.020 --> 58:17.020
Just type it here.

58:17.020 --> 58:19.020
We can see it now.

58:19.020 --> 58:21.020
Wait for me.

58:21.020 --> 58:23.020
Text box.

58:23.020 --> 58:25.020
Okay.

58:25.020 --> 58:27.020
Now we are typing the text.

58:27.020 --> 58:29.020
Do you have any questions?

58:29.020 --> 58:31.020
Do you have any comments?

58:35.020 --> 58:37.020
You can ask some basic questions.

58:37.020 --> 58:39.020
For example,

58:39.020 --> 58:41.020
what do you study

58:41.020 --> 58:43.020
and so on.

58:45.020 --> 58:47.020
I have an interesting question.

58:47.020 --> 58:49.020
Of course,

58:49.020 --> 58:51.020
this is the most fundamental

58:51.020 --> 58:53.020
scenario.

58:53.020 --> 58:55.020
Then we can

58:55.020 --> 58:57.020
think about

58:57.020 --> 58:59.020
a special example.

58:59.020 --> 59:01.020
But now you...

59:01.020 --> 59:03.020
Let me think.

59:03.020 --> 59:05.020
So what you just said

59:05.020 --> 59:07.020
is basically

59:07.020 --> 59:09.020
your maximum

59:09.020 --> 59:11.020
and the two parties below

59:11.020 --> 59:13.020
are two extremes.

59:13.020 --> 59:15.020
They can be discussed.

59:15.020 --> 59:17.020
But those in the middle

59:17.020 --> 59:19.020
are in, for example,

59:19.020 --> 59:21.020
how many parties do bad people have?

59:21.020 --> 59:23.020
Are the interests of bad people

59:23.020 --> 59:25.020
completely the same?

59:25.020 --> 59:27.020
In these cases,

59:27.020 --> 59:29.020
your conclusion

59:29.020 --> 59:31.020
is related to

59:31.020 --> 59:33.020
N,

59:33.020 --> 59:35.020
how many good people and bad people

59:35.020 --> 59:37.020
are assigned to each other.

59:37.020 --> 59:39.020
What is the relationship between them?

59:39.020 --> 59:41.020
Will it affect your conclusion?

59:41.020 --> 59:43.020
Yes.

59:43.020 --> 59:45.020
I...

59:45.020 --> 59:47.020
I just posted

59:47.020 --> 59:49.020
the conference here.

59:49.020 --> 59:51.020
I will jump back to my PowerPoint.

59:51.020 --> 59:53.020
It is...

59:57.020 --> 59:59.020
In...

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.020
In Max and Min,

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:03.020
the simple case

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.020
is that

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.020
when greater than or equal to 3,

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.020
it is impossible.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.020
In the middle,

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.020
the group Max and Min

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.020
is the same as Max and Min,

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.020
greater than or equal to 3,

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.020
it is impossible.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.020
It is related to N.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.020
Three people can't do it,

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.020
or four people can't do it.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.020
In the middle,

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.020
no matter how many people can do it,

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.020
it is related to N.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.020
Does this answer the question?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.020
Yes.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.020
Actually, this is just the beginning of my question.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.020
I should say that

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.020
I also expect that

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.020
this thing is related to N,

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.020
and N will affect your conclusion.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.020
If this is the case,

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.020
it is closer to

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.020
the realistic situation.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.020
For example,

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.020
how do you study in computer science?

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.020
Do you calculate one by one?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.020
Or do you use

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.020
Monte Carlo

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.020
to use empirical methods

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.020
to conclude

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.020
some relationships,

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.020
such as the relationship with N,

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.020
or what is the solution

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.020
under some threshold,

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.020
what do you usually do?

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.020
So,

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.020
the question asked by the host

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.020
is more like

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.020
I have

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.020
a set of definitions

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.020
on the left,

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.020
a set of

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.020
maybe it is the sky,

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.020
maybe it is

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.020
some

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.020
realistic

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.020
problem motivator

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.020
definition,

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.020
a set of

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.020
motivator definitions,

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.020
how do I discuss

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.020
or

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.020
how do I discuss

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.020
the definition on the left

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.020
whether it can be done

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.020
or not,

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.020
especially

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.020
in this

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.020
current

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:07.020
talk discussion

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.020
it is

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.020
related to N,

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.020
and how

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:15.020
to say

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.020
how much can be done

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.020
and how much can't be done.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.020
In this

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.020
work,

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.020
there is

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.020
no good way.

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.020
In the middle,

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.020
every case

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.020
where N is greater than

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.020
how much can't be done,

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.020
is used

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.020
to

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.020
transform

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:43.020
to make another statement

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.020
N is greater than how much can't be done.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:47.020
For example,

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.020
at the beginning,

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.020
N is greater than 2,

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.020
the first result is

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.020
the lower bound of cleave.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.020
The following

01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.020
is to

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.020
extend

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.020
the first

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.020
cleave's

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.020
impossibility

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.020
to 3 and 4.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.020
In this example,

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.020
there is no good way.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.020
There may be

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.020
other examples,

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.020
but

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.020
these definitions

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.020
are

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.020
the definitions of

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.020
cleave.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.020
We

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.020
don't have

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.020
these continuous

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.020
or

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.020
continuous

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.020
or functional

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.020
mathematical tools

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.020
to use.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.020
For example,

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.020
I asked

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.020
if there is

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.020
Monte Carlo

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.020
or experiments

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.020
to prove

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.020
those

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.020
experimental

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.020
methods,

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.020
we usually

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.020
avoid them.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.020
Because

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.020
experimental methods

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.020
are difficult to prove.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.020
Even if there are

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.020
only 3 or 4 small numbers,

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.020
it is not possible

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:27.020
to prove.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.020
So,

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.020
we

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.020
rarely use them.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:35.020
Maybe

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.020
we don't know

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.020
how to use them

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.020
to prove them.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:43.020
Our

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:45.020
proof

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.020
is here.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.020
It is more

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.020
comprehensive.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:53.020
We calculate the probability.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.020
After that,

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.020
we use...

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.020
For example,

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.020
here,

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.020
we calculate the expectation

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.020
and the probability.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.020
Then, we use the average

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.020
to conclude

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.020
whether it is possible or not.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.020
I see.

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.020
Thank you.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.020
Do you have any questions?

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.020
Hello.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.020
I have a question.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.020
Please go ahead.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.020
I still don't understand.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020
Can you

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.020
explain

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.020
how to

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:41.020
reduce

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.020
3 to 3?

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.020
How to reduce

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.020
almost

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.020
and malicious

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.020
to 3?

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.020
This

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.020
is a good question.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.020
It is very simple.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.020
Let's assume

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.020
n is equal to 4.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.020
If n is equal to 4,

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.020
in this line,

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.020
unanimous

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.020
is the same.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.020
Almost is one less.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.020
Only one less.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.020
If n is equal to 4,

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.020
it is...

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.020
I just type it.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.020
It is 0, 1,

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.020
1, 1.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.020
It is 0, 1, 1.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.020
Of course,

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.020
it is symmetric.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.020
0 may be in one person.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.020
We don't know.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.020
We don't care.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.020
It is 0, 1, 1.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:41.020
Then,

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.020
you have to ask

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.020
whether

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.020
there is a rule

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.020
that allows 4 people

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.020
to protect

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.020
the interests of honest people.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.020
Let's assume

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.020
there is a rule

01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.020
that allows

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.020
4 people

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.020
to protect

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.020
the interests of honest people.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.020
What do we do?

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.020
We do

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.020
that

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.020
I don't care

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.020
whether 1, 1, 1, 1 is a good person or a bad person.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.020
I tie

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.020
the two people

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.020
who like 1 together.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.020
It is

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.020
a person.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.020
It is

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.020
a fatter person.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.020
They all like 1.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.020
The fatter person

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.020
likes 1.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.020
If

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.020
there is a rule that allows

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.020
4 people to protect

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:43.020
the interests of honest people,

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.020
I tie

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:47.020
the two people who like 1 together.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.020
Then,

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.020
they

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.020
play according to the rules of 4 people.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.020
I don't care

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.020
whether it is a good person or a bad person.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.020
After

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.020
I tie

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.020
the two people together,

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.020
there are only 3 people left.

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.020
Their preferences

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:09.020
are 0, 1, 1.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.020
Their preferences are 1.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.020
So, I tie

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.020
their preferences to 1.

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.020
If

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.020
there is a rule that allows

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:23.020
4 people to protect the interests of honest people,

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.020
it is a rule

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.020
that allows 3 people

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.020
to protect the interests of honest people.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.020
Okay.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.020
Okay.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.020
It feels like a math problem.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.020
Yes.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.020
It's what we often do.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.020
We don't have a good tool.

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.020
Is it the same

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.020
for other preferences?

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.020
Do you tie all 0s

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.020
and 1s together?

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.020
This question

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.020
is a good question.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.020
We tie

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.020
0s and 1s together.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.020
Then, we tie

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.020
other 0s and 1s together.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.020
Why do we tie like this?

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.020
It's because

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.020
Cliff's result said

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.020
that

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.020
when you play

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.020
with two parties,

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.020
you must have a way

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.020
to make them leave

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.020
0.5.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.020
I don't know

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.020
if it's from 0.5 to 1

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.020
or from 0.5 to 0.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.020
But there must be one side.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.020
I don't know which side it is.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.020
He didn't tell you.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.020
But after

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.020
tying 0s and 1s together,

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.020
if it's one side,

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.020
in my definition of

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020
maximum,

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.020
it will definitely hurt

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.020
one of the 0s and 1s.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.020
Because 0s and 1s are tied together.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.020
Okay.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.020
It doesn't matter which side it is.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.020
So,

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.020
I can get

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.020
a contradiction like this.

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.020
Okay.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:01.020
It's amazing.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:03.020
The thing is that

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.020
you can go down

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.020
a few pages.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.020
I don't remember.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.020
Go down again.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.020
This is also right.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.020
The method of

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.020
strong Nash equilibrium

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.020
is that you call a 0 and

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.020
a 1 out.

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:23.020
Then they are tied together.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.020
The reason why this method

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.020
can't be used in Max and Min

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.020
is that you may choose

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.020
0 and 1.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.020
One of them is a bad guy.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.020
I'll cut it here.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.020
I sent two representatives

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.020
to point at the board.

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.020
Why this thing

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.020
doesn't work

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.020
in Max and Min?

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.020
The question is like this.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.020
The definition of Max and Min

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.020
is that

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.020
the benefits of good people

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.020
can't be harmed.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.020
So,

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.020
in the definition of Max and Min,

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.020
the bad guy doesn't care

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.020
about his own benefits.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020
The bad guy

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.020
can lose money.

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.020
But the good guy

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.020
just wants to harm the good guy maliciously.

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.020
For example,

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:25.020
the red one is the bad guy

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.020
and the green one is the good guy.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.020
Can you tell the difference?

01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:31.020
The red one is the bad guy

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.020
and the green one is the good guy.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.020
I can tell at the beginning.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.020
Sometimes the color is not enough.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.020
Because some people

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.020
have color blindness.

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.020
There are three bad guys

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.020
and two good guys.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.020
If the bad guy just wants to harm

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.020
the good guy maliciously,

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.020
he can point to the bad guy

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.020
and the good guy will like him.

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.020
Then he will be harmed.

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.020
He doesn't care.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.020
The good guy is happy.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.020
But as long as the good guy is not happy,

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.020
Max and Min won't work.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.020
So, this thing

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:15.020
doesn't work in Max and Min.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.020
Does it have anything to do with

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.020
the question

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.020
the host asked at the beginning?

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.020
Do I consider

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.020
all the benefits of the good guy

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.020
or the benefits of the good guy

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.020
individually?

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.020
My strictest condition

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.020
is that I can't harm

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.020
every benefit of the good guy.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:37.020
So, Max and Min

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.020
can't harm every good guy.

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.020
Yes.

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:47.020
This is a difficult question.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.020
The definition

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.020
is tricky.

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.020
There will be a lot of groups

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.020
after the number of people.

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.020
I have a question

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.020
that is unrelated.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.020
If

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.020
there is

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.020
something

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.020
that is completely random

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.020
and everyone agrees that it is random.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.020
For example,

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.020
there is a quantum stack.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.020
For example, the radiation of the sun.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.020
This is also possible.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.020
But you have to observe

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.020
the same thing in two places.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.020
Yes.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:27.020
There is

01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:29.020
something called quantum entanglement.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.020
Do you know this?

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.020
I know.

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.020
There are two examples.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.020
For example,

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.020
they have to spin up together

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.020
and spin down together.

01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.020
I assign these two

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:47.020
to two people

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.020
who are far away.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.020
They observe this example.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.020
Spin up

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.020
means one place.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.020
Spin down means another place.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.020
In this way,

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.020
can we solve this problem?

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.020
We don't need these protocols.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.020
There will be

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.020
some ways

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.020
that you can operate.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.020
Actually,

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.020
I know entanglement,

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.020
but I'm not familiar

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.020
with how to do it.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.020
For example,

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.020
you mentioned that

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.020
you have to create two examples

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:25.020
that have entanglement.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.020
I'm not

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.020
familiar with it.

01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.020
Can we

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.020
do this entanglement

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.020
in advance

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.020
and

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.020
bias to

01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.020
one side?

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:43.020
I'm not sure.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.020
Maybe.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.020
It seems that

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.020
we need some proof

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.020
to prove that

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.020
the entanglement

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.020
we created at the beginning

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.020
is fair.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:59.020
I really don't know.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.020
I just heard it.

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.020
After creating the entanglement,

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.020
you have to give

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.020
these two entanglement to two people.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.020
In this

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.020
long-distance definition,

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.020
it may not be

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.020
very suitable.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.020
I don't know if there is a better explanation

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.020
that it can't be done.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.020
But you have to

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.020
give two bits

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020
to two people,

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.020
or give two examples to two people.

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.020
Actually,

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:33.020
it doesn't

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.020
go well with this

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.020
definition.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:39.020
Why don't I

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.020
create an entanglement

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:43.020
and give the result to two people?

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:45.020
OK.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.020
It makes sense.

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.020
It doesn't seem that

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.020
it can be solved.

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.020
But I think

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.020
there is room for discussion.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.020
Because some

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.020
can prove

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.020
that the entanglement

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.020
is fair.

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.020
Another thing

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.020
I want to ask is

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.020
at the beginning,

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.020
what I said

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.020
is that

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.020
1, 2, 3,

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.020
everyone says a number at the same time,

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.020
and then X, O, 2.

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:21.020
Why can't

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:23.020
everyone

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.020
say X, O, 2

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.020
at the same time

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.020
and then

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.020
say the number?

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.020
If it's

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:35.020
more than 12 o'clock,

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.020
you lose.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.020
It's the same with fail-stop.

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.020
Fail-stop means

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:43.020
if you are slow,

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.020
you lose.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.020
Yes, but

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.020
I think

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:51.020
at the same time,

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.020
it's difficult in practice.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.020
One is in China,

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.020
the other is in the U.S.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.020
The distance is

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.020
quite far.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.020
The transmission message

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.020
may also have a delay

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.020
of 0.0 seconds.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.020
0.0 seconds

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.020
plus

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.020
on the food,

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:15.020
if the light

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.020
is directly

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.020
connected,

01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.020
it may be OK.

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.020
But the network on the food

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.020
has passed many host

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.020
and the delay

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.020
may be almost 1 second.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.020
You can't be sure

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.020
how much time is there.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.020
59 minutes and 59 seconds.

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.020
Is 1 second enough?

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.020
Or

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:41.020
too much

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.020
will be a bit slow.

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.020
It's hard to decide.

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.020
At the same time,

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.020
this is mainly

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.020
difficult to do on the food.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.020
So people think

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.020
if you can't do it

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.020
or you can't prove it,

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.020
you give up.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.020
Failstuff

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:07.020
also requires a time.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.020
Yes, failstuff

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.020
is...

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.020
Yes, failstuff is...

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.020
Let me put it this way.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.020
At the same time,

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.020
the rules are tight.

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:21.020
At the same time,

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.020
after my message

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.020
is sent out,

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.020
it takes at least

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.020
1 second to send it.

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.020
It may not work if I arrive early.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.020
Because if I arrive early,

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.020
there will be a relatively slow output.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.020
It won't work if I arrive late.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.020
Is it slow output

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.020
or is it

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.020
slow? I don't know.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.020
But failstuff

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.020
has a relatively large

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.020
range.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:53.020
I can

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.020
arrive in 0 seconds

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:57.020
or 10 minutes.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.020
So the range is relatively large.

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:03.020
If I can't wait for you for 10 minutes

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.020
and you haven't sent it out,

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.020
it's just

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.020
1 second

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.020
or 1 minute

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:13.020
to send it out.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.020
So the

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.020
condition is

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.020
strictly

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.020
weak.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.020
Very interesting talk. Thank you.

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.020
Thank you.

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:31.020
Actually,

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.020
it's been more than 10 minutes.

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:35.020
Please turn on

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.020
the microphone again.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:39.020
Thank you to our speaker, Weikai.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.020
Thank you, everyone.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.020

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.020
It's on the right side of our website.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.020

Weikai or Weikai's paper.

01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.020
You can also see this information.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.020
If you are interested in his paper,

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:03.020
he just wrote

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:05.020
on our

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.020

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.020
and discuss more.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:21.020
Thank you again.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.020
Thank you for attending today's Terra Talk.

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:25.020
That's all for today.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.020
Thank you, everyone. Bye.
