00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am the host for this week, Lin Yu-Wei.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am very happy to invite our speaker today, Zhou Zhijie.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at NTU,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and is currently a doctor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Lincoln.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Under the guidance of Professor Dai Yu-Chang,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
he has been conducting research on wearable devices and biomimics for medical purposes.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Zhijie and his speech today.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now let's give the microphone to our speaker today, Zhijie.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, for the introduction.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello, everyone. I am Zhou Zhijie.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Without further ado, let's get to the topic.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
First of all, I would like to introduce to you

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
why wearable devices have become a hot topic in recent years.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Basically, it can be divided into several aspects.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The first is the concept of non-invasive.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The concept of non-invasive means that the device does not need to enter our body.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You may have been to the hospital for injections or blood draws.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Once something enters your body, the first reaction is pain.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In addition to the pain, the immune system will also react to foreign bodies.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For example, some white blood cells or other immune cells will attack foreign objects.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Basically, it will cause a lot of inflammation, swelling, pain, and heat.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Therefore, wearable devices basically avoid such risks.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Many technology giants like Apple and Fitbit

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
want to study non-invasive devices first

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and see where their limits can be pushed.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then they will consider the so-called minimally invasive devices.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In fact, there is a huge barrier between non-invasive and minimally invasive.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Whether it is from the perspective of devices or from the perspective of government agencies like the FDA,

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the biggest barrier is still entering the body.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Once you enter the body, there is a lot of risk.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Stay outside the body is a very low-risk device.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Basically, wearable devices have become so popular recently.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Next is the so-called big clinical data.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I believe everyone has heard of big clinical data.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The meaning of big clinical data is that this device can provide some diagnostic information.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This diagnosis is also a bit tricky.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How can we determine the value of the diagnosis?

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What metrics are really useful?

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The third part is the so-called Autonomous Sensing.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Autonomous Sensing is not as complicated as you think.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just put the wearable device on your body and it will automatically start to measure.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then you don't need to intervene.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then it can continuously send this data out in a wireless way.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The advantage is that even if you are not conscious, for example, when you are sleeping,

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
this device can still continue to measure and send the data out.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So it can let us see some things that we couldn't see before.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For example, when you are sleeping, it can help you measure the cycle of sleep,

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or the heartbeat when you are resting, and so on.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The fourth aspect is that it is very easy to compare with portable devices,

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
such as mobile phones, smartphones, or even tablets.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Basically, these portable devices can be used as a relay station.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can imagine that your wearable sensor is a bit like a place to send signals.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then store these signals in the portable device.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Basically, the computing power of these portable devices is relatively strong,

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and the bandwidth to upload data is relatively high.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
On the one hand, it can be used as a relay station, and on the other hand,

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
it can be used as a place to send signals.

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There are a lot of benefits that you can think about.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Next, I will talk about the logic of why we want to use wearable devices

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to monitor the health of our body.

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is a study in Stanford,

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
which is called digital health.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It is a comparison of regular visits to the hospital

68
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and digital health.

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The so-called digital health is actually

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
collecting all the data that should be collected at the hospital,

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
digitizing it,

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and then processing these digitized data.

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This study is actually very simple.

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There are only two main variables.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
One is to measure the skin temperature,

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and the other is to measure the heart rate.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If I put the sensor on the patient

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
for a long time,

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the patient will inevitably get sick.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
when the patient is sick

82
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
are basically the same.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
are basically the same.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
are basically the same.

87
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
are basically the same.

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
are basically the same.

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
are basically the same.

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
are basically the same.

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
are basically the same.

97
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
are basically the same.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The heart rate and skin temperature

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
are basically the same.

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The wearable sensor has some information in it.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
How do we get this information out?

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How do we get this information out?

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How do we get this information out?

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We have big clinical data.

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It takes about 24 hours to get this data.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It takes about 24 hours to get this data.

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It can be useful when you sleep.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It can be useful when you sleep.

110
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It can be useful when you sleep.

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Heart rate...

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Heart rate...

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Heart rate...

114
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Heart rate...

115
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's basically when you wake up.

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Can you tell if a person is healthy or sick?

117
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's from the data we get from these sensors.

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
For example, a disease has a certain distribution in the data space of this sensor.

119
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So this is a very interesting question.

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Before wearable devices appeared,

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
it was basically completely blank.

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The information we can get in Sleep is very limited.

123
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
However,

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
there are some privileges at this stage of sleep.

125
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
For example, when you sleep, your body basically doesn't move.

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's great for sensors.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Because you have less noise in your daily life.

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
For example, your motion noise.

129
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Or when you do other things during the day, your heart rate suddenly changes.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But when you sleep, it doesn't.

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Some wearable sensors are already measuring

132
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
heart rate during rest and sleep.

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll show you some data later.

134
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Location

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It mainly depends on where our sensors can be placed in the body.

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is a research done by Georgia Tech.

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It looks at how the motion impedance is affected

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
when your sensors are placed in various parts of the body.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The motion impedance is when your sensors are placed in a specific body location.

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What impact does it have on your activity?

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
On the left is the male, on the right is the female.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can see that the range is a little different.

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You can see where our wearable devices are often placed.

144
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
For example, the bowl.

145
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's a good place to put it.

146
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is another metric.

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It tells us

148
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
what sensor is most suitable for measuring

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
when it is placed in a specific location.

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For example,

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the red bar

152
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
is used to measure whole body motion.

153
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It measures the movement of the whole body.

154
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You can imagine that your limbs are often moving.

155
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But if you want to track the center of the body,

156
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the red bar is used to measure the center of the body.

157
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
For example, the joint stretch

158
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is measured by the elbow and the knee joint.

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The last one is

160
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
where the sensor is placed.

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is interesting.

162
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You can compare it with the two pictures.

163
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
For example, many devices are placed in the wrist

164
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
or ankle.

165
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Next, I will talk about

166
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
the future of wearable devices.

167
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The trend is like this.

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
From the era of personal computers,

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the market trend is to reduce the size of the computer.

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
From personal computers to portable devices,

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to wearable devices.

172
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The so-called computing unit

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
is getting closer to the body.

174
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The advantage is that you don't need much delay

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to make computing.

176
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is the size of the market of wearable devices.

177
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is the size of the market of wearable devices.

178
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is the size of the market of wearable devices.
