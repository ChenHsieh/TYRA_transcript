0	14000	I am today's host, I am Hong Shaoming, I am now working in California as a postdoctoral researcher.
14000	18000	Without further ado, let's introduce today's speaker, Dr. Wei Qunshu.
18000	24000	Dr. Qunshu graduated from the College of Electrical Engineering, and stayed in California to study electrical engineering.
24000	31000	After graduating, he went to UCSD to study biotechnology, and his professor is Professor Zong Ziping.
31000	40000	He is mainly interested in using the perspective of engineering to use brain-to-brain meetings to study human behavior.
40000	53000	Over the past few years, he has published nearly 10 conference papers and two journal papers.
53000	56000	Without further ado, let's listen to his presentation.
56000	62000	The title is Towards Real-World Awareness Estimation Using Brain-Computer Interface.
62000	65000	Let's welcome him.
65000	69000	Thank you Shaoming for the introduction.
69000	85000	Today, I will introduce how we measure brain activity and monitor our alertness using a brain-computer interface.
86000	91000	If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt.
91000	97000	We can easily have a discussion.
97000	102000	First, I will briefly introduce the brain.
102000	109000	Our brain is a tube of about 3 pounds, about 1,000 grams.
109000	118000	The outermost part of the brain has many folds.
118000	125000	These folds are composed of many neurons in the brain.
125000	130000	There are about 8.6 billion neurons.
131000	138000	We know that the brain has very strong computing power.
138000	144000	However, compared to our most powerful computers, its performance is very good.
144000	157000	In terms of energy consumption, it is 100,000 times more efficient than a normal CPU.
157000	163000	Therefore, the brain can only operate at 12 to 25 watts.
163000	168000	This wattage is equivalent to the wattage of a light bulb.
168000	178000	So you can imagine that in some comics, when the character thinks of a point, he will draw a light bulb.
178000	181000	It's actually pretty close.
181000	186000	Because the brain's power consumption is the power of a light bulb.
186000	194000	The structure of the neural network is composed of cells.
194000	196000	There are many vectors.
196000	202000	The vector part collects information from other neural networks around it.
202000	207000	After the information is compiled into the neural network, it will decide whether to power up.
207000	210000	If you want to power up, you can use the axis.
210000	214000	Then you can power up to other neural networks.
214000	221000	In this way, complex networks can be used to control the whole person.
221000	225000	Here is a brain signal that I use more often.
225000	227000	It's called a brain wave.
227000	229000	It's EEG.
229000	233000	Many people have been exposed to EEG.
233000	243000	Especially when a newborn is born, we often do a brain test to see if his vision or hearing is normal.
243000	245000	How does EEG occur?
245000	251000	There are many neural networks in our brain.
251000	253000	Especially the skin.
253000	256000	Many neural networks are arranged.
256000	258000	There are some rules in the structure.
259000	268000	The arrangement of the rules allows the neural network to have an additional effect when it is powering up.
268000	279000	The change in the electrical field can be so great that you can feel the change in the electrical field outside the scalp.
279000	285000	The change in the electrical field becomes our brain wave signal after some processing.
286000	289000	If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt me.
291000	295000	Our brain wave signal is...
295000	297000	I have a question.
297000	299000	There is a line below.
299000	302000	BlueJeans meeting is sharing your screen with bluejeans.com.
302000	305000	You have to press the hide button.
305000	306000	Oh, okay.
306000	307000	Or you can block it a little bit.
307000	308000	I'm sorry.
308000	309000	You can continue.
309000	311000	Thank you.
312000	313000	Okay.
313000	315000	Let's continue.
315000	320000	This is the brain wave signal.
320000	325000	It is a real-time signal.
325000	329000	You can see that it is like a time series.
329000	331000	It is a time series.
331000	341000	In order to measure the whole brain, we will try to arrange electrical fields outside the scalp.
341000	347000	So we will have a lot of brain waves on both sides at the same time.
347000	356000	We will analyze the energy of brain waves in terms of frequency.
356000	364000	The frequency depends on whether the signal is fast or slow.
364000	368000	The high frequency is the fast part.
368000	370000	The low frequency is the slow part.
370000	374000	So we will divide delta.
374000	378000	It is a low frequency activity of less than 3.5 Hz.
378000	382000	It is a very slow vibration.
382000	390000	If you go higher, it will be divided into theta wave, alpha wave, or beta wave.
390000	394000	The higher the frequency, the faster the vibration.
394000	398000	Our brain can be divided into different bands.
398000	404000	By observing the energy of the band, we can get a lot of information.
405000	411000	Let me introduce the location of the channel of the brain.
411000	415000	It has a standard way of dividing.
415000	424000	The name of the channel is divided into points.
424000	428000	Frontal is the channel at the beginning of F.
428000	432000	Central is the channel at the beginning of C.
432000	436000	Central parietal is the channel at the beginning of O.
436000	442000	Occipital is the channel at the beginning of O.
442000	448000	We can do this frequency analysis for each channel.
448000	454000	We can combine the change of time with the change of frequency.
454000	460000	We can see the energy of different bands over time.
460000	467000	This can tell us a lot of information about the state of this person.
467000	473000	We can design experiments to see if the brain changes.
473000	479000	We can find some characteristics in different states.
479000	483000	Reflect the brain in different states.
484000	492000	The brain interface is where we read the signals of the brain.
492000	498000	Then we go through some signal processing, including frequency analysis.
498000	505000	Or you can use a lot of other different signal processing methods to get different characteristics.
506000	515000	Then we use the processed signals to make it recognizable.
515000	518000	Then we can convert it into some commands to control.
518000	524000	For example, a mechanical arm or a wheel or a mouse cursor.
524000	528000	Or to input text or some messages.
529000	533000	We call this the brain computer interface.
533000	535000	In short, it's BCI.
537000	539000	What can BCI do?
539000	541000	As I just said, it can convert into commands.
541000	548000	So when we play video games, we can use it to control the movement of your character.
548000	552000	Of course, including the wheel and the mechanical arm.
552000	557000	Of course, it can also be used to monitor a person's cognitive state.
557000	559000	Including whether you want to sleep.
559000	564000	This extends to my main area of expertise.
564000	567000	Monitoring the level of awareness.
571000	577000	The level of awareness is related to drowsy driving.
577000	581000	A lot of people fall asleep while driving.
581000	589000	This news happened on July 18th.
589000	593000	It was only recently that a drowsy driving incident occurred.
593000	595000	So it's not a big deal.
595000	597000	It's not a big deal.
597000	599000	It's not a big deal.
599000	601000	It's not a big deal.
601000	603000	It's not a big deal.
603000	605000	It's not a big deal.
605000	607000	It's not a big deal.
607000	609000	It's not a big deal.

659000	661000	So he can't hear the headphones, can he?
661000	663000	I didn't hear it.
663000	666000	Oh, no.
666000	668000	Let's see.
668000	670000	I can't.
670000	672000	Can you play it on your computer?
672000	674000	Okay.
676000	678000	Can you hear me?
678000	680000	Yes.
680000	682000	Can you hear me?
682000	684000	Yes.
686000	688000	Can you hear me?
692000	694000	Yes.
694000	696000	I can hear you.
696000	698000	Can you hear me?
698000	700000	Yes.
726000	728000	Max.
728000	730000	And then after 11 hours a day, we have to shut down
730000	732000	and have 10 hours of sleep.
732000	734000	Truck drivers are also required to take a 30-minute break
734000	736000	during their first 8 hours of driving.
736000	738000	All of this needs to be recorded
738000	740000	in logs like these,
740000	742000	which are now mostly computerized.
742000	744000	We now have to carry electronic recording devices
744000	746000	on our vehicles.
746000	748000	Rio says his students learn to make driving plans
748000	750000	to avoid getting fatigued,
750000	752000	and they're encouraged to stop to power nap
752000	754000	or just stretch their legs.
754000	756000	It gives you more stamina.
756000	758000	You're more alert, because when you're not alert,
758000	760000	you know, you can't make good decisions.
760000	762000	And that's what truckers like Rudy live by.
762000	764000	I start closing, you've got to pull over
764000	766000	and take a nap.
766000	768000	GoMana, eight news now.
768000	770000	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
770000	772000	says drowsy driving
772000	774000	causes up to 1.2 million crashes
774000	776000	every year in this country,
776000	778000	and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.
778000	780000	That's nearly twice as many
780000	782000	as distracted driving.
784000	786000	Okay.
788000	790000	So,
790000	792000	this is a recent
792000	794000	drowsy driving incident.
794000	796000	As you saw in the video,
796000	798000	a truck hit
798000	800000	a construction vehicle
800000	802000	and
802000	804000	caused
804000	806000	two deaths and three injuries.
806000	808000	Drowsy driving can cause
808000	810000	up to 1.2 million
810000	812000	crashes every year,
812000	814000	and it kills
814000	816000	between 5,000 and 8,000 people.
816000	818000	So if we can avoid
818000	820000	drowsy driving,
820000	822000	if we can effectively monitor
822000	824000	drowsy driving
824000	826000	and manage it,
826000	828000	maybe we can avoid
828000	830000	the death and injury
830000	832000	caused by this.
832000	834000	And then,
834000	836000	in the news,
836000	838000	it was mentioned that
838000	840000	if you find your eyes
840000	842000	blind,
842000	844000	you should stop driving.
844000	846000	But I also discussed with
846000	848000	Shaoming last time
848000	850000	whether to use
850000	852000	eye or blink
852000	854000	to do
854000	856000	this alertness monitoring.
856000	858000	But there is a question
858000	860000	that is,
860000	862000	is there a way to
862000	864000	catch it
864000	866000	before it closes
866000	868000	its eyes
868000	870000	and put it in the car?
870000	872000	This part may want to
872000	874000	use brainwaves to
874000	876000	break through this problem.
878000	880000	If we use
880000	882000	the brain interface to do
882000	884000	this alertness monitoring,
884000	886000	we will first
886000	888000	measure its brainwaves
888000	890000	from the driver.
890000	892000	After we get this EEG signal,
892000	894000	after some processing,
894000	896000	we use machine learning
896000	898000	to build a model
898000	900000	that can turn the EEG
900000	902000	data into
902000	904000	alertness.
904000	906000	After we know its alertness,
906000	908000	we can try to
908000	910000	give it some feedback.
910000	912000	For example, we can wake it up,
912000	914000	or we can
914000	916000	let the car
916000	918000	stop driving
918000	920000	and stop by the road,
920000	922000	or force it to rest.
922000	924000	There are some ways to intervene.
926000	928000	My research is
928000	930000	mainly about
930000	932000	how we deal with this signal,
932000	934000	how we build a
934000	936000	machine learning model,
936000	938000	and how we can
938000	940000	monitor the alertness
940000	942000	very well.
942000	944000	Then we can
944000	946000	accurately determine
946000	948000	whether to make some interference.
948000	950000	I have a question.
950000	952000	I want to
952000	954000	clarify a little bit.
954000	956000	Do you mean
956000	958000	that your research is
958000	960000	a state of
960000	962000	mental relaxation
962000	964000	or a state of real sleep?
964000	966000	It's a state of
966000	968000	waking up
968000	970000	to almost falling asleep
970000	972000	before you really
972000	974000	fall asleep.
974000	976000	I didn't study
976000	978000	the state of the brain
978000	980000	after falling asleep,
980000	982000	because I want to catch
982000	984000	it before I fall asleep.
984000	986000	In fact,
986000	988000	I have
988000	990000	driving experience,
990000	992000	and I know
992000	994000	that my eyes were open at that time,
994000	996000	but the image
996000	998000	was already
998000	1000000	blurred and black,
1000000	1002000	and I was not looking at the road.
1002000	1004000	I was a little out of my mind,
1004000	1006000	and then I suddenly woke up,
1006000	1008000	and I felt a little
1008000	1010000	shaky.
1010000	1012000	So you have to catch
1012000	1014000	the time point
1014000	1016000	before you fall asleep.
1016000	1018000	It depends on
1018000	1020000	when you can't support
1020000	1022000	the alertness.
1022000	1024000	I have another question.
1024000	1026000	You are now
1026000	1028000	identifying a signal,
1028000	1030000	and you think
1030000	1032000	this signal is
1032000	1034000	the state you are talking about.
1034000	1036000	Do you have a contrast group?
1036000	1038000	For example, you track his eyes,
1038000	1040000	and then I define
1040000	1042000	the behavior of the eyes,
1042000	1044000	which is to fall asleep.
1044000	1046000	Then I look for
1046000	1048000	a corresponding brain wave,
1048000	1050000	or I ask the subject to write
1050000	1052000	that I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.
1052000	1054000	What is your calibration?
1054000	1056000	This question is very good.
1056000	1058000	How do we define
1058000	1060000	the so-called alertness?
1060000	1062000	I'm going to talk about it next.
1062000	1064000	Because we think
1064000	1066000	alertness is related to your reaction time.
1066000	1068000	So we use
1068000	1070000	reaction time to
1070000	1072000	give us an objective
1072000	1074000	measurement method.
1074000	1076000	Just like you said,
1076000	1078000	using the eyes or
1078000	1080000	the way the subject responds.
1080000	1082000	The part of the eyes
1082000	1084000	is that the activity of the eyes
1084000	1086000	is also a physiological signal.
1086000	1088000	So whether he can react directly
1088000	1090000	to this behavior
1090000	1092000	is another experiment.
1092000	1094000	His role and brain wave
1094000	1096000	are the same.
1096000	1098000	It just depends on which physiological signal
1098000	1100000	makes it easier for us
1100000	1102000	to be more accurate
1102000	1104000	to determine
1104000	1106000	whether it is
1106000	1108000	alert or not.
1110000	1112000	Subject report
1112000	1114000	is an objective determination.
1114000	1116000	The subjective determination
1116000	1118000	will have some
1118000	1120000	deviation.
1120000	1122000	That is, the word
1122000	1124000	reported by the subject
1124000	1126000	cannot express
1126000	1128000	the state he just experienced
1128000	1130000	very objectively.
1130000	1132000	Many researchers
1132000	1134000	think that the more objective
1134000	1136000	determination method is to look at
1136000	1138000	his reaction time.
1138000	1140000	Next,
1140000	1142000	I will talk about how we
1142000	1144000	measure brain waves and
1144000	1146000	his reaction time.
1146000	1148000	Finally, I will talk about
1148000	1150000	how to define
1150000	1152000	alertness.
1154000	1156000	Does this answer your question?
1158000	1160000	Yes, thank you.
1160000	1162000	Thank you.
1162000	1164000	I will talk about
1164000	1166000	the experiment we did
1166000	1168000	and how to get the data we want.
1168000	1170000	We put the subject
1170000	1172000	in a simulated
1172000	1174000	driving car.
1174000	1176000	The car has a
1176000	1178000	circular projection screen.
1178000	1180000	The car is
1180000	1182000	on a dynamic platform,
1182000	1184000	so driving in it
1184000	1186000	is to simulate
1186000	1188000	the real driving situation as much as possible.
1188000	1190000	This is a device
1190000	1192000	in the brain center
1192000	1194000	of the University of Transportation
1194000	1196000	.
1200000	1202000	In this experiment,
1202000	1204000	we are doing
1204000	1206000	road maintenance
1206000	1208000	tasks.
1208000	1210000	Road maintenance
1210000	1212000	means that the subject
1212000	1214000	must maintain the car
1214000	1216000	on the road.
1216000	1218000	We will
1218000	1220000	automatically make the car
1220000	1222000	lean, forcing
1222000	1224000	the subject to
1224000	1226000	adjust the direction of
1226000	1228000	his car from time to time.
1228000	1230000	The scene is
1230000	1232000	on a straight
1232000	1234000	highway,
1234000	1236000	but the car
1236000	1238000	will tilt to the left
1238000	1240000	or to the right.
1240000	1242000	The car will tilt once every 6-10 seconds.
1242000	1244000	The subject
1244000	1246000	will feel that the car is
1246000	1248000	tilted,
1248000	1250000	move the steering wheel
1250000	1252000	to guide the car.
1252000	1254000	We will see
1254000	1256000	when the car
1256000	1258000	moves the steering wheel
1258000	1260000	after it is tilted.
1260000	1262000	This is the reaction time.
1262000	1264000	Every 6-10 seconds,
1264000	1266000	we can measure the reaction time.
1266000	1268000	In the end, we hope
1268000	1270000	to predict the
1270000	1272000	reaction time
1272000	1274000	after the
1274000	1276000	brain wave
1276000	1278000	before the tilt.
1280000	1282000	This is the
1282000	1284000	role of prediction.
1286000	1288000	Next, I will talk about
1288000	1290000	how to deal with
1290000	1292000	the prediction of
1292000	1294000	the alertness.
1296000	1298000	Every 6-10 seconds,
1298000	1300000	we will have a response time
1300000	1302000	sample.
1306000	1308000	On the y-axis,
1308000	1310000	I draw the reaction time.
1310000	1312000	I go to log.
1312000	1314000	On the horizontal axis,
1314000	1316000	I draw the time.
1316000	1318000	The unit is divided.
1318000	1320000	This is the length
1320000	1322000	of the whole experiment.
1322000	1324000	The length of the experiment
1324000	1326000	is not certain.
1326000	1328000	This is shorter,
1328000	1330000	it is only 45 minutes.
1330000	1332000	Most experiments
1332000	1334000	take more than an hour.
1334000	1336000	About an hour and a half.
1340000	1342000	Sometimes we will
1342000	1344000	ask the same subject to
1344000	1346000	come back and do it.
1346000	1348000	Let me see.
1350000	1352000	We finally collected more than 30 subjects.
1352000	1354000	There are
1354000	1356000	5, 6, 10
1356000	1358000	driving
1358000	1360000	experiment data.
1362000	1364000	Let's talk about
1364000	1366000	each point.
1366000	1368000	It's the RT we just measured.
1368000	1370000	10 to the power of 0 is about 1 second.
1370000	1372000	When he wakes up,
1372000	1374000	he can get the car back
1374000	1376000	to normal.
1376000	1378000	After a while,
1378000	1380000	his condition is not good.
1380000	1382000	After his alertness began to decline,
1382000	1384000	we will see some longer
1384000	1386000	response time.
1386000	1388000	In fact, the reaction is that
1388000	1390000	his alertness becomes worse.
1390000	1392000	We have to deal with
1392000	1394000	this RT data.
1394000	1396000	Because RT is
1396000	1398000	not a range.
1398000	1400000	Only one side has a range.
1400000	1402000	The other side has no range.
1402000	1404000	Let's do a regularization first.
1404000	1406000	Change it to a value of 0 to 1.
1406000	1408000	The way to regularize it
1408000	1410000	is to use its
1410000	1412000	cumulative distribution function.
1412000	1414000	Map it
1414000	1416000	to a
1416000	1418000	range value.
1418000	1420000	Then
1420000	1422000	let's do a
1422000	1424000	smoothing here.
1424000	1426000	For smoothing, I use a 90-second
1426000	1428000	moving window
1428000	1430000	to make the
1430000	1432000	data look more dynamic.
1432000	1434000	We turn it
1434000	1436000	into a smoother value.
1436000	1438000	This part is because
1438000	1440000	RT only samples
1440000	1442000	once every 6 to 10 seconds.
1442000	1444000	If you
1444000	1446000	use too high quality
1446000	1448000	to look at this data,
1448000	1450000	it is more meaningless.
1450000	1452000	If we use a smoothing,
1452000	1454000	we can get rid of
1454000	1456000	some of the
1456000	1458000	inaccuracies of this data itself.
1458000	1460000	So we use
1460000	1462000	this
1462000	1464000	alertness deficit index
1464000	1466000	which is an index
1466000	1468000	that lacks attention.
1468000	1470000	We use it as
1470000	1472000	a ground truth
1472000	1474000	in our behavior.
1474000	1476000	Does anyone have any questions?
1478000	1480000	Let's assume that
1480000	1482000	RT directly reflects
1482000	1484000	the level of alertness.
1484000	1486000	Yes.
1486000	1488000	RT becomes alertness
1488000	1490000	should be one of the factors.
1490000	1492000	Yes.
1492000	1494000	So it depends on the
1494000	1496000	design of the experiment.
1496000	1498000	In addition, let's assume that
1498000	1500000	in our experiment design,
1500000	1502000	the part that affects RT
1502000	1504000	is only drowsiness.
1504000	1506000	We try to
1506000	1508000	eliminate other factors
1508000	1510000	that may affect RT.
1510000	1512000	Because
1512000	1514000	similar paradigms
1514000	1516000	in the experiment
1516000	1518000	are also used
1518000	1520000	to study
1520000	1522000	mind-wandering.
1522000	1524000	Mind-wandering and
1524000	1526000	alertness are related
1526000	1528000	but not exactly the same.
1528000	1530000	For example, your subject
1530000	1532000	starts to think about other things
1532000	1534000	and his RT becomes worse.
1534000	1536000	In your definition,
1536000	1538000	it is a lack of alertness.
1538000	1540000	Yes.
1540000	1542000	It is acceptable.
1542000	1544000	So our alertness
1544000	1546000	is based on
1546000	1548000	the alertness defined by RT.
1548000	1550000	Yes.
1550000	1552000	Because the subject does not react
1552000	1554000	like you said,
1554000	1556000	he may be thinking about other things.
1556000	1558000	Of course,
1558000	1560000	the instruction of our experiment
1560000	1562000	is to teach them to focus.
1562000	1564000	Yes.
1564000	1566000	What we can do is
1566000	1568000	only up to here.
1568000	1570000	It may affect your
1570000	1572000	EEG data later.
1572000	1574000	Imagine that there are three reasons
1574000	1576000	why his RT becomes worse.
1576000	1578000	You will catch three patterns.
1578000	1580000	The three patterns
1580000	1582000	may be different.
1582000	1584000	For example, when you train the data,
1584000	1586000	the accuracy will be lower.
1586000	1588000	Because your data is not high enough.
1588000	1590000	Sometimes it is because of A,
1590000	1592000	sometimes because of B,
1592000	1594000	sometimes because of C.
1594000	1596000	It is impossible to be completely correct.
1596000	1598000	Just like what you said,
1598000	1600000	mind-wandering,
1600000	1602000	we can't control it.
1602000	1604000	However,
1604000	1606000	when RT becomes longer,
1606000	1608000	it becomes quite long.
1608000	1610000	For example, 5 seconds.
1610000	1612000	If he is thinking about other things
1612000	1614000	for 5 seconds
1614000	1616000	without following our instructions
1616000	1618000	to guide him,
1620000	1622000	I don't know what to do.
1622000	1624000	OK.
1624000	1626000	What you see
1626000	1628000	is the real
1628000	1630000	death.
1632000	1634000	Some trials,
1634000	1636000	like what you said,
1636000	1638000	may be due to other factors
1638000	1640000	or some miscommunication.
1640000	1642000	This part
1642000	1644000	cannot be ruled out.
1644000	1646000	OK.
1646000	1648000	If your task
1648000	1650000	can separate
1650000	1652000	different things that affect RT,
1652000	1654000	your model
1654000	1656000	will be cleaner.
1656000	1658000	This is an ideal situation.
1658000	1660000	Of course,
1660000	1662000	we can't cover
1662000	1664000	so many different factors at the same time.
1664000	1666000	Yes.
1666000	1668000	So,
1668000	1670000	in terms of brain science,
1670000	1672000	we often have this problem.
1672000	1674000	We can't control what the subject is thinking.
1674000	1676000	That's right.
1676000	1678000	It's a bit awkward.
1678000	1680000	I have a different idea
1680000	1682000	about brain science.
1682000	1684000	OK.
1684000	1686000	If you want to
1686000	1688000	throw data to machine learning,
1688000	1690000	if there are three reasons,
1690000	1692000	whether he wants to sleep
1692000	1694000	or something else,
1694000	1696000	your algorithm
1696000	1698000	may be persuaded
1698000	1700000	to identify
1700000	1702000	three different reasons.
1702000	1704000	But for whatever reason,
1704000	1706000	it will
1706000	1708000	indicate that
1708000	1710000	you are lying.
1710000	1712000	Isn't that right?
1712000	1714000	It's possible.
1714000	1716000	So, in the end,
1716000	1718000	his algorithm
1718000	1720000	can avoid
1720000	1722000	the longer RT time
1722000	1724000	for whatever reason.
1724000	1726000	I think we should
1726000	1728000	go back to the original question.
1728000	1730000	What do you want to detect?
1730000	1732000	For example,
1732000	1734000	if you want to promote a policy,
1734000	1736000	you want to avoid
1736000	1738000	drowsy driving.
1738000	1740000	This whole thing is set up
1740000	1742000	for drowsy driving.
1742000	1744000	But later I found that
1744000	1746000	the other important factor
1746000	1748000	that affects their driving
1748000	1750000	is mind-wandering.
1750000	1752000	Even if you can detect
1752000	1754000	mind-wandering at the same time,
1754000	1756000	when you make a policy,
1756000	1758000	these two are completely different.
1758000	1760000	How do you avoid A and avoid B?
1760000	1762000	In the end,
1762000	1764000	from the point of view of brain science,
1764000	1766000	what happened during that time?
1766000	1768000	That's the reason
1768000	1770000	I asked this question.
1770000	1772000	I think it's possible.
1772000	1774000	When you make a machine learning,
1774000	1776000	it can identify all patterns
1776000	1778000	as a lack of awareness.
1778000	1780000	This is also possible.
1782000	1784000	Like what
1784000	1786000	Yen-Yung mentioned,
1786000	1788000	if I use machine learning,
1788000	1790000	it will learn
1790000	1792000	the relationship between data.
1792000	1794000	Then you get
1796000	1798000	an overall
1798000	1800000	influence
1800000	1802000	of R&D.
1802000	1804000	I don't know what it is.
1804000	1806000	In addition,
1806000	1808000	we just
1808000	1810000	discussed that
1810000	1812000	different
1812000	1814000	cognitive
1814000	1816000	phenomena can be
1816000	1818000	disassembled.
1818000	1820000	It can be seen independently.
1820000	1822000	Or there are some interactions
1822000	1824000	between them.
1824000	1826000	If
1826000	1828000	we want to
1828000	1830000	use our data
1830000	1832000	to disassemble different
1832000	1834000	cognitive states
1834000	1836000	on this RT,
1836000	1838000	in fact,
1838000	1840000	there is no way to
1840000	1842000	just use one experiment.
1842000	1844000	It may be necessary to
1844000	1846000	do different experiments
1846000	1848000	to estimate
1848000	1850000	what will happen.
1850000	1852000	In our case,
1852000	1854000	we try to say
1854000	1856000	that there is only one
1856000	1858000	influence.
1858000	1860000	But we can't guarantee.
1860000	1862000	If we say that 90% of
1862000	1864000	our trial
1864000	1866000	is based on
1866000	1868000	our imagination,
1868000	1870000	because we
1870000	1872000	let it do it
1872000	1874000	after lunch.
1874000	1876000	We asked it to
1876000	1878000	drive the highway.
1878000	1880000	We hope to
1880000	1882000	let it sleep
1882000	1884000	in this way.
1884000	1886000	At least
1886000	1888000	in this process,
1888000	1890000	it is closer to
1890000	1892000	what we want it to
1892000	1894000	trigger.
1896000	1898000	Is that OK?
1898000	1900000	My question
1900000	1902000	has been answered.
1902000	1904000	OK.
1904000	1906000	I will talk about
1906000	1908000	this later.
1908000	1910000	This is very troublesome.
1910000	1912000	Many cognitive states
1912000	1914000	do not have a good
1914000	1916000	objective definition.
1916000	1918000	In the future,
1918000	1920000	whether it is a brain interface
1920000	1922000	or cognitive science,
1922000	1924000	this is a big problem.
1924000	1926000	Let me
1926000	1928000	continue my research.
1928000	1930000	OK.
1930000	1932000	As I said,
1932000	1934000	our brain wave can be
1934000	1936000	divided into different
1936000	1938000	characteristics.
1938000	1940000	Here I list
1940000	1942000	some of my
1942000	1944000	processing processes.
1944000	1946000	EEG will
1946000	1948000	do a
1948000	1950000	re-referencing
1950000	1952000	for different channels.
1952000	1954000	Here we
1954000	1956000	take
1956000	1958000	the EEG of
1958000	1960000	all channels to
1960000	1962000	reduce their overall average.
1962000	1964000	This can remove some
1964000	1966000	impurities.
1966000	1968000	Then we do
1968000	1970000	bandpass filtering.
1970000	1972000	The EEG
1972000	1974000	is limited to
1974000	1976000	50 Hz or less.
1976000	1978000	Some low frequency
1978000	1980000	waves may
1980000	1982000	come from
1982000	1984000	moving around
1984000	1986000	the device itself.
1986000	1988000	We will use
1988000	1990000	1 to 50 Hz
1990000	1992000	or more
1992000	1994000	to filter the EEG
1994000	1996000	and get
1996000	1998000	something that
1998000	2000000	really looks like EEG.
2000000	2002000	But there are still a lot of artifacts.
2002000	2004000	Downsampling
2004000	2006000	reduces our computing time.
2006000	2008000	Then we do
2008000	2010000	subbandpass filtering.
2010000	2012000	We divide the EEG
2012000	2014000	into different brainwaves.
2014000	2016000	Here are some examples.
2016000	2018000	Fast and slow.
2018000	2020000	They are from delta,
2020000	2022000	zeta, alpha to beta.
2022000	2024000	Then we take
2024000	2026000	their energy
2026000	2028000	and do a smoothing.
2028000	2030000	We use
2030000	2032000	90-second
2032000	2034000	moving window
2034000	2036000	to smooth
2036000	2038000	the EEG
2038000	2040000	and get our data.
2042000	2044000	Now we have
2044000	2046000	the brainwave energy
2046000	2048000	and the alertness index.
2048000	2050000	Now let's
2050000	2052000	compare the two.
2052000	2054000	The y-axis
2054000	2056000	represents
2056000	2058000	the EEG energy.
2058000	2060000	The x-axis
2060000	2062000	represents the alertness
2062000	2064000	index.
2064000	2066000	The x-axis
2066000	2068000	is the slow
2068000	2070000	reaction time.
2070000	2072000	The y-axis
2072000	2074000	represents the EEG energy.
2074000	2076000	Here are
2076000	2078000	delta, zeta, alpha, beta.
2078000	2080000	I have
2080000	2082000	several channels
2082000	2084000	with frontal
2084000	2086000	and central.
2086000	2088000	Z is the
2088000	2090000	midline.
2090000	2092000	The middle of the front,
2092000	2094000	the middle of the middle,
2094000	2096000	the middle of the parietal,
2096000	2098000	and the middle
2098000	2100000	of the parietal.
2100000	2102000	In these positions,
2102000	2104000	the EEG energy changes
2104000	2106000	in different channels
2106000	2108000	are related to
2108000	2110000	alertness.
2110000	2112000	Delta is a positive
2112000	2114000	channel. 0.77
2114000	2116000	is a positive channel.
2116000	2118000	Alpha is a
2118000	2120000	negative channel,
2120000	2122000	negative 0.28.
2122000	2124000	When
2124000	2126000	alertness decreases,
2126000	2128000	the channel
2128000	2130000	will decrease.
2130000	2132000	This part
2132000	2134000	has a variability.
2134000	2136000	Everyone
2136000	2138000	does it every time.
2138000	2140000	The relative situation
2140000	2142000	will be different.
2142000	2144000	Here I use
2144000	2146000	a distribution map
2146000	2148000	with relative
2148000	2150000	details to see
2150000	2152000	the relationship
2152000	2154000	between the brain wave
2154000	2156000	and the alertness.
2156000	2158000	The red is the positive channel,
2158000	2160000	the blue is the negative channel.
2160000	2162000	Most of the delta
2162000	2164000	is positive,
2164000	2166000	and the beta
2166000	2168000	is negative.
2168000	2170000	This graph
2170000	2172000	shows the results
2172000	2174000	of the brain wave and alertness
2174000	2176000	in this experiment.
2176000	2178000	This graph
2178000	2180000	will change
2180000	2182000	with time.
2182000	2184000	This part is to be discussed first.
2186000	2188000	If you take the brain wave
2188000	2190000	to make a frequency map,
2190000	2192000	does it have 4 peaks
2192000	2194000	in this alpha,
2194000	2196000	beta,
2196000	2198000	theta,
2198000	2200000	and delta?
2200000	2202000	Or is it a smooth
2202000	2204000	continuous frequency map?
2204000	2206000	If you
2206000	2208000	look at the frequency,
2208000	2210000	it will have
2210000	2212000	1 over f
2212000	2214000	distribution.
2214000	2216000	1 over f
2216000	2218000	looks like a
2218000	2220000	decline
2220000	2222000	curve.
2222000	2224000	The brain wave
2224000	2226000	has a higher
2226000	2228000	low frequency energy
2228000	2230000	and a lower high frequency energy.
2230000	2232000	So cutting the alpha, beta,
2232000	2234000	theta, delta band
2234000	2236000	is basically just
2236000	2238000	cutting a continuous frequency map
2238000	2240000	into 4 pieces.
2240000	2242000	Yes, but sometimes
2242000	2244000	there will be some peaks.
2244000	2246000	Although it is 1 over f,
2246000	2248000	the overall distribution is 1 over f.
2248000	2250000	We call it
2250000	2252000	pain noise,
2252000	2254000	one of the noise.
2256000	2258000	But sometimes
2258000	2260000	the overall distribution
2260000	2262000	will have some small peaks.
2262000	2264000	Because sometimes the brain
2264000	2266000	can have a strong alertness
2266000	2268000	such as alpha.
2268000	2270000	Alpha is when you close your eyes
2270000	2272000	and especially
2272000	2274000	the back part
2274000	2276000	will start to vibrate
2276000	2278000	about 10 Hz.
2278000	2280000	At that time,
2280000	2282000	there is a small peak
2282000	2284000	on the curve of
2284000	2286000	1 over f.
2286000	2288000	It looks a bit like this.
2290000	2292000	What I'm thinking is
2292000	2294000	if your energy spectrum
2294000	2296000	does not have a peak,
2296000	2298000	if you cut it into 4 pieces
2298000	2300000	and then divide it into
2300000	2302000	these 4 groups of data
2302000	2304000	to do machine learning,
2304000	2306000	I don't think it will enhance
2306000	2308000	the effect of machine learning.
2308000	2310000	Because it may be
2310000	2312000	on the edge of the band
2312000	2314000	that you cut.
2314000	2316000	But if you have a peak
2316000	2318000	in alpha today,
2318000	2320000	you separate alpha
2320000	2322000	and other
2322000	2324000	data to do
2324000	2326000	machine learning training,
2326000	2328000	I think it will have a more obvious effect.
2328000	2330000	That's why I asked this question.
2332000	2334000	I understand what you mean.
2334000	2336000	So if you use
2336000	2338000	some really meaningful band
2338000	2340000	to do
2340000	2342000	machine learning,
2342000	2344000	the effect will be
2344000	2346000	better.
2346000	2348000	Yes, I agree with you.
2348000	2350000	You must put a lot of
2350000	2352000	impurities into it.
2352000	2354000	But because
2354000	2356000	the problem I'm going to solve later is
2358000	2360000	how do I say it?
2360000	2362000	I can't give up on each one.
2362000	2364000	Because each one has
2364000	2366000	mutational problems,
2366000	2368000	so each one sometimes
2368000	2370000	becomes the best feature
2370000	2372000	that appears on top.
2372000	2374000	So
2374000	2376000	there's no way
2376000	2378000	to narrow it down
2378000	2380000	to a better feature.
2380000	2382000	I have to
2382000	2384000	use so many features.
2384000	2386000	That's the situation.
2388000	2390000	OK, thank you.
2394000	2396000	OK.
2396000	2398000	I'm going to talk about
2398000	2400000	machine learning.
2400000	2402000	It's a regression problem.
2402000	2404000	Because I want to
2404000	2406000	predict
2406000	2408000	the change of
2408000	2410000	the alertness
2410000	2412000	index.
2412000	2414000	It's a continuous value.
2414000	2416000	The output of the model
2416000	2418000	must be a continuous value.
2418000	2420000	It must be close to this value.
2420000	2422000	I just did some
2422000	2424000	processing.
2424000	2426000	It's the same here.
2426000	2428000	Then I put the energy of the brain wave
2428000	2430000	and the reaction time
2430000	2432000	recorded by our experiment
2432000	2434000	in the
2434000	2436000	processed alertness
2436000	2438000	index into the model.
2438000	2440000	Then I train it.
2440000	2442000	Then I get a
2442000	2444000	regression model.
2444000	2446000	It can turn the brain wave
2446000	2448000	into the alertness index we estimated.
2450000	2452000	But there's a problem.
2452000	2454000	I've been talking about it.
2454000	2456000	Human variability.
2456000	2458000	We will
2458000	2460000	divide it into
2460000	2462000	inter-subject or intra-subject.
2462000	2464000	Inter-subject and subject
2464000	2466000	have some variability.
2466000	2468000	I want to invite you
2468000	2470000	to do an activity.
2470000	2472000	The dancer you see now
2472000	2474000	is teleporting.
2476000	2478000	Just make a sound.
2480000	2482000	I can see both sides.
2482000	2484000	So you can see this
2484000	2486000	and that.
2486000	2488000	I can see what I want to see.
2488000	2490000	I've seen this picture so many times in my life.
2490000	2492000	But I can only see one side.
2494000	2496000	I don't know why.
2496000	2498000	I really want to see the other side.
2500000	2502000	Some people see the retrograde
2502000	2504000	and some people see the subject.
2504000	2506000	Some people want to see
2506000	2508000	what they want to see.
2508000	2510000	I also
2512000	2514000	want to see the other side.
2514000	2516000	Then I go to see it.
2516000	2518000	It will follow my
2518000	2520000	direction.
2520000	2522000	This part is
2522000	2524000	the same stimulus to
2524000	2526000	different people.
2526000	2528000	Our brain
2528000	2530000	will react differently.
2530000	2532000	This is just an example.
2532000	2534000	It tells you that
2534000	2536000	everyone's brain is different.
2536000	2538000	Our brain
2538000	2540000	will react differently
2540000	2542000	to the same stimulus
2542000	2544000	at different times.
2544000	2546000	The brain wave change
2546000	2548000	related to the brain wave
2548000	2550000	is actually the same.
2550000	2552000	Different people are different.
2552000	2554000	A person does the experiment
2554000	2556000	on a different day.
2556000	2558000	Here I put my data.
2558000	2560000	I gave an example.
2560000	2562000	I just said
2562000	2564000	to use the distribution of correlation
2564000	2566000	as a relationship
2566000	2568000	between the brain wave and the alertness
2568000	2570000	of a certain experiment.
2570000	2572000	Here I have a S5-1,
2572000	2574000	which is the fifth subject.
2574000	2576000	Do the driving experiment.
2578000	2580000	The correlation we get is like this.
2582000	2584000	There are three reds here.
2584000	2586000	From Theta to Alpha
2586000	2588000	to Beta
2588000	2590000	are all positive.
2590000	2592000	But this is
2592000	2594000	the second time he did it.
2594000	2596000	The second time he did it.
2596000	2598000	We see that it's completely different.
2598000	2600000	Delta is positive.
2600000	2602000	The other three are negative.
2602000	2604000	Even Alpha is negative.
2604000	2606000	If we use his first experiment
2606000	2608000	to train our model,
2608000	2610000	we will find that
2610000	2612000	the effect will be very poor
2612000	2614000	the second time.
2616000	2618000	But we did a lot of experiments.
2618000	2620000	We recorded a lot of people.
2620000	2622000	For example, the 41st subject
2622000	2624000	when he did it for the fifth time,
2624000	2626000	he had this pattern.
2626000	2628000	It's very similar to subject 5.
2628000	2630000	So different people
2630000	2632000	have similar reactions
2632000	2634000	on the brain wave we want to look at.
2634000	2636000	If so,
2636000	2638000	I can take the data
2638000	2640000	of subject 41
2640000	2642000	for the fifth time
2642000	2644000	to train a model.
2644000	2646000	If we use it for the second time
2646000	2648000	of subject 5,
2648000	2650000	the effect will be very good.
2650000	2652000	Of course, this is what we can do
2652000	2654000	after the test.
2654000	2656000	This session is very similar to this session.
2656000	2658000	But we can't
2658000	2660000	When subject 5
2660000	2662000	comes, we have a way
2662000	2664000	to know that we want to use
2664000	2666000	the model of subject 41 to give it.
2666000	2668000	That is a
2668000	2670000	engineering challenge
2670000	2672000	or a scientific challenge.
2672000	2674000	How do we do this?
2674000	2676000	I want to ask a question.
2676000	2678000	Sorry.
2678000	2680000	I want to ask a question.
2680000	2682000	The time they do the experiment
2682000	2684000	is probably fixed.
2684000	2686000	Like you said, after lunch.
2686000	2688000	The time
2688000	2690000	is probably fixed.
2690000	2692000	Yes.
2692000	2694000	This looks
2694000	2696000	a bit like
2696000	2698000	the problem I just mentioned.
2698000	2700000	There may be different factors.
2700000	2702000	The brain activity
2702000	2704000	between different sessions
2704000	2706000	may be different.
2706000	2708000	Yes.
2708000	2710000	For example,
2710000	2712000	if you want to measure drowsiness,
2712000	2714000	your second session of subject 5
2714000	2716000	is similar.
2716000	2718000	Yes.
2718000	2720000	In other words,
2720000	2722000	if you can have another task
2722000	2724000	or a subjective report
2724000	2726000	to verify
2726000	2728000	what happened in each session,
2728000	2730000	you may be able to
2730000	2732000	go back and say that
2732000	2734000	this brain wave is more like
2734000	2736000	A or B or C.
2736000	2738000	Yes, this is what I want to do.
2738000	2740000	Is there anything else
2740000	2742000	we can measure
2742000	2744000	faster?
2744000	2746000	Then we can know
2746000	2748000	that this should be
2748000	2750000	similar to the previous session.
2750000	2752000	Then we can use it.
2752000	2754000	Next,
2754000	2756000	I will develop this.
2756000	2758000	OK.
2758000	2760000	The actual operation may be more complicated than this.
2760000	2762000	In other words,
2762000	2764000	my brain activity of drowsiness
2764000	2766000	is similar to
2766000	2768000	your brain activity of mind wandering.
2768000	2770000	There is a relationship between
2770000	2772000	brain state and brain state.
2772000	2774000	It may be like this.
2774000	2776000	Everyone may have a different brain state.
2776000	2778000	Of course,
2778000	2780000	I have a brain state
2780000	2782000	corresponding to
2782000	2784000	the brain activity of mind.
2784000	2786000	But it doesn't mean
2786000	2788000	that everyone's brain state
2788000	2790000	is similar.
2790000	2792000	I don't know.
2792000	2794000	That may be the actual difficulty.
2794000	2796000	It feels like it can be done.
2796000	2798000	Of course,
2798000	2800000	it's good.
2800000	2802000	But we can't
2802000	2804000	analyze other factors
2804000	2806000	in this experiment.
2806000	2808000	It's a pity.
2810000	2812000	Next,
2812000	2814000	I will deal with
2814000	2816000	the relationship
2816000	2818000	in a data-driven way.
2818000	2820000	OK. Thank you.
2820000	2822000	I have a question.
2822000	2824000	This page.
2824000	2826000	I want to ask
2826000	2828000	about the black dots
2828000	2830000	on the image.
2830000	2832000	The black dots are the
2832000	2834000	corresponding probes
2834000	2836000	of the hat.
2836000	2838000	But the hat is actually
2838000	2840000	a spatial distribution of the sphere.
2840000	2842000	It's not a flat 2D circle.
2842000	2844000	Yes.
2844000	2846000	How did you
2846000	2848000	project the image
2848000	2850000	from the spatial distribution of the sphere
2850000	2852000	to the image you drew now?
2852000	2854000	Or is it just a visual image?
2854000	2856000	Do you preserve
2856000	2858000	the distance between each dot?
2858000	2860000	Is it a specific
2860000	2862000	projection like a map?
2862000	2864000	Or do you arrange it one by one?
2864000	2866000	This value
2866000	2868000	is only used in visualization.
2868000	2870000	So if the relationship is distorted,
2870000	2872000	it won't affect much.
2872000	2874000	Because I...
2874000	2876000	You only take
2876000	2878000	exactly the position above.
2878000	2880000	OK.
2880000	2882000	Like this is 30 channels.
2882000	2884000	So I only have those 30
2884000	2886000	channels of data.
2886000	2888000	And what happens in the middle?
2888000	2890000	That's all visualizations.
2890000	2892000	They are inserted
2892000	2894000	and projected.
2894000	2896000	I want to tell you about this.
2896000	2898000	What I was thinking is
2898000	2900000	if you process the data like this
2900000	2902000	and then throw it away,
2902000	2904000	it sounds like you will re-weight
2904000	2906000	the effect of each data.
2906000	2908000	And it may smear
2908000	2910000	what's physically happening in your brain.
2910000	2912000	I don't know what you mean.
2912000	2914000	OK.
2914000	2916000	This is purely visualization.
2916000	2918000	OK. Thank you.
2918000	2920000	Like you said, some people
2920000	2922000	use mapping as data.
2922000	2924000	And I don't like it.
2924000	2926000	Because it's like a problem.
2930000	2932000	So we just talked about
2932000	2934000	how to find
2934000	2936000	a model that is similar to
2936000	2938000	the new people in the database.
2938000	2940000	What's the advantage of this?
2940000	2942000	We call it Subject Transfer.
2942000	2944000	It transfers the model
2944000	2946000	from one person to another.
2946000	2948000	The advantage is that
2948000	2950000	we used to say
2950000	2952000	we try to collect
2952000	2954000	each person's data,
2954000	2956000	brainwaves and behaviors.
2956000	2958000	We try to collect more data
2958000	2960000	to build a model.
2960000	2962000	We believe that it will have a good performance
2962000	2964000	for the same person.
2964000	2966000	We call it Self-Decoding.
2966000	2968000	Because of some variability,
2968000	2970000	it often fails.
2972000	2974000	So we want to use
2974000	2976000	Subject Transfer.
2976000	2978000	We use a small amount of data
2978000	2980000	as an indicator,
2980000	2982000	as a brain signature.
2982000	2984000	Then we can
2984000	2986000	find a suitable model
2986000	2988000	from our database
2988000	2990000	and use it.
2990000	2992000	Then we can start
2992000	2994000	to detect
2994000	2996000	its alertness level.
2998000	3000000	What should we use
3000000	3002000	for this
3002000	3004000	relatively small amount of data?
3004000	3006000	What I'm talking about
3006000	3008000	is
3008000	3010000	Baseline Activity.
3010000	3012000	Baseline Activity
3012000	3014000	is a standard state.
3018000	3020000	Baseline Activity
3020000	3022000	can also be called
3022000	3024000	Task Activity
3024000	3026000	or Task Free Activity.
3026000	3028000	It means that
3028000	3030000	this subject is not doing anything
3030000	3032000	and it has nothing to do with your task.
3032000	3034000	Then the brain activity at that time.
3034000	3036000	In the past, there were many studies
3036000	3038000	to see
3038000	3040000	when the brain was not doing anything,
3040000	3042000	the brain's
3042000	3044000	existing activities
3044000	3046000	and the specific activities
3046000	3048000	after you really gave it a task.
3048000	3050000	Is there any connection?
3050000	3052000	On the brain wave,
3052000	3054000	we found that
3054000	3056000	from RESTing data,
3056000	3058000	you use ICA
3058000	3060000	to look at
3060000	3062000	some
3062000	3064000	decomposed
3064000	3066000	component activity.
3066000	3068000	Then you can use that
3068000	3070000	to help it in the action
3070000	3072000	imagination of this specific task.
3074000	3076000	You can find it
3076000	3078000	from RESTing data
3078000	3080000	to find out the pattern
3080000	3082000	of its action imagination.
3084000	3086000	When a person is not doing
3086000	3088000	action imagination,
3088000	3090000	his data can tell you
3090000	3092000	what his pattern looks like
3092000	3094000	when he is doing action imagination.
3096000	3098000	In addition, there is RESTing data
3098000	3100000	to predict
3100000	3102000	the performance of the brain interface.
3102000	3104000	Because not everyone
3104000	3106000	can master
3106000	3108000	how to use the brain interface.
3108000	3110000	RESTing data
3110000	3112000	can tell you
3112000	3114000	if this person is suitable for using the brain interface.
3114000	3116000	Another study
3116000	3118000	is from RESTing.
3118000	3120000	This is MRI data,
3120000	3122000	fMRI data.
3122000	3124000	It predicts
3124000	3126000	from RESTing fMRI
3126000	3128000	that under a specific
3128000	3130000	cognitive task,
3130000	3132000	the activation mapping is like this.
3132000	3134000	There is a lot of evidence
3134000	3136000	that your RESTing
3136000	3138000	data and your
3138000	3140000	task data
3140000	3142000	are related.
3142000	3144000	Back to
3144000	3146000	how we choose the right model,
3146000	3148000	I thought
3148000	3150000	if we use a small piece of RESTing data,
3150000	3152000	we can find the right model
3152000	3154000	for the new person.
3154000	3156000	Here I think
3156000	3158000	I have a lot of models
3158000	3160000	from the past
3160000	3162000	experiments.
3162000	3164000	I have built a lot of models.
3164000	3166000	The new person
3166000	3168000	is called Target Subject.
3168000	3170000	Then we record a baseline.
3170000	3172000	This is recorded
3172000	3174000	in the alert situation.
3174000	3176000	That is to say,
3176000	3178000	this person
3178000	3180000	in our
3180000	3182000	simulation driving
3182000	3184000	simulation car
3184000	3186000	is not moving,
3186000	3188000	he is not turning the steering wheel,
3188000	3190000	he is not doing anything,
3190000	3192000	the car is moving forward,
3192000	3194000	he doesn't have to do anything,
3194000	3196000	the data during that time,
3196000	3198000	we treat it as a brain signature.
3198000	3200000	We use this to estimate
3200000	3202000	who is more like
3202000	3204000	the new person
3204000	3206000	and the model in the original database.
3206000	3208000	We do a sequence
3208000	3210000	for this model,
3210000	3212000	and then do a fusion,
3212000	3214000	which is to combine those models
3214000	3216000	and outputs together.
3216000	3218000	Finally, we do a recalibration,
3218000	3220000	because sometimes
3220000	3222000	there are some offsets.
3222000	3224000	Finally,
3224000	3226000	we can give this subject
3226000	3228000	to estimate his alertness.
3230000	3232000	Any questions?
3232000	3234000	Can you explain
3234000	3236000	the pairing process again?
3236000	3238000	OK.
3238000	3240000	How do you find
3240000	3242000	a person
3242000	3244000	to pair with
3244000	3246000	a car make a session?
3246000	3248000	OK.
3248000	3250000	I have
3250000	3252000	a backup slide here.
3256000	3258000	For the new person,
3258000	3260000	I will have his baseline data.
3260000	3262000	It is
3262000	3264000	his energy in different
3264000	3266000	bands and in different locations.
3266000	3268000	We use this to compare
3268000	3270000	the data of all other people
3270000	3272000	in my database.
3272000	3274000	Then I estimate his similarity.
3276000	3278000	I use this similarity
3278000	3280000	to assume that
3280000	3282000	if he is
3282000	3284000	in the baseline state,
3284000	3286000	the pattern of these two people is similar,
3286000	3288000	then I believe
3288000	3290000	their EEG alertness
3290000	3292000	model will be very similar.
3292000	3294000	That's how I do it.
3294000	3296000	OK.
3296000	3298000	In other words,
3298000	3300000	you just showed us
3300000	3302000	a session.
3302000	3304000	According to this model,
3304000	3306000	their default baseline
3306000	3308000	activity should be very similar.
3308000	3310000	Yes.
3310000	3312000	OK.
3312000	3314000	Thank you.
3314000	3316000	I have a post-trial analysis here.
3316000	3318000	In other words,
3318000	3320000	we use baseline activity
3320000	3322000	to predict the similarity.
3322000	3324000	Is it really their similarity?
3324000	3326000	The real similarity here
3326000	3328000	is that I put
3328000	3330000	a model of a person
3330000	3332000	and a session
3332000	3334000	to use the data of another person.
3334000	3336000	Then look at their
3336000	3338000	performance afterwards.
3338000	3340000	There is a real similarity
3340000	3342000	offline.
3342000	3344000	I also use baseline activity
3344000	3346000	to estimate their
3346000	3348000	subject-subject similarity.
3348000	3350000	Then I predict
3350000	3352000	the performance
3352000	3354000	I can get.
3354000	3356000	I found that these two things
3356000	3358000	are quite similar.
3358000	3360000	You can see a correspondence here.
3360000	3362000	It's actually the same as what I predicted.
3362000	3364000	There is an accuracy here.
3364000	3366000	If I use this,
3366000	3368000	I can do what I just did.
3368000	3370000	It means that at least
3370000	3372000	part of my assumption is correct.
3374000	3376000	Because of this,
3376000	3378000	we can look at
3378000	3380000	our prediction
3380000	3382000	results.
3382000	3384000	The black line here
3384000	3386000	is the change of time
3386000	3388000	in the entire experiment.
3388000	3390000	It's a black line.
3390000	3392000	The result we predict
3392000	3394000	is to get close to this black line.
3394000	3396000	We can see that
3396000	3398000	the relevant details of different
3398000	3400000	curves can express
3400000	3402000	how accurate we predicted.
3402000	3404000	The blue part here
3404000	3406000	is the traditional way.
3406000	3408000	Each subject uses
3408000	3410000	the data he has recorded
3410000	3412000	to train a model
3412000	3414000	to look at his prediction results.
3414000	3416000	The red line is
3416000	3418000	the method I just mentioned.
3418000	3420000	We look at a small section
3420000	3422000	of baseline activity.
3422000	3424000	We use other people's models
3424000	3426000	to predict his alertness.
3426000	3428000	You can see that
3428000	3430000	on this example,
3430000	3432000	red is better than black.
3432000	3434000	This is their curve.
3434000	3436000	They are related to
3436000	3438000	the actual ground truth here.
3438000	3440000	On this example,
3440000	3442000	the method
3442000	3444000	of subject transfer
3444000	3446000	is slightly better.
3446000	3448000	I have a small question.
3448000	3450000	This concept
3450000	3452000	is like a donation, right?
3452000	3454000	If you can
3454000	3456000	find a group of people
3456000	3458000	whose genotype
3458000	3460000	or model
3460000	3462000	is similar to yours,
3462000	3464000	can you use this method
3464000	3466000	to match
3466000	3468000	their data?
3468000	3470000	Yes.
3470000	3472000	OK.
3472000	3474000	In other words,
3474000	3476000	you can only do
3476000	3478000	a few hours.
3478000	3480000	If you use this method,
3480000	3482000	you can use
3482000	3484000	an infinite amount of data.
3484000	3486000	If you recruit a lot of people,
3486000	3488000	a lot of people can match.
3488000	3490000	The data pool will keep increasing.
3490000	3492000	That's right.
3492000	3494000	Thank you.
3494000	3496000	I have a question.
3496000	3498000	The picture in the front page
3498000	3500000	is the actual.
3500000	3502000	No, the next page.
3502000	3504000	Yes, the next page.
3504000	3506000	This is
3506000	3508000	a different way
3508000	3510000	to do it.
3510000	3512000	Now you draw a line.
3512000	3514000	But if
3514000	3516000	you divide your data
3516000	3518000	a little bit,
3518000	3520000	it's a bit like
3520000	3522000	repeating the same thing
3522000	3524000	500 or 1000 times.
3524000	3526000	Your prediction
3526000	3528000	will be a little bit different every time.
3528000	3530000	Then you can put your
3530000	3532000	red line into a red band.
3532000	3534000	Do you know what I mean?
3534000	3536000	There is an error.
3536000	3538000	Yes, the range of the band
3538000	3540000	is basically
3540000	3542000	the range of uncertainty
3542000	3544000	of your model.
3544000	3546000	OK.
3546000	3548000	So every time you run,
3548000	3550000	it will be a little different.
3550000	3552000	Did you hear that?
3552000	3554000	So every time you run,
3554000	3556000	it will be a little different.
3556000	3558000	Yes, so I'm curious.
3558000	3560000	Except for the line you show now,
3560000	3562000	the uncertainty
3562000	3564000	behind each line
3564000	3566000	may not be the same.
3566000	3568000	For example,
3568000	3570000	predictability is particularly good
3570000	3572000	in this specific case.
3572000	3574000	It may actually be fluctuate up.
3574000	3576000	But the band is actually very wide.
3576000	3578000	So it may not be particularly good.
3578000	3580000	Oh.
3580000	3582000	This is a good question.
3582000	3584000	Because usually
3584000	3586000	if you plot this prediction,
3586000	3588000	you will plot 95% confidence interval.
3588000	3590000	He is actually talking about this thing.
3590000	3592000	You should plot this thing out.
3592000	3594000	OK, got it.
3594000	3596000	Yes.
3596000	3598000	But I see that it's a lot.
3598000	3600000	I probably feel that
3600000	3602000	there should be nothing to argue about.
3602000	3604000	It should be effective.
3604000	3606000	But if it's very close,
3606000	3608000	I'll be more curious.
3608000	3610000	This is better than that.
3610000	3612000	I might want to see the error bar.
3612000	3614000	Oh, got it.
3614000	3616000	Yes, this is good.
3616000	3618000	I should be able to put that
3618000	3620000	confidence interval
3620000	3622000	in as well.
3622000	3624000	Because I just want to compare
3624000	3626000	their correlation.
3626000	3628000	Then I just draw the line.
3628000	3630000	So if I draw the curve,
3630000	3632000	I can have a better
3632000	3634000	that
3634000	3636000	better than
3636000	3638000	better
3638000	3640000	measure to see
3640000	3642000	their performance.
3642000	3644000	Yes, that's what I think.
3644000	3646000	Because I think if you have an error bar,
3646000	3648000	you can clearly say this is better, this is worse.
3648000	3650000	Yes, but
3650000	3652000	if you just want to show features,
3652000	3654000	it looks like they all work.
3654000	3656000	And they all work pretty good.
3656000	3658000	I think.
3658000	3660000	OK, got it.
3660000	3662000	Because the way I compare here
3662000	3664000	is that every time
3664000	3666000	I go to see the correlation
3666000	3668000	of different methods.
3668000	3670000	And for different people,
3670000	3672000	I compare their correlation
3672000	3674000	and then
3674000	3676000	conclude which method
3676000	3678000	is better.
3678000	3680000	This is my current approach.
3680000	3682000	It's simpler,
3682000	3684000	but it might not be the best.
3688000	3690000	Hello?
3690000	3692000	Yes, if we have a better
3692000	3694000	I'll ask you again.
3694000	3696000	OK.
3696000	3698000	We can discuss later.
3698000	3700000	OK, thank you.
3700000	3702000	OK, I'll continue.
3702000	3704000	OK, so just now
3704000	3706000	I used the correlation to see
3706000	3708000	different methods
3708000	3710000	and their overall performance.
3710000	3712000	Here I just put all
3712000	3714000	the subjects I tested
3714000	3716000	together.
3716000	3718000	Just now Shaoming mentioned
3718000	3720000	that my data increase
3720000	3722000	will be good.
3722000	3724000	So I went to test
3724000	3726000	if the size of my database
3726000	3728000	just now
3728000	3730000	is different.
3730000	3732000	The way I did it
3732000	3734000	is that I cut off
3734000	3736000	some data
3736000	3738000	from my database.
3738000	3740000	Randomly cut off some data
3740000	3742000	and use the subject as a unit.
3742000	3744000	I'll see if my method performance
3744000	3746000	will increase
3746000	3748000	when the subject increases.
3748000	3750000	Y-axis is the average
3750000	3752000	correlation coefficient.
3752000	3754000	Blue is the traditional method.
3754000	3756000	Use your own data
3756000	3758000	to train a model.
3758000	3760000	Red is our
3760000	3762000	method of subject transfer.
3762000	3764000	Grey is the same
3764000	3766000	subject transfer, but without
3766000	3768000	our baseline activity
3768000	3770000	to choose those models.
3770000	3772000	You can see that
3772000	3774000	our method
3774000	3776000	will increase
3776000	3778000	when the size increases.
3782000	3784000	But if you don't use
3784000	3786000	the baseline correction,
3786000	3788000	it will be a little worse.
3788000	3790000	A little worse.
3794000	3796000	Then continue to talk about
3796000	3798000	the next picture.
3798000	3800000	I will compare
3800000	3802000	if we do this,
3802000	3804000	will the calibration time be reduced?
3804000	3806000	Traditionally, you have to
3806000	3808000	record your own data.
3808000	3810000	If we want to record
3810000	3812000	the alertness to become drowsy,
3812000	3814000	it takes a long time.
3814000	3816000	Traditionally, it takes a long time
3816000	3818000	to get the data you need.
3818000	3820000	This will cause
3820000	3822000	a long calibration time.
3822000	3824000	Our new method is to
3824000	3826000	use baseline activity.
3826000	3828000	It's easy to get baseline activity.
3828000	3830000	Just don't move.
3830000	3832000	Less than two minutes of data
3832000	3834000	The past method
3834000	3836000	is about 18 minutes.
3838000	3840000	There is no difference.
3840000	3842000	My conclusion
3842000	3844000	is that I can reduce it
3844000	3846000	from 18 minutes to
3846000	3848000	less than two minutes.
3848000	3850000	In terms of calibration reduction,
3850000	3852000	subject transfer can give us this effect.
3852000	3854000	In this case,
3854000	3856000	we really need to use our brain
3856000	3858000	to predict alertness.
3858000	3860000	It will be much better
3860000	3862000	if we use our brain to
3862000	3864000	predict alertness.
3864000	3866000	There is another question
3866000	3868000	that people often ask.
3868000	3870000	This hat looks like this.
3870000	3872000	No one wants to wear it.
3872000	3874000	Is there a better way
3874000	3876000	to measure our brain?
3876000	3878000	I was thinking
3880000	3882000	that when we measure our brain,
3882000	3884000	hair is a big problem.
3884000	3886000	If we avoid hair,
3886000	3888000	we can use some simple devices.
3888000	3890000	We can also use
3890000	3892000	these sensors
3892000	3894000	on our skin.
3894000	3896000	If we can use these
3896000	3898000	to measure our brain,
3898000	3900000	more people will be willing to use it.
3900000	3902000	You don't have to damage your hair.
3902000	3904000	It won't be uncomfortable.
3906000	3908000	I tested that
3908000	3910000	if I only use the front ear and
3910000	3912000	these channels next to the ear,
3912000	3914000	there are only six channels.
3914000	3916000	Can I use these six channels
3916000	3918000	to make a comparison
3918000	3920000	with the two heads
3920000	3922000	with 32 channels?
3922000	3924000	I found that
3924000	3926000	if you only use the channels
3926000	3928000	without hair,
3928000	3930000	the classification accuracy
3930000	3932000	can be the same
3932000	3934000	as the classification
3934000	3936000	with all channels.
3936000	3938000	There is no significant difference.
3938000	3940000	So we can actually
3940000	3942000	use the BCI
3942000	3944000	on alertness
3944000	3946000	or these channels
3946000	3948000	with no hair.
3948000	3950000	This way,
3950000	3952000	our device can be more convenient.
3954000	3956000	Here are some problems
3956000	3958000	that we need to solve
3958000	3960000	when we really want to use it.
3960000	3962000	The first one is
3962000	3964000	to reduce the calibration time
3964000	3966000	by using subject transferring.
3966000	3968000	Here we verify that
3968000	3970000	we don't need to use so many channels.
3970000	3972000	We can do this
3972000	3974000	with only one channel.
3978000	3980000	Here is a demonstration
3980000	3982000	of how our future
3982000	3984000	system will work.
3984000	3986000	We just mentioned
3986000	3988000	that we use response time
3988000	3990000	as a ground truth
3990000	3992000	for our alertness.
3992000	3994000	To be more precise,
3994000	3996000	I plan to use the distribution
3996000	3998000	of response time
3998000	4000000	as alertness
4000000	4002000	to define our alertness.
4002000	4004000	So if your distribution is shorter
4004000	4006000	and the peak
4006000	4008000	is shorter,
4008000	4010000	the y-axis is
4010000	4012000	the response time
4012000	4014000	and the unit is the second.
4014000	4016000	So if this is a very narrow distribution,
4016000	4018000	it is a better alertness.
4018000	4020000	If the distribution
4020000	4022000	is very wide,
4022000	4024000	it is easier to have
4024000	4026000	a longer response time,
4026000	4028000	which is a bad alertness,
4028000	4030000	and then
4030000	4032000	here is
4032000	4034000	a demonstration
4034000	4036000	that my black line
4036000	4038000	is my now,
4038000	4040000	and then I use
4040000	4042000	the previous
4042000	4044000	brainwave data
4044000	4046000	to predict that
4046000	4048000	from now on to 90 seconds,
4048000	4050000	the distribution of
4050000	4052000	response time
4052000	4054000	is a
4054000	4056000	thing that
4056000	4058000	will change
4058000	4060000	over time.
4060000	4062000	Then
4062000	4064000	when this time
4064000	4066000	passes, I can use some
4066000	4068000	offline tests
4068000	4070000	to see
4070000	4072000	if my response time
4072000	4074000	really falls
4074000	4076000	at a relatively high rate.
4076000	4078000	These white dots
4078000	4080000	are the response time
4080000	4082000	that we draw
4082000	4084000	based on
4084000	4086000	this, and you can play it a little bit.
4096000	4098000	OK, so you can see
4098000	4100000	that now this is
4100000	4102000	its distribution is
4102000	4104000	narrower, so the color here is
4104000	4106000	also more obvious, and then this is
4106000	4108000	the response time we actually recorded.
4108000	4110000	It is easier to fall
4110000	4112000	within this range,
4112000	4114000	in a better state of
4114000	4116000	alertness, and then
4116000	4118000	as time goes by, we can see that
4118000	4120000	this person's
4120000	4122000	distribution keeps drifting
4122000	4124000	and then finally becomes wider,
4124000	4126000	which means that
4126000	4128000	he is not in a good condition.
4138000	4140000	I'm starting to
4140000	4142000	sleep.
4144000	4146000	Like this,
4146000	4148000	it's
4148000	4150000	like this,
4150000	4152000	it's
4152000	4154000	like this,
4154000	4156000	its distribution has become wider,
4156000	4158000	and then this side is also blurred.
4158000	4160000	Then you can also see that
4160000	4162000	there are some
4162000	4164000	long response times,
4164000	4166000	which means that
4166000	4168000	our prediction is roughly
4168000	4170000	real data
4170000	4172000	to verify that this prediction
4172000	4174000	is correct.
4180000	4182000	It will keep going.
4182000	4184000	This is a bit
4184000	4186000	like a weather forecast,
4186000	4188000	we go to its learnings to make a forecast.
4190000	4192000	Does anyone have any questions here?
4194000	4196000	Sorry, this forecast is
4196000	4198000	a few seconds ago, I might have missed it.
4198000	4200000	OK, this black line is now,
4200000	4202000	so I'm going forward
4202000	4204000	to predict 90 seconds,
4204000	4206000	and within 90 seconds, its probability distribution is here.
4206000	4208000	Yes, so let's see
4208000	4210000	that I predicted like this in the front,
4210000	4212000	and then the real response time
4212000	4214000	is it just below the one I just predicted?
4214000	4216000	OK, OK.
4216000	4218000	This is the distribution I just predicted.
4218000	4220000	Then I
4222000	4224000	plan to continue
4224000	4226000	to do it.
4226000	4228000	I hope that this thing can really
4228000	4230000	be used in
4230000	4232000	many applications.
4232000	4234000	In addition to driving,
4234000	4236000	many jobs that require
4236000	4238000	attention and focus
4238000	4240000	may be able to use this thing.
4240000	4242000	In addition, I also want to
4242000	4244000	use this thing to see
4244000	4246000	if there is a way to
4246000	4248000	actually see if our brain
4248000	4250000	uses
4250000	4252000	the change of
4252000	4254000	learning
4254000	4256000	to see if it has anything to do
4256000	4258000	with learning.
4258000	4260000	Or we can look at
4260000	4262000	ADHD or other
4262000	4264000	more specific people,
4264000	4266000	are they different
4266000	4268000	from normal people
4268000	4270000	in this part of
4270000	4272000	learning?
4272000	4274000	Take learning as a tool
4274000	4276000	to see if
4276000	4278000	different groups
4278000	4280000	have different differences.
4280000	4282000	I would like to thank
4282000	4284000	many people and the lab
4284000	4286000	and my funding is mainly
4286000	4288000	sponsored by Lu Jun.
4288000	4290000	Thank you all.
4294000	4296000	Thank you, thank you.
4296000	4298000	And applause, great.
4298000	4300000	Do you have any questions?
4300000	4302000	You can ask now.
4304000	4306000	Questions.
4306000	4308000	There are some comments.
4308000	4310000	The first one is a small question.
4310000	4312000	You said it was sponsored by Lu Jun,
4312000	4314000	is it the United States?
4314000	4316000	The project sponsored by
4316000	4318000	Lu Jun in the United States.
4318000	4320000	I'm just curious.
4320000	4322000	Are you an American?
4322000	4324000	No,
4324000	4326000	this project
4326000	4328000	is not sensitive.
4332000	4334000	So it can
4334000	4336000	have a project
4336000	4338000	with many schools
4338000	4340000	to help Lu Jun do things.
4340000	4342000	He donated money to many schools
4342000	4344000	to help him do things.
4344000	4346000	This project mainly wants to
4346000	4348000	look at the brain interface
4348000	4350000	and how to use
4350000	4352000	sound science
4352000	4354000	in some situations.
4354000	4356000	I see.
4356000	4358000	At least in physics
4358000	4360000	or astronomy,
4360000	4362000	if there is
4362000	4364000	military sponsorship,
4364000	4366000	they usually have a lot of
4366000	4368000	work to do.
4368000	4370000	Who is your nationality?
4370000	4372000	What is your nationality?
4372000	4374000	What is your background?
4374000	4376000	Yes, they have a lot of projects
4376000	4378000	that require citizenship.
4378000	4380000	The unit that gave us the money
4380000	4382000	requires you to be a citizen
4382000	4384000	to work there.
4384000	4386000	Even PR is not allowed.
4386000	4388000	I see.
4388000	4390000	I have something
4390000	4392000	that I find interesting.
4392000	4394000	I think
4394000	4396000	if I were to do something
4396000	4398000	in the future,
4398000	4400000	for example,
4400000	4402000	this person has started to hallucinate.
4402000	4404000	We all have this experience.
4404000	4406000	You sit next to a co-driver
4406000	4408000	and the driver starts to hallucinate.
4408000	4410000	You say, hey, don't sleep.
4410000	4412000	But the idiot
4412000	4414000	wakes up and brakes.
4414000	4416000	It's actually very dangerous.
4416000	4418000	So I think
4418000	4420000	the reaction of Awakening
4420000	4422000	to make this whole thing
4422000	4424000	a complete and useful thing
4424000	4426000	is a very important part, I think.
4426000	4428000	Yes, well said.
4428000	4430000	Yes, we also saw
4430000	4432000	that if it was
4432000	4434000	during sleep,
4434000	4436000	we used sound to wake him up
4436000	4438000	to see if it was useful
4438000	4440000	after waking him up.
4440000	4442000	But we didn't really see
4442000	4444000	what you said.
4444000	4446000	Braking randomly.
4446000	4448000	Yes, but I think it's possible.
4448000	4450000	Yes, it's possible.
4450000	4452000	Yes.
4452000	4454000	That's my suggestion.
4456000	4458000	I have two questions.
4462000	4464000	Okay, I have two questions.
4464000	4466000	The first question is
4466000	4468000	related to your hardware.
4468000	4470000	You mentioned that
4470000	4472000	if you only use a few channels
4472000	4474000	without covering the hair,
4474000	4476000	the effect is the same.
4476000	4478000	Do you use dry electrodes
4478000	4480000	to measure signals?
4482000	4484000	In my research,
4484000	4486000	I use the same electrodes
4486000	4488000	for all of them.
4488000	4490000	They're all wet electrodes.
4490000	4492000	I just look at the results
4492000	4494000	from different locations.
4494000	4496000	Because I have to compare,
4496000	4498000	I still use the same method
4498000	4500000	to measure.
4500000	4502000	Because I actually
4502000	4504000	went to San Diego a few years ago
4504000	4506000	and he showed us
4506000	4508000	his lab
4508000	4510000	using the dry electrodes
4510000	4512000	for baseball caps.
4512000	4514000	Baseball caps?
4514000	4516000	Baseball caps are the most primitive form.
4516000	4518000	But they mainly
4518000	4520000	turn electrodes into dry electrodes
4520000	4522000	so they don't need to be covered.
4522000	4524000	So I'm curious
4524000	4526000	about your current experiment.
4526000	4528000	Is there anyone
4528000	4530000	still using dry electrodes?
4530000	4532000	Or most of them are still covered?
4532000	4534000	In fact, dry electrodes
4534000	4536000	are becoming more and more popular.
4536000	4538000	Because people find it useful.
4538000	4540000	It takes less time.
4540000	4542000	And
4542000	4544000	subjects like it more.
4544000	4546000	But it's not necessarily more comfortable.
4546000	4548000	Because dry electrodes
4548000	4550000	usually need
4550000	4552000	some special design
4552000	4554000	on the hair
4554000	4556000	to pass through the hair.
4556000	4558000	So a lot of dry electrodes
4558000	4560000	make some corners,
4560000	4562000	deep corners,
4562000	4564000	and longer hair.
4564000	4566000	So it's not comfortable to wear for a long time.
4566000	4568000	So I specialize in
4568000	4570000	the part without hair
4570000	4572000	because there are a lot of
4572000	4574000	choices for the sensor
4574000	4576000	because it doesn't need to deal with hair problems.
4576000	4578000	And for the
4578000	4580000	adhesive type,
4580000	4582000	it's better for
4582000	4584000	long-term measurement.
4584000	4586000	Because most people
4586000	4588000	wear dry electrodes
4588000	4590000	and they start to feel pain
4590000	4592000	after a few hours.
4592000	4594000	Okay.
4594000	4596000	My second question
4596000	4598000	is a bit of a disaster question.
4598000	4600000	Most of the BCAAs I've seen
4600000	4602000	are taken signals from the brain
4602000	4604000	and transmitted to the computer
4604000	4606000	for related processing
4606000	4608000	or other applications.
4608000	4610000	But is it possible that
4610000	4612000	in the future, or is there anyone
4612000	4614000	who is already doing it?
4614000	4616000	It's a bit like the opposite.
4616000	4618000	So the BCAAs are being taken signals
4618000	4620000	and transmitted to the human brain
4620000	4622000	to try to manipulate human behavior.
4622000	4624000	Yes.
4624000	4626000	There are a few non-BCAAs.
4626000	4628000	I'm talking about non-BCAAs
4628000	4630000	because BCAAs are directly
4630000	4632000	transmitted to the computer.
4632000	4634000	Non-BCAAs
4634000	4636000	have a kind of TMS,
4636000	4638000	which is a pass-through magnetic field.
4638000	4640000	It uses a very strong magnetic field
4640000	4642000	to try to
4642000	4644000	trigger
4644000	4646000	brain activity
4646000	4648000	in a certain area.
4648000	4650000	At the moment,
4650000	4652000	we know
4652000	4654000	that
4654000	4656000	the doctor
4656000	4658000	can look for
4658000	4660000	the magnetic field
4660000	4662000	in a certain area
4662000	4664000	and your hand will move.
4664000	4666000	But
4666000	4668000	this thing
4668000	4670000	hasn't been
4670000	4672000	fully studied.
4672000	4674000	So what changes
4674000	4676000	can it cause?
4676000	4678000	There is not much
4678000	4680000	relevant evidence at the moment.
4680000	4682000	So it's still under development.
4682000	4684000	Can I say something?
4684000	4686000	Yes.
4686000	4688000	Someone in our lab has done this.
4688000	4690000	I haven't done it myself.
4690000	4692000	But basically,
4692000	4694000	it's close to a one-to-one response.
4694000	4696000	For example, if you stimulate
4696000	4698000	the visual cortex,
4698000	4700000	some people will see crossfade,
4700000	4702000	which is a flash.
4702000	4704000	As mentioned earlier,
4704000	4706000	if you stimulate the motor,
4706000	4708000	it will move in a certain area.
4708000	4710000	You can find out which finger moves.
4710000	4712000	For example, if you stimulate a certain area,
4712000	4714000	it will map out
4714000	4716000	which finger moves.
4718000	4720000	For hearing,
4720000	4722000	relatively few people
4722000	4724000	have done it.
4724000	4726000	For example, compared to EEG or MRI,
