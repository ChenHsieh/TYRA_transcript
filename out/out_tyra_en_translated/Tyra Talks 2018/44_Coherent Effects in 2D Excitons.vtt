00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
First of all, I would like to welcome everyone to our Chira Talk on August 4th.

00:09.000 --> 00:17.000
We are honored to have Jason Hong, a student from Hong Shi An University, to give a speech on his latest research.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Before we start, let me briefly introduce Jason.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Jason graduated from the University of Taiwan in the Department of Physics.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
He did his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
He is currently working as a postdoc in Michigan.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
His current field of expertise is the application of super fast light in solid matter.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
His main research topics include graphene optical sensors,

00:50.000 --> 01:01.000
coherent exotonic effects in 2D materials, and cavity exotonic polaroids.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
In today's talk, he will introduce some basic principles and applications of super fast light.

01:06.000 --> 01:18.000
He will use super fast light and light-matter interactions to understand the dynamics of electrons in solid state physics.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
He will also discuss related research in super fast light and exotonic effects.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
If there are no further questions, let's welcome Jason to start his talk.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Hello everyone.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
I am very happy to be invited to Chira Talk.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.

01:45.000 --> 01:56.000
Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
This is today's outline.

02:06.000 --> 02:24.000
In the beginning, I will talk about what super fast light is, the history of super fast light, and a very important technique called pump probe measurement.

02:24.000 --> 02:44.000
On the other hand, I will briefly explain what is special about the acetone in the coherent exotonic materials.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Finally, I will talk about my recent research.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
In the coherent exotonic materials, there are not only acetone, but also biacetone effects.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
I will start with super fast light.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
The so-called super fast light is actually a super fast phenomenon that uses light to study the extremity of time.

03:08.000 --> 03:18.000
Generally speaking, the definition of a super fast phenomenon is the phenomenon between a femtosecond and a picosecond.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
We call it a super fast phenomenon, but there is no clear definition.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
Femtosecond is 10 to the power of negative 50 square seconds, and picosecond is 10 to the power of negative 20 square seconds.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
However, we will briefly introduce the extent of time later.

03:35.000 --> 03:45.000
The main reason why we use light to study these super fast phenomena is that there are many super fast phenomena that cannot be observed in other ways.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
For example, the general method of electrolysis.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
Everyone knows that electrolysis is basically to charge.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
The charging time is actually around nanoseconds.

04:01.000 --> 04:16.000
For example, the switch speed of these computers is about gigahertz, and gigahertz is about nanoseconds.

04:16.000 --> 04:28.000
Even if the electrolysis is done well, the time you can observe is only about nanoseconds.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
There is no way to do better.

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
If you want to observe these super fast phenomena with a shorter time period, you have to use light.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
At this time, we have a technique called pump-up technique, and we can use it to observe these super fast phenomena.

04:50.000 --> 05:01.000
Basically, in my own concept, light is basically photography, which is the art of capturing light.

05:01.000 --> 05:09.000
For example, when we usually shoot small objects, this is called micro light.

05:09.000 --> 05:19.000
When we turn a black and white camera into a color camera, what we are actually doing is photography.

05:19.000 --> 05:29.000
We can study the reaction of a object to a different amount of light with different energy.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
This is called photography.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
The meaning of super fast photography is actually high-speed photography.

05:35.000 --> 05:44.000
For example, when we watch TV, when a baseball player throws a ball, he basically uses high-speed photography to do these things.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Super fast photography basically uses high-speed photography to the extreme.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
What is photography?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
There is a picture here.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Basically, photography is that you have a light source, and the light source shines on your object, on your model.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
The model will reflect light or penetrate light.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
People don't penetrate light, so this is reflected light.

06:07.000 --> 06:17.000
In the end, the reflected light is taken down by the photographer with these cameras.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
This is called photography.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Sometimes you need something else.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
For example, you need another assistant to remind your model to remember to smile.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
When you add all these things together, this is called photography.

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
When it comes to super fast photography, I have to talk about the interesting history.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
A long time ago, people had a question.

06:46.000 --> 06:59.000
When a horse is running, is it possible that when the horse is running, the four legs will float in the air for a moment?

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
It may not seem like a problem now, but you may think it's not useful at all.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
This was in the 1870s.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
These people were very passionate about racing horses.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
This was a very interesting question at the time.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
People wanted to know how the horse ran.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
But you can't see it with your eyes.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
You can't record it and tell everyone how the horse ran.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
At that time, there was a man named Leland Stanford.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
He was the governor of California.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
He thought that when the horse was running, the four legs might float in the air for a moment.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But no one believed him.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Leland Stanford was very rich.

08:01.000 --> 08:16.000
He asked Edwin Muybridge, who was a photographer, to research how to capture these fast things.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
He gave him a $25,000 research fund.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I think it was a huge amount of money at the time.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
After several years of hard work, Muybridge invented the shutter.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
The picture on the left is the shutter he invented.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Basically, it's a few boards.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
He used a mechanical method to make the board fall.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
When the board falls, it blocks the light.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
When the light does not pass, it means that the camera will not continue to expose the light.

08:55.000 --> 09:04.000
The shutter speed can be up to 500 microseconds.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
This is where he did the experiment.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Basically, it's a racecourse.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The horse will run from here to here.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
There are 24 cameras.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Each camera has a shutter.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
When the horse runs like this, it will take pictures like this.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Then he got a picture like this.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
Basically, you can see that there are 12 pictures here.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
This is the continuous process of the horse running.

09:39.000 --> 09:48.000
You can see that these two pictures clearly show that the horse's four legs are in the air.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
But it's definitely not like the picture above.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
This is a very wrong concept.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
When the horse is in the air, it's definitely not the state of the legs.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
It's probably the situation where the legs are shrunk.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
This is an interesting story.

10:08.000 --> 10:19.000
In that era of super fast light, the method was to take a light source and take a picture of the object you wanted to take.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
How do we choose which time to take a picture?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Use a mechanical shutter.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
The shutter switch is very fast.

10:31.000 --> 10:38.000
At this time, we can take a picture that is short in time.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
But everyone found that the mechanical shutter has a limit.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Basically, you can't do it faster than microseconds.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
The next time is nanosecond.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
How to enter this nanosecond?

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
An important invention is the light bulb.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
The light bulb was invented in 1880.

11:08.000 --> 11:17.000
So it was before Moonbridge.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
What is a light bulb?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Light is produced by electricity.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Of course, ordinary light bulbs can't do this.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
But the next invention is this.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
We can use electricity to produce light.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
So we can adjust this electricity.

11:36.000 --> 11:41.000
The light we produce is a form of pulse.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
You can turn on this light at a certain time and turn off this light at another time.

11:48.000 --> 11:58.000
You can use this pulse to hit your object.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
When the object is reflected back to the camera,

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
you just need to turn off the shutter when the pulse stops.

12:08.000 --> 12:16.000
In this way, you can measure the time it takes for the pulse to stop.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
This method is called frequency-shift observation.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
The main concept is that we can't quickly adjust the shutter of the camera.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So we change it to adjust the light source.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
Here are some photos of stroboscopes.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
This is basically what you see in many photo studios.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
On the left is a woman waving a golf club.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
This speed is also very fast.

12:54.000 --> 13:03.000
Basically, every frame is your flashlight hitting the woman.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Then it reflects back and you take a picture.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
At the next moment, the next pulse hits the woman and you take another picture.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
This inventor is a professor at MIT named Edgerton.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
He has a nickname called Papa Flash.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Basically, Flash is Flashlight.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
It's the light source you need for frequency-shift observation.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
This method was invented in 1931.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
The picture on the right is an example.

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
You can use this method to take a picture of the state of the bullet in the air.

13:53.000 --> 14:04.000
We use frequency-shift observation to reach the level of nanoseconds.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
How do we get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds?

14:09.000 --> 14:19.000
The first thing is why we are particularly interested in picoseconds and femtoseconds.

14:20.000 --> 14:31.000
It's because there are many physical phenomena that occur at this time.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
For example, phonon vibration.

14:35.000 --> 14:43.000
The vibration of the metal in this material is actually at the level of picoseconds.

14:44.000 --> 14:54.000
There are also a lot of electrons in this material.

14:54.000 --> 15:08.000
The events of activation and relaxation are actually at the level of femtoseconds.

15:08.000 --> 15:18.000
This is why we want to get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds.

15:18.000 --> 15:30.000
The main discovery that can break through nanoseconds is the discovery of magnetic laser.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
Laser is basically a game media.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
When the light passes through the game media, the light becomes stronger because of the feedback of the game media.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
If you put the light in an optical cavity,

15:50.000 --> 16:05.000
The optical cavity is basically made up of two high-reflection mirrors.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
At this time, it becomes a laser.

16:08.000 --> 16:20.000
Of course, we want the laser to output, so we use a semi-transparent mirror on one side to let the laser pass through.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
At this time, you have a laser.

16:23.000 --> 16:33.000
Another interesting thing is that when you have a cavity,

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
What frequency of light can become a laser?

16:40.000 --> 16:50.000
The important thing is that when the light passes through the cavity,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
How to make it a coherent line?

16:55.000 --> 17:15.000
The condition is that when the light passes through the cavity, the light-returned phase is the same.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
This is the condition.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
We can convert it to frequency.

17:28.000 --> 17:38.000
At this time, you can see that the allowed optical mode is actually a positive integer.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
Multiply by c divided by 2L, where L is the length of the optical cavity.

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
I have a question.

17:52.000 --> 18:00.000
What kind of material is the game media?

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
There are many kinds of game media.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
We can see all kinds of lasers on the market.

18:07.000 --> 18:15.000
For example, there are semi-transparent lasers, CO2 lasers, and hydrogen peroxide lasers.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
These are the game media.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Semi-transparent lasers are used as game media.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
CO2 lasers are used as game media.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
There are all kinds of game media.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
As long as there are four lasers, there are two conditions.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
The first condition is that there should be game media.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
The second condition is that there should be an optical cavity.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
All lasers are indispensable.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
There are many ways to do it.

18:53.000 --> 19:02.000
Can you give more details about the output coupler?

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
What is its main function?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Does it allow light to pass through?

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
The output coupler is actually a mirror.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
It's just a semi-transparent mirror.

19:20.000 --> 19:29.000
The first thing is that when the light travels through the cavity,

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
the gain should be greater than the loss.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
The reflection rate should not be too low.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
If the reflection rate is too low, the loss will be too high.

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
The gain should be greater than the loss.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
The output coupler can also leak some light.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
This creates a laser that can be used.

19:56.000 --> 20:09.000
It means that half of the light can pass through the cavity.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
This is the basic structure of a laser.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
The current laser looks completely different from this one.

20:18.000 --> 20:28.000
You can still point out what is game media, what is mirror, and what is its cavity.

20:28.000 --> 20:39.000
The frequency of light that can be allowed is the frequency mode of the equality space.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Let's see what happens.

20:42.000 --> 20:54.000
The picture above is a simulation of an optical mode in the cavity.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
This is the output of the laser.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
There is only one mode now.

20:59.000 --> 21:06.000
The difference between the two modes is c divided by 2L.

21:06.000 --> 21:13.000
You can see that the frequency of red and green are slightly different.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
If we add these two modes together,

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
you can see that there is a beating effect.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
You can see that there is something that looks like a pulse.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
When there are four modes, this is more obvious.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
These four modes are c divided by 2L.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
You can see that the pulse of the output of the laser is more obvious.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Now we can keep adding until there are 30 modes.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
You can see that there is a very obvious pulse here.

21:49.000 --> 21:56.000
The general ultrafast laser has hundreds or thousands of modes.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
This will make the pulse very obvious.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
Another thing is why this thing is called a lock mode laser.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
This is because when you add a lot of modes,

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
there is a condition that their phase must be fixed.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
Then these pulses will be formed.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
This blue line above

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
means that when the phase of these modes is locked,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
you will see that there is a pulse.

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
However, when each optical mode has a different phase,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
when they have a random phase,

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
you will see that this is probably a general CW laser.

22:47.000 --> 22:59.000
The invention of lock mode laser is surprising.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
The invention of lock mode laser was in the 1960s.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It was Charles Townes.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
They made Mesa or something.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
The first invention of lock mode laser was in 1965.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Five years after the invention of lock mode laser,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
everyone has already discovered this lock mode laser.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
After a period of time,

23:19.000 --> 23:27.000
everyone tried to shorten the pulse of the laser.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
In 1980,

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
a method called CPA was invented.

23:34.000 --> 23:43.000
It's called True Pulse Amplification.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
Basically, it stretches the laser pulse,

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
amplifies it, and compresses it.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
At that time,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
it took about 6 femtoseconds to make a die laser.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It was in 1985.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
Another technology was invented.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
It's called Tie Sapphire.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
It just changes the laser gain media.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
There are many reasons why Tie Sapphire is good.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Basically, it is a semiconductor laser.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
At that time,

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
the technology of Tie Sapphire made rapid progress.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
In 2000,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
it took about 4 femtoseconds.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
This is equivalent to a light oscillation.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
A light in a visible oscillation.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
This is a limit.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
There is no way to continue.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
The application of lock mode laser is very wide.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
The first application is to use the laser's pulse.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
It can be used for a short time.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Basically, it uses rapid pulses

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
to study atomic physics, solid physics,

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
chemical reactions, and so on.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
It can also be used for light communication

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
and higher harmonic generation.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Another direction is

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
because the pulse laser

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
collects energy that does not have a pulse time

25:35.000 --> 25:42.000
in the time that there is a pulse.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
This means that in the pulse time,

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
the laser beam will be very strong.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Generally, you can get the power

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
to 10 to the power of 8 or 10 to the power of 4.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
This can be used to do a lot of interesting things.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
If you have super strong light sources,

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
you can use it to do non-linear light studies.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Recently, some people want to do nuclear fusion.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
There are also laser cutting or cosmetic surgery.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
You can see that the picture on the right

26:20.000 --> 26:26.000
is basically the laser's peak power.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
It is the laser beam within the pulse time.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
It is also a very fast-growing laser.

26:39.000 --> 26:47.000
It can now reach the power of 1 terawatt.

26:47.000 --> 27:00.000
Of course, you can use the laser as a light source.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
Because the pulse time is very short,

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
you should be able to take very short pictures.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
But there is a problem here.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
The time is too short to figure out

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
how to trigger an event.

27:19.000 --> 27:25.000
How do you know when the event will happen?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
If you don't know when it will happen,

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
you can't take pictures at all.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
So the next question is

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
how to find the event you want.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
The general approach is like this.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
The picture on the right.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
We are using a pulse laser.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
It will emit a pulse.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
The red dot is a pulse.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
When the red dot reaches the beam splitter,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
the pulse will be divided into two parts.

28:00.000 --> 28:08.000
One part will go through the pump beam.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
The other part will go through the pull beam.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
The pump beam will hit the sample first.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
The pump beam will hit the sample first.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
After the pump beam hits the sample,

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
the pull beam will pass the sample

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
and reach the detector.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
What is the purpose of doing this?

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
We use pump beam to trigger the sample,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
such as electrons or electrons.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Anyway, no matter what we do,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
we generate an event.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
After a while,

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
we use pull beam to observe the event.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
Another thing you can do is

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
to adjust the time difference

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
between the pull beam and pump beam.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
You can adjust the time difference

29:18.000 --> 29:23.000
between the pull beam and pump beam.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
You will put the pull beam on a delay stage.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
When you adjust the delay stage,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
the pull beam will start to change.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Then you can see

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
the evolution of the event over time.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
For example,

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
this is a pump probe measurement on a pull beam.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
This is how it works.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Basically,

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
a pull beam with a wavelength of 800 nm

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
hits the sample.

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
Then you use a wavelength of 100 nm

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
as a probe.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
When the probe passes the sample,

30:13.000 --> 30:19.000
you use the detector to observe the pull beam.

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
To simplify it into a dynamic picture,

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
it looks like this.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
First, you use the pump beam

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
to stimulate the electron.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
When the electron decays for a while,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
you use the pull beam

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
to observe the graphene absorption

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
under the current situation.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
The experimental picture looks like this.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
When the time is zero,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
the pump beam and the pull beam

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
are in synch.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
This is when you get the biggest reaction.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
As time goes by,

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
the electron slowly relaxes

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
and decays back to its original state.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
I have a question.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Sorry.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Why does the curve

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
have a different direction?

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
This is the experimental detail.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Okay.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
This is not what I want to talk about.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
But this is an interesting thing.

31:37.000 --> 31:44.000
This is what the paper discusses.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
The blue line is graphene in charge neutral,

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
which means it is not doping.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
You can see this.

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
This should be the absorption increase.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
I can tell you that

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
this line represents the absorption increase.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
It means that when you hit an optical beam

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
to stimulate the electron,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
you will produce more carriers,

32:11.000 --> 32:19.000
resulting in a higher conductivity of graphene.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
When the conductivity increases,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
the absorption increases.

32:23.000 --> 32:30.000
The red line is graphene in doping state.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Why is it negative?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
It means that the absorption is decreasing.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
The reason is that

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
when you hit an optical beam,

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
you will increase the temperature of the electron.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
When the temperature of the electron increases,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
the conductivity will decrease.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Because it has more scattering.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
When the conductivity decreases,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
the absorption decreases.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Do you mean that it will produce photons?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Yes.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Okay. Thank you.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Basically,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
this means that

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
there are a lot of things to study

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
in the super fast speed.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Very interesting.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Thank you. Please go on.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
On the other hand,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I want to talk about

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
the two-dimensional semiconductor.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
The first two-dimensional material discovered is graphene.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
As you know,

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
graphene is made by the method of exfoliation.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Basically, you take a tape

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
and put the graphite on it.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Then you stick the tape on the substrate

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
and tear it up.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Then you will find that

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
there is a layer of graphene on the substrate.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
It looks like this.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Then you look under the microscope

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
and you can find these

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
only one-dimensional flakes.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
This is the band structure of graphene.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Another thing is

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
this is the band structure of graphene.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
There are two Dirac cones.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
There are two different Dirac cones.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
The reason for these two cones

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
is that

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
graphene has inversion symmetry

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
and time reversal symmetry.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
As a result,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
this conduction band

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
and valence band

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
will always have

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
a intersection point.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Basically,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
this thing

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
means that

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
graphene is always a metal.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
It is always a metal.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Metal is often bad

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
and can't do what we want to do.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Another thing is

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
because it has two different values,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
there is another degree of freedom

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
called pseudo-spin degree of freedom.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
This means that

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
you can put these messages

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
on these two different values.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
If you can manipulate this value,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
you can treat it as 0 and 1.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
For example, 0 is the k-value

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
and 1 is the negative k-value.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
The advantage of this thing is that

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
we used to use

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Electron's degree of freedom

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
to make computers.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Basically,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
the current computer

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
uses charge.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
When you turn on the transistor,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
the charge will flow.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
When you turn off the transistor,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
the charge will not flow.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
One of the things

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
we want to do in the future

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
is to use spin.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
When you turn on a switch,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
the spin-up electrons can pass

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and the spin-down electrons

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
cannot pass.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
There is a proposal

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
that we can also use

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Electron's degree of freedom

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
in the k-value

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
or negative k-value

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
as 0 or 1.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
However,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
the first thing is

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
that metal cannot do anything.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
We have to find a way

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
to open a gap.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
This is a saying.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
We want to find a semiconductor.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
One of the semiconductors

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
is called

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Transition Metal Dichotronate.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Basically,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
its lattice

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
is similar to graphene.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
One of its atoms

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
is transition metal,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
which is probably

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Mo or tungsten.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
The other

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
atom site

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
is sulfur

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
or selenium.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
At this time,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
you will find

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that this lattice structure

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
does not have

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
inversion symmetry.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You can't find a point

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
where the inversion symmetry

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
returns to its original state.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
This means

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
that it will open a gap.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
It turns out that

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
the basic structure

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
of this lattice structure

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
looks like this.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
It has a gap.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
There is no state

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
in the middle.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
This is a gap.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
However, it still has

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
k and negative k-value.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
You can still

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
use it

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
to make valetronics.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
However,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
you still have a semiconductor.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Because you have a semiconductor,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
you can still

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
study electrons.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Sometimes,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
you can study electrons.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Sometimes,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
you can reduce

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Fermi energy.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Fermi energy

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
is in the middle.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
At the same time,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
electrons and holes

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
form acetone.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Acetone is a particle

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
where electrons and holes

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
form.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
These properties

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
lead to

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Transition Metal Dichotomy.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Transition Metal Dichotomy

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
is one of the popular

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
research topics.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
We hope

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to use it

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
to make valetronics

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
or other

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
optoelectronics.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Our question is

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
that we are

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
using valetronics

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
to make valetronics.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Another interesting thing

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
about valetronics is

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
that

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
we mentioned acetone.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Acetone is an electron and a hole.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
You can imagine

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
that an electron and a hole

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
have coolant in them.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
They are heterogeneous.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That's why they are heterogeneous.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
When they are bound together,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
they release their energy.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
That's why their energy

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
is a little bit low.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
How much energy do they release?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It depends on

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
how strong

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
the electric field between them is.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
In the three-dimensional

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
semiconductor,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
there is a hole

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
and an electron.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Because of this,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the electric field

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
goes through

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
many other backgrounds.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
These backgrounds

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
cause the electric field to go down.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
The coolant interaction

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
between them is not very strong.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The binding energy goes down.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
In the two-dimensional material,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
you will find that

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
the electric field

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
between them is in the air.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
In the air,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
the electric field

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
is not screened.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
After the electron and hole

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
are bound together,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
a very good

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
acetone is formed.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
This is one of the reasons

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
why people want to study acetone.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Acetone is

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
similar to

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
the concept of

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
hydrogen.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
You may have

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
found acetone

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
in Galileo Arsenal.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Basically,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
this is

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
basically

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
an electron

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and a hole.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
They are not bound together.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
They have a continuum.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
The continuum is here.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Under this continuum,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
you will have

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
the electron and hole's

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
bound state.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
They have 1s, 2s, 3s,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
just like the hydrogen atom.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Under this spectrum,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
you will see

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
the spectrum of 1s, 2s, 3s.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
In the

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Transition Metal Dichotomy,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
there is the same thing.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
However,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
the effect is very strong.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
You can see

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
the energy scale

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
in the left picture.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The binding energy

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
is about

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
3-4 MeV.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
In the Transition Metal Dichotomy,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
we can't even see

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
the continuum.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
The reasonable

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
prediction is

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
that the binding energy

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
is about 300 MeV.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
You can only see

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
the first state

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and the second state.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
The next question is

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
that you have these values

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
and these acetones.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
What is the question?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
The question we want to ask is

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
whether we can

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
break the value degeneracy

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
We just mentioned

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
the value degeneracy.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
We just mentioned the value.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
However, the energy of

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
these two values is exactly the same.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
So,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
the question is

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
that if you store

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
the information in the value,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
but you don't

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
touch

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
the energy of the value,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
the information

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
will not change.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
The final result is the same information.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
This is basically

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
meaningless.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
What we want to do now is

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
that if you have a way

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
to store the information

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
in these values,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
if you use

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
some methods

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
to change

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
the energy of the acetone,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
then

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
you can read

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
the final result.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
The final result will be changed.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Depending on

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
the energy of the value,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
the information will change.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
This is called manipulation.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
One of the ways

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
is to use the magnetic field.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Using the magnetic field,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
you can pull

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
the energy of the value

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
on one side up

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
and the energy on the other side down.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Then you will see

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
that the red line

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
and the blue line

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
represent two values.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
When the magnetic field is zero,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
the two values are exactly the same.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
When you add a strong magnetic field,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
the energy of the two values

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
will be slightly separated.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
At this time,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
you can use

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
the magnetic field

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
to do valetronics.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Another thing is that

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
we want to ask

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
whether light

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
can do valetronics.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Another thing is that

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
in the valetronics,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
the acetone has

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
very strong valence.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Will the valence

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
affect the behavior of the machine?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
The reason

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
why I ask this question

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
is that

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
we have found similar things

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
in Galen-Arsenal.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
In Galen-Arsenal,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
you will have

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
various free electrons

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and holes.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
It is called plasma.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Then you will have some acetone.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
When the density of acetone

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
is high enough,

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
biacetone will appear.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Biacetone is

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
two acetone bonds

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
together.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
It is a bit like a hydrogen atom.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
When you have more

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
density,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
it will form a droplet atom.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
There are many acetone bonds.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
These

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
biacetone

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
quasiparticles

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
also have

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
some applications.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
In Galen-Arsenal's

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
quantum darts,

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
you can use these biacetones

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
to make entangled photons.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
You can also

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
use optical control

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
to change

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
the behavior

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
of acetone.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Next,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I want to answer

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
two questions.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
The first question

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
is...

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Sorry, I have a question.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Can we go back to the last page?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
You just said

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
that

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
if you want to break

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
the valley degeneracy,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
let's say

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
your sample is

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
molybdenum sulfide.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
If you want to break

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
the degeneracy,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
if I am an alloy

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
or some doping,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
will it break the degeneracy?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
If the material is not...

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
OK.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
If you want to break

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
the valley degeneracy,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
there is a

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
symmetry condition.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
The symmetry condition

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
for the valley degeneracy

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
is time-reversal symmetry.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
If your material

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
has time-reversal symmetry,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
it will have valley degeneracy.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Then,

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
time-reversal symmetry

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
will break the time-reversal symmetry.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
For doping,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
it is not exactly break.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Doping is not.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Doping is not.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
So, apart from the magnetic field,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
do you know any other factors?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Light.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Is that all?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
If so...

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I don't think so.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
And the current.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
The current is...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
If the current is long,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
it will break the time-reversal symmetry.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
So, if it has a lot of charge,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
the current...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
The current is...

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
The current is flowing.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
So, for example,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
when you are measuring,

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
if you apply a bias to it,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
it may...

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
This will slightly break.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
This is the valley hole effect.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
OK.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Thank you.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
You can continue.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
OK.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
The answer to the first question

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
is yes.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But this thing

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
is about optical stock effect.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Now,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
let's look at a very simple model.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
You have a...

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
a...

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
a material.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
It has a state.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
It has a black state called state A.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
It has a red state called state B.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
At this time,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
if you apply a light,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
it is non-resonant.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Then we

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
control the light's

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
frequency

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
under the

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
AB resonance.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Its energy will be under this.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
At this time,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
state A will produce a

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
virtual state under state B.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
state B

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
will also produce a virtual state

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
above state A.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
If you

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
consider these

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
dipole interactions,

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
if you

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
consider the two corresponding states,

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
these two states

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
will repel each other.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Usually, if you

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
write a matrix,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you add...

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The matrix's

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
cross-section represents two energies.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
The off-diagonal

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
represents

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
two...

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
represents their interactions.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
If you turn on the interactions,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
these two energies will be separated.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
The following

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
is the same.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
At this time, you will find that the red state

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
will move up and the black state will move down.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
When

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
you apply light,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
the transition

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
from black to red

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
will increase

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
its energy.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
It will blue shift.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
The quantity

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
of

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
the

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
blue shift

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
will

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
be determined

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
by this formula.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Basically, this formula

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
tells you that

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
it is equal to

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
how strong the light

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
is.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
It is equal to

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
detuning.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Detuning is the energy difference

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
between the AB resonance

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
and the light.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
This is called detuning.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
However,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
there is one thing.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
If you take these things

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
into numbers,

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
you will find that

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
this change is very small.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Therefore,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
it is true that you can use light

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
to change the energy of the machine,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
to change the energy of the acetone.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
However,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
because this change is too small,

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
you need to adjust the intensity

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
very, very strongly.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
The intensity of light is very, very strong.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Therefore, at this time, you need to sell

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
the laser to do this thing.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
Of course,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
someone has done this before.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
You can see

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
that this paper

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
was published in 1986.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
This is

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
basically

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
demonstrating

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
the optical star effect

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
on the gallium arsenide.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Basically,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
you take a piece of gallium arsenide

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
quantum well.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
The pump is 806 nm.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Its energy is lower

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
than

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
the energy of acetone.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Then,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
you use another beam of light,

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
which is a probe.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Its function is

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
to see

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
if your spectrum

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
is changing

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
when the pump is on.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You can see that

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
here

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
at negative 2 picoseconds,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
negative 2 picoseconds is this line.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Negative 2 picoseconds

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
means that

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
when you hit the probe,

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
your pump hasn't come yet.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Therefore,

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
its original spectrum

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
is two peaks.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
One is heavy acetone.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
The other is light acetone.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
This is acetone in gallium arsenide.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
When it's 0 picoseconds,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
it means that the pump

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
and the probe are

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
hitting the sample at the same time.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You can see that

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
the resonance of acetone

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
is getting smaller.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
The resonance of acetone

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
is getting smaller.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
It means that its energy

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
is getting bigger.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
When you turn off

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
the pump,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
when the pump

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
is at 1.2 picoseconds,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
the resonance

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
of acetone

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
moves back.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
This is an interesting effect.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
When you hit the pump,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
when you hit the pump,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
the resonance of acetone

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
moves slightly.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
When you turn off the pump,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
the resonance of acetone

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
moves back.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
What's the situation

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
in Transition Metal Dichotomy?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
What's the situation

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
in Transition Metal Dichotomy?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
What's the situation

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
in Transition Metal Dichotomy?

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
The two values

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
will correspond to

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
different helicity light.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
We can use

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
the left and right light

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
to distinguish the two values.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
We can do this.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
We choose

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
the left light.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
It only couples

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
to the K-value.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
We choose

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the light

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
which is lower than

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
the resonance of acetone.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
When there is light,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
the resonance of acetone

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
will slightly blue-shift.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
If we send

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
a probe

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
of the left light,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
we will see

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
a blue-shift.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
If we send a probe of the right light,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
the resonance of acetone

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
will slightly blue-shift.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
By using this method,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
we can break

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
the VAD degeneracy.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Let's try

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
to see if it's right.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
This is our sample.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
We choose

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
to use Moebillion Dicillinide

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
as our sample.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
We have

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
encapsulated

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Moebillion Dicillinide

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
in these two HBNs.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
It's in boron nitride.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
The reason why we do this

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
is that

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
there is a study

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
that says

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
in boron nitride,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
the quality

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
of Moebillion Dicillinide

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
is very good.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
This is the reason

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
why we do this.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
This is...

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Sorry.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Is it necessary

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
to use low temperature

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
in this kind of measurement?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Or can we use room temperature?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
You mean in this...

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Yes.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
We have this

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
in room temperature.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
We can see this

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
in room temperature.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
But some can't be seen.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
So...

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
We can't do

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
what we want to do.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
But

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
if it's Moebillion Dicillinide,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
it can be seen in room temperature.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Yes.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Will there be some...

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Because I always think...

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I don't know much about this.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Will there be some phonons in room temperature?

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Won't those affect

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
these observations?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
There is an important thing here.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
The light we emit is always

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
lower than the energy of acetone.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
So basically,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
it won't be absorbed

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
by the material.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It just passes through.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Okay.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So there won't be any phonons.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Yes.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
This is a very important question.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Okay.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Thank you.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
This is the sample's

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
reflectivity.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Basically,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
E-reflectivity is a solution.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You can see this is Moebillion Dicillinide

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
in room temperature.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
When we lower it

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
to low temperature,

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
you can see the peak

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
becomes narrower.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
The intensity of the peak becomes larger.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
The width of the peak

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
is about 5 MeV.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Compared to

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
before,

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
when we didn't

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
use boron-nitride

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
encapsulation,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
the line width of CVD

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
is about 30 MeV.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Without

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
encapsulation,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
the sample is about 10 MeV.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
When we

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
demonstrate the sample,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
the line width is about 5 MeV.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
This means the quality of the sample

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
is very good.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Another interesting thing

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
is that we can see

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
the absorption

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
curve.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
The absorption curve

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
changes from 30%

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
to very large.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We can even make it

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
close to 100% absorption.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
There are

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
other interesting questions,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
but I won't

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
talk about it today.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
If you are interested,

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
you can discuss it.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I have a small question.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Have you compared

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
the sample of CVD

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
with the sample of

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Isfoliade?

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
The quality?

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Yes.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
We have compared.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Generally speaking,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Isfoliade is better?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Yes, much better.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Much better means

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
if we measure

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
absorption or PL,

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
the line width of

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Isfoliade sample

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
is about 5 to 10 MeV.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
But the CVD

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
is about 30 MeV.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Is it because of some defects?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Yes,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
because

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
the CVD sample

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
has a lot of

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
inhomogeneous broadening.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
The source of inhomogeneous broadening

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
is basically those defects.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Yes.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Thank you.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
This is the

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
setup of PoundProbe.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
This is a simple diagram.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
On the left,

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
there is a laser.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
We divide it into two parts.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
One part is called PoundProbe.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
PoundProbe

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Because the laser

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
has a wide bandwidth,

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
we use a spectrometer

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
to divide the light.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
We only take

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
about 2 MeV of

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
line width light

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
and let PoundProbe

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
run to a delay stage.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
The other half of the light

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
is called Probe.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
We let it run to

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
a delay stage

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
and let it hit a Sapphire.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The role of Sapphire

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
is to make

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Probe light produce

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
nonlinear effect.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Then it will

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
basically change

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
the color of the light

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and it will

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
hit the sample

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
and study the sample.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Finally, we put the Probe light

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
into a spectrometer

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
to divide the light

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
and put it on

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
the detector.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
This is basically the picture on the right.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
We use

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
a picosecond

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
laser light

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
with a very sharp

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
line width light

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
to hit the sample.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Then we send

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
a Probe with many colors

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and this Probe

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
is very short,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
to hit the sample

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and study what we want to study.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The result is...

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The result is

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
something like this.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Let's take a look at

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
the picture in the middle.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The x-axis is

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
the delay,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
which is the time

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
between the Probe and the pump.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
The y-axis

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
is the delay.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
The x-axis is the energy,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
which is the energy

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
of the Probe light.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
We see

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
the red

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
or blue

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
represents

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
the difference

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
between the pump

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and the non-pump.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Let me explain

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
the meaning of this picture.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The first thing

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
is that

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
all the effects

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
occur within

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
1-1 picosecond.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
This means that

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
only the pump light

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
hits the sample

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and the non-pump light

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
hits the sample.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
This is a

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
coherent effect.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
This is

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
what we want to see.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
If you

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
draw a line

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
within 0 picosecond,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
you will get this.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
This

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
basically tells you

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
how the reflectivity

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
changes

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
when the pump and probe

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
hit the sample.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
We also have

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
the normal reflectivity of the sample.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
The reflectivity of the sample

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
without the pump.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
This is what we can measure.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
If we add

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
these two pictures,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
we can see that

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
the reflectivity

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
of the sample

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
increases

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
when there is a pump.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The reflectivity

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
of the sample

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
decreases when there is a pump.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Basically,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
this is a shift.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
The red part of the peak

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
increases

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and the blue part decreases.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
This means that

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
the peak is blue-shifted.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
This is a blue-shift

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
effect.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
To draw a picture,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
we use

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
a ready-tuner

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
sigma plus light.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
We probe

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
the k-value.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
At this time,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
the energy of the k-value

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
is blue-shifted.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
This is what the picture tells us.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
OK.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
another thing is

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
that

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
we have done this before.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
This is

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Berkeley's

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
group.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
There is another group,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
MIT's group.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
They have done this before.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
This measurement

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
shows that

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
if the intensity

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
of the pump

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
is very high,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
the blue-shift

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
is about 3 MeV.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
This 3 MeV

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
means that

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
we have talked about

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
using magnetic field

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
to break the value degeneracy.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
If you want

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
the energy

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
to change 3 MeV,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
you have to add 60 Tesla's

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
magnetic field.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
This is basically impossible.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Normally,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
you can't do

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
60 Tesla's magnetic field.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
However,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
we can

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
break the value

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
degeneracy

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
at this rapid rate.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
We can also

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
make the energy

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
shift very large.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
But

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
the previous research

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
showed that

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
k'-value

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
basically has no effect.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Because these two are not coupled,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
you will think that

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
it has no effect.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
However,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
we also found

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
some strange effects.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Because

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
the curve of k'-value

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
is the opposite

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
of the curve of k'-value,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
it means that

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
this is a redshift.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
When we use

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
sigma plus,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
k'-value is redshifted.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
The next thing

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
we want to talk about

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
is what happened.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
In addition to

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
making a light

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and observing it,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
we can also change

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
the energy of the reflected light.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
What we just showed

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
is detuning

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
equal to 50.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It's about this.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Omega x

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
is about 50 mEV.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
We see a redshift.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
However,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
when we increase

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
the photon energy

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
of the pump light,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
the detuning will decrease.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
The detuning will be slightly smaller.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
We see that

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
the peak becomes splitting.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
If we

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
adjust the photon energy

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
very close to

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
the resonance of acetone,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
we will find that

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
the curve is completely opposite.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It is a blueshift.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
What does this mean?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
When you see

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
a redshift to a blueshift,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
the first thought is

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
is this a new resonance?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Next,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
we need to ask

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
how to explain this phenomenon.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Let's go back

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
to the beginning.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
In the beginning,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
you have a light state.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You have K-value acetone.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You have K'-value acetone.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
When you insert

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
a sigma plus light,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
you will shift

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
the light state

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
down

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
and the K-value acetone up.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
This leads to

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
if you send

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
a sigma plus light

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
in,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
this will be a blueshift.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
But there is a question.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Why?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Theoretically,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
the light state will also

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
be a redshift.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
This means that

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
the K'-value should also be a blueshift.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Why

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
hasn't anyone noticed this?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
This means

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
that

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
this picture is wrong.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
When we

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
consider the

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Arpio Stark effect,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
in addition to

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
the light state,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
the K-value acetone,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
and the K'-value acetone,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
we need to consider more states.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
What are these?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
This is

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
a two-acetone state.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Basically,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
you can

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
excite another acetone.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
If you insert

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
a sigma plus light,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
you will have a K-acetone.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You will have an acetone in the K-value.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
If you insert

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
a sigma plus light,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
you can have

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
two acetones in the K-value.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You can also

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
insert a sigma plus light

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
and a sigma minus light.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You will have a K-value acetone.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You can also have

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
K'-value acetone

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
and K'-value acetone.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
These states

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
are actually

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
in your transition.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
They all need to be

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
considered.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
If you

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
consider like this,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
you will find that

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
the energy of K-value acetone

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
does not change.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Because you have a light state

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
that will move it up.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But you have

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
a two-acetone state

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
that pushes it down.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So it will actually

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
stay at a fixed energy.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
But your light state will move down

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
because it is moved down by K-value.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Your K'-value

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
will also move down.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
At this time, you will find that

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
if you insert a sigma minus light,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
the degree of moving down

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
is the same.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So the sigma here

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
should not change.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
The next question is that

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
in addition to these states,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
we know that there is another state

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
called bi-acetone.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
As explained earlier,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
bi-acetone is the interaction

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
between two acetones

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
to produce some binding energy.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
This binding energy

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
will make the state's

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
energy move down.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
This state

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
will also affect

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
the K'-value.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
We claim that

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
the experimental results we see

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
are from these bi-acetones.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
How do we explain this?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Let's go back to

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
the experimental data.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
We can see that

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
this is the detuning dependence.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
From left to right,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
it is redshift to blueshift.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
When it is redshift,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
the photon energy

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
is relatively small.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The photon energy

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
is relatively small.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So the pump

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
will have this effect

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
in addition to this effect.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
This effect

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
will cause a virtual state

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
above the K'-value.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It will push

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
the energy of the K'-value down.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
This will cause

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
the probe value

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
to redshift.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
When you move

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
the photon energy

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
of the pump

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
very close to the acetone,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
the virtual state

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
produced by

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
the bi-acetone

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
is below

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
the K'-value.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
If it is below the K'-value,

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
it will push

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
the K'-value

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
above the K'-value.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
At this time,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
you will see a blueshift.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
This is how we explain

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
our data.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
In the middle,

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
the photon energy

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
matches the

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
bi-acetone and acetone transition.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
When these two

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
energies match,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
the state will split.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
We can see that

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
there is a split here.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Based on this method,

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
we can determine

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
the difference

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
between the two-acetone state

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
and the bi-acetone state

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
energy.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
The energy difference

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
is the binding energy.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Based on the detuning result,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
the binding energy

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
is 20 MeV.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
This is similar to

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
what we have seen

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
in TMDC

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
to see the

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
effect of bi-acetone.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It matches

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
these effects.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The last thing we do

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
is to write

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
our theory

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
as an effective theory.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Because we are

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
experimentalists,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
we cannot write a complete theory.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
So we try to write

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
the interaction

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
of all these states.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Basically,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
we only consider

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
the transition

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
from ground state

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
to K'-value.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
The state related to

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
ground state

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
will change

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
the state of ground state,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
which is K'-value and ground state.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
This is a 2x2 matrix.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The state of K'-value

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
will change

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
the state of

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
free 2-acetone

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
and the state of

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
bi-acetone.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
This will form

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
a 3x3 matrix.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
If you solve this 3x3 matrix,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
you will get

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
this prediction.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
The picture on the left

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
shows the experiment.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
As you can see,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
the experiment matches the theory.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I want to emphasize

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
that this is an effective theory.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Many things are fitting.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
If there is a theory here,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I hope this theory

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
can help us

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
to calculate

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
how these parameters

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
come from.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This may involve

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
many-body theory.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
This is the conclusion.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Today, I talked about

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
the history of super-fast light theory

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
and the technique of pump-prop.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I also

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
showed you

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
the effect of

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
acetone in 2-acetone.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I hope

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
you can

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
understand

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
the value

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
of

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
valetronics.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Lastly,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
we demonstrated

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
that we can use light

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
to change

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
the value

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
of valetronics.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
We can

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
use our sample

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
to observe

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
the effect of acetone.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
What's left is

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
what we didn't talk about today.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I'm currently

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
studying

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
ultrafast optics.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I'm still

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
studying

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
2D materials.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Recently, I'm studying

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
photon-echo spectroscopy.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Another interesting thing

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
is that

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
what we talked about today

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
is the optical star effect.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It's acetone in photon dress.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
It's a very weak dress.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
There are other ways

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
to

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
put the

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
semiconductor

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
in the optical star.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
If you make the optical star very small,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
you can strongly

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
couple

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
photon and acetone.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
This is

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
acetone-polyurethane.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
This is

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
my recent research in Michigan.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I hope you can see

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
the effect of acetone-polyurethane.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
We also

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
did some applications.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
One of the concepts

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
is that we can use

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
graphene.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Basically, if you

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
add voltage to graphene,

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
the absorption of graphene

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
will change.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
We can use this method

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
to create optical sensors.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Recently,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
we put

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
neuron cells

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
on graphene.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Neuron cells

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
emit electrical signals.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Do you use love to generate electricity?

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
What?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
What do you mean by love?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Do you use love to generate electricity?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
In our experiment,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
we put the heart of a chicken

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
on graphene.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Basically,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
we put

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
something

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
that generates electricity

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
on graphene.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
We need to study your heart cells

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
or neurons.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Neurons

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
use electricity

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
to transmit messages.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
When these electrons

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
transmit messages,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
they also change

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
the absorption

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
of graphene.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
When we

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
turn on the light,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
we can see

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
if the neurons

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
are generating electricity.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
By using this method,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
we can detect

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
the signals

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
of brain cells.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
This is the main application

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
for biophysics.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
These are

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
my main collaborators.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
In Ann Arbor,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Hui Deng is my boss.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
In UC Berkeley,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Wang Feng is my boss.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
In Charcong Yang,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
we work together

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
to create

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
the optical star effect.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Thank you.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
This is a slide of

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
sigma plus and sigma minus

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
pump probe.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
On resonance,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
you can see a split state.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
In the middle of the slide,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
the two states

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
that split up

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
have a parity difference.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
In theory,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
in quantum optically split state,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
there should be

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
some selection rule

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
difference.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
These two states

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
should not...

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
We write

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
effective theory,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but according to

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
effective theory,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
there should be no change.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
The reason is

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
basically,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
this is

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
sigma plus.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
When you add

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
optical star effect,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
the remaining

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
is sigma plus.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Basically,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
these two states

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
should not change.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
For this state.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
This is my understanding.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
But of course,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
in fact,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
we did not do this experiment.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
If you probe

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
with sigma plus,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
you will...

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
This experiment is not easy.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
This experiment is not easy.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Because if you send

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
a probe with sigma plus,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
the most important effect

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
will be in ground state to k-value.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
This thing

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
is just a very small

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
change.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Of course,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
it is possible to do this experiment.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I'm not sure

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
if I can see the significant effect.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Thank you.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Because today's time

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
is a little over.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
So we will stop here today.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I will

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
temporarily pause the recording.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Thank you, Jason.
