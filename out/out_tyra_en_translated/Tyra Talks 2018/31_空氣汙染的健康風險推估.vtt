00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira speech. I am today's host, Lin Bo-xuan, and today I am very happy to invite our speaker, Huang Jiao-yan.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
He is now the first EQ in North Carolina to serve as Environmental Consultant.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
This speaker's self-introduction is actually quite cool.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
He has been in the air-conditioning environment research for more than ten years.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
Recently, he gave up atmospheric chemistry research and started to be a policy analyst civil servant.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Today he will share with us the story of Taichung Power Plant.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
The slogan is very simple, if you are afraid of death, you must listen carefully.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Then I will leave the time to Jiao-yan, thank you everyone.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
Before we start, I would like to applaud and encourage everyone to remember to turn on the sound so that the audience can hear.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Huang Jiao-yan is so handsome.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you, thank you.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Jiao-yan, please start your speech.

01:02.000 --> 01:21.000
Today, I would like to talk about the impact of certain fixed pollutants on the downstream or the overall health risks of Taiwan.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Why do I want to mention Taichung Power Plant?

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
The main reason is that Mr. Zhuang Bin-jie published an article a few years ago.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
He used his own air pollution model to run the Taichung Power Plant PN2.5.

01:37.000 --> 01:55.000
The PN2.5 is a model that shows the impact on the overall health risks of Taiwan.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
However, I think his analysis has some errors or bugs.

02:02.000 --> 02:27.000
The main reason I want to talk about Taichung Power Plant is that in the past two months, we have been discussing whether Taichung Power Plant should be converted to a natural gas or maintain the current super-nearby coal-fired power plant.

02:28.000 --> 02:38.000
Mr. Zhuang Bin-jie and Mr. Zhang Chang-chuen from Taichung Power Plant have done a lot of analysis.

02:38.000 --> 02:55.000
I would like to discuss with you what these studies tell us about the real content or the story.

02:55.000 --> 03:05.000
First of all, we need to discuss what air pollution is. Mr. Zhang Chang-chuen discussed what air pollution is in May.

03:05.000 --> 03:26.000
Simply put, any material that is unbearable in the atmosphere is air pollution. The U.S. Department of Environment now defines six standard pollutants, including carbon dioxide, SO2, PN2.5, and NOx.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
There are 187 harmful pollutants.

03:30.000 --> 03:47.000
These pollutants will be released into the atmosphere through man-made or natural emissions.

03:47.000 --> 04:14.000
Natural emissions include forest fires, VOCs, and chemical or physical reactions.

04:14.000 --> 04:29.000
At the end, the pollutants will descend back to the ground, causing the human body to breathe in the pollutants.

04:29.000 --> 04:39.000
There are two main levels of air pollution risk. One is inhalation, and the other is exhalation.

04:39.000 --> 04:51.000
Inhalation is very simple. For example, when you stand next to a car and the engine is turned on, NOx and particles are released, and you breathe in these pollutants.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
Most of these pollutants are not harmful to the human body, but they are long-term.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Another type of air pollution risk is intact.

05:04.000 --> 05:16.000
Intact pollutants are harmful air pollutants that are released into the atmosphere and descend back to the ground.

05:16.000 --> 05:29.000
These pollutants will be released into the air through biological accumulation, such as milk, fish, or fruits.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Most of these pollutants are not heavy metals, but they are organic.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
Today, we will focus on the inhalation part.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
We are currently discussing the PN2.5 and ozone part.

05:49.000 --> 06:05.000
Before discussing the Taiwan part, I would like to discuss the current distribution of global air pollution.

06:05.000 --> 06:15.000
This graph shows the global distribution of PN2.5 in 2013.

06:16.000 --> 06:25.000
In this area, there are mainly deserts, so there are relatively small particles.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
In China, it is mainly human-made pollutants such as fuel cells and mobile pollutants.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
In northern India, it is mainly human-made pollutants.

06:40.000 --> 06:52.000
In the Amazon, it is a natural pollutant, but it emits a lot of VOCs, which is volatile organic matter.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
These pollutants will be released into the atmosphere through light reflection to produce secondary particles.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
We will also see relatively high PN2.5 in non-rainforest areas.

07:09.000 --> 07:18.000
In the US, PN2.5 is relatively low.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
