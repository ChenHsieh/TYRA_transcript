Q&A

00:04.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, I am today's representative host, Zhang Yanyong, because our host, Zhang Jianyuan, he is actually more suitable, because he is doing Qubits, doing condensed matter, but he is now stuck on the road, he has no time for transportation, so I will represent the host.

00:23.000 --> 00:43.000
Let me introduce our speaker today. Our speaker today is Dr. Zeng Yuqing. The topic he is going to talk to us today is ... I want to read it right, wait a minute, I suddenly can't find it, wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:43.000 --> 01:08.000
Topological quantum phase transitions in Haldane spin chains. This is a very popular topic, because in 2016 or 2017, Topological Matter won the Nobel Prize, so we have always hoped that we could invite an expert to introduce to us what topological phases are.

01:08.000 --> 01:35.000
Then, Zeng Yuqing, in 2005, got a college degree from Donghai University, a physics major, right? Then he went to serve in the military, and then served in the military for 1.5 years, but he served in the military at Donghai University. Why?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
After I served in the military, I returned to Donghai University as a research assistant.

02:05.000 --> 02:23.000
Then there is a published paper in PRB, if you are interested, because I don't have that number, so you can directly ask our speaker for this thing. Then he transferred to Central University and completed his Ph.D. degree. The main function is also condensed matter theory.

02:23.000 --> 02:46.000
At present, Zeng Yuqing is at the University of Kent in the UK, and he is now focusing on numerical study on the time-reversal invariant fractional topological insulator. This is a very hot topic, so we don't have much to say, we applaud and welcome today's speaker. Oh, if you want to applaud or ask a question, remember to turn on the microphone.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
Let's get started. Today I prepared some props.

03:23.000 --> 03:34.000
I have some props. You can play with some props later.

03:53.000 --> 04:10.000
I will talk about some of the things I have done before, which will be more professional. First of all, what is physics?

04:10.000 --> 04:25.000
What we mainly learn in physics is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is like classical mechanics, which is mechanics, or kinetic mechanics of electricity, quantum mechanics, thermal mechanics, and statistical mechanics.

04:25.000 --> 04:44.000
This whole thing is actually studying the interaction between time, space, and matter. The interaction between matter has, for example, strong, weak, electromagnetic, or gravity.

04:44.000 --> 05:05.000
You can take the whole world, these substances, as if they were actors on stage. The stage is the background between time and space, and there will be some interaction between the actor and the actor.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
The whole thing will form a movie or a stage play.

05:15.000 --> 05:34.000
What about matter? This is from when I was very young, for example, in high school or elementary school, I learned that we can classify matter in this way.

05:34.000 --> 05:45.000
First, divide it into solid matter or mixtures. Mixtures, such as beer, milk tea, or air, are mixtures.

05:46.000 --> 05:57.000
For example, alcohol, water, and many other substances, such as beer, flowers, and so on.

05:57.000 --> 06:05.000
For example, most of the air is 4 out of 5 gas, and 1 out of 5 oxygen, for example.

06:06.000 --> 06:24.000
Pure matter can be divided into elements and mixtures. For example, the elements in the cycle table, such as gold, iron, oxygen, and O2.

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
For example, the previously well-known graphene, which is basically carbon.

06:34.000 --> 06:45.000
For example, alcohol is a mixture of alcohol and water.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
Alcohol has a chemical form, such as CH3CH2OH, which is alcohol.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
Chlorine is also a mixture of pure matter.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
Oxygen is also a mixture of pure matter.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
For example, ice is water, which is the solid of water.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
Ice is also pure matter, which is H2O.

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
This classification is probably a little bit of preliminary understanding of matter.

07:30.000 --> 07:38.000
To understand this understanding further, we can see that matter has many states.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
This state is called phase.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
There is a change between the phase and the phase, which is called phase change.

07:49.000 --> 08:01.000
For example, the ice or water we just talked about is under pressure in the horizontal axis and temperature in the vertical axis.

08:01.000 --> 08:10.000
For example, at the bottom of atmospheric pressure, below 0 ° C, it is solid.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
This side will be liquid and this side will be gas.

08:16.000 --> 08:25.000
The red line is from here, it will pass through a waste point and then become water vapor.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
From here, it will pass through this ice point and solidify into ice.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
For example, this picture.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Of course, you can't see the water vapor with your naked eye.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Because the water vapor is transparent and colorless.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
If it is connected to this water drop on the glass, it will become a liquid.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You can see that this is water.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
This is the water we usually see.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Ice is solid.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
This picture is in our present.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
It's snowing in the UK recently, and it's cold.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
After the snow, many people want to do an experiment.

09:20.000 --> 09:31.000
Put the liquid nitrogen on the snowman and then destroy it.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
See what the result is.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
In short, this picture of water should have been seen in elementary school.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I don't know if there is any problem.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
If not, I want to emphasize that there is a critical point here.

09:53.000 --> 10:18.000
The meaning of this critical point is that if the temperature and pressure are very high from here to the critical point, you will not be able to distinguish whether the water is a liquid or a gas.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
After this critical point, there is no red line.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
The red line on the left has been extended.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
This point stops at this critical point.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
So if this side is gas, this side is liquid, this side is solid.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
This line completely separates solid and liquid.

10:52.000 --> 11:01.000
But here you can adjust the temperature and pressure appropriately.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
Then let it slowly go around this critical point from here.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Then enter another item.

11:11.000 --> 11:25.000
In other words, the phase of the liquid and the phase of the gas are the same phase.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
The three-dimensional picture of water here is actually only two phases.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
There are only two images like this.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
There should be no problem.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
This is a relaxing video.

11:45.000 --> 11:59.000
A few days ago, we put the liquid and gas on the snowman.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Many people came to see.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
There are about 100 people here.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Other dramas have come to see.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I think this is interesting.

12:13.000 --> 12:24.000
You can see that gas is also a pure material.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
Pure materials have three-dimensional pictures of water like just now.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Now pour out the liquid and gas.

12:32.000 --> 12:40.000
The liquid and gas are about 70K.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
It's about 100 degrees below zero.

13:10.000 --> 13:28.000
The temperature of the ice is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.

13:28.000 --> 13:41.000
The temperature of the liquid and gas is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
The temperature is lower.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.000
You can see the picture of the liquid and gas.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
It is still solid.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
That's about it.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
What is a phase?

13:58.000 --> 14:08.000
What does it mean?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
You have an external parameter.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
For example, you just saw that there is temperature and pressure.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
You have an external parameter.

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
What is the state of a huge macro of this material?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
What are the external parameters?

14:28.000 --> 14:37.000
For example, temperature pressure, magnetic field, or external control.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
You can control the outside.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
For example, you add a power plant.

14:40.000 --> 14:49.000
Or you use other elements to replace these compounds.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
You do some mixing.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
This mixing can also be regarded as an external parameter.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Mainly these parameters.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
You made these modifications.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Will affect these.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Because the matter is composed of those atoms.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It is composed of those particles.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
You modified these external parameters.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Will affect the interaction between particles.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
What about the interaction between particles?

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
It will have different phases.

15:25.000 --> 15:37.000
The higher the temperature, the more chaotic the material is.

15:37.000 --> 15:52.000
But if you have an interaction, the material may have a different order.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
What is a macro state?

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
For example, the three-phase change just now.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
The three-phase change is the solid, solid, gas.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
But it's not just solid, solid, gas.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
It's a macro state.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
For example, conductivity.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Conductivity is also a macro state.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Magnetic field is also a macro state.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
For example, mercury.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
In 1911, it was discovered by Ernst.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
After the temperature dropped very low, it suddenly became a superconductor.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
What about conductivity?

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
For example, the angle is the temperature.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
When the temperature is very high.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
This temperature is the absolute temperature.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
From this place, you can see that there is a conductor here.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Satisfy the Ohm's law.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
When the temperature drops, the conductor becomes smaller and smaller.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
But there is still a conductor.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
But when the temperature is about 4K, about 4.2K.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
The conductor suddenly disappears.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
There is almost nothing.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
There is nothing at all.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
There is nothing here.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
This can be regarded as a phase change.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Because this is a very macro state.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
The whole change.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Because there is a conductor here.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
There is no conductor here at all.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Here is the general conductor.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.000
On the left side, it suddenly becomes a superconductor.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
The superconductor has great application value.

17:50.000 --> 18:00.000
For example, later we found that mercury is a pure material.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Mercury is an element.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
But other compounds may also become superconductors.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Like these high-temperature superconductors.

18:10.000 --> 18:19.000
High-temperature superconductors can become superconductors as long as they are at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
For example, these copper oxides.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
You will see that there is an X in these different compounds.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
There is an X here, right?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
This X is when you synthesize this compound.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
How much ratio do you want to put in?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
How much ratio do you put in?

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Then you go to burn this compound.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
Then you are equal to saying that this X is your external parameter.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
That's your temperature with your axis.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Different temperatures and different cross-sections.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
The horizontal axis is the cross-section.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The horizontal axis is the cross-section.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Write a P on the right.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You are the cross-sectional electric.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
This is the meaning of the X.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Write an N on the left.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Write N on the left.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You are the cross-sectional electric.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Here is the electron dot and the hole dot.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
This place is when you are not in the cross-section.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
This is a counter-iron-magnetic superconductor.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
When you cross-section to a certain degree,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
When you drop to a low enough temperature,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It becomes a superconductor.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
So this area is a superconductor phase.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
This area is a counter-iron-magnetic phase.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
What is a counter-iron-magnetic?

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Then go on.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Magnetic.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
There are many kinds of magnetic.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
The magnet we usually see,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Like this magnet.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
When we were in elementary school,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Take the magnet and sprinkle some magnetic powder.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Look at the magnetic field.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
The magnetic nature of this magnet is called magnetism.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That is to say,

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
There are many magnetic poles inside the magnet.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Many small magnetic poles.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
These magnetic poles are originally,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
If it is messy,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
If the temperature is very high,

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Then these magnetic poles are messy.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
After the mess, the whole is not magnetic.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
But if you lower the temperature,

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Then because of this magnetic pole and the magnetic pole,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
There will be some interaction.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
These interactions will make these magnetic poles,

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
The direction is still in the same direction.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
When everyone is lined up in roughly the same direction,

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
The overall magnetic nature will be displayed.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
You will see that it is a magnet.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
It is the overall direction.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
For example, this arrow here is N-level,

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
This is S-level.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
If everyone is messy,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
The whole thing is offset.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
I found a YouTube video.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It's probably like this.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Can you see it now?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Should be no problem.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Yes, I can see it.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
There is a piece of iron on the top.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Put a piece of iron.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
After the magnetic iron below is red,

21:39.000 --> 21:47.000
The red magnetic iron is magnetic.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Its magnetic pole is messy.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Messy, then there is no magnetic nature.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
But after it slowly cools down,

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
The temperature is low enough.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
Because it has an interaction between the magnetic pole and the magnetic pole.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
When the temperature is low enough,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
It will be aligned with everyone in the same direction.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
There is a magnetic pole in the same direction.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
If there is a magnetic pole,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
It becomes iron magnetic.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Iron magnetic is the meaning of this magnetic iron.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
There should be no problem.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Another one is that it is lined up well.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
But it does not have a total magnetic force.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
The total magnetic iron.

22:39.000 --> 22:48.000
Although the super island I just talked about.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
When you are not mixed, it is iron magnetic.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
What does iron magnetic mean?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
That is to say, your magnetic pole.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
This magnetic pole.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
How did this magnetic pole come?

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
Part of it is the orbital momentum of the electron.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
And the other part is the magnetic circle.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
If these magnetic poles are interspersed.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
For example, here is up, down, up, down, up, down, up.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Interspersed.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
It is also lined up well.

23:26.000 --> 23:33.000
But it does not have the iron magnetic force of the magnet just now.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
But it still has order.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
This iron magnetic force.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
Although there is no total magnetic force.

23:46.000 --> 23:56.000
But it is completely different from the one that was completely messed up just now.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Because the magnetic pole of the burning red iron is messy.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
This iron magnetic pole.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
The magnetic pole is very well arranged.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
After that, I will mainly talk about.

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
If these magnetic poles are arranged into a chain.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Of course, this is the intention below.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Because you are not taking a magnet.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Then directly this magnet.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Because there are countless magnetic poles in a magnet.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Or there are already a lot of magnetic poles inside.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Then we have to discuss later.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
It is said that the magnetic pole is arranged into a circle.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Then the magnetic pole and the magnetic pole next door have some interaction.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
Will this cause the whole?

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Will there be a state of order?

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
Or will it be a whole?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
What is the order?

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
Simply put, everything has an order.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
For example, electrons also have an order.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
The light also has an order.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
The magnet also has an order.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Quark also has an order.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Everything has an order.

25:36.000 --> 25:46.000
Order is a basic physical nature.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Quark also has an order.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Quark's order is 1.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
But Quark's order is 1.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
Its z-direction can only be positive or negative 1.

26:02.000 --> 26:10.000
So we see that light has a polarizing direction.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
There is a left-handed light and a right-handed light.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Light has an order.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
The order of light is 1.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
All orders should be divided into two categories.

26:21.000 --> 26:32.000
One is the order of one-half, three-thirds, five-fifths, seven-fifths.

26:32.000 --> 26:42.000
This kind of half-order is called quark.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
The other is the order of the whole.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
For example, the order is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
This is called quark.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Light has an order of 1.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
So it is quark.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Electrons have an order of one-half.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
So it is quark.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Like this.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Sorry.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Go on.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
That's right.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Yes.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Is it OK?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yes.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
OK.

27:13.000 --> 27:24.000
So the spin-chain discussed later is related to quark.

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
Is it an order or a half-order?

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
This is a big deal.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
These are two very different types.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.000
Before talking about these orders,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
what is symmetry?

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
What is asymmetry?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
What is asymmetry?

27:57.000 --> 28:09.000
Asymmetry means that after you have done a certain operation, the result does not change.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
For example, as I just said,

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
parallel symmetry, rotation symmetry, mirror symmetry, time parallel, time inverse,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
any kind of operation.

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
Can you see me now?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Yes.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
For example, I take this.

28:33.000 --> 28:42.000
If you don't look at the pattern on this ball,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
if they are all the same color,

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
I just turn 360 degrees like this.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
I'll cover it up first.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Then I'll turn a little bit.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Then I'll show you.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Then you don't know.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
You will never be able to tell if I'm turning or not.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Right?

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
So it means that this ball has the symmetry of this rotation.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
There is already a pattern on it.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
Of course, this pattern will destroy its rotation.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Because if I turn like this, you will recognize this pattern.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
You know I have turned.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
But if this is all blue,

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
I can turn this three-dimensional corner.

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
This is a rotation symmetry.

29:37.000 --> 29:43.000
What about this apple?

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
This apple, you have an imagination first.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
There is a meme here.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
And then, here,

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
So if I turn like this,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Then you will find that it is different.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
But if I turn like this along this axis,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Assuming its shape is perfect.

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
Then you will see that it also has this rotation symmetry.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
But this rotation symmetry

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
Only with this Z axis as the rotation axis

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
You have this symmetry.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
I can turn like this.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
I can also turn like this.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
I can also turn like this.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
I can also turn like this.

30:44.000 --> 30:53.000
The symmetry of this apple is less than the symmetry of this ball.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Because it only rotates like this.

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
This ball can rotate in any way.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
If so, you will see that this and this ring

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I made a ring.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
This ring is the same.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
I turn like this, the result is unchanged.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
What about this bagel?

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
If I turn like this,

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
You will not know that I have turned.

31:34.000 --> 31:41.000
Of course, if this is the case,

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
If I put a sticker on it,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Do you know that I have turned?

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
For example, I'm hungry now.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
I'm hungry, I take a bite.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
Now after being bitten by me

32:03.000 --> 32:10.000
It has lost the symmetry of this rotation.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
This is also the same.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
This bagel is also the same.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
If I don't bite too big

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I take a bite first.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
I bought a lot today.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
I bite a little bit.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
I don't bite this hole.

32:30.000 --> 32:36.000
Then it has no symmetry of this rotation.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
In other words, what does this bite cause?

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
Causing a defect

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Causing a defect

32:46.000 --> 32:57.000
Defects will affect a lot of things.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
What I'm going to talk about later is Torpo.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
Torpo

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Let's play a little game first.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
I have a ring here.

33:13.000 --> 33:20.000
I have a ring here.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
If I use a pen

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Many people should know that

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
If I go from here

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Then follow this ring

33:32.000 --> 33:41.000
Go around like this

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Go around and pick it up.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
Wait for the paper to turn 360 degrees

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
I'll go back to the origin.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
These two are not the same.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
One

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I do this too.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
I am also back to the origin.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But this is not.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
When this is done

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
This ring is very different from these two rings.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
This ring is just like this one.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
This ring is just like this one.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
These two rings are very different.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
This ring is just like this one.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
This ring is just like this one.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
In fact, the same

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
I twisted it a little bit.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
In fact, this ring is just like this.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
This ring is like this.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So you see, I just painted black here.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
If there is

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Usually there is an ant walking up

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
After going around

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
You will return to the original place.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
This ring is like this.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
This ring is not

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
This ring is the so-called Mobius ring.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
What if

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I have an ant here

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Walk like this

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Walk like this

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Go go go

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Go go go

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Go around

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Go

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
After going around

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
He will

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
He actually

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I'm going around now.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Go around

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
As a result, I ran to this path.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Run to the back of this ring

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Not the same as this

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
After two laps

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Will return to the origin

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
This is a

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
It's completely different from a few boxes.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
This thing

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
And then go back to the video.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
That

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
What I just said is symmetrical.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
This is symmetrical.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
That

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
This is symmetrical.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Has been destroyed

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
That

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
With

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
What does it have to do with the photo?

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Because we know

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Is

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Ah

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
If you

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
If

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Ah

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
You have one

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Energy or free energy

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
He

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
If he is a certain parameter

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
If the function

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Then you basically free energy should be like

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Energy is like the lower the better

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Will be stable

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
If your

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
At first your function is like this

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
So

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
If you have a ball here

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
He is of course symmetrical

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Because of this symmetry

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Symmetry is of course

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Is the lowest point of energy

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
But if your external parameters

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Change

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
For example, your temperature

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Temperature changes

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Temperature

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Low temperature

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Your temperature is getting lower and lower

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
That causes this function to change

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
The lowest energy state at this time

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Not in this

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Symmetrical point

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
And he might

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Will choose to be in

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
A certain one

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Free energy is lower

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
That place

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Of course, every place

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
This place or this place

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Free energy

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Energy is the same

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Then he has to choose

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
On the left or on the right

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I don't know

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
He might be him

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
He might

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
He

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
He has a little bit

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
Direction

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
A little bit to the left or a little bit to the right

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
When

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
He is very natural

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
He will run to this soon

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
To a stable place

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
That's like this place

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
In this case

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
You will find that he is not symmetrical

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Originally

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Originally

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
It was left and right

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
This has a

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Symmetrical

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
That's not symmetrical now

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
That's not symmetrical

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
It means

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
There is a order

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Happened

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That's what happened

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
That's a certain

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
An image is produced

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
For example, just now

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
We just saw that

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
The experiment of the distance temperature

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
That burning red iron

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
No magnetic

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Burning red iron

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
His

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
The magnetic field is messy

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
That

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
When it's messy

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Magnetic field

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Although he has a magnetic field in every place

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
He has a lot of this

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
That order or

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Magnetic field

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
For example, this magnetic field

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
That

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
But the temperature is very high

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
He has a magnetic field

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
All

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Keep doing this

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Just keep doing it

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Ah

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
In the disturbance

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
In the transformation

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That causes the whole

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
You look

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
That moment looks very messy

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
That magnetic field looks messy

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
And positive magnetic field and negative magnetic field

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Positive and negative, but in different directions

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
The whole

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Put this whole magnetic field

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
All offset

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
That's messy

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
That messy

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
How do you say he is symmetrical?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Just when you have this magnetic field

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
When the magnetic field is very messy

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
You you

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Rotate him

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
You do a certain area to balance

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
You have a camera

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You you you this camera

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Observe and then you balance this camera

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Then you find that he is still messy

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
Just as messy as just now

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
You can't see what it is

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
You can't tell

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Do you have a rotation

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I did not

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
I did a balance or did a rotation

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
You can't tell

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
and so

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
He

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
In the video just now

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
This red iron

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
What is the symmetry

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Just have

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Balance symmetry

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Also have

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Rotational symmetry

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
But what happens when the temperature drops?

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
Because of the magnetic field and the magnetic field

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
His interaction

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
It's more

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
More strong

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
More obvious

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
What about the thermal disturbance?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Not enough for him

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Let him mess up

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So he will be the whole

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
Causing the overall magnetic field to lean towards one

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
One direction

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
At this time if everyone

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
When everyone is leaning in the same direction

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
At this time you will find

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I no longer have

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
This rotation symmetry

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Is my rotation symmetry

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Just

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
I rotate

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
That direction just now

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
It was all pointing up

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Everyone is pointing up

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Then I rotate everyone

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Changed direction

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
You will find that he has changed

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
That's not symmetrical

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
That's called

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Automatic symmetry

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Symmetry

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Symmetry is that he has a sequence

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Then you say that he is

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Change

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
This is us

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
The most traditional

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Ah

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
For matter

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
The most

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
The most

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Ah

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
One

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
This is the theory of the blue path

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
It should be

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
We have one

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Just

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
There is one

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
This sequence

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
What about this sequence

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
What if he has it

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
He just has a sequence

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
That means he happened

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
A change

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
But like just now

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Excuse me

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Ah

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Sorry

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
OK

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
OK

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
That

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
That

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Some things are not like this

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Just

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Ah

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Um

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Wait a minute

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Will continue to talk

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
That

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Later found

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
There is a change

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Ah

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
The earliest

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
A Russian

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
He found out

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
He is a model

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
That later

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Because he published

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
This story is probably like this

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
The article he published is

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Written in Russian and then

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Earlier than Kostelis and Solis

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
That later

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
No one knows that later Kostelis and Solis

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
They also counted

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
One thing and then found out

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Ah

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
There is actually a change

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
But this model

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
He did not happen

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
They do

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
This model is like this

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I just said that one by one

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Right?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Each arrow is a word

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
That seems to be here

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
One of this amount

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
This amount is

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
It's not like that

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
It's just an amount

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That is

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It is

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I will talk about the amount later

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Here

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
This amount is

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
There is an xy amount

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
You are on the plane

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Then there is an xy amount

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Then you are on this

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Every one on this scale

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
In this square

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Square lattice

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Each one has a

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
The corresponding amount

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
All

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Do it

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Just write a built-in interaction

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
That

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Look at this model

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
He did not

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Destroy

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Rotational symmetry because

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I just put it

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I am in this

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Z axis

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
For

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
If you turn, I just rotate

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
How many degrees

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
0 to 2拍

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
0 to 360 degrees

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I just turn a little bit

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Or turn a lot

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Just turn a few degrees

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Any angle

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
This model

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
This energy is unchanged

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
This does not change

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
So he has this

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Continuous

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
This rotation symmetry

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
There was a theorem before

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
This theorem is called Mermin-Wagon theorem

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
If you only have

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Corresponding interaction

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Then yours

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
If you have continuous symmetry

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Continuous symmetry

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
That

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Below 2

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Continuous symmetry

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Will not occur

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
This is

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
This is his mathematical theorem

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
But

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
They found

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Even if there is no

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Continuous symmetry

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It will not occur

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Does not mean

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
It will not change

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
And this change

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Just

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
This kind of change

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Later we

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It's called KT Transition

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Or BKT Transition

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
How is he

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
At high temperature

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Because it will not occur

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Will not occur

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
So

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
As long as you have a limit

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
He will not

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Not that continuous

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
For example, you

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
This energy is written like this

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
There is a symbol in front

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
If j is j is positive

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
That

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
If you have these two quantities

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
How to

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Internal

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Will

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
The answer will be lower

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Internal is

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Did you learn in high school?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Is

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
The length of this quantity

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Multiply by the length of another quantity

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Multiply

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Cos theta

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
If cos theta is

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
If theta is 0

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Cos is 1

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
If theta is 90 degrees

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Positive

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
That this

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Cos is 0

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
So

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
There is a symbol in front

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
So if the energy is relatively low

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Of course every quantity

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
It's best to

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
The same

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
What if the opposite

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
You have the highest energy

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
The same energy is the lowest

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
So

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
But if the temperature is 0

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
That is

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
It is in

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Ground state

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
The lowest state of energy

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Of course it is

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
But as long as you have a little

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Temperature as long as there is a little

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Temperature

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
It won't be

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It won't be

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
All in the same direction

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
It is absolutely

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Is not

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
No

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Symmetry

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Symmetry

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
That

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
No symmetry

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
But there is a change

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
What is the situation

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
That is

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
High temperature

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
That is

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
A little

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
When there is a little temperature

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
These will not

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
These

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
These quantities will not be the same

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
That won't be the same

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
That can only be formed

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Some called vortex

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Is some whirlpool

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That way

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
At a very high temperature

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
What about these vortex

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
No matter what temperature

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
These vortex

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Because you have to

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
You must be

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You have a vortex

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Is

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Turn like this

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
That

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
In fact, this

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Let's make an example

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Is that you have a

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
This vortex

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
There is another

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Reverse vortex

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
That this

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
The positive vortex and the reverse vortex

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
At low temperature

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Is two

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Tied together

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Is paired together

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
That's like this ship

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Two ships are actually tied together

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
But if it's at high temperature

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
This one by one

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Is every

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Every vortex is free

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
This

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
This quantity

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Main configuration

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Run around

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
That way

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
This kind of change

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
It's called

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
KT transition

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It does not destroy any

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
So there is no contradiction

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Sorry

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Is there a question?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
That is

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I remember when I was learning xy model

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
He said he was different

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
One is

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
One is

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
How to put that thing

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Connected to you

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
That

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Um

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Um

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
That is to say

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Um

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Um

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Um

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Um

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Correlation

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Because

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
First of all

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
First of all

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
If there is no order

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Its correlation length must be

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Decay to zero

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
But

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But the way to decay to zero

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
There are actually two

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
One is

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Decay to zero very quickly

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
The other one is

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Is

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
It's slow

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Outflow decay

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Um

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Um

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I think I think this may be

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Carefully pushed down to see

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Its connection here

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
I don't think I can do it directly

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
In a very intuitive way

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
To see

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
This configuration

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Uh in this place

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Is exponential decay

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
The other place is power load decay

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Um

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
If you have this feature

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Type pair of voltage

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You have to use math to show

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
For example, the amount of matter on the left and the right is different

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Represents two phases

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Is there anything like

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Other parameters

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
For example

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
The method of decay is different

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Two different phases

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
This place

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Because you don't have

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
That kind

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Order parameter

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Um

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Um

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
My question is

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Can you define something

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
For example, the left phase is zero

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
The right phase is one

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
So they are different

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
That's the order parameter

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
But here

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Um

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Here you can only count its

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Here you should count its

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Some decay

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Um

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
This may

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I have to look again to answer you

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Ok thank you

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
No problem

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
You go ahead

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I have to review this

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Um

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
That

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Of course he should be able to

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Calculate one

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Is the so-called

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Unchanged

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
For example, this is

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I forgot what the number is

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Or what

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
This is the phase

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Uh, as far as I know

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
The number is

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
There is such a

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Decay

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
It's a

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
It's a

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
It will correspond to

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
It's the quantity or the effect

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Different

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
That

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I'm just curious about that

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Is there anything like this

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
It's math

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
You can tell me very clearly

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I don't understand this

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I remember there is

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
But not

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Because here is only

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
All are

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Spin system

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Then you go ahead

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
I will also study it later, thank you

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
I may

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I can check it later

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Tell you

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
That

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Just here

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Talked about

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Uh

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Different

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
A few boxes and wrong

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Different

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
If it's a few boxes

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Uh

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
You will find

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
After a bite of apple

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
That his

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
His symmetry

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Already

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
It's gone

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
His geometric shape has changed

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
But

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
His

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Uh

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
What about the characteristics

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Is unchanged

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
That's the same as this bagel

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Uh

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
There is a hole

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
As long as

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So this

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
What about this hole

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
If you keep it

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Like I just said

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Inside the equation

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
If that

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Your conductance

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
With the one you calculated

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Torpo

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
That amount

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
If it can correspond to

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
How many holes are you here

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
If there is a hole, two holes, three holes

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Will correspond to you

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Conductance is

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
There is a change in the whole number

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Of course I can't find it

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Two holes

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
If you find this

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
There are many holes in the answer

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
That's it

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Um

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Um

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Um

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Um

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Um

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Okay, I just said

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I think

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Maybe not very good

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Um

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
What I'm going to talk about is

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
The anti-iron

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Uh

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Eisenberg model

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
First of all, these equations

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Uh

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
The XY model just now

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Is

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Only

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Which amount

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Only x and y

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
And between this amount

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
It's just a number

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
That now

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
This

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
What about the amount of this equation

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
It's not just a number

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
What about them

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Can't be exchanged

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
What about ax and y

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
For example, there is this

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Is

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
xy

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
minus yx

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Will equal

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Is z

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
In this case, this is a

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
The model of quantum mechanics

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
That

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
His

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
This side

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Is

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
If the inner machine is also

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
x times x

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
y times y z times z

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
What about this model

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
This if x is equal to

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
One-half

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
You can use

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
A mathematical technique called beta ansatz

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Solve it

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
After that

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Of course

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
There is another

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
This mathematical theorem

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Is

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Three people

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
That lsm

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Three people's theorem

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
What about this theorem

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
He is using

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Uh

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
You define one first

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Another operator

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Then put it in

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Ground state

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Then found

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
He and the original

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Ground state is positive

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Then found

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
This positive state

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
So this positive state

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Uh

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
With ground state is positive

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
And his energy

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
To

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
When thermodynamics is limited

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
When n is equal to infinity

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
He and ground state

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The energy is

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
The difference is equal to zero

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
For example

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Of course here

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Calculate directly with numerical

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Ground state

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
This is the size

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
That size

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
What about this

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Is

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
To find his

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Is his

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Parity is equal to

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Positive or negative

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Excited state

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Then these two

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
To thermodynamics

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Why do I say

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Because there are some

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Sometimes

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
When n is equal to

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
If n is equal to 4 times

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
That

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
10 is p

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Equal to positive 1

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That excited state is negative 1

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But if

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
n is equal to

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Is

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Two

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
2 times

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But not 4 times

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That is the opposite

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
In short, there is a positive here

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
One is negative

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
One of the two is ground state

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
One is excited state

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
That's the end

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
When thermodynamics is limited

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
He will focus on this

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
This is just

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That solution

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
That is to say

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
This theorem tells you

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
As long as you are

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The number of times

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
These are the number of times

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Is the number of times

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Then he has no energy

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That's how it works

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That but

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
That

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Correlation

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Correlation is the power of decay

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
That guess

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
That is to say

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
The number of times

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
There is a gap in the system

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
The number of times is different

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And correlation

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Correlation is exponential decay

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You can define

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
One

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
The length of the connection

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
that

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
What we know now

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
It is said

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
This equation equals to 1

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
What kind of nature does it have?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
There is another model

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Is spin equal to 1

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
But you add this

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
After adding this

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
You S equals 1

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
This model becomes

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Strictly solvable

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Strictly solvable

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
After you solve it, you will find that its ground state

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It looks like this

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
This big circle

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Is a spin 1 thing

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
The two dots in it

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Is two

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You look at it

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
This spin 1 is actually two

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
One-half spin

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
One-half spin

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
It can be one-half positive and one-half negative

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So here it can be

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Here it can be

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
One-half positive and one-half negative

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Here it can be one-half positive and one-half negative

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
So there are a total of four possibilities

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
These four possibilities

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But spin 1, it has

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
1, 0, negative 1, 3

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Three possibilities

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
You find that

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Two spins

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
One-half

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Plus one-half

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
One-half

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Is a spin 0 thing

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That type

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Is called

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Singlet

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The other three

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Is spin equal to 1

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
That triplet

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
This circle is

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
This big circle is

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
These two spins

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
One-half

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Translated into a

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Spin triplet type

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
That

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
The blue stick is

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
This spin and the other spin

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Form

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Singlet

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
That way

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
After all this

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
If you are

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
This is the Open Boundary Condition

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
You find the most

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
One-half spin

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
He has no one

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Can match him

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So it will become a

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Free

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
This

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
This state is out

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You can see it here

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
He has one

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Is the boundary

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
In this case, it will cause this side

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
This side can also

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Up

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Then you can also

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
The whole thing is

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
If you are

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
If you make a circle

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
With this spin

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It will form Singlet again

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
The whole ground state is unique

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
There is no boundary

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
But if OBC, it is

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Four-layer boundary

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
such

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Um

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
What if you are

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
PBC

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You can still calculate

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Another thing

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
You put

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
A circle

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
A circle and then

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Cut into two sides

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
One side is called A

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
The other side is called B

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Then you

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
You put this ground state

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Trace off the B part

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Calculate his

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Reduce Density Matrix

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
This Reduce Density Matrix

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Assume it

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
If he is

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
One

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Uh

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Just like

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Density Matrix

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
There is a temperature

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
You have one

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Your Density Matrix should be exponential

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Negative beta

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
H

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But you

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
This H is not

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
A part

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
A part of Hamiltonian

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
This H does not know what

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
A part of Hamiltonian

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Generally speaking, you will not just

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
After you finish

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
This is just the A part of Hamiltonian

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
So

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
The temperature in front

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Beta is meaningless

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Then put this

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
The temperature in front is absorbed

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Absorbed into this Hamiltonian

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Then put this Hamiltonian

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Intangible Hamiltonian

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
What about this Hamiltonian

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
His

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Eigenvalue

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
That is

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
That is

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
This is called Intangible

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Spectrum

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Omega i is

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
If the Eigenvalue of rho a

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Then you put it on both sides

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
If you take the log, you will find

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I want to know

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
This Intangible Hamiltonian

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Spectrum

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That is

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Do it like this

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Then

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
You can find out

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Because you did this trace

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So if you are a circle

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
If a ring

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You will have two

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You will have two edges

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Two edges

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Two edges

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Is a

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Your density matrix

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Can be written as

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
This kind of product way

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
This kind of product way

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
No matter what rho 0 is

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Then your

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Omega i

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Must be

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
This must be

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
But if

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
If you are

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
What is used

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Infinite chain

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
You don't care about this boundary

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Very far away

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Then

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Then you cut it in the middle

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Then go here

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Then you will find

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
At least every word

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Because you only cut one

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Boundary

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
If

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
The first is another parameter

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Will talk later

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
If

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
AKLT

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
1 out of 3

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
If you make it a parameter

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Then

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
If you make it smaller

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
You will find this ground state

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Will be

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Adiabatic

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Will connect

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
To this

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Heisenberg model

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Heisenberg

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Model

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Is probably

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
This kind of

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Configuration

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Then

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Intangible

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Because you have edge state

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So in

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Holden phase

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
If you cut an edge

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
You are

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
If you are

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Periodic boundary condition

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Then you will have

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Four edges

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
If you are in this place

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
You didn't add

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Symmetry

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Z2Z this is

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
This is

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The face of the antithesis

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That this is

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
You are the same

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
There is no here

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
There is no O, there is no O here

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Here

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Of course there is O

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Here and here

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
No O

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
There is no symmetry

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Destroy any symmetry

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
But

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
But you can see here

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Here you can have

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Intangible spectrum

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
At least two-fold

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Here

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
There is no need to

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Two-fold

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
There is no

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
This is a coincidence

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
There will be a

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
But at least there is no

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
That this

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Can be regarded as

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
He is

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Topological face

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
One

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
One possibility

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
One possibility

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
One possibility

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Probably like this

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
That

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
That

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
That

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
That

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
That

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
That

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
That

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
That

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
That

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
That

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
If you want to use

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Intangible spectrum

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Is it here

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
He has a topological

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
If the face

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
That is also a problem

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Because we don't know yet

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
How to define

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Intangible

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
That

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Maybe i'm

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
After that, I'll take a look

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Turn the book over again

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
That

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Of course

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Everyone knows that he took the Nobel Prize

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
He

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Nobel Prize

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Of course, Hoden and Kosterlitz

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
With Solace

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
The three of them got the Nobel Prize together

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
That they

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Nobel official

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Give them everyone

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
There is a certificate like this

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
That

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Everyone's picture is different

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Hoden's picture

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Of course, Hoden has another contribution

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Hoden's picture is a

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
This circle

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
This circle

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
This circle

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
This is a spin

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
That this stick

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
This stick is

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
A single

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
One like this

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
That aklt

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
One aklt

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
That

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Material

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Uh

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
But Hoden

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Hoden's idea

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
After that

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
That

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Soon that

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Experiment

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
The material is made

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Of course the material is three-dimensional

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But this

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Is that

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It is spin one

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Particle

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
The one next to it is green

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Green particles

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Green words like spin two

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Green words are a

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
A

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
That

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Through this green

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
For example, like spin two

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
This is a spin two

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
This particle

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
That through the middle of this green

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
He

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
His interaction will be through

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Through this green

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
To reach

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Super exchange

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
He might jump in the middle

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Then jump over here

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Then jump back

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
That will become

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Like this Hamiltonian

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Like this material

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
This

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Along this c axis

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Is a circle

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
This is also a circle

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
So there are a total of four here

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Four circles

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Inside the circle

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Through this green

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
To reach this interaction

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
To reach this super exchange

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Interaction

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
What about the different circles?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
This one to this one

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
He's going to

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
If you want to form this interaction

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
He

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
At least

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Through the middle of two

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Green

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
To reach this interaction

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
In this case, it means

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Say this J

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
The size of this J

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
This in the circle

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
The size will be much smaller

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Much smaller

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Much smaller

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
As if he did not

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
What about the first word?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Is called single ion

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Anisotropy

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
This one

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Here

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Basically this one

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
If it's not too big

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
What about this circle?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Can be regarded as

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Spin one

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
This material is regarded as

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Then later

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
A lot of materials

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Found and did

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Anisotropy

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Then

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It proves that Houghton's guess is right

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Spin two

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
But less

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Then

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
For example, this material

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Should

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
This should still be because

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It may be difficult to make

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Now

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
There should still be people doing it

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
There seems to be some

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Dispute

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But usually

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
This one

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Is in the material

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Will have

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The main thing is this single ion

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Anisotropy is like this

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
This is a low orbit

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Five orbits

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
What about the low orbit?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
dSyS square

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Y square

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
dZ square

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
dSyDyz

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
dDyz

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
What about the top here?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
This side is

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
At this top

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Originally should be

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Have that

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Other

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Other orbit

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Other electrons

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Put these

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Are regarded as a dot

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
If

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
If there are no such dots

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
These five orbits are

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
The energy is the same

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Is the same

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
But now you put this top

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
After putting it up

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Then you will find this energy

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
There are two types

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
One type of EG

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Is these three

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
These two

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
The energy is the same

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
These three

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
These three

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
The energy is the same

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Because you see

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
The distance is the same

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Just

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Just rotate the angle a little

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
These three energies are the same

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
These three T2G energy are the same

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
These two are the same

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
What if

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
You

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
These two above

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You are also in the middle

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Up and down

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Extend or shorten

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Extend and shorten

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
This one

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
This one and this energy

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Will be divided

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It's different

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
This one

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
With

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
These two

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
The energy will be different

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
These two

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
These two energies are still the same

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
If it is up and down

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
This one is different from these two

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
EG will be divided here

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Assuming

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Then these three

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Will be divided

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
These two are the same

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Then dxy

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
The energy is divided

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
These two are still short

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
How to

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Let these two not be short

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Is

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
This one

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
This one in the middle

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
This one

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
This one with color

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
This is a square

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
This was originally a square

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
If this square

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
You

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Because of some reasons

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Become

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Square or not square

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Then you will further cause

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
These two

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
The energy is divided

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Sorry

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Wait a minute

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Our recording may be

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
End in about ten minutes

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
How many videos do you have

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Almost

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Okay

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Control

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
In the back

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Some new results

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Let's talk about the results first

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
We may not understand the results

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I don't understand

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Actually

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I am still

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Introduction

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Introduce some

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Because I think this is

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Very popular recently

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Not so many people understand

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I think the introduction is very interesting

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
That

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Let everyone know

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I think we have to talk very well

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Some of the previous questions

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I don't understand

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
I understand part of it

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Correct

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I understand that I have done it myself

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
This part

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
That

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Then I will speak faster here

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
If you are here

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
What about this distortion

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
This is

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Spin orbital coupling

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
You will become

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Similar

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It will become like this

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Like this

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
That way ax and ay az

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Three parameters

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
These three parameters are with you

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
The size of these three parameters will be with you

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
How to split here

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Will be related

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
What about these three

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
There are actually three parameters

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
In fact, there are only two parameters

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
If it is a square

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It is equal to s times s plus 1

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
That is

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
You can push it down

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
This ha can finally be written

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Like this

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
This is a parameter

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
This is also a parameter

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
s times s plus 1

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
s equals 1

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
s equals 1, then 1 times 1 plus 1 equals 2

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
So this is a parameter

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Only this sz square

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
With ss square minus sy square

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So this parameter has only two parameters

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
If you throw away those parameters

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That single isomers

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
That you are the source of this parameter

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
You just follow you

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Up and down here

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
If there is distortion

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Then you will

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
If you are all

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Then you will have this d

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
If you are all

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Isotropic

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Then you are here

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
There is no d and 1

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
If you have this square

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Becomes a rectangle or a ring

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
You will have this 1

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
That's it

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So my previous work

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The previous work is

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Go

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Use the numerical method

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Such

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Face diagram

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
To calculate his face diagram

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Then go to see his

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
The nature of one state

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
The first is s

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
s equals 1

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
This

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
In the early

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Someone has done it

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Then I also

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Teacher Yang

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Some questions

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Then put this place

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
This place is

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
The middle is the face

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
From here to the face

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Nothing happens

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Symmetry

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Symmetry is not broken

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
That is to say this whole

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Are all

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
That if

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You are here

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
The earliest

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
The earliest classification of the face

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
You put that free energy

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
For external parameters

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
If the division is not continuous

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You are the face

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
If the division is not continuous

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
That is the face

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Then later

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
After the symmetry theorem

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
You have those old parameters

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
You divide it into

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
You if

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Your old parameters

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Continuous

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Is not continuous

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
That is not continuous

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Then he is a face

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
If the old parameters are continuous

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Then he is called continuous face

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Then he belongs to the second stage

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
The above face

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Is called continuous face

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Or some people say

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
These are called the second stage face

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
But if you want to subdivide

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Still can

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
At zero temperature

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
You divide the ground state

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Then you see him

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
A few times

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
That

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
This one

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
What if

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
You go to see the first one

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
These two parameters

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Let me talk about this face diagram first

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
This face diagram

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
From this red dot

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
From here to here

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
This red arrow

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Because there is no

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Any

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Symmetry

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Because if it is

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
If it is

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
The value of SZ can be

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
10-1

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
That 10-1

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
His square will become

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
10-1

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
So if D is very big

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
You don't look at the other lines

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
That is very big

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
That

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
If the energy wants to be lower

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
That must be SZ equal to zero

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So it becomes

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
This large

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The limit of D becomes

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
SZ equal to

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Zero

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
That SZ is equal to zero

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Of course there is no

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
No order

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Because you have to see

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
All of you

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
All of you

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
SZ you can't measure

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
You don't have magnetization

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
That red dot is not here

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So I

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Actually I didn't say

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I didn't say

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
He actually has a string order

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That you put these materials

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Go find people to do experiments

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
This material

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It will be very close to here

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
It still falls

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Very close to this critical point

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
That critical point

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
What if you have a little bit

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
You will enter another phase

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
That these two phases

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I haven't found it before

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
So we think

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
If it is on this material

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Add a little

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Distortion

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
That is very likely to let

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Enter

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Not enter large

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
But enter

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Y-face or X-face

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
That's it

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Intangible spectrum

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Also said

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Here is

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Self-reduction

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
First of all, here we do

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
A periodic boundary condition

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Just one

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
A closed ring

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
What about this ring

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
This is the energy

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
The energy of the ground state is at the bottom

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Then

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
The energy of the excited state

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
According to your different quantum number

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Divided out

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Of course this paragraph

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Is the magnetization gap

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Then when you add 1

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
This gap

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
But here

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Not

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
But there is

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Another kind of gap

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
What about this gap

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
So this place is the ground state

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
But it still has a gap

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
If you go here

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
He just

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
There is no reduction

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
It becomes

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Sx equals 0

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Product state

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Not Sz equals 0

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Sx equals 0

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Intangible spectrum

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
You will see

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Indeed in this place

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
There are four points here

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
This red

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Then black triangle

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Then black cross green

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
This is a quadruple reduction

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
This is a quadruple reduction

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Here is a symmetry breaking phase

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It is a quadruple reduction

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
The origin of the quadruple reduction is because

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
This ground state is double

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
The ground state itself is double degeneracy

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Then you have quantum number

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Then it becomes

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
The ground state you choose

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
The ground state

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Will be with these quantum numbers

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
That means it is

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
A certain

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Add type

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
For example, it's all up down up down

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Or add up up up

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
That's a bit like

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
That Schrodinger's cat type

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Cat state

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Will cause all

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Intangible spectrum

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Quadruple reduction

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
That can be used like this

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Quadruple reduction here

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Quadruple reduction

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
No reduction

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Here is

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Here is Hodian phase

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Here is

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Symmetry breaking phase

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Here is trivial phase

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Hodian phase is

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Symmetry protected

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Topological phase

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I forgot to say here again

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Correlation

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Correlation

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Correlation

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Correlation is a more traditional way

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Look at those order

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I think the focus should be

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Why

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
What is symmetry protected topological phase

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
What is symmetry protected topological phase

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Should be

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I did not put this powerpoint

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It's okay

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
That is to say

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
That is to say

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
That is to say

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
You this

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
This middle

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
This Hodian

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
If this phase

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
If you

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
If your Hamiltonian

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
You did not add

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Other items

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
If you add an item

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
You keep

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You keep

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Symmetry

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
For example, this Hodian phase

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
It has three symmetries

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
To protect it

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
The first is

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Is parity

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Is mirror

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Is reflection

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Is left and right

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Is left and right

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Symmetry

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
The second is time reversal symmetry

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Is time reversal

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
All spin

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
SxSySy

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
SxSySy

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Take the sub-number

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Two sub-numbers

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Both sub-numbers will be removed

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
So

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
It has time reversal symmetry

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
The other is more difficult to see

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Is Z2

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Z2 symmetry

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
As long as you add

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Other perturbation

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
If there is no destruction

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
If there are no three destructions

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Then

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Hodian phase will still exist

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
This is still

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Unless your perturbation is strong enough

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It will be destroyed

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Just like you added this

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
D and 1

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
If you add D and 1

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Did not destroy time reversal symmetry

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Did not destroy parity

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Did not destroy

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Z2 symmetry

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
So

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
So

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
When D is big enough

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
There will be a

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
There will be symmetry

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
That

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Correlation skip first

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
That

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
This is

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Monumentality

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Is to set

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I take this amount to set

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Critical point

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
But

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
What about the critical point just now?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
If you are AKLT state

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
You can use

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Twisted boundary condition

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
That twisted boundary condition

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You will let

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
This side

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
This spin

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
This boundary becomes a triplet

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
If you are

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
If you have multiple spin 1

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
If you are in Hodian phase

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
If you are in Hodian phase

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
There will be multiple singlet

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Every singlet

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Your parity is equal to negative 1

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So you have multiple

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
It is equal to 1

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
That will be with large D phase

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Can't tell

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
But if you are twisted boundary condition

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
That

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
You have multiple spin

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
You will have multiple singlet

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
This is a triplet

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
This triplet is parity equal to 1

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
This triplet is parity equal to negative 1

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So this parity is equal to negative 1

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
This parity is equal to 1

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
You can do this level crossing

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Is to put this 1 and negative 1

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Do cross

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
That cross point

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Just take it as your critical point

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Then under the finite size

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
A critical point

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Do finite size scaling

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Finally you will get a very accurate

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Critical critical point

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
That's it

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Of course you can always use

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Spin 2

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Because spin 2

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
In 1992

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Oshikawa

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
He is

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I think it should

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
After you add this D

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
There may be middle

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Middle phase

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Not only from Hodian phase to large D phase

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
First spin 2

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
His Hodian

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
This isotropic

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Heisenberg point

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
This phase is also here

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
This place is very small

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
That means his

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
He is very close to the critical point

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
His correlation length is actually quite long

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
There are about 60

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
In fact, if you put the whole image

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
If you get it out

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
In fact, this Hodian phase

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
With large D

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
This phase is connected

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
That is to say

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Hodian phase

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
Trivial phase

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Not

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Topological phase

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
But you can still

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Find one in the middle

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Similar to

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Intermediate D phase of spin 1

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
This is a topological phase

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Because

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
This frame is mapped to spin

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
1

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
This frame is mapped to spin 2

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And it is Sz equals 0

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
This is Sz equals 0

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Spin 1

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
That looks like

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
AKLT state

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
That

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Of course it is magnified

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
It can be seen

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
This

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
This is the way

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
That's the conclusion

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Symmetry is actually

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
In physics

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It's still a very important role

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Because if you have symmetry

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
One is symmetry

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Protective

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
There is another

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
In fact, you don't need symmetry

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
It has its own

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Topological

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
It's not in 1D

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
That 1D

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Can have

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Must have

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Symmetry

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
That

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Um

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
1D spin system

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
I think there are still a lot of places to do

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Um

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
That's about it

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
My speech

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I think I didn't speak well

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
No, I think

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Probably know the important

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Where

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
From introduction

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
To the real result

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Is

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I feel a little bit

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
I don't know

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
The link in the middle

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Where is it

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And you can talk about it

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Half an hour you should be very tired

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Can I ask a question

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Can

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I have a question about that

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
That

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
That picture

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
What is your side

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Is it

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Or you later

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
If you want to see it here

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It's a few lines of words

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
A method is

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Ground state

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Just fix a jz

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And then

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
To ground state

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
To d

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Energy

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
To d

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
To this

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
So you're here

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
The group you gave later

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Will also give the same

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Is it

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
In principle

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
But this is a mistake

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
The problem

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
But if the three-dimensional change is a five-dimensional change

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
If it's a five-dimensional change

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Not divided

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Three-dimensional and five-dimensional

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Because it can't be counted

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Because

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
The number to be divided

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
In fact, it is to be divided

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
What about your two-dimensional division

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
You have to count three points

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
If you use central

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Difference

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Then you

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
One-dimensional division

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Then you have to count two points

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Do the difference

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
You have to count three points in two-dimensional division

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
You have to do this point in the middle

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Take two more points

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
That three-dimensional point to take five points

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And your error will become

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
The error of your two-dimensional division will become

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
You take the square of the interval

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That you three-dimensional

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Become

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Three-dimensional or four-dimensional

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
That five-dimensional

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
So

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
The three-dimensional and five-dimensional

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Take advantage of

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Critical exponent

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Scaling

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Find it out

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Someone still counts

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
This three-dimensional

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Five-dimensional

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
But that's not divisible

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
We already know

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
It's not divisible

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
But there is no serious

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Three-dimensional and five-dimensional

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I don't think so

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Because I

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I wanted to do this problem

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
But you have to find time

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
The one behind

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
If you don't consider

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
The problem of accuracy

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
You just find a physical quantity

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
For example, quantum energy

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
See if he has

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
You can find out if there is a phase transition

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It doesn't matter

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
For example, you can do that

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
You can also find out the phase transition

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
As long as the physical quantity

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
You can see the phase transition

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
The first one is in the one-dimensional system

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Either there is a gap

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Or there is no gap

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
If there is a gap

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Then your volume

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Entropy

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
There is an area

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
If there is no gap

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
If there is no gap

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Then your entropy will follow

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Size log

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
That's what I wrote below

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
C is central charge

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
It is inferred from conformal field theory

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
It has a log

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Here is one-third

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Because I use

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Periodic boundary condition

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
If there is some amount

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
There is no way

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Detected

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
That phase transition

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Before

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Above

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
These

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
These two articles

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Fidelity Susceptibility

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Fidelity Susceptibility

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Basically the concept is like this

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I calculated

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Choose a place

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Then calculate the ground state

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Then a little near

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Calculate a little here

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Then the next door is also a little

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Two ground states

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
These two ground states are internal

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
If these two states

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
On the same phase

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
You will think you will

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Expect

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Its internal volume should be close to 1

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
If it happens

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
If it happens

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
One ground state is here

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
The other ground state is in another phase

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Then you will expect these two

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Ground state

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It should be much worse

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
If it is much worse

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
It is

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Internal volume

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
It may be very small

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Use this to detect

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Is there a phase change here?

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
In this case

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
In

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
In this example

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Two-stage phase change and three-stage phase change

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Can be successful

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
But there is no way

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Five-stage phase change

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Especially here

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
The so-called phase change here

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
This is the so-called

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
BKT transition

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
BKT transition is actually

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
You don't have to

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
It will happen

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
That is to say

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
It will not happen

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
In this case

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
It is difficult to detect

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
The phase change of this place

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
But if

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
You use

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
You have gaps here

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Then only here is no gap

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Of course there is a gap

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
So if you want the whole

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
In this

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
For this phase diagram

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
You have to use monument entropy

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
To set the critical point

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Only here is valid

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Only here is valid

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
If you are here

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
It will be difficult to find

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Because there is an xy1 here

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
There is an xy1 here

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
There is also an xy2 here

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
These two are the gapless phase

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
What is this xy2

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It is the kind of quadruple order

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I didn't talk about

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
It should be like

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Similar to this quadruple

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
This correlation

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
But these two are

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Gapless

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
In monument entropy

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
All happened

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Then you can't see it here

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
This is ferromagnetic

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
This is ferromagnetic

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Ferromagnetic here is

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
One-phase phase change

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
One-phase phase change

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I don't know how to use

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So I don't know

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Scaling here

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
What to do

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Just in this case

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
This model

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Selected

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Actually, it's me

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I calculated it first

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
How is it here

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Then the last show is that picture

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Every phase here

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
There is a gap

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Only at these phase changes

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
These phase changes are gapless

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
In this case

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Monument entropy

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It looks more beautiful

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Then you find this

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Single place

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
This is the peak

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
That's the gap

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Then you can do some finite size scaling

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
This is the finite size scaling

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I don't know

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Is this ok

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Is this ok

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Is this ok

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Ok, thank you

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Ok, today we probably

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
No special questions

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Hello

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Hello

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I'm Ted

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I just joined

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Sorry

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Today's speech is probably

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
It's over here

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
OK

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Thank you

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Very good

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Then I'm going to

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
I'm going to stop the recording first

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
OK, thank you

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Thank you
