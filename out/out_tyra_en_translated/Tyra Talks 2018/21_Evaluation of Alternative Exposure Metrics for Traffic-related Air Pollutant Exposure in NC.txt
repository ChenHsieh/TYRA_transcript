Hi everyone, welcome to this week's TARA Talk.
The title of today's talk is
The Evaluation of Alternative Exposure Metrics
for Traffic-Related Air Pollutant Exposure
in North Carolina.
Let's welcome our speaker today,
Zhang Shiying, or you can call her Zhang-C.
Let's briefly introduce the speaker's information.
She's currently working at Sonoma Technology,
a company that specializes in this area.
She did her Ph.D. at UNC-North Carolina-Champaign Hill.
Before coming to the United States,
she was a master's student at the University of Texas,
then a master's student at the University of Texas,
then a master's student at the University of Texas.
She's currently working on a topic that's closely related to her research.
Let's welcome our speaker, Zhang Shiying.
Hi everyone.
Before I start, I want to show you my T-shirt.
I won last year.
My name is Zhang Shiying.
You can call me Zhang-C.
Today's topic is
how to use air quality models or model-based methods
to assess human exposure to air pollution.
I'm going to focus on the traffic pollutants.
A few days ago, the host asked me to talk about
the related issues of air pollution.
But because our company has a strict process
of reviewing things and publications,
I didn't have time to make a new video.
So I'm going to talk about my last year's video.
This photo was taken in the United States in 1948.
Why is air pollution important?
This photo was taken in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1948
called Donora.
The photo on the right was taken at noon.
You can see that it wasn't bad weather or raining that day.
No, it was a normal noon.
The streetlights were all on and the sky looked dark.
Air pollution was very serious at that time.
After that incident,
40 people died in the town.
50% of the residents suffered from
serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
People said that it was very difficult to breathe at that time.
This incident caused a lot of resonance in the United States.
People said that air pollution was very serious.
After that incident,
there were a lot of social movements,
protests, and government measures.
Finally, in 1967,
the United States passed the Clean Air Act,
which is the most important law in the United States.
The Clean Air Act was finally passed,
and control began.
Was it useful?
The answer is yes.
Let's take a look at this picture.
The word may be too small to see clearly,
but it doesn't matter.
This is basically the annual air pollution concentration.
This is a measured situation.
I remember I took this.
It should be LA.
Each line represents a different city or county.
You can see this trend.
Every year, air pollution is decreasing.
So it's actually useful.
Since air pollution has decreased,
what are we doing to study air pollution?
It's already so low.
What are we doing here?
The two most important things now
are not only in the United States,
but also in the world.
The two most important air pollutants are
1. Smelly sheep
2. PM2.5
PM2.5 is called a particulate matter
with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.
I won't go into detail.
But basically,
smelly sheep is not directly released.
You won't have something that says it's smelly sheep.
It won't be like that.
The formation of smelly sheep is secondary.
In other words, it's not a smelly sheep gas.
These gases become smelly sheep
after chemical reactions in the air.
These gases that are released
may not be so harmful to the human body.
But after it's released,
it becomes smelly sheep
and is very harmful to the human body.
PM2.5 is simply a very, very small particle.
This is a strand of hair.
We all love to use this picture.
This is a strand of hair.
PM10 is a diameter smaller than 10 micrograms.
It's about this big.
It's a blue circle.
PM2.5 is this small.
What does being small have to do with it?
Being small means that it's easy to pass through your respiratory tract.
It can go deeper.
It can go into the lungs.
It will cause respiratory diseases
and even cardiovascular diseases.
Let's skip this one first.
This is a study
that has been very active in recent years
called Global Burden of Disease.
They publish every year
the current ranking of causes of death
and how many people die.
Why is air pollution important?
After the Clean Air Act,
the concentration of pollutants decreased every year.
But if you look at the whole world,
the cause of death from air pollution
is ranked fourth in the world.
Air pollution is very, very, very important.
This is a paper from Nature in 2015.
They divided the world into countries
and gave the most serious air pollution
emission sector.
They predicted how many emission sectors
would cause death.
So if you look at this table,
there are different pollutants in the horizontal axis.
For example, we have residential energy.
Air pollution caused by using energy.
Agriculture causes air pollution.
Land traffic causes air pollution.
You can see the two red boxes,
USA and Germany.
These two countries
cause the most death
in the traffic sector.
These are some introductions.
What am I going to talk about today?
This paper was published in 2015.
In terms of environmental epidemiology,
it is important to look at the relationship
between diseases and air pollution.
You want to use air pollution variability
to explain whether there is a disease
or whether there is a disease.
In this case,
if there are 10 people today,
5 people have respiratory diseases,
5 people do not.
I wonder if this is related to air pollution.
When I was doing this statistical model,
I found that these 10 people
were exposed to the same amount of air pollution.
For example, they were all exposed to
5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5.
At this time,
the model can't see anything.
5 people are sick, 5 people are not sick,
but everyone is exposed to the same amount of air pollution.
This means that you can't do anything.
This paper talks about
the past epidemiological studies,
the past studies that link diseases
and air pollution.
What can be improved?
This slide has a lot of words.
Basically, the most important thing is
the Health Effect Institute.
This is a 2009 paper.
The Health Effect Institute
is a very famous institution
that studies health effects.
They use data from the American Cancer Society
to re-analyze and link
the relationship between air pollution and death.
As I said before,
when you do this,
you need to have all the information
about whether you are sick or not.
Secondly, you need to have data
about the exposure of air pollution.
How do they do the air pollution exposure data?
Basically, they do it in this area.
Let me translate it for you.
They have a monitoring station
set up by the U.S. Department of Environment
in the United States.
They have a station on both sides,
an air pollution station.
Their approach is
for example,
in San Francisco,
I have 10 stations.
I collect the data of these 10 stations
and calculate the average.
I say that everyone living in San Francisco
has the same air pollution exposure.
That is to say,
everyone living in San Francisco
has the same air pollution exposure.
This is the same as what I just said.
For example,
everyone lives in San Francisco.
Some people are sick.
Some people are not sick.
When I do this epidemiological analysis,
I tell my models that
whether they are sick or not,
as long as they live in San Francisco,
their exposure is this high.
At this time,
you can see that
there seems to be a problem.
Another question is
that the U.S. Department of Environment
set up these stations in the United States
to measure air pollution.
However,
many air pollution is not regional.
It does not mean that
a station can represent
the concentration of pollutants in the entire area.
The table I listed here
is the distance from the road.
The unit is meters.
The axis is normalized to roadside.
That is to say,
the concentration of air pollution
is standardized,
which is the concentration of two roads on the roadside.
On the left side of the table,
you can see that
so many pollutants
actually have a very steep gradient.
That is to say,
between 100 and 150 meters,
the concentration has dropped by almost 60%.
That is to say,
the road distance is only a few meters.
There is such a difference in concentration
within 100 meters.
Can you see such a difference
in concentration
in a station
in a certain corner of the city?
You can't see it.
The first one,
you use that kind of station
to represent exposure,
the exposure of human body to pollution.
You may not be able to catch
the hot spot in the urban.
Hello, I have a question.
Please go ahead.
The first one,
the horizontal axis is the distance,
and the vertical axis is the concentration.
In the first few meters,
their gradient looks almost the same.
But you have,
for example, CO, CON,
and NO, NO, and N.
Don't they have a lot of difference in their atomic mass?
If I take one,
I think it's just an expansion.
Shouldn't the gradient be a lot different?
Because there is still a chemical reaction.
CO may not have much reaction.
NO and NOX may have chemical reactions.
It will generate other things.
So it may laugh faster,
laugh slower, not necessarily.
OK, OK.
Maybe it's all gas.
Even particles are different.
Particles may have
some different characteristics.
I want to add that
you have to consider the gradient.
So,
there is a physical problem.
So there is a chemical process.
That's right.
OK.
OK.
We just talked about outdoor.
For example,
you use outdoor,
you use the concentration of the side station beam
to represent the pollution source.
First, you can't catch the hot spot.
Like this kind of traffic pollution source.
If someone lives,
if someone's house is close to the road,
you can't catch it.
But if it's far away,
you can't catch it.
Second,
in fact,
most people
spend more time indoors
than they spend outdoors.
This is a...
It should be a Canadian study.
They looked at
how much time
children spend
indoors or outdoors.
I used the two red boxes.
You can see
one is in winter,
one is in summer.
In indoor time,
67% in winter,
72% in summer.
It means that
most people
spend more time indoors
than they spend outdoors.
At this time,
you use outdoor pollutants
to represent...
The concentration of the beam
to represent human exposure
may also be a problem
because everyone is indoors.
Right?
So that's why
there is this paper.
The first one is
Central Sites.
Central Sites
means
those
U.S. environmental protection agencies.
They can't catch
these local sources.
Local sources can be
traffic
or any
small sources
next to your house.
They may not be able to...
The second one is
using outdoor air pollution
to represent exposure
may not be very representative
because most people are indoors.
In theory,
you should use indoor air pollution
to represent exposure.
The goal of this paper
is to use model-based...
That is to say,
use model-based methods
to predict...
to estimate
the intensity of indoor and outdoor
and use them
to represent human exposure
to see
how different they are.
We can quantify
these potential exposure errors
This is the model I used.
The three yellow boxes
are STOKE, STOK, R-Line,
and LBL AR models.
These three are models.
STOKE stands for
Spacetime Ordinary Crating.
It represents...
It's actually
an internal and external
technology.
That technology
uses...
Its input data
is the data
from these environmental protection agencies.
We use that data
to push it inwards and outwards
to the census block level.
Census block is...
Imagine...
It's a block.
When you're walking,
there's a block on the road.
It could be a block.
So we push those intensities
inwards and outwards
to these block levels.
This represents
a background level.
I use the data
from the Central Monitoring Site
to push it inwards and outwards
to these places.
But it could miss
these local sources,
such as traffic.
R-Line is a line source
dispersion model.
It's used to predict
traffic-related pollution.
It basically
takes all roads
as a line.
It uses
a simple
high-definition
method
to model
traffic pollution.
It represents local source.
We define local source
as traffic pollution.
The last LVL-AR model
is Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
Air Exchange Rate Model.
It's used to
predict air exchange rate,
which is the air exchange rate
for each household.
For example,
how long
will the air
in your house
be exchanged
with the air outside?
Using these three models
and combining them,
we can calculate
the six blue boxes.
These six boxes
represent
exposure.
We call it
exposure metric.
We use these six boxes
to represent
air exposure.
What are they?
The first one is
outdoor stoke,
which is
outdoor air exposure.
It's called stoke.
It represents background.
Remember,
the source of this thing
is Central Monitoring Site,
which is
the U.S. Department of Environment.
The second one is
outdoor on-road.
It represents
air pollution
caused by
traffic.
It's modeled
by R-Line.
Combining these two things,
outdoor stoke
represents background
because it can't
capture local source.
If you add these two things,
you get total exposure.
We call it
outdoor hybrid,
which is hybrid between
R-Line and stoke.
These three things
represent
outdoor concentration.
Using these three
outdoor concentrations
as a base,
we can combine
the air exchange rate.
The air exchange rate
from the LBL
air exchange rate model
on the left
can be used
to calculate
the corresponding
indoor concentration.
We use outdoor concentration
to calculate
indoor concentration.
We have
three other metrics,
indoor on-road,
indoor stoke,
and indoor hybrid.
There are six metrics in total.
I have a question.
Go ahead.
Do you consider
opening and closing
the window
or just
looking at
the exchange rate
under the air condition?
You'll see it later.
We'll talk about it later.
We'll talk about it later.
This slide
is about R-Line.
R-Line is a dispersion model.
You have to use R-Line.
In any air pollution model,
the most important thing
is emission.
This slide talks about
how emission is calculated
and where the data comes from.
This is not
too important
to everyone.
Let's not talk about it.
This is stoke.
It's the same as what I just said.
It is an
internal and external
critting technology.
It uses
the U.S. Environmental Protection
Air Quality System,
or AQS,
which is
the big test stations.
Finally,
these two things are added up.
This is
how to calculate
the corresponding
indoor concentration
of the outdoor concentration.
This is a very simple
mass balance model.
The internal
concentration
and time change
are determined by these terms.
The first is
the outdoor concentration
brought in by the
air exchange
and the
internal concentration
of the outdoor pollution.
This includes
deposition,
which is the rate
of indoor air
being excreted.
Here are some factors.
The penetration factor
is the rate of
incoming air.
The deposition rate
is the rate of
incoming air.
The penetration rate
is 1.
The deposition rate
is 0.5 per hour.
The PEM
has lower
penetration factor
and slower deposition rate.
The next question
is
what does
the AERM
consider?
The answer is no.
There are
three counties
in North Carolina.
The results
are based on
census block level.
There are
330,000 houses
in the area.
In theory,
the model
includes
windows and air-conditioning.
There is such a model,
but there is no data.
I cannot go to each
of the 330,000 houses
and tell them
what the
air-conditioning rate
is.
So we have to
consider
the house
and the air-conditioning rate.
I will not
go into details of
this model,
but basically
all the parameters
such as
the building
and the air-conditioning rate
have been used in the past.
For example,
if I want to look at
10 or 15 houses,
there is no problem.
But if I want to look at
330,000 houses,
I cannot do that.
So I have to
look for the data.
I use the county property
assessment record
to have the data
collected.
I will not go into
details of other data,
but basically
they are all public
available data.
For each census block,
I sample
about 10 houses
and use
these 10 houses
to represent the census block.
I do not make
330,000 houses
because my modeling domain
is the three counties in North Carolina.
Orange County is
where UNC is located.
Durham is
where Duke University is located.
So
don't go there.
This is
a snapshot.
I use the six
exposure metrics
and calculate them.
Then I draw
the map
and show it here.
A is the outdoor
stoke data.
It is the result of
internal and external
measurements.
B is the
outdoor hybrid data.
It is the result of
R-line traffic source
and background
interpolation.
Then I use
these two
air quality fields
to calculate the
indoor concentration
using the
simple mass balance model.
Let's look at
the outdoor stoke data.
Most of the concentration
is between 24 and 27.
There is no
spatial variation.
That's it.
If I remember
correctly,
there are only two or three
stokes.
If there are two or three
stokes with
interpolation,
you can only get
this result.
However,
if you add the local
source data,
you can see
the map
is different.
Let's look at
C, the indoor stoke.
The station
is a transportation source.
There are various types of stations.
Some are in the background,
such as National Park.
Some are near the traffic.
That's right.
We use the background
station.
It is close to the road.
Have you
used the
R-Line transportation model?
Yes,
I used it in the
last talk.
Thank you.
Let's look at
indoor stoke.
A is the input of C.
C and A
are compared.
First,
the color scale is reduced.
Second,
the spatial variation is increased.
The concentration
of C is between
7 and 14.
Compared to
the outdoor stoke above,
it is between 24 and 27.
Where do these spatial variations
come from?
They come from
the air exchange rate
above.
What does this mean?
If you only use the outdoor stoke above,
which is what they did,
they used that method
to predict
exposure.
If you look
to the right,
you can see
the concentration
of the local source.
If you look down,
you can see
the map of the
indoor concentration.
If you only look at the map,
you can see the difference.
The last one,
D, is the indoor hybrid.
The input source is B.
You can see
that the variation
is still the same.
You can see the high concentration
near the road,
and the low concentration
near the road.
If you look at the map above,
you can see
the difference between 90 and 100.
If you look at the map below,
you can't see the difference.
When you go indoor,
the absolute concentration
will decrease.
I have a question
about the front page.
This is a 2D model,
right?
You can also
make it vertical.
But this is
2 meters away from the ground.
I'm just curious.
Is the terrain around here
flat?
This area is quite flat.
This area is quite flat.
This area is quite flat.
It's a mountain to the west.
It's quite flat here.
I'm using a box plot
to show
the average concentration.
I'm using a box plot
to show the average concentration.
The concentration is distributed by
the pollutants.
I forgot what I was going to say.
I forgot what I was going to say.
Let's start with CO.
Let's start with CO.
If you only look at
the black and white boxes,
the black represents
the outdoor concentration.
The white represents
the indoor concentration.
You can see that
CO is about the same.
Look at Stokes.
Outdoor and indoor are about the same.
On-road is about the same.
Hybrid is about the same.
Why is that?
It's because of the
penetration factor and
deposition factor.
CO penetration factor is 1.
Deposition rate is 0.
So the indoor and outdoor concentration
are about the same.
On NOX, the penetration factor is 1.
Deposition rate is 0.5.
You can see that
the indoor concentration is lower
than the outdoor concentration.
It's about half of the indoor concentration.
On PM, the particulate matter,
PM and EC,
the indoor concentration is about the same.
The outdoor concentration is half of the indoor concentration.
If you use the outdoor concentration
to represent the deposition rate,
you may overestimate the deposition rate.
Now let's compare
Stokes and On-Road.
Stokes and On-Road.
The two black and white boxes
on the left
and the two black and white boxes
in the middle.
Let's look at
CO and NOX.
CO and NOX.
You can see that
Stokes is much higher than
On-Road in terms of CO.
But NOX is closer.
Why is that?
Because of traffic pollution,
NOX emitted by
cars and
cars is very high.
I don't have the table here,
but I remember that
some NOX emissions
may be up to 40%,
which means
these cars emit a lot of pollution.
So you can see that
Stokes is higher than On-Road.
In particular,
On-Road is very low
in terms of PM2.
In terms of
primary PM2,
its total emissions
may only reach
about 5%.
But in terms of EC,
the smaller PM2
in terms of
PM2.5,
its combustion
may be higher.
OK.
What I'm looking at here is
the ratio of density.
What I want to look at
is spatial variation.
I calculated a value
called spatial coefficient
of variation.
The higher the value,
the higher the spatial variation.
The higher the value,
the higher the spatial variation.
OK.
What we want to look at now is
whether these things
represent exposure or not.
Most people use
Stokes' Outdoor Concentration,
which means
the side station
represents exposure.
The black box on the left
represents Stokes'
Outdoor Stokes.
You can see that
there's a big difference.
For example,
Stokes' spatial variation
is very low.
The white box on the left
represents Stokes'
Outdoor Stokes.
Why?
Because I added
the spatial variation
of air exchange rate.
If you use the box on the left
to represent exposure,
you will get
the spatial variation.
In epidemiology,
there's a way
to classify exposure.
Sometimes we don't use
absolute concentration.
For example,
50 micrograms per cubic meter
represents exposure.
Sometimes we just use it
to classify.
For example,
low concentration
represents 0-2 micrograms.
Medium concentration
represents 2-4 micrograms.
High concentration
represents 4-8 micrograms.
Let's do something similar.
Let's divide
6 exposure metrics
into 5 groups,
0-20%, 20-40%,
40-60%, and so on.
Now I need an answer.
Let's assume
the real exposure
is the hybrid-based
indoor concentration.
It represents the real exposure.
First, it considers local source.
Second, it considers
indoor concentration.
That is,
the hybrid-based indoor
is the answer.
Let's divide it
into 5 groups.
On the left,
we are going to compare
the remaining 5 exposure metrics.
First,
let's compare
outdoor hybrid and
hybrid-based indoor.
The red numbers
represent
the agreement.
The higher the number,
if it is 100%,
it means
100% agree with each other.
For example,
the 0-20% group
is the hybrid-based
indoor group.
When you use
outdoor hybrid
to represent exposure,
only 50%,
49.22% of the sensors
will fall in the same group.
When you use
these 5 criteria
to divide the exposure
from high to low,
only 50% of the sensors
will fall in the same group.
The highest group
is the NOx group,
with 73% of the sensors
falling in the same group.
The NOx group
mainly
considers on-road source.
The NOx group
also considers
on-road source.
If you can capture the local source,
you can capture
most of the pollution.
Your analysis unit
is the sensor's track, right?
No, sensor's block.
What about spatial resolution?
Your model can run hourly, right?
Yes, hourly.
You have a sensor's track
and hourly data.
Did you match
the contingency
to the group?
No.
I used the annual average.
This should be only the annual average.
This is not the hourly level.
I used the sensor's block,
not the sensor's track.
Let's look at
the worst case.
The outdoor stock
is the most widely used
in the research
on viral diseases.
Compared with the hybrid-based
indoor,
the red line
is 25.54% lower
than the red line.
What does it mean?
It means you may have
such a big exposure error.
Why?
First, you did not consider
the local source.
Second, you did not consider
the indoor concentration.
The surprising thing
is that
the performance
of the on-road concentration
is very good.
The on-road concentration
is only the on-road part.
It does not consider the background level.
Why?
The reason is the same as before.
A large part of the NOx
comes from the gas engine.
It also controls
the spatially.
When you only use this,
you can clearly see
the higher the concentration
on the on-road,
the lower the concentration
on the off-road.
As long as you can capture this,
you can capture
the difference.
It also considers
the indoor concentration.
It uses the air exchange rate
to reflect the air exchange rate
between each house.
The performance is good.
The highest group
can reach 89%.
Here,
I am showing
a similar situation.
You can see
there is no hybrid indoor.
This is the answer.
Other things
are cut out.
Then,
it becomes a box plot.
Each box
represents
when you use
the specific exposure metric
to represent the exposure,
what is the difference?
Let's look at
the most widely used
exposure metric,
Stoke Outdoor Concentration.
You can see
the normalized difference
is very high.
The average of NOx
is about 80-90%.
The conclusion is
that
it is very complicated.
There are many
different analysis and pollution.
The pollution
and the traffic
are different.
Bear with me.
Basically,
CO and PN2.5
traffic
is lower.
14% and 6%.
NOx and ECO
are higher.
40% and 44%.
When you use
the indoor infiltration model,
the indoor concentration
is about 60%
of the outdoor concentration.
It will be reduced by 40%.
When you use the outdoor concentration
to represent the exposure,
it is not right.
The concentration is not that high.
The exposure is not that high.
Okay.
It is too complicated.
This is my
acknowledgment.
I used to work at UNC.
The funding source is
the EPA contract.
The EPA provides emission
and meteorological data.
The EPA has not joined us yet.
This is a reference.
That's it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do the audience
have any questions?
I don't think so.
Yay!
You can join us
on Saturday afternoon.
Don't be so academic.
This is interesting.
You can see it with R-Line.
For example,
why is there a basketball court next to the bridge?
When I started
doing this,
especially after I moved here,
the Golden Gate Bridge
next to San Francisco
is a place
for jogging and cycling.
There are six lanes.
There are three lanes
on each side of the bridge.
Normally, cars drive very slowly on the bridge.
In terms of emissions,
the slower the car drives,
the higher the emissions.
People jogging and cycling
next to the bridge
breathe in the air very happily.
My idea is that
if you move the basketball court
to the middle of the bridge,
you can save a lot of
motority.
Just move it a few feet.
Taiwan is small.
Is there a way?
I have a question.
Please go ahead.
The question is
if you look at
the road emission data
on the road,
you won't stand next to the road
to check if every car
is a Tesla
or a diesel car.
But
there is a free parameter
here.
If all the cars driving today
are Tesla, half Tesla, half pickup,
and all big trucks,
how much improvement can there be?
Is it possible
to justify
how much
public sector
resources should be invested
to promote
a policy that seems to
change the quality of air?
This is also a very important point.
Fleet distribution.
When talking about traffic pollutants,
a very important parameter is
fleet distribution.
Is there a difference in the composition
of each place's car?
We use MOVES
to deal with this.
Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator
is used to deal with this
in terms of models.
In terms of models,
you can tell MOVES
that half of the fleet distribution
is electric vehicles
and the other half is diesel vehicles.
You can make these adjustments
and see how much these things change.
But
in terms of models,
I think you can do this.
But if you want to
seal off a street
and make the entire fleet
50% Tesla,
it's a bit difficult.
But what you said is a very good point.
I don't remember
having seen
a similar study
on fleet distribution.
Coach, have you seen a similar study?
He's probably taking care of the kids.
I don't remember
having seen a similar study
on changing the fleet distribution
and changing it to electric vehicles.
I haven't seen such a study.
Thank you.
I have a question.
I'm a bit curious.
When I first saw this topic,
I thought it was interesting
and I wanted to know more about it.
So I looked it up online
and it seems like
North Carolina's air pollution
is more serious.
This area is
the NC Piedmont region.
North Carolina is divided into four areas.
Coastline,
Piedmont,
and Mountain.
Piedmont is a bit like a triangle.
This area is an RTP area,
so the air pollution
is a bit more serious.
The other reason
why I did these three counties
is because we had a plan
with EPA.
They wanted to use
the metrics I just mentioned
to do their epidemiological studies.
They had a study
on heart disease.
They wanted to use
air pollution data.
We had a contract
with EPA
to do this study.
When I talked to them last time,
they said they were already
writing a paper.
I don't know where it went.
So the research
done in this area
is quite valuable.
Because the EPA
is located there.
The EPA's R&D office
is located there.
A lot of research
is done there.
Yesterday,
a few people from UNC
came to our lab.
I asked them,
I heard the air pollution
in UNC is very serious.
They were surprised.
I said, really?
The air there is much better than California.
I said it was serious
compared to
North Carolina.
Even in Piedmont,
although it's a serious area,
it's still very low.
Okay.
North Carolina is a very clean area.
The population of North Carolina
should be four times that of Taiwan.
The population is only 9 million.
In South California,
the population of
one county is 20 million.
Yes.
I believe
air pollution is more serious.
The more people,
the more air pollution.
Near Road Study
and
Children's Health Study
are all done by
senior scientists
in our company.
Many of them
are in LA.
The first project
I joined was
to use R-Line
to predict the air flow
of children
due to air pollution.
The system
is also for
the entire
South Coast area.
The entire
South Coast area.
That area should be
well-known
for air pollution.
Actually,
in Joe's
presentation,
I think
it was
in the 1970s.
It was
Los Angeles Times.
It was
in the 1970s.
It was
LA Times.
It was
talking about
air pollution.
I remember
it was
700 ppb.
700 ppb
is not a big deal.
The standard in Europe
is 70 ppb.
It's quite high.
700 ppb in that era.
Some of the senior
people in our company
lived in LA when they were young.
Standing outside
would make you cry.
It's an older magnitude.
It's very, very
exaggerated.
Air basing.
The air
is relatively stable.
Air pollution can't escape.
Thank you for your answer.
I want to ask
if there are any other questions.
If not,
let me promote Tyra.
Got it?
OK.
I want to
ask you a question.
Yes.
Do you have a question?
No.
OK.
You know what I'm doing,
right?
Let me
talk about it.
Basically,
a lot of
epidemiologists
and epidemiologists
have underestimated
the impact of air pollution.
The main reason is
from an economic perspective,
when you know the air quality is bad,
you will optimize your behavior.
So your hospital,
acute hospital admission,
or all the end points
are the results
after people optimize their behavior.
So some things,
like ozone,
CO,
you may not see anything
because when you realize
the air quality is bad,
you don't go out.
So I think
from an economic perspective
and epidemiological perspective,
it's a big difference.
When the air quality is bad,
you can choose a different transportation mode.
For example, in Taiwan,
you ride a scooter,
but when the air quality is bad,
you ride a bus.
If people don't optimize
their behavior,
the effect may be worse.
This has nothing to do
with today's topic.
It's interesting.
What's your name?
Yishu.
Yishu, right?
I want to ask,
do you work on energy policy?
Yes, I do.
I have an article
about Taipei Metro and air pollution.
For example,
in the US,
the government,
for example,
when they want to change
their policy,
do they refer to the research
or the company?
Or do they get an average?
The policy setup
is basically a political negotiation process.
For example,
in California,
I want to push 50% of energy
to renewable sources.
The government's policy
comes out like this.
The next step is
to hand it over to California
Air Resources Board
or other government agencies
to implement it.
Under my overall policy target,
how do I use
what they call
economic instruments?
For example,
I do a lot of electricity markets.
It's basically a competitive market.
Now, you can't force
these companies
to use renewable energy.
Many times,
our target is to
come out with the way
to use market instruments.
For example,
I can cross-subsidy renewable energy
from the fossil fuel
or dirty energy.
I can use this method
to let those firms
have a policy goal
and use the market
to achieve that result.
I think policy is
important for researchers.
For example,
what I'm doing here
is CO2 reduction.
Basically,
our funding source
is based on government policy.
Trump said
he doesn't support
energy.
Do you worry about
the next five years?
I don't think so.
But others are worried
about the Institute.
Our Institute is
not only in Caltech,
but also in Stanford
and Berkeley.
Everyone is worried about it.
Now, it seems like
it has been guaranteed
to be implemented in 2020.
Except Trump,
I don't think it's possible
to implement it in California.
California is a pioneer
in environmental policy.
Even though
the federal funding
is not enough,
we have a lot of state-funded funding.
Thank you for your comment.
I think it's interesting.
I'll send you an email.
I think we can work together.
Okay.
Let me interrupt.
You mentioned
policy design.
If I'm not mistaken,
next week's talk
is about economics.
It's about
mechanism design.
It's not
specific to
energy policy design.
It's about
mechanism design itself.
I just realized
it has something to do with
what you were talking about.
I think we can
keep in touch.
You should have it.
I'm in control of everything.
Okay.
I'm just cyber-stalking you
right now.
I already have
C.
I can stalk others.
Keep stalking.
I was wondering
if
Jiao Yan joined
Taira's team.
If you're interested in joining Taira.
She gave a talk last year.
She gave a talk last year.
Yixu,
are you in Taira?
You're a passer-by.
I'm a passer-by.
You can join us next time.
Okay.
I'll give you the membership form.
I'll give you the membership form.
Okay.
If you're interested,
you're welcome to join Taira.
Okay.
The biggest problem is
you can't find students
even if you want to.
What students?
PhD students.
You mean me?
I mean me.
I can't find students.
Not necessarily.
We'll have students
after the promotion.
I'll turn off
the recording of our talk.
