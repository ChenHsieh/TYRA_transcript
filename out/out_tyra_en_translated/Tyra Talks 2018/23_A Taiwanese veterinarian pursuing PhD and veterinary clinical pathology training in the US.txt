My original topic was to share one of my Ph.D. projects,
but I realized that most of the members of TARA are related to engineering or engineering,
so I wanted to talk about a more interesting topic,
which is veterinary education.
First, I will talk about my Ph.D. project,
which is a program called DVM, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.
Then, I will talk about my Ph.D. research.
Let's get started.
First of all, veterinary education in the U.S. is different.
We apply for a veterinary degree after graduating from high school.
In the U.S., you need to go to a four-year university,
take a course, and apply for a veterinary degree.
After four years, you can take a national exam.
If you want to pursue further training,
you can spend a year as an intern.
Intern is a term used to refer to a student who is already a veterinarian.
After the internship,
some people choose to apply for a veterinary doctorate.
Some people choose to apply for a veterinary doctorate.
After the internship,
you can apply for a veterinary doctorate.
There are 30 veterinary medical schools in the U.S.
There are only one veterinary medical school per state.
Some states have more than one veterinary medical school per state.
Texas A&M is the only veterinary medical school in Texas.
Here is the ranking of veterinary medical schools in the U.S.
There are different rankings.
UC Davis and Cornell are in the front.
Texas A&M is a good veterinary medical school.
Everyone is called DVM,
but if you are a UPenn graduate, you will be called VMB.
