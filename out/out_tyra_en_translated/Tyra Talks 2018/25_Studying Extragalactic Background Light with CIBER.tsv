0	14000	Hello everyone, welcome to this week's Terra Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. I am currently studying high-energy physics experiments at the University of California.
14000	19000	Before we officially start, let's first introduce what kind of organization Project Terra is.
19000	28000	In fact, as we wrote on the website, our goal is to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,
28000	35000	connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world, exchange results and trends in Taiwan's academic circles overseas,
35000	39000	and provide each other with a platform for effective communication.
40000	49000	To put it simply, we hope to establish a platform that helps Taiwanese from all over the world engage in research and work to communicate with each other quickly and timely.
49000	53000	We will hold a webcast like today every week.
53000	58000	The speakers are basically our members, and the audience can sign up online.
58000	64000	The topic of the speech is based on the results of the speaker's research, review his current development in his special field,
64000	68000	and share new ideas, plans, or opportunities for cooperation.
68000	73000	Project Terra is currently a fully self-funded, fully volunteer organization.
73000	78000	Our staff are basically all doctoral students and post-doctoral students.
78000	83000	You can see the About page on our website.
83000	91000	Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.
99000	105000	I want to add that we recently added a lot of staff who may not have been updated to the website.
105000	112000	The most important purpose of a project like this is to fully open up, share and cooperate.
112000	117000	The more friends who are willing to join us, share and help each other,
117000	121000	we can move towards the goals we all want.
121000	127000	I also hope that it will be helpful to Taiwan's academic circle and everyone's research career, or to transfer jobs in the future.
128000	135000	Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.
135000	145000	If you feel that you support our ideas, or are passionate about sharing your very passionate research,
145000	150000	you can consider joining our members, and you will continue to receive our speech and activity information.
150000	154000	Of course, you can also go to our Facebook fan page and continue to follow our news.
155000	158000	We also want to emphasize that we have no profit at all.
158000	163000	If you are willing to share with other Taiwanese, it will be the biggest reward for us.
163000	167000	It is also the biggest help to other friends who work in the academic circle.
167000	171000	This is the introduction of TARA.
171000	174000	Next, I want to introduce our speaker.
174000	178000	We are honored to invite Zheng Yunting today.
178000	183000	Zheng Yunting is currently studying physics at the California Institute of Technology.
183000	186000	He is currently a doctoral candidate.
186000	193000	Yunting graduated from the Department of Physics in 2014 and joined the Caltech Research Institute.
193000	195000	He is currently studying his doctorate.
195000	198000	His special field is observational cosmology.
198000	205000	He will introduce to us today that he is doing a data analysis project.
205000	207000	It is a rocket project.
208000	211000	There is one more thing to remind everyone.
211000	214000	In order to let the speaker feel our enthusiasm,
214000	218000	the microphone must be turned on when applauding, so that he can hear the voice.
218000	222000	Let's applaud and welcome Yunting to give us this speech.
230000	232000	Thank you everyone.
233000	236000	I am Zheng Yunting. I am studying my PhD at Caltech.
237000	241000	Thank you to my office mate, Zhang Yanyong, for the introduction.
241000	244000	The topic I am going to talk about today is
244000	248000	Measuring Extragalactic Background Light at Optical and Near-Infrared.
250000	252000	This is a project I am doing.
252000	254000	I am doing its data analysis.
254000	257000	What I am going to talk about today is more focused on
257000	261000	the background in this field.
261000	263000	What do we want to measure?
263000	264000	What do we want to understand?
264000	266000	What is a signal?
268000	273000	Let me start by introducing the history of our universe.
273000	275000	This is the universe we know so far.
275000	280000	We can start from the left.
280000	283000	The left is the earliest period.
283000	286000	We have inflation and Big Bang.
286000	290000	Inflation is the theory of explosion in Chinese.
291000	296000	Big Bang is the beginning of the universe.
296000	299000	In the very early period,
299000	303000	the universe is very small and hot.
303000	308000	Everything inside is very hot and oily.
308000	312000	As the universe expands,
312000	317000	the gas will expand.
317000	320000	At a certain point in time,
320000	324000	the temperature in the universe is low enough.
324000	328000	The electrons and protons in the gas
328000	331000	will combine to form hydrogen.
331000	334000	This process is called recombination.
334000	336000	After recombination,
336000	343000	there are a lot of photons in the universe.
343000	348000	Photons are easily scattered with free electrons.
348000	351000	After recombination,
351000	353000	there are almost no free electrons in the universe.
353000	361000	These photons will not become long.
361000	367000	We can see the photons emitted at that time.
367000	372000	This is called a cosmic microwave background or CMB.
372000	382000	This is the earliest signal we can measure in cosmology.
382000	389000	After recombination and CMB,
389000	395000	a lot of protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen.
396000	399000	During this period,
399000	404000	the universe is full of neutral hydrogen and hydrogen.
404000	407000	This period is called the Dark Age.
407000	410000	Because it is very dark,
410000	414000	there are no photons like the CMB at that time.
414000	419000	However, there are no stars and galaxies yet.
419000	423000	The universe during this period is completely black.
423000	426000	During this period,
426000	436000	there will be some density fluctuations in the universe.
436000	440000	These density fluctuations are because of gravity.
440000	443000	As time goes by,
443000	449000	there will be more matter coming in.
449000	455000	The main component is dark matter.
455000	463000	These dark matter may form heavier and condensed structures.
463000	465000	We call this dark matter halo.
465000	469000	Because there is a strong gravitational potential in the halo,
469000	476000	the background gases such as hydrogen will also gather here.
476000	481000	When the gathering becomes compact,
481000	492000	it will cause a fusion reaction and form the first star or galaxy.
492000	495000	After a period of time,
495000	500000	the universe begins to form stars and galaxies.
500000	503000	After these stars and galaxies form,
503000	506000	they will release a lot of photons.
506000	509000	If the energy of the photons is strong enough,
509000	515000	the energy gap between the hydrogen and the gas will be strong enough.
515000	518000	The gas will separate the hydrogen nearby.
518000	525000	You can see that there are some separated areas on this map.
525000	528000	We call this ionizing bubble.
529000	533000	This process is called reionization.
533000	536000	As time goes by,
536000	541000	there will be more and more stars and galaxies in the universe.
541000	544000	It will ionize the hydrogen nearby.
544000	546000	At the end,
546000	549000	if you have enough galaxies,
549000	553000	you will separate all the hydrogen in the universe.
553000	559000	The gases outside the galaxy are all ionized.
559000	562000	This is our current universe.
562000	567000	This is the history of the development of the universe.
567000	574000	What I'm going to study now is called an extra-galactic background light.
575000	578000	I have a question.
578000	583000	What if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
583000	586000	Oh, okay.
586000	589000	I see.
589000	593000	So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
593000	596000	I see.
596000	601000	So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
601000	604000	I see.
604000	607000	So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
607000	610000	Can you see it clearly like this?
610000	613000	Actually, I think it's pretty clear.
613000	616000	Okay, then I'll do it like this.
616000	619000	I also think traffic lights are more convenient.
619000	623000	So, what I'm going to measure is the extra-galactic background light,
623000	626000	or EVL.
626000	634000	In the literature, the word galactic refers to our own galaxy.
634000	641000	So, extra-galactic is outside our own galaxy.
641000	646000	Background light refers to everything outside the galaxy.
646000	653000	So, the EVL we measure is the time in the history of the universe.
653000	656000	So, it's like this.
656000	659000	You can see CMB from the beginning,
659000	662000	and then there's Dark Age,
662000	665000	and then there's a lot of stars and galaxies.
665000	668000	And then they emit light.
668000	671000	So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.
671000	674000	The spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.
674000	677000	So, the spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.
677000	680000	So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.
680000	685000	So, the spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.
685000	688000	So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.
688000	691000	And these data on the diagram show the subjects all of the EMB measurements.
691000	694000	And these data on the diagram show the subjects all of the EMB measurements.
694000	697000	And you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,
697000	700000	And you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,
700000	703000	and you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,
703000	706000	and I'm going to share a little bit about what each wavelength does for you.
706000	709000	and I'm going to share a little bit about what each wavelength does for you.
709000	712000	So, let's look at the high-energy and low-energy one first.
712000	715000	The high-energy one is GAMMA RAY and X-ray.
715000	718000	The high-energy one is GAMMA RAY and X-ray.
718000	721000	The main source of these high-energy photons is called
721000	724000	the Active Galactic Nuclei from the AGM.
724000	727000	The main source of these high-energy photons is called the Active Galactic Nuclei from the AGM.
727000	730000	These are billions of black holes in the center of each galaxy
730000	733000	These are billions of black holes in the center of each galaxy
734000	737000	These black holes accelerate the heat emanated from galaxies
737000	740000	These black holes accelerate the heat emitted from galaxies
740000	743000	These black holes accelerate the heat emanated from galaxies
743000	746000	These black holes acceleration leads to både  coated with aurorae
746000	747000	These black holes acceleration leads to béocte
747000	748000	These black holes acceleration leads to béocte
748000	751000	These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane
751000	754000	These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane
754000	757000	These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane
757000	760000	These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane
760000	762540	These high-energy photons secure the Psi
762540	765620	These high-energy photons secure the Psi
765620	767020	These high-energy photons secure the Psi
767020	770020	These high-energy photons secure the Psi
770020	773020	These high-energy photons secure the Phi
773020	776020	These high-energy photons secure the Phi
784020	787020	We also have low-bout of agaric compounds
787040	790040	which are synchrotron radiation
790040	793040	which is when gas is heated,
793040	796040	which is when gas is heated,
796040	799040	or accelerated to a very high speed.
805040	808040	We don't have much data on UV
808040	811040	We don't have much data on UV
811040	814040	We don't have much data on UV
814080	817080	and the experiment result was mere readings
817080	820080	And the experiment result was mean readings
820080	823080	And the experiment result was mere readings
833080	836080	So we very rarely meet UV in astro galactic.
836080	839080	So we very rarely meet UV in assegalactic.
839080	842080	So we very rarely meet UV in astro galactic.
842120	854120	This peak was the oscillation of Cosmic microwave background in 30s
854120	854120	
854120	862120	These are the two small bumps, one in the optical and one in the infrared.
862120	868120	These two mainly come from the star emission in each galaxy.
868120	873120	Star emission is on the optical side.
873120	880120	In the infrared, it is the emission of dust in the galaxy.
880120	892120	These dusts absorb the starlight and emit thermal radiation.
892120	897120	This thermal radiation is in the infrared.
897120	909120	In the infrared, half of the starlight is emitted by the optical, and the other half is absorbed by the dust.
909120	919120	The wavelengths I'm going to talk about today are in the optical.
919120	927120	If we zoom in, we can see that there is a lot of different data here.
927120	935120	This is the fine infrared bump, and this is the optical down near infrared.
935120	942120	You can see that there is a lot of different data here.
942120	950120	Each data is measured at a different value in the same wavelength.
950120	958120	The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.
958120	966120	The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.
966120	976120	The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.
