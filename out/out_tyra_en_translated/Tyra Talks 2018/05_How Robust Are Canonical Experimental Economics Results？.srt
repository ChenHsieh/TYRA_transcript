1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm very happy to have you all here today for Lin Bo-xuan's talk.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let me first introduce our speaker, Lin Bo-xuan.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
She studied economics at NTU, and is now a sophomore at NTU Economics.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Currently, she is an intern at a startup company called ModLab in Pasadena, California.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Her main topic is game-related data analysis.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today, we are very happy to invite Lin Bo-xuan to give a talk

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
about how to use class experiment data to test the stability of the final window match

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the results of the double-sided auction experiment.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's welcome Lin Bo-xuan to start her talk.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you, Director Lin.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Without further ado, I'll get started.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Today's topic is very simple.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll just ask one question.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are the results of the economic experiment we see on paper stable?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
To be honest, in the field of economic experiments,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
people are the ones doing the research.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, if you want to say that a result is stable,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you can't just say,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
if I were in Taiwan, I'd do this result.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Or, if I were in a victim group, I'd do that.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Often, we need to do a lot of different victim groups.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If we were to say that this result is right for all humans,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
then it should be right to take the same result

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and do the same experiment in every place.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But in fact, we often know that

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
this situation is often not necessarily right.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For example, let's say we measure the risk.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In Taiwan alone,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
if you only measure the risk for men or women,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the set of risks may be different.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, in fact, if we want to measure stability,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that is, if we want to do the same experiment

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in many places, the result is wrong.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But often,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
what we want to do

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
is actually very difficult in the experiment.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
First, because economists know

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that our research funds are limited.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Second, our time is limited.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, often, it's hard for us to think about

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
whether we can do the same experiment

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
in every corner of the world.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, this is a very difficult thing.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because, mainly, there is a big limitation in economic experiments.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In fact, we hope to provide real benefits to consumers.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Because of this,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we need a lot of money and a lot of time.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We need to have a good enough time design.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Basically, it will be impossible to measure in every place in the world.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, because of this,

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
we did not give up

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to test whether our experiment results are stable or not.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, there are two main ways

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to do this on our website.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
First,

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for example,

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
in the case of Ultraman Game,

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
in fact, in the past 50 years,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
there have been a lot of studies on the series of Ultraman Game.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, basically,

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
there is a method

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that we take the previous experimental data

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and break it into a very large database

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to do some meta-analysis here.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just like what Usterbeck did in 2004.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But, like this,

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
there is a problem.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In fact, many times,

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
all the previous studies of Ultraman Game

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
are the same game,

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but their context is a bit different.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So, in practice,

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
many times, your usage is different,

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
or your context is different,

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which may affect the result of the experiment.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, when we use this method,

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
we have already lost the control

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
of our experimental design.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Although this method

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
can make our database very rich.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The other way is that

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
we control the same experimental design,

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but go to other places

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to do the same experiment.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just like Roth,

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
he has been to four countries in the world.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One is the United States,

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
one is Slovenia,

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
one is Israel,

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and the other is Japan.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He went to these four countries

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to do the same final analysis

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and market game

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to see if the results of these four countries

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
were stable or not.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the largest experiment

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
so far.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But, from this point of view,

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
even so,

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we can only do it in a small number of places.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, in this way,

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
although you can

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
control your experimental design,

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but you can't make

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
your database very large.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, today,

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
what we are doing is

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
using the third method.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's like

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you want to test the stability

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
of a result of an experiment.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There are three things to do.

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One is the real sound,

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and the third is to have a large enough sample.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The first two methods

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
are to give up

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and control the experimental design.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The other is to give up a large enough database.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But what we are going to do today

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is to have a large enough database,

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and the design

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is exactly the same.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But what we give up today is to give up

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and control the sound.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In this case,

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can only say that we are the first article

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to do this.

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We have a lot of data.

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But when we give up

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and control the sound,

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
our experiment

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
will be done in a very

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
no-easy situation.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, if we can

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
reproduce

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
all the experimental results

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in the lab,

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
it means that the experimental results

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
are very stable.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As I said,

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
what we are going to use today

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is MobLab.

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
MobLab is an experimental platform

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
for all class economics experiments.

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If we take all the data from the class,

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it is actually good and bad.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Of course, the two biggest concerns are

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that all the students in the class

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
do not use money

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to provide their sound.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Most of the time, they just use

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the grade of the course

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
or other random numbers

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to provide their sound.

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is what we have lost control of.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The two biggest concerns are

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that many students in class

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
may not necessarily be

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the representative sample

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
of the culture.

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
However, there are still

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
a lot of benefits

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
for us to try this method.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
First of all,

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
there is no publication bias

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in our database.

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For example,

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
if you take the results

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
of the previous article

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
as a meta-analysis,

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you may get too good results.

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is called publication bias.

173
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
However,

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
all the results, good or bad,

175
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
are recorded in our database.

176
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Another thing is that

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
our company is

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
at least in the class of

179
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
experimental economics.

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you want to do a class experiment

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
in the world,

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you basically use our company.

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
In fact, our sample is very diverse.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There are many different areas.

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This gives us a lot of

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
variation to test.

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thirdly,

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the environment in which our data is generated

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is exactly the same.

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The interface, language,

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and the entire experiment process

192
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
are exactly the same.

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This means that we have

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
completely controlled

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the process of their game.

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
These are the three advantages

197
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that we think

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are very important.

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Before talking about these two areas,

200
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I would like to talk about

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
how big our dataset is.

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
First of all,

203
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we can see that

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
this table is a total of

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
10 areas in our dataset.

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can see that

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
this data is across North America,

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Europe, and Asia.

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
In Ultraman Game,

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
we have more than

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
15,000 sample points.

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
For those of you who do not know

213
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the economics of time,

214
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the data in Ultraman Game

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
is about 10 times more than

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
a normal article,

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
or 0 to 2.0.

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In DoubleAction,

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
there are basically 2.0 more.

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is a very large sample

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that we can test.

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Next,

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I will talk about these two areas.

224
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
These two areas are actually very simple.

225
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The first is Ultraman Game.

226
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In addition,

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
why do we choose these two areas?

228
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The first is because these two areas

229
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
are the most abundant in our database.

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The second is that these two areas

231
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
are basically the origin of

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the economics of time.

233
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In Ultraman Game,

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
there are two people in this game.

235
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
One is Proposer,

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the other is Responder.

237
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Proposer can decide

238
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
how much to give to the other party.

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This game is very simple.

240
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There is a ball in the middle.

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can decide how much to give to the other party.

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can pull the ball

243
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and decide how much to give to the other party.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you decide,

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you can press Submit.

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In this way, the other party can see

247
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
how much you gave to the other party.

248
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Next,

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
suppose I decide to give the other party $45.

250
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In this way,

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the other party can see

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that this is

253
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
a Proposer you have provided.

254
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Proposer is

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I take $55, you take $45.

256
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you want to accept it?

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you are Responder,

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
if you decide to accept it,

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you take $45, he takes $55.

260
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you refuse,

261
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
you both take $0.

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is a very simple environment.

263
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's like the simplest negotiation

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
in simulation life.

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For example, when you go to the night market to buy vegetables,

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you often say

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that you might say in the last round

268
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
don't pull the ball.

269
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like simulating such a concept.

270
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is the game interface

271
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
of our Ultraman Game.

272
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Next, I want to talk about

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
double-sided auction.

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The most classic example

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
of double-sided auction is

276
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
like Wall Street.

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They are selling stocks.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You often see some pictures and news photos

279
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that there may be a lot of machines

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
with a lot of stations.

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Many traders are raising their hands

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and shouting loudly.

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's like everyone is shouting at the same time.

284
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
How much do I want this? How much do I want this?

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's like buyers and sellers are arguing there at the same time.

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So double-sided auction is

287
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
compared to Ultraman Game.

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ultraman Game has only one side.

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I propose a proposal to you.

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In double-sided auction,

291
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
no matter which side, buyer or seller,

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
they can call at the same time.

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So in double-sided auction,

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I will introduce what this game is playing now.

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
One is a buyer and the other is a seller.

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So if you are a buyer today,

297
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you want to buy something.

298
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We are buying oranges here.

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In this game interface,

300
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the first thing you can see is

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
how much satisfaction you will get when you buy an orange.

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is called value.

303
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Next, you have to raise a price.

304
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can pull a slider bar here.

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can move left and right

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to decide how much you want to bid

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
to bid for this orange.

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you buy an orange,

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
your advantage is

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
your value today is

311
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
how much you spent to buy it.

312
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OK.

313
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you are buying,

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
you have two ways to buy.

315
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
One is to bid here.

316
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The other one is

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
if there are a lot of buyers in front,

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
they have already asked for a price.

319
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So you can also buy directly at the lowest price.

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
OK.

321
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The next one is

322
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
seller.

323
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We have the same interface.

324
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If you sell an orange today,

325
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
you have a cost.

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So you will see your cost here.

327
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
OK.

328
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Next,

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you can pull a slider bar here

330
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to decide how much you want to bid.

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can ask for a price here.

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Or you can decide

333
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to sell the highest price here.

334
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I can sell it here.

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Then pay attention here.

336
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There is a special design in our game interface.

337
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
When you decide to

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
ask for a price here,

339
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
if you ask for a price,

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
if the transaction

341
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
makes you pay a negative price,

342
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will make it red

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to warn you

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
this transaction may bring you

346
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
a negative price.

347
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So this is a double option

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
game interface.

349
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let me introduce

350
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
our game settings here.

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is because

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in such a simple game interface,

353
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
many teachers

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
can adjust the game parameters

355
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
themselves.

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But in most cases,

357
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
many teachers use our preset options.

358
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In Ultimatum Game,

359
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
you can divide the money

360
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
into 100 yuan.

361
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In the case of double option,

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
there are five buyers in total.

363
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then each person

364
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
can have three products to buy.

365
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That is to say, there are a total of

366
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
15 things in the market to buy and sell.

367
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If we draw this value,

368
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
this is our black line.

369
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is our demand curve.

370
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Then the gray line

371
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
is our supply curve.

372
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Before I start,

373
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to talk a little bit

374
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
about the theoretical prediction

375
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
of these two games.

376
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In Ultimatum Game,

377
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the theoretical prediction is very simple.

378
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If we look at it

379
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
from the perspective of the respondent,

380
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
we say that

381
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the balance of a game is basically

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that if I do this option,

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
the reward is higher than the other option,

384
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
then I should do this.

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So if you look at the responder,

386
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
no matter what positive reward he sees,

387
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I should accept it.

388
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
For example, if I take 1 yuan,

389
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
it is still better than 0 yuan.

390
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So in this case,

391
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
if I get a positive reward,

392
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I should accept it.

393
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If I get a negative reward,

394
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I should accept it.

395
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If I get a positive reward,

396
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I should accept it.

397
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So this is the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Game.

398
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But in fact,

399
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
in the past 50 years of research,

400
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
we all know that

401
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
this theory is basically written to be overturned.

402
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This is because many times

403
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
when we do research,

404
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
we will find that

405
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
basically all the recipients

406
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
will not only give the other party 1 yuan.

407
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is Ultimatum Game.

408
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Then in Double Option,

409
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
this is like a high school science textbook,

410
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
you will see Supply and Demand Curve.

411
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you want to solve this game,

412
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it is actually very simple,

413
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you have to find a price

414
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to clear all the markets.

415
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So if you are here,

416
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
this gray curve is the price

417
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
of our theoretical prediction.

418
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It just happens to be the intersection

419
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
of Supply and Demand Curve.

420
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If the price is higher,

421
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
it means that

422
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
there are more sellers who want to sell things at this time,

423
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and fewer sellers want to sell.

424
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So if the supply and demand are uneven at this time,

425
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
this force will force the price down.

426
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But if the price is lower,

427
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
then there are more people who want to sell,

428
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and fewer people want to sell.

429
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So this force will push the price back.

430
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is also the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.

431
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is our equilibrium price.

432
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Then in our prediction market,

433
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the number of equilibrium is 13,

434
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and the price of equilibrium is 112 yuan.

435
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So this is our game setting.

436
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to stop here for a while.

437
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is everyone OK?

438
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If there is no problem,

439
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I will continue to talk about the results.

440
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wait a minute,

441
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
let me confirm first.

442
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So the buyer's

443
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
willing price here is

444
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
150,

445
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the prediction is 150,145,

446
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
140, and so on?

447
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
From 150 to 115.

448
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So from 150 to minus 3,

449
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
how much is the last one?

450
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The last one is about

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
112 or 117.

452
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then the other side is from 50,

453
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and then keep adding up.

454
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes.

455
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Thank you.

456
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
OK, then I have no problem.

457
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I want to continue.

458
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Let's talk about

459
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the overall results.

460
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
First of all, I want to show you

461
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
this table.

462
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let me summarize first.

463
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We mainly looked at five outcome variables.

464
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What are some of its numerical statistics?

465
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
First of all, in the Ultimation Game,

466
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
we mainly looked at two outcome variables.

467
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
One is how much proposal you give the other party.

468
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The other is how much your acceptance rate is.

469
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
First of all, we see the first one.

470
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In the case of 100 yuan,

471
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
on average,

472
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you will give the other party about 36 yuan.

473
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This number is actually

474
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
very close to the result of our experiment.

475
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
For example, if we take

476
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Rock's article in 1991 as a benchmark,

477
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the average of the article

478
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
is 40.

479
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
In fact, our gap is only 4%,

480
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
so I think it's a very close result.

481
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then the second one

482
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we look at is the acceptance rate.

483
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What we are looking at now is unconditional.

484
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If we look at

485
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the unconditional acceptance rate,

486
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
the acceptance rate is 66%.

487
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Rock's result is about 73%.

488
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So the gap is only 6% or 7%.

489
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But because our offer

490
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
is relatively low,

491
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think our result

492
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
is able to reproduce

493
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Rock's result at the aggregate level.

494
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hello, I have a question.

495
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You just said

496
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
he made 40 and then 36.

497
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Or let's just say

498
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
how much is the experimental

499
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and how much is the theoretical expectation.

500
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think it's very close.

501
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What I want to ask is

502
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
what do you think?

503
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Because you didn't show

504
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
your uncertainty range.

505
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Maybe it's actually a very stable difference,

506
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
so it's not very close.

507
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is

508
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
what I will continue to talk about later.

509
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Because I'm going to show you a statistic now.

510
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Show you an approximate

511
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
rapid statistics.

512
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you're right,

513
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I should do some statistics

514
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
to see if there is a significant difference.

515
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But in fact,

516
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the first one is

517
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
this is one point.

518
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If I want to do an assessment,

519
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
there is another problem.

520
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Our sample number is very unbalanced.

521
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Very unbalanced.

522
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So it means that our sample number

523
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
is about more than 10,000 points,

524
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and their sample number is only more than 1,000 points.

525
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So in fact, many times,

526
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
when you do an assessment like this,

527
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
sometimes there are some

528
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
things that you need to pay attention to.

529
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But in fact,

530
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
at least in the case of showing data now,

531
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can only say it out loud.

532
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What I can only say now is

533
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to see if it's close or not.

534
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Next,

535
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the other three are

536
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
the results of the double option.

537
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
For the double option, I'm going to use three indexes

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to talk about whether this market

539
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
has been able to

540
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
refine

541
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
the prediction of the theory.

542
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The first three indexes we look at

543
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
are the average error.

544
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The definition of the average error is actually below.

545
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
DQ is the price of

546
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
each unit

547
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
of each contract.

548
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Subtract.

549
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This means

550
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
how much is the difference

551
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
from our theoretical prediction.

552
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Next, I look at the average.

553
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Because we often have

554
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
about 800 different market configurations.

555
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So in order to make everyone

556
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
comparable, I use

557
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the average price to standardize it.

558
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So we can actually use this index

559
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
to see how much our accuracy is.

560
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The next one is

561
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
our

562
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Smith Alpha.

563
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Smith is to commemorate

564
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Brown-Smith.

565
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This index is actually very simple.

566
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It is the distance

567
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
between my price

568
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and

569
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
the price of my theoretical prediction.

570
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I take the square here.

571
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then I take another one.

572
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Next, I look at the average distance.

573
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Then I open a number.

574
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So it's actually like my standard error.

575
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But

576
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
what I'm doing today is not average.

577
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What I'm doing today is

578
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
theoretical prediction.

579
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Next, I still use

580
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
my average price to standardize it.

581
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I can use this index

582
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
to measure the fluctuation of price.

583
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The next

584
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and the third index is Efficiency.

585
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
For Efficiency, I want to use

586
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
the above picture to explain.

587
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So in this

588
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
market equation,

589
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
if this seller

590
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
makes a deal with this buyer,

591
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
then it shows

592
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the above section

593
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
in the middle

594
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
is the profit I made.

595
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's the buyer's profit.

596
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The following section is the seller's profit.

597
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So it tells me

598
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the total length of this section

599
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
is the

600
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
profit I can make

601
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
from this deal.

602
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That is to say,

603
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I sum up the area of

604
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the supply curve and demand curve.

605
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
In theory,

606
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
this is the total

607
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
surplus I can get.

608
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So this year's efficiency

609
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
definition is

610
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the efficiency I achieve

611
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
in this market

612
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and the efficiency

613
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I expect in theory.

614
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The following

615
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
can be seen as

616
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the first one is

617
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
my average error is about 6%.

618
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That is to say, my average price

619
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is about 6% higher than the theory.

620
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The next one is

621
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
my Smith Alpha.

622
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The fluctuation rate

623
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
is about 30%.

624
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The efficiency

625
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
is about 84%.

626
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
In fact,

627
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
these numbers are

628
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
significantly different from the theory.

629
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
However,

630
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
this is related to another problem.

631
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In our lab,

632
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
we often let our customers

633
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
play the same game for 10 or 20 rounds.

634
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
At this time,

635
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
after more than 10 rounds,

636
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the price will become very stable.

637
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But here,

638
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
if we play for 10 rounds,

639
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the customer may have gone up to level 3.

640
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is why the price

641
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
here is unstable.

642
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
However,

643
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I will try to show

644
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
if our students

645
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
can play enough rounds,

646
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
where will they end up?

647
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is the result

648
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
of the double option.

649
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's continue to see

650
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the whole distribution.

651
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know

652
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
which computer

653
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I used to jump out.

654
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't know

655
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
what to do now.

656
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Thank you for reminding me.

657
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I hope you don't

658
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
knock on my door anymore.

659
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't want to leave the group.

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you.

661
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's continue.

662
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
First, let's see

663
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
the whole distribution of Proposal Offer.

664
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Because

665
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
in our game design,

666
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the teacher can decide

667
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
whether to play one round, two rounds,

668
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
or several rounds.

669
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If you play more than two rounds,

670
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
it will become a repeat game.

671
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If we divide the data

672
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
into a repeat game and a single game,

673
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
we can see

674
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that

675
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the first point

676
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
is

677
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
theoretical prediction.

678
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This is theoretical prediction.

679
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is theoretical prediction.

680
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So here,

681
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
whether it is a one-shot game or a repeat game,

682
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
only about 10% of the audience

683
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
played on the theoretical prediction.

684
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Next, we have seen

685
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
50% of the audience

686
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
played on the theoretical prediction.

687
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Next, we have seen

688
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
50% of the audience

689
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
played on the theoretical prediction.

690
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The first observation

691
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
is that we have a lot of Proposal Offer

692
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
on the natural focal point.

693
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I played 0,

694
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
10, 20, 30.

695
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This is the first observation.

696
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The second observation is that

697
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
only 6% of the audience

698
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
gave themselves

699
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
less than the Proposal Offer.

700
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I gave myself more.

701
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In this game,

702
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
there should be a first mover advantage.

703
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I should give you 50% if I'm great.

704
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
According to the theory, I should not give you 10%.

705
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But only 6% of the audience

706
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
gave more than the Proposal Offer.

707
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This is the first observation.

708
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Next, let's compare

709
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
the distribution with ROF.

710
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This is ROF's distribution

711
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
in 1991.

712
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
As Mr. Zhang said,

713
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
we did not do a statistical analysis.

714
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So we can only see

715
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the distribution characteristics.

716
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The first observation is that

717
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
the density is

718
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
about 50% to 40%.

719
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The density is about 50% to 40%.

720
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But this is

721
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ROF's distribution.

722
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So we can

723
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
give them the result.

724
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
In addition,

725
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
the biggest difference

726
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
between ROF and ROF

727
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
is that almost no one

728
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
played in the theoretical prediction.

729
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But about 10% of the audience

730
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
played in the theoretical prediction.

731
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
In fact,

732
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
at least I and Colin

733
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
are not sure.

734
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This may be the reason for the prediction option.

735
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In the beginning of a game,

736
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the prediction ball

737
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
is placed on the theoretical prediction.

738
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So if the students

739
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
press the button

740
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
without thinking,

741
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
it means that

742
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
there is no strategy at all.

743
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So 10% of the audience

744
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
may play in the theoretical prediction.

745
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Of course, it may also be affected by the prediction option.

746
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But this is...

747
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you have the response time here?

748
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I will fix it later.

749
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
According to your hypothesis,

750
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the response time should be the lowest.

751
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But the response time is actually very high.

752
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But I will show the result later.

753
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So it may not be the result of the prediction option.

754
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes.

755
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But...

756
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sorry, Bo-Xuan.

757
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Can you show the previous video?

758
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
OK.

759
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Because I just thought

760
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
if you said it was because of the default option,

761
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
then you should see...

762
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Because the information of ROF

763
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
is very rare.

764
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Almost none.

765
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yes.

766
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But the people who chose 1

767
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
seem to be more likely than 0.

768
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yes.

769
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So...

770
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Although 0 is so high,

771
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
it may be the effect of the default option.

772
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But it seems that there are more people

773
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
who are more likely.

774
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
If you look at the balance

775
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
as 0 or 1,

776
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
there are more people who chose 1.

777
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes.

778
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's what I think.

779
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank you for this comment.

780
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But it is indeed...

781
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It should be...

782
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
In this...

783
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There should be a lot of people who play with the theory.

784
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But it is indeed the default option.

785
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This effect is indeed a confirmation.

786
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I will continue to talk about it.

787
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Then here is

788
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
our acceptance rate.

789
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Because I think this result is very cool.

790
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So it doesn't matter if I talk about it later.

791
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I will talk about it later.

792
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
First of all, because what we talked about earlier

793
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
is the unconditional acceptance rate.

794
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What is more interesting now

795
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
is to measure the conditional acceptance rate.

796
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Unconditional...

797
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What is the number of offers I see?

798
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That is to say, because we measure

799
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the expected value of the conditions.

800
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Then this is actually

801
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
a function of an offer.

802
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So on this graph,

803
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
my X-axis shows

804
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
how many proposal offers I see.

805
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What is the acceptance rate?

806
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
OK.

807
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
In this graph, the black dot represents the information of one-shot game.

808
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The orange dot represents the information of repeat game.

809
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Next,

810
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
the size of each point

811
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
represents

812
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
the density of the histogram

813
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
we saw earlier.

814
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So if you put the size of this ball

815
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
projected to the X-axis,

816
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
it becomes the entire histogram.

817
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
OK.

818
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Next, because when I was checking the data,

819
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
between 49 and 50,

820
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
there is actually a jump of about 20%.

821
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So I thought it was strange.

822
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So I used a specification

823
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
to measure

824
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the P-splice linear

825
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
specification.

826
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So what you can see

827
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
is that I think it is quite special.

828
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If you are less than 50,

829
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
you see

830
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that your acceptance rate is this curve.

831
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
When it is greater than 50,

832
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
there will be a big break here.

833
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This is completely obvious.

834
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It is very obvious.

835
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When we measure the standard error,

836
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
we also use

837
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
a cluster.

838
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We have a cluster at the session level.

839
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So we use the most conservative estimation

840
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
to estimate our variability.

841
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So in this case,

842
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
it is also very obvious.

843
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If we put all the data together,

844
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
there is a jump of about 20% to 21%.

845
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If we divide it into one-shot game

846
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and repeat game,

847
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
the jump is about 16%.

848
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
If we divide it into one-shot game

849
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and repeat game, the jump is about 26%.

850
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
First of all,

851
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
this phenomenon has not been seen

852
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
in the first 50 years.

853
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I think it is a very cool discovery.

854
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Next, let's talk about 1.

855
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
First of all,

856
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
this interpretation is actually very complicated.

857
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Because we have a lot of confounds here

858
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
that our database cannot detect.

859
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But what we can be sure is that

860
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
at least the source of this break

861
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
is the difference in payoffs.

862
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because you can see that

863
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
when we come in from the left B,

864
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
you can come in from 49.99999.

865
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Then the next is coming in from the right B,

866
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
it is about 50.0000001.

867
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
In fact, this gap is less than

868
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
how small your Epsilon is.

869
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So this effect is definitely not

870
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
from monetary payoffs.

871
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Or even if you are in a hypothetical state,

872
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it is basically not from

873
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
how much your payoff is.

874
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So it is very possible that

875
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
you have to consider

876
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
how other people

877
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
distribute the whole proposal.

878
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Next, there are many interpretations here.

879
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We can't uniquely pin down.

880
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It may be like

881
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
because you are from 49.999 to 50.

882
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
There is a big gap here,

883
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
which is equality.

884
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because this paragraph can also mean

885
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that I may be very, very care.

886
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Am I equal to you?

887
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Or this is the first one.

888
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Or another one is that

889
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
if you don't give me 50,

890
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I may punish you.

891
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So this is why this paragraph

892
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
may be 10% more in the repeated game.

893
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It may be that this 10% is more

894
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that I want to punish you.

895
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or I may care about my fairness.

896
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Or I simply

897
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
since we are not playing real money,

898
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I just don't want to lose you.

899
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So it means that

900
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
my acceptance rate is relatively low.

901
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But when I can at least not lose you,

902
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
my acceptance rate is about the same.

903
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
This is what we see

904
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
in the data.

905
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I want to ask

906
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
what is your idea?

907
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I don't know.

908
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Before you do this,

909
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
there is a problem.

910
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Although you know a lot,

911
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
you just showed us

912
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that there are very few offers above 50.

913
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There are about 600.

914
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So

915
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
your estimate of acceptance rate

916
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
is because

917
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
you are not using strategy method.

918
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You are showing an offer.

919
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So it means that

920
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the point of return you are running now

921
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
when it is below 50

922
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the variation

923
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
is relatively good.

924
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But when it is above 50,

925
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
your estimate may not be stable.

926
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But this point

927
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
is really interesting.

928
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Because

929
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
let me think about it.

930
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Have you ever tried

931
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
not to use

932
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
a linear return when it is below 50?

933
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I haven't tried it yet.

934
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But I want to try quadratic.

935
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
There is another possibility.

936
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It is not like a breakpoint.

937
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It is a

938
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
more complicated non-linear.

939
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Because you fit linear,

940
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
it looks like a breakpoint.

941
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If you look at the data directly,

942
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it looks at least

943
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I think it is quite linear.

944
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If you look at the

945
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
orange repeating game,

946
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it looks like

947
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
it is a

948
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
falling down.

949
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But it is stable

950
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
when it is above 40.

951
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It is like quadratic.

952
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you only look at

953
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
black,

954
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
it looks like

955
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it is

956
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
between 20 and 50.

957
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It is a steep drop.

958
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But

959
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
it is stable

960
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
when it is below 20.

961
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So

962
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
there is a possibility here.

963
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's just because

964
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
you fit a

965
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
straight line relationship.

966
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Anyway, I will try quadratic.

967
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But this is

968
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
what I estimated.

969
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I think it is quite interesting.

970
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
If this is true,

971
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
how do we

972
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
reproduce this

973
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
breakpoint in the lab?

974
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Let's look at

975
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the result of ROS.

976
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
If we look at the data of ROS,

977
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
this breakpoint is completely invisible.

978
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think this result

979
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
is quite special.

980
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We have a lot of work hypothesis

981
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
running at the same time.

982
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But we have tried

983
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
a power test.

984
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
If we only draw the data,

985
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
the sample number is about 0.

986
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So if we only draw 10% of the data,

987
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
can we estimate this breakpoint?

988
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
In our data, we can still estimate this breakpoint.

989
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So it may not be because

990
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
of the problem of power in statistics.

991
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Then another

992
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
work hypothesis is

993
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
hypothetical stake.

994
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Is it because it's all

995
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
not about making money?

996
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I care more about the ranking between you and me.

997
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
At least I don't want to lose you.

998
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So

999
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
this is my current work hypothesis.

1000
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This may be

1001
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
the next article to do

1002
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
is how to reproduce this breakpoint in the lab.

1003
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think it's quite interesting.

1004
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Can you remind us

1005
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
again

1006
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
the population composition of your data?

1007
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
For example,

1008
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the proportion of each state.

1009
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We have

1010
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
seen that

1011
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
the United States has the West,

1012
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
the Middle West,

1013
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
the Northeast,

1014
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
the South America,

1015
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Canada,

1016
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
the United Kingdom,

1017
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Spain,

1018
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
China, Japan,

1019
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and Singapore.

1020
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
What about the proportion?

1021
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
About 80% of the data is in the North,

1022
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
about 10% in Europe,

1023
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and 10% in Asia.

1024
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OK.

1025
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So overall,

1026
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
this result

1027
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
is more conservative.

1028
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It's based on the North America,

1029
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
right?

1030
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes.

1031
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
OK, I just want to ask.

1032
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But I want to add

1033
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that the problem is

1034
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
all the results in the lab

1035
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
are not in the North America.

1036
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes.

1037
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That's true.

1038
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OK.

1039
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Then I'll...

1040
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Bo-Xuan,

1041
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
if you want to compare

1042
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
with Ross's article,

1043
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Ross's article is mainly not in the North America,

1044
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
but the data of

1045
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
other works

1046
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
such as Automaton Game

1047
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
can be observed.

1048
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I have almost never seen any shortcomings.

1049
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes.

1050
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
OK.

1051
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because of the time...

1052
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You can go first.

1053
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll go first.

1054
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I have a question.

1055
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Because the article was written

1056
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
about 20 years ago,

1057
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
right?

1058
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes.

1059
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you think the change of time

1060
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
has a big impact on the data?

1061
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Of course it's possible.

1062
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Because a lot of social preferences

1063
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
may change with time.

1064
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
For example, the value of Taiwanese

1065
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
may change every few years.

1066
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So it's true that

1067
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
there may be a difference.

1068
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But we can see that

1069
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
there is a difference.

1070
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
If we look at it simply,

1071
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
if it has any impact on the shortcomings,

1072
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
maybe it's okay.

1073
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Because the shortcomings may be a mirror effect.

1074
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But this is a big problem.

1075
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We can talk about it later.

1076
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Then I'll go on.

1077
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Finally, the teacher just said

1078
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
to show the reaction time.

1079
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Because our server does record

1080
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the reaction time.

1081
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Then I look here.

1082
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Because in one-shot game and repeated game,

1083
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
the reaction time is very similar.

1084
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So I only use one-shot game

1085
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to demonstrate the result.

1086
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
First of all, the black line,

1087
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
the y-axis is the reaction time.

1088
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The black line represents the reaction time.

1089
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Then the black line is

1090
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
our lowest estimation.

1091
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Then the orange line,

1092
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
the y-axis is my acceptance rate.

1093
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Then this is

1094
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
also my lowest estimation.

1095
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Then below me,

1096
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
the x-axis is

1097
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
my offer.

1098
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If you don't have any concept,

1099
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
you can think of it as

1100
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
doing a return in each section

1101
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
to measure it.

1102
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This means that

1103
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm fitting the data

1104
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
when it's close to infinity.

1105
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's very close.

1106
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So what the teacher saw at the beginning

1107
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
was at zero.

1108
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It actually took a lot of time.

1109
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It actually took almost 20 seconds

1110
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
to make a decision.

1111
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
However,

1112
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
at 50,

1113
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
there was a very sharp drop.

1114
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It only took about 8 seconds

1115
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
to make a decision.

1116
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
This means that

1117
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
50-50 may be

1118
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
a very special allocation.

1119
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
At least for them,

1120
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
if I see 50-50,

1121
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't have to think too much

1122
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and I can decide to accept it.

1123
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Another thing is

1124
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
we see a very sharp kink

1125
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
at 50-50.

1126
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's true that

1127
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
no matter how

1128
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
qualitative you are,

1129
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
at least we can still see something.

1130
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is the data

1131
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
on the reaction time.

1132
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
However,

1133
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the interpretation is quite special.

1134
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
At least for Show,

1135
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
at 50-50,

1136
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
we can spend very little time

1137
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
to make a decision.

1138
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You can't record

1139
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the proposal time

1140
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
to enter the game.

1141
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because if you want to see

1142
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
if it's default...

1143
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We can see

1144
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
the time it takes

1145
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
to enter the game.

1146
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
If you want to see

1147
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
if it's the default option

1148
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
that causes a lot of people to raise their hands,

1149
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you should look at the proposal time.

1150
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes, you're right.

1151
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
We did look at the proposal time.

1152
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I remember

1153
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
it took a lot of time here.

1154
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Hello?

1155
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let me respond.

1156
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
At the close to 0,

1157
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
you said

1158
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it took a lot of time.

1159
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You mentioned

1160
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
that

1161
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
you were thinking

1162
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
that

1163
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
at 0,

1164
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
there would be a lot of people raising their hands.

1165
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
At that time,

1166
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I was wondering

1167
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
if it was because the starting point

1168
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
of the slider bar was 0.

1169
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
However,

1170
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
if they spent a lot of time

1171
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
to think about it,

1172
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't think

1173
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
it's because...

1174
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I think it's a bit like

1175
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
negating

1176
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
the explanation you mentioned

1177
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
at the beginning.

1178
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I just accepted it casually.

1179
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's right.

1180
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But it took a lot of time here.

1181
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It took a lot of time

1182
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
to respond.

1183
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But I should show you

1184
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the proposal time.

1185
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But it's true.

1186
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It's funny to explain the coding.

1187
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It took a lot of time

1188
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to look at this.

1189
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
A lot of people didn't want to accept it.

1190
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It took me a long time

1191
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
to accept it.

1192
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's right.

1193
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Bo-xuan, you can

1194
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
split the responder into

1195
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
accepting and not accepting.

1196
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Okay.

1197
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
This point is quite special.

1198
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'll split it.

1199
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I'll write it down.

1200
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Next,

1201
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I still have some time.

1202
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm going to talk about the result of double option.

1203
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Double option, first of all...

1204
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Bo-xuan, before you enter the double option,

1205
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
let's talk about the

1206
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Automatic Game breakpoint.

1207
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I was just thinking,

1208
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
you just said that one possibility of the breakpoint

1209
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
is that everyone cares about fairness.

1210
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
The other possibility is that

1211
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
everyone cares about

1212
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
not counting you.

1213
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Is there a way to look at

1214
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
the 50 proposed

1215
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
in your data?

1216
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Is the acceptance rate

1217
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
particularly high?

1218
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Or is it the whole breakpoint

1219
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
after the breakpoint is raised

1220
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
to form a frequency curve?

1221
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Because if you care about fairness,

1222
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
maybe after 50 is particularly high,

1223
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
there will be another breakpoint

1224
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
after 51 and 52.

1225
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
One-shot game is like this.

1226
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
There is no repeated game.

1227
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Okay.

1228
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'll keep talking.

1229
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

1230
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The next double option is...

1231
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The first thing I want to show here

1232
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is what the data looks like.

1233
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
This is our predicted market.

1234
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
The next one is

1235
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
the price fluctuation.

1236
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This is just an example.

1237
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I have 10 regions here.

1238
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I choose a market for each region.

1239
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I draw it out to show you

1240
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
what it looks like.

1241
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You can see that I only draw four periods.

1242
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Because the length is about four periods.

1243
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If you look at the first period,

1244
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
everyone may be very noisy.

1245
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Then look at the second and third periods.

1246
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
In fact, the price fluctuation

1247
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
becomes less.

1248
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Then look at the fourth period.

1249
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The more they play, the more stable they become.

1250
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So what we want to see here is

1251
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
that under the double option market mechanism,

1252
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
as long as they play about three or four times,

1253
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
consumers can find

1254
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
a balanced price, even if I don't tell them anything.

1255
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
The next thing is

1256
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
what I said earlier.

1257
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Because our bidders play very short,

1258
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
we want to estimate

1259
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
what it is like.

1260
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
If it can play a lot of games,

1261
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
where will it end up?

1262
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
We spent about a month

1263
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
with Alex

1264
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
to figure this out.

1265
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
First of all, let's talk about intuition.

1266
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Don't think about intuition.

1267
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Let me give you an example.

1268
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Let's say

1269
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
a lot of people here have the same experience.

1270
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
When you apply for a PhD,

1271
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I want to know

1272
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
how this student

1273
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
will perform in the next career.

1274
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But the only information I can know

1275
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
is his GPA for the next four years.

1276
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So

1277
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
at this time,

1278
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
if a student wants to estimate

1279
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
what will happen next,

1280
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
the only thing he can do is to increase his GPA

1281
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
in different periods of time.

1282
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So it's possible that

1283
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I put more players in the last GPA

1284
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and fewer players in the first GPA.

1285
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So in this market,

1286
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
you can look at two parts.

1287
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
First, the left side is our dependable variable.

1288
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
On the right side,

1289
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
if T is 1,

1290
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
that means I'm in the first period.

1291
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
In this case,

1292
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
it's back to the simplest way to go back.

1293
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
This is very common.

1294
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
In the first period,

1295
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
if you use the example of GPA,

1296
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
it means that in the first semester,

1297
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
there may be a lot of variables.

1298
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Maybe it's because you're a middle school student

1299
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
or you're from another school,

1300
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
so it will affect your GPA in the first semester.

1301
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But in the second semester,

1302
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I only put you at the starting point.

1303
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Maybe you're a middle school student

1304
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
or something like that to explain this.

1305
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I only give you a quarter of the weight.

1306
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I also give you a quarter of the weight

1307
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
of your GPA at that time.

1308
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
It means that your GPA at this time

1309
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
may be only half,

1310
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and it can be attributed to

1311
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
the population composition in front of you.

1312
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
In the third period,

1313
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I put your GPA at two-thirds of the weight.

1314
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
In this case,

1315
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I only give you one-third of the weight

1316
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
of the starting point.

1317
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
In other words,

1318
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
if I can make T

1319
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
converge to infinity,

1320
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
then my beta2

1321
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
is actually the progressive estimate

1322
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
of our dependent variable.

1323
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
In other words,

1324
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
if we put this y

1325
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
on all the indicators of the first three markets,

1326
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
it means that this market

1327
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
will converge to where

1328
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
if consumers can play enough.

1329
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
If we put this value

1330
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
in front of our three dependent variables,

1331
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
this is the mean error deviation.

1332
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The final price is only

1333
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
1% higher than the average price.

1334
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It is not significantly different

1335
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
from the theoretical estimation.

1336
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The final price change

1337
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
is reduced to 11%.

1338
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Although the point estimate is a bit big,

1339
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
it is also not significantly different

1340
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
from the theoretical estimation.

1341
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Finally, we can reduce the efficiency

1342
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
to 97%,

1343
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
which is not significantly different from 1%.

1344
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So these results are basically

1345
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
the same.

1346
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
At least we can prove that

1347
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
double option is a very stable

1348
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
price mechanism

1349
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
to achieve 100% efficiency.

1350
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
At that time, we saw that

1351
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
our data also showed the same thing.

1352
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
When our students can play enough,

1353
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
all of our waffers

1354
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
should be exhausted.

1355
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The last word is

1356
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Can I go back to the last page?

1357
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yes, you can.

1358
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I want to confirm

1359
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
why there is no variable

1360
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
next to beta 2

1361
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
in the model?

1362
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Because this means that

1363
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I want to see where your final GPA

1364
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
is. I bring a constant here.

1365
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I multiply here

1366
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
by a constant.

1367
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
This means that I am adding

1368
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
your GPA

1369
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
to your original

1370
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
demographic variation.

1371
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Is it OK?

1372
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It doesn't matter.

1373
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
If you don't understand,

1374
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I will discuss with you later.

1375
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I will continue.

1376
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
What we see at the end is that

1377
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
although there are some

1378
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
theoretical estimates,

1379
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
if there are still some gaps,

1380
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
where are they?

1381
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
What we see at the end is the amount of transactions.

1382
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The horizontal axis

1383
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
is the amount of theoretical estimates.

1384
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The vertical axis is the amount of theoretical estimates.

1385
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The horizontal axis is the amount of theoretical estimates.

1386
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Here is the real

1387
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
amount of observations.

1388
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You can see that

1389
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
if the market is not balanced,

1390
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
we are often under-traded.

1391
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This is because

1392
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
the last 1-2 transactions

1393
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
may bring us 1-2%

1394
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
of the efficiency gap.

1395
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
In this case,

1396
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I am too lazy to make the last 1-2 cents.

1397
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I am too lazy to make the last 1-2 cents.

1398
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
This is the main result of the double option.

1399
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
We still have about 10 minutes.

1400
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I want to talk about

1401
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
what I said earlier.

1402
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We have a lot of

1403
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
transactions in different countries.

1404
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I want to use

1405
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
some metanonysis tools

1406
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
to analyze

1407
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
the composition

1408
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
of these transactions.

1409
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The first thing we look at

1410
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
is the transactions between countries.

1411
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The first thing we look at

1412
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
is the transactions between countries.

1413
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
This is a

1414
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
calculation in metanonysis.

1415
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This is a calculation in metanonysis.

1416
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It is called I-square.

1417
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
If you look at the graph,

1418
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
you can see that

1419
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
these are

1420
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the average transactions

1421
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
of the proposal offer.

1422
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Next,

1423
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
we have all the transactions.

1424
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
We have the transactions between countries.

1425
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Of course, we also have the transactions within the country.

1426
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What we want to know is

1427
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
the proportion of transactions

1428
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
between countries.

1429
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Let's calculate I-square.

1430
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Since we don't have much time,

1431
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I won't talk about how to calculate I-square.

1432
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
However,

1433
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
the proportion of I-square is

1434
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
the number of transactions

1435
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
from between regions.

1436
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We can see that

1437
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
the result of the calculation is

1438
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
86.6% of the proposal offer.

1439
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
This is a very significant transaction.

1440
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Although we dare not say this is a cultural difference,

1441
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
what we can say is

1442
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
at least we can see that

1443
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
the transactions between countries are very significant.

1444
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
From the same perspective,

1445
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
we look at the acceptance rate.

1446
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The acceptance rate is special

1447
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
because we want to look at the acceptance rate of conditions.

1448
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
What we have to do is

1449
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
to compare the shape of the whole probability function.

1450
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
In order to make it

1451
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
comparable,

1452
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
what we can do is

1453
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
we ask for a logic regression.

1454
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
On the left,

1455
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
we put 0 or 0.1.

1456
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
On the right,

1457
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
we put 10 countries' dummy variables.

1458
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
On the right,

1459
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
we put 10 countries' dummy variables.

1460
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The result of the calculation is

1461
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
the coefficient of the dummy variable

1462
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
is the shape of the whole probability function.

1463
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We use this coefficient

1464
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
to measure the variation between countries.

1465
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We can see that

1466
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
only 30% of the variation

1467
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
comes from countries.

1468
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
This is not significant.

1469
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
On the right,

1470
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
we can see that

1471
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Proposal Offer has a significant variation

1472
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
between countries.

1473
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The acceptance rate is not significant.

1474
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This is in response to

1475
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Roth's conjecture in 1991.

1476
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
In 1991,

1477
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Roth proposed a hypothesis

1478
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
that the cultural difference

1479
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
between countries

1480
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
should be

1481
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
influenced by

1482
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Proposal Offer.

1483
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
However,

1484
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the acceptance rate is not affected.

1485
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
This is a good evidence

1486
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
to respond to

1487
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Roth's initial hypothesis.

1488
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
This is a good evidence to respond to

1489
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Roth's initial hypothesis.

1490
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Finally, we look at the variation

1491
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
between double options.

1492
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
We look at the first round

1493
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
of the market.

1494
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Then we look at

1495
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
the first price

1496
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and the last price

1497
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
between them.

1498
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We want to know

1499
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
how the market price

1500
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
is balanced.

1501
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
This is the first price

1502
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
of each market.

1503
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
We can see that

1504
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
only 27.3% of the variation

1505
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
comes from countries.

1506
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
This is not significant.

1507
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
We can see that

1508
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
the first price

1509
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
between countries

1510
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
is very noisy

1511
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
because of

1512
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
the standard error.

1513
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
However,

1514
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
the standard error bar

1515
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
is quite large in other countries.

1516
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
In the first round,

1517
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
you may be wondering

1518
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
what the price is.

1519
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
In the last price,

1520
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
the standard error bar

1521
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
is very small.

1522
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Basically,

1523
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
every country

1524
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
can predict the price.

1525
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
If we look at

1526
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
the overall price distribution,

1527
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the first price

1528
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
is about 0.33%.

1529
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
In the last price,

1530
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
the overall price is only 14%,

1531
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
so the standard error bar is 60%.

1532
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This tells us that

1533
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
in the beginning,

1534
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
you may not know

1535
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
what the price is,

1536
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
but in the end,

1537
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
you can get the balance

1538
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
very stable.

1539
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
The market will tell you

1540
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
what the balance looks like.

1541
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
In the end,

1542
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I will summarize

1543
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
with this video.

1544
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
In this project,

1545
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
we tested

1546
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
the stability of

1547
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
the final purchase.

1548
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
In the Ultimate Game,

1549
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
we can see that

1550
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
more than 94% of the proposals

1551
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
are offered at 50%.

1552
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Many of the proposals

1553
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
will be offered

1554
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
at the natural breakpoint.

1555
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
In terms of acceptance rate,

1556
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
we saw a 20% breakpoint.

1557
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
In the repeat auction,

1558
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
we saw 10% more

1559
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
breakpoints.

1560
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
In terms of response time,

1561
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
it is basically the lowest

1562
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
at 50%.

1563
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
In the double auction,

1564
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
no matter which of the three indicators

1565
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
we use, accuracy,

1566
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
fluctuation, or efficiency,

1567
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
we can predict

1568
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
when our students

1569
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
can play enough.

1570
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
In the end,

1571
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
we tested

1572
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
all the variations.

1573
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
In the Ultimate Game,

1574
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the proposal offer

1575
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
has more variables

1576
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
than the acceptance rate.

1577
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
This corresponds to

1578
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Roth's contracture in 1991.

1579
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
In the Ultimate Game

1580
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and the double auction,

1581
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
we saw a big difference

1582
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
between the two countries.

1583
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
This corresponds to the fact that

1584
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
the double auction is a very stable mechanism

1585
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
in every country.

1586
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I think this is

1587
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
all I have.

1588
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I will show my email.

1589
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
If you have any questions,

1590
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
you can email me or contact me on Facebook.

1591
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We have about 5 minutes left.

1592
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Let's see what questions you have.

1593
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Do you have any comments?

1594
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Thank you.

1595
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Please comment.

1596
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Do you have

1597
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
any questions?

1598
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I will ask first.

1599
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Wait a minute.

1600
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The first question is for you.

1601
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You have to estimate the long-term result.

1602
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
There is a way.

1603
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You can show us

1604
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
the data

1605
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
in the lab.

1606
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
If you only use the first few rounds,

1607
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
then you can estimate

1608
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
the long-term result.

1609
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
In this way,

1610
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
people may understand better.

1611
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm not sure

1612
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
how long

1613
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
the gap

1614
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
is.

1615
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
How do you estimate the long-term result?

1616
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Let me explain first.

1617
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I mean

1618
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
what you want to verify.

1619
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If it is a double auction,

1620
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
then

1621
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
why...

1622
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You mean Asians are more polite?

1623
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No, I mean

1624
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
double auctions

1625
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
in different parts of the world

1626
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
are closer to each other.

1627
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
However,

1628
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
there is a big difference

1629
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
between each country.

1630
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That's what I want to say.

1631
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Okay.

1632
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Let me think about it.

1633
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Because...

1634
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
There is a problem here.

1635
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You mean

1636
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
the market is

1637
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
universal,

1638
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and

1639
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
there is no

1640
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
final

1641
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
negotiation.

1642
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
However,

1643
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
there is a problem here.

1644
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
If you don't use

1645
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the strategy method,

1646
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
you can't see the

1647
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
strategy of the

1648
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
mutual fund.

1649
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So,

1650
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
what you see

1651
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
is that

1652
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
in terms of

1653
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
acceptance or not,

1654
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you can only explain

1655
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
the 30% variation.

1656
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
However,

1657
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
in terms of

1658
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
the actual strategy,

1659
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm not sure

1660
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
how far you can go.

1661
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Maybe

1662
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
it's because

1663
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
different countries

1664
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
have already explained

1665
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
most of the proposal.

1666
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So,

1667
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
it means

1668
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
that everyone

1669
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
has proposed

1670
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
social norms

1671
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
based on that culture.

1672
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
So, there is not much difference

1673
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
in terms of acceptance or not.

1674
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Maybe it's because

1675
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
it's not in the proposal.

1676
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
This is also

1677
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
what I want to point out.

1678
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Ok, that's all.

1679
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Can I ask a question?

1680
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Sure.

1681
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Hi.

1682
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
In the Ultimatum game,

1683
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
0 and 100

1684
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
have more than 2.

1685
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I agree with what Meng just said.

1686
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
According to the proposal,

1687
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
the default reaction time

1688
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
might be

1689
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
a factor

1690
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
in the outcome.

1691
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But you said

1692
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
you have an instruction

1693
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
for the experiment,

1694
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
right?

1695
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So, can you tell

1696
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
what is

1697
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
the incentive

1698
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
to give

1699
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
the same result

1700
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
as the proposal?

1701
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Usually,

1702
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
the incentive is

1703
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
how many points you get

1704
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
if you participate in the experiment.

1705
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But I don't know

1706
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
what their design is like.

1707
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Maybe some of them

1708
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
are related to the outcome

1709
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and give you points in proportion.

1710
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Some of them

1711
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
just participate in the experiment and give points.

1712
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
If they participate in the experiment

1713
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and give points,

1714
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
the proposal or the result

1715
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
basically have no effect on them.

1716
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
If you compare the outcome

1717
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
with Ralph's experiment,

1718
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
it's normal to have more than 100 points.

1719
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Because the result

1720
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
is just a result.

1721
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
He didn't think of anything else.

1722
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
As for the fact that

1723
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
there are more than 0 points,

1724
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think

1725
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
it's just a question.

1726
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
In general,

1727
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
people who do the experiment

1728
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
should be

1729
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
from the economics department.

1730
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I don't know if this hypothesis is right.

1731
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But this is what I imagine.

1732
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And then...

1733
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
There is also a postgraduate school.

1734
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Yes, postgraduate school.

1735
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's a class

1736
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
teaching the ultimate game theory.

1737
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It may teach the game theory

1738
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
or something like that.

1739
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The problem here

1740
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
is that

1741
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
some classes

1742
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
teach the ultimate game theory

1743
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
and the theoretical prediction is 0.

1744
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Or

1745
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
they do the experiment

1746
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
before the theoretical prediction.

1747
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
There is a gap.

1748
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because if you do the experiment

1749
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
after the theoretical prediction is given,

1750
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
the default of many people

1751
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
will be 0.

1752
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Let me respond to this.

1753
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
We have seen different classes.

1754
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The smallest class

1755
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
is the game theory class.

1756
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
This is a response.

1757
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
OK.

1758
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Can you see

1759
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
the degree

1760
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
of the class

1761
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
related to the game theory?

1762
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Can you see this?

1763
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yes.

1764
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
We can see it.

1765
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Because we have the name of the class,

1766
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
so we probably know.

1767
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What we can't see is

1768
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
that they teach the theoretical prediction

1769
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
before the game theory.

1770
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
OK.

1771
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
For 0 and 100,

1772
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
there is a big difference

1773
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
between these two classes.

1774
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So I think

1775
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
if you can

1776
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
clear the data,

1777
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
or find the way

1778
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
like just now,

1779
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
then compare with the kink.

1780
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
OK.

1781
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Maybe it will be closer.

1782
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I don't know if this will affect.

1783
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
OK.

1784
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I have notes.

1785
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Thank you.

1786
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Hello.

1787
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
OK.

1788
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
You ask first.

1789
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
OK. Thank you.

1790
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
This is not a problem.

1791
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's more like a comment.

1792
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Since

1793
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
you have the default option

1794
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
bias,

1795
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
it seems to be a serious thing.

1796
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It will make your two curves

1797
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
different from the theoretical one.

1798
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
My idea is

1799
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
can you...

1800
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Will it be too difficult?

1801
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Can you change the program

1802
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and make the starting point

1803
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
different every time?

1804
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
You can choose a starting point

1805
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
to solve the problem.

1806
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Let me respond.

1807
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
This is technically

1808
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
easy to do.

1809
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But there is another problem

1810
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
in economics.

1811
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I'm afraid there will be

1812
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
the result of anchoring.

1813
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So...

1814
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Sorry.

1815
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If your starting point

1816
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
is a very high offer,

1817
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
you may be affected

1818
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
by that point.

1819
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
If your starting point

1820
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
is low,

1821
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
you may be affected by that point.

1822
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So we can't

1823
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
control

1824
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
the most

1825
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
standard time.

1826
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Usually,

1827
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
the way to control

1828
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
is to put $100

1829
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
directly on the desktop.

1830
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Don't put it on both sides.

1831
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Put it one by one.

1832
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
But

1833
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
in their

1834
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
operation,

1835
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
they choose

1836
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
to put it directly at the beginning.

1837
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So there will be a prediction effect.

1838
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But in terms of response time,

1839
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
the prediction effect should be small.

1840
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I have a response.

1841
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Or just change the interface

1842
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
and just fill in the numbers.

1843
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Don't use Labar.

1844
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Of course,

1845
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
this is also possible.

1846
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But you may have to

1847
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
talk to the engineer.

1848
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But this is also possible.

1849
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But we want to change Labar.

1850
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
We want to use Labar mainly

1851
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
to make the picture interesting

1852
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and make consumers want to buy it.

1853
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Make students have fun.

1854
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't know why.

1855
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Everyone thinks Labar is fun.

1856
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I like Labar.

1857
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Yes, but there will be a lot of problems.

1858
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Of course.

1859
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Many people

1860
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
operate with a tablet.

1861
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Yes, that's right.

1862
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I have a question.

1863
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Hello, can you hear me?

1864
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
This question is like this.

1865
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Because you know

1866
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Zhang Anping is studying

1867
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
social psychology.

1868
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
He often plays

1869
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
the game of the game.

1870
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But they like to do one thing.

1871
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That is to manipulate the victim.

1872
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
For example, let you play the game first.

1873
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Then teach you Game Theory.

1874
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Then let you play the game and look at the difference.

1875
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
But what they do more often is

1876
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
let you play the game first.

1877
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Then let you watch Hitler's documentary.

1878
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Then let you play the game and see if there is any difference.

1879
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Have you ever tried to manipulate the victim?

1880
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
This is what we can't do.

1881
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Because you are

1882
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
giving the victim different treatments.

1883
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We can compare the experimental group and the control group.

1884
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But we are basically

1885
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
because we don't have an experimental group and a control group.

1886
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So this is

1887
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
what we can't do.

1888
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
But of course, if we are in the lab,

1889
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
we can do it completely.

1890
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But you can sell the product to the psychology department.

1891
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I'm sure of this.

1892
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
This is

1893
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
So we are now

1894
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
going to hire a psychologist.

1895
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I think it will be an interesting tour.

1896
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Because they are writing.

1897
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And they have to write by themselves.

1898
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
In fact, I think

1899
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
it's ugly to meet.

1900
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That's what you're doing.

1901
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I think there is a marketing potential.

1902
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I should tell the boss about this.

1903
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And science

1904
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
is also interesting.

1905
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I want to tell the boss about this.

1906
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Then Bozun

1907
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
ask again.

1908
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
As long as you can see

1909
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
in each area,

1910
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
you should be able to see which schools use

1911
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I can.

1912
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Then you have

1913
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
the education level or

1914
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
income level

1915
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
proposal or acceptance.

1916
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But we have

1917
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
each school.

1918
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I want to say that the school itself is an income proxy.

1919
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It must be some

1920
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I can.

1921
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I haven't connected yet.

1922
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I haven't connected with the income area.

1923
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You can

1924
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
take a look.

1925
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You now have income data.

1926
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You have similar income or education

1927
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
level data.

1928
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You should be able to find it.

1929
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But don't give me homework, please.

1930
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
If you have any questions,

1931
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
you can write an email to me.

1932
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Or you can find me on Facebook.

1933
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
The small question I just wanted to ask

1934
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
is that you said that

1935
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
ROTH

1936
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
between Proposer and Responder

1937
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
is a hypothesis

1938
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
of ROTH.

1939
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Is this hypothesis

1940
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
from his data observation?

1941
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It is

1942
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
from his data observation.

1943
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
In short,

1944
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
there are only four countries.

1945
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You can't compare the last round of data.

1946
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You are discussing

1947
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
100 data points.

1948
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
He can't do

1949
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
statistical analysis.

1950
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
He can only say what the four distribution

1951
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
look like and

1952
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
what my observation looks like.

1953
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Are there any questions

1954
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
from the audience?

1955
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's time to

1956
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
wrap up.

1957
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Can you stay for a while?

1958
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I want to have a talk with you.

1959
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Sure.

1960
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That's all for today.

1961
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Thank you.

1962
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Thank you.

1963
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Let's give him a big hand.

1964
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'll pause the recording.
