0	7000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.
7000	10000	I am the host for this week, Lin Yu-Wei.
10000	14000	I am very happy to invite our speaker today, Zhou Zhijie.
14000	17000	He obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at NTU,
17000	21000	and is currently a doctor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Lincoln.
21000	24000	Under the guidance of Professor Dai Yu-Chang,
24000	29000	he has been conducting research on wearable devices and biomimics for medical purposes.
29000	34000	Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.
34000	38000	Let's give a round of applause to welcome Zhijie and his speech today.
38000	40000	Remember to turn on the microphone.
45000	50000	Now let's give the microphone to our speaker today, Zhijie.
50000	52000	Thank you, Yu-Wei, for the introduction.
52000	55000	Hello, everyone. I am Zhou Zhijie.
56000	65000	Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.
70000	73000	Without further ado, let's get to the topic.
74000	77000	First of all, I would like to introduce to you
77000	86000	why wearable devices have become a hot topic in recent years.
86000	92000	Basically, it can be divided into several aspects.
92000	97000	The first is the concept of non-invasive.
97000	104000	The concept of non-invasive means that the device does not need to enter our body.
104000	111000	You may have been to the hospital for injections or blood draws.
111000	120000	Once something enters your body, the first reaction is pain.
121000	130000	In addition to the pain, the immune system will also react to foreign bodies.
130000	139000	For example, some white blood cells or other immune cells will attack foreign objects.
139000	148000	Basically, it will cause a lot of inflammation, swelling, pain, and heat.
148000	156000	Therefore, wearable devices basically avoid such risks.
156000	163000	Many technology giants like Apple and Fitbit
163000	170000	want to study non-invasive devices first
170000	174000	and see where their limits can be pushed.
174000	182000	Then they will consider the so-called minimally invasive devices.
182000	189000	In fact, there is a huge barrier between non-invasive and minimally invasive.
189000	195000	Whether it is from the perspective of devices or from the perspective of government agencies like the FDA,
195000	202000	the biggest barrier is still entering the body.
202000	209000	Once you enter the body, there is a lot of risk.
209000	217000	Stay outside the body is a very low-risk device.
217000	223000	Basically, wearable devices have become so popular recently.
223000	228000	Next is the so-called big clinical data.
228000	235000	I believe everyone has heard of big clinical data.
235000	245000	The meaning of big clinical data is that this device can provide some diagnostic information.
245000	248000	This diagnosis is also a bit tricky.
248000	253000	How can we determine the value of the diagnosis?
253000	261000	What metrics are really useful?
261000	269000	The third part is the so-called Autonomous Sensing.
269000	274000	Autonomous Sensing is not as complicated as you think.
274000	280000	Just put the wearable device on your body and it will automatically start to measure.
280000	285000	Then you don't need to intervene.
285000	293000	Then it can continuously send this data out in a wireless way.
293000	298000	The advantage is that even if you are not conscious, for example, when you are sleeping,
298000	303000	this device can still continue to measure and send the data out.
303000	308000	So it can let us see some things that we couldn't see before.
308000	313000	For example, when you are sleeping, it can help you measure the cycle of sleep,
313000	318000	or the heartbeat when you are resting, and so on.
318000	324000	The fourth aspect is that it is very easy to compare with portable devices,
324000	329000	such as mobile phones, smartphones, or even tablets.
329000	335000	Basically, these portable devices can be used as a relay station.
335000	340000	You can imagine that your wearable sensor is a bit like a place to send signals.
340000	345000	Then store these signals in the portable device.
345000	350000	Basically, the computing power of these portable devices is relatively strong,
350000	355000	and the bandwidth to upload data is relatively high.
355000	360000	On the one hand, it can be used as a relay station, and on the other hand,
360000	365000	it can be used as a place to send signals.
365000	370000	There are a lot of benefits that you can think about.
370000	375000	Next, I will talk about the logic of why we want to use wearable devices
375000	380000	to monitor the health of our body.
380000	385000	There is a study in Stanford,
385000	390000	which is called digital health.
390000	395000	It is a comparison of regular visits to the hospital
395000	400000	and digital health.
400000	405000	The so-called digital health is actually
405000	410000	collecting all the data that should be collected at the hospital,
410000	415000	digitizing it,
415000	420000	and then processing these digitized data.
420000	425000	This study is actually very simple.
425000	430000	There are only two main variables.
430000	435000	One is to measure the skin temperature,
435000	440000	and the other is to measure the heart rate.
440000	445000	If I put the sensor on the patient
445000	450000	for a long time,
450000	455000	the patient will inevitably get sick.
455000	460000	The heart rate and skin temperature
460000	465000	when the patient is sick
465000	470000	are basically the same.
470000	475000	The heart rate and skin temperature
475000	480000	are basically the same.
480000	485000	The heart rate and skin temperature
485000	490000	are basically the same.
490000	495000	The heart rate and skin temperature
495000	500000	are basically the same.
500000	505000	The heart rate and skin temperature
505000	510000	are basically the same.
510000	515000	The heart rate and skin temperature
515000	520000	are basically the same.
520000	525000	The heart rate and skin temperature
525000	530000	are basically the same.
530000	535000	The heart rate and skin temperature
535000	540000	are basically the same.
540000	545000	The heart rate and skin temperature
545000	550000	are basically the same.
550000	555000	The heart rate and skin temperature
555000	560000	are basically the same.
560000	565000	The wearable sensor has some information in it.
565000	570000	How do we get this information out?
570000	575000	How do we get this information out?
575000	580000	How do we get this information out?
580000	585000	We have big clinical data.
585000	590000	When do we get this data?
590000	595000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
595000	600000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
600000	605000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
605000	610000	You can get some useful information
610000	615000	such as your body temperature, heart rate, etc.
615000	620000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
620000	625000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
625000	630000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
630000	635000	It's basically 24 hours a day.
635000	640000	Can we tell if a person is healthy or sick?
640000	645000	We can tell from the data from the sensors.
645000	650000	For example, a disease has a certain distribution in the data space of the sensor.
650000	655000	So this is a very interesting question.
655000	660000	So this is a very interesting question.
660000	665000	Before this disease appeared, our data space was completely blank.
665000	670000	Before this disease appeared, our data space was completely blank.
670000	675000	But there are actually some privileges in this sleep stage.
675000	680000	But there are actually some privileges in this sleep stage.
680000	685000	For example, when we sleep, our body does not move.
685000	690000	For example, when we sleep, our body does not move.
690000	695000	Because there is a lack of noise in our daily life.
695000	700000	For example, motion noise.
700000	705000	Or when we do other things during the day, our heartbeat suddenly changes.
705000	710000	But when we sleep, it doesn't change.
710000	715000	At present, some wearable sensors are already measuring heartbeats during rest and sleep.
715000	720000	At present, some wearable sensors are already measuring heartbeats during rest and sleep.
720000	725000	I will show you some data later.
725000	730000	Location.
730000	735000	The main thing is to see where our sensors can be placed in the body.
735000	740000	The main thing is to see where our sensors can be placed in the body.
740000	745000	Research related to motion impedance.
745000	750000	Research related to motion impedance.
750000	760000	Research related to motion impedance.
760000	765000	First look at this picture.
765000	770000	You can see that its range is a bit different.
770000	782000	You can see that the place where wearable devices are often placed, such as a bowl, is actually a good place to put it.
782000	786000	Because it doesn't have too many...
786000	801000	This is a matrix.
801000	810000	It tells us what sensor is most suitable for measuring when placed in a certain place.
810000	819000	For example, the red block is used to measure whole body motion.
819000	824000	Basically, it is used to measure the movement of the whole body.
824000	829000	You can imagine that your limbs, hands and feet are often moving.
829000	836000	But if you want to track the center of the whole body, the red block will be more accurate.
837000	840000	And so on.
840000	850000	For example, the extension of the joint stretch, of course, depends on the elbow and knee joint.
850000	854000	So...
854000	860000	The last one is the place where the sensor is really placed.
860000	866000	This is interesting. You can compare it with the two pictures just now.
867000	875000	For example, many devices are placed at the wrist or ankle.
875000	897000	Next, I will discuss the future prospects of wearable devices.
897000	902000	Basically, it is like this.
903000	915000	From the era of personal computers, the market trend is to try to make the size of the computer smaller and smaller.
915000	923000	From personal computers to knee-shaped devices and wearable devices.
924000	932000	The so-called computing unit is the center of the data, which is closer to the body.
932000	940000	The advantage of doing this is that you don't need too much delay from your sensor to get the data.
940000	943000	You can do the operation directly.
943000	953000	This is the size of the entire market of wearable devices.
953000	963000	This is the size of the entire market of wearable devices.
963000	966000	The size of the entire market of wearable devices is the largest at the beginning.
966000	974000	However, as soon as Apple Watch appeared, it appeared around the middle of 2015.
974000	978000	As soon as it appeared, it immediately ate up the market share.
978000	988000	Then, until recently, 2016 to 2017, you can see that the largest has become Apple Watch.
988000	993000	Then, on the contrary, Feizui started to decline from the highest point.
993000	996000	This is a very interesting phenomenon, and you can think about why.
1006000	1010000	The last is my own imagination.
1010000	1016000	From the beginning of the 2000s, the so-called smartphones began to appear.
1016000	1023000	By 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.
1023000	1032000	It has PPG, which is a method of optical heart rate detection.
1032000	1035000	Motion is basically an accelerometer.
1035000	1038000	It can see the motion of your entire body.
1038000	1043000	ECG is a heart rate map.
1043000	1045000	Blood pressure.
1045000	1049000	Basically, these are some of the information that is easier to get.
1049000	1052000	However, its application is actually limited.
1052000	1061000	In the next ten years, there may be some new wearable devices.
1061000	1070000	For example, FUET, which measures biomarkers in sweat.
1070000	1075000	LP is ocular pressure.
1075000	1080000	CGM is Continuous Glucose Monitoring.
1080000	1088000	Basically, these devices may need to use minimally invasive sensors.
1088000	1092000	However, it still has great advantages.
1092000	1098000	Because it basically gives us some information that the previous wearable sensors cannot provide.
1098000	1104000	Of course, it is more difficult for the government to get FDA approval.
1104000	1107000	Because it is a relatively high-risk device for patients.
1108000	1119000	My prediction is that after 2030, it depends on how the market reacts.
1119000	1122000	Because there is the first and second generation of wearable devices.
1122000	1130000	If the market reacts well, there may be new minimally invasive devices.
1130000	1133000	Then let the market continue to grow.
1133000	1140000	Or like personal computers or smartphones, it will start to saturate.
1140000	1145000	So you can wait and see what the future of wearable devices will look like.
1155000	1159000	Next, let's move on to the next topic.
1159000	1166000	I will introduce the wearable sensors on the market now.
1172000	1174000	First, let's talk about Fitbit.
1174000	1183000	Fitbit is the first company to launch a smartwatch.
1184000	1190000	At first, it only gives you some heart rate information.
1190000	1196000	Heart rate information is based on optical detection.
1196000	1199000	The principle is simple.
1199000	1206000	It uses a green light LED to illuminate the threshold under the skin.
1207000	1215000	When your blood flow changes, it will affect the intensity of the reflected green light.
1215000	1222000	When the green light shines fast enough, for example, this is a 25Hz frequency.
1222000	1227000	The heart rate is about 1 to 2Hz.
1227000	1234000	The 25Hz light can be modulated by the heart rate.
1235000	1240000	You can get heart rate information by processing digital signals.
1245000	1248000	This is the first generation of Fitbit.
1248000	1252000	Recently, they have added some new features.
1252000	1255000	They are interested in sleep tracking.
1255000	1258000	The reason is simple.
1258000	1260000	First, it is easy to measure.
1260000	1262000	Because you don't move much when you sleep.
1262000	1267000	So there is little noise.
1267000	1270000	You can see the picture on the right.
1270000	1283000	Fitbit uses EEG to divide the sleep cycle into 3 to 4 types.
1283000	1285000	The most famous is REM.
1285000	1287000	Rapid Eye Movement.
1287000	1292000	This is the sleep cycle when you are dreaming.
1292000	1298000	There are other types, such as pre-sleep and deep sleep.
1298000	1305000	It can show you the percentage of each sleep cycle.
1305000	1312000	Although it is a sleep cycle, it does not use EEG.
1312000	1322000	It only uses heart rate and acceleration to measure data.
1322000	1331000	You can see that the cycle is fast.
1331000	1336000	Some people complain that there are some false signals.
1342000	1349000	Let's take a look at the EEG.
1349000	1361000	EEG measures the electric field on the head and nose.
1361000	1369000	Different sleep cycles have different brain waves.
1370000	1384000	Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 correspond to the sleep cycle of JELLO and DEEP.
1384000	1391000	Fitbit does not measure EEG.
1391000	1397000	It only uses heart rate and acceleration to measure data.
1397000	1410000	This is the sleep cycle of JELLO and DEEP.
1410000	1415000	Let's take a look at Apple Watch.
1415000	1422000	Apple Watch is a little later than Fitbit.
1422000	1437000	The reason is that it has a lot of functions that are not related to clinical information.
1437000	1445000	Apple likes to make things fancy, so it adds a lot of external functions.
1445000	1454000	In the latest series 4, Apple tried to add ECG.
1454000	1464000	You can see that there is an optical heart rate sensor on the back.
1464000	1467000	This part is the same as Fitbit.
1467000	1472000	But there are two more electrodes.
1472000	1477000	One is the crystal electrode on the back.
1477000	1482000	The other one is the electrode above the circle.
1482000	1494000	When you want to measure ECG, you have to touch the dial with your right finger.
1494000	1499000	This way, you can form a circuit to measure your ECG.
1499000	1506000	But this ECG only has one channel.
1506000	1511000	You can think about it. It measures the electrical field from the left to the right of your heart.
1511000	1517000	But this also requires FDA clearance.
1517000	1523000	Because it claims to be a device that can assist with medical care.
1523000	1528000	Any device that claims to have this needs FDA approval.
1528000	1536000	Once you have this ECG, you can do some irregular rhythm notification.
1536000	1544000	It can see if there are any abnormal frequencies in your ECG waveform.
1545000	1554000	The so-called abnormal frequency is a signal like a heart beat or atrial fibrillation.
1554000	1559000	Once the ECG is detected, it will give you an alarm.
1559000	1579000	The so-called class 2 is not the simplest medical device for FDA.
1579000	1589000	But it's not as invasive as class 3.
1589000	1595000	This device can't be used for diagnosis.
1595000	1599000	This is a point that FDA emphasizes.
1599000	1607000	The last feature is the accelerometer.
1607000	1619000	When you fall, it will tell you if you need to call an ambulance.
1619000	1623000	This is a very fancy feature.
1629000	1634000	The next product I want to introduce is Omron.
1635000	1641000	You may think of it as a blood pressure monitor.
1641000	1645000	Or a stopwatch.
1645000	1649000	What I'm going to talk about today is a blood pressure monitor.
1649000	1654000	The traditional blood pressure monitor has a cuff.
1654000	1656000	You have to tie it to your arm.
1656000	1658000	Then it will start to add pressure.
1659000	1663000	Then it will measure your heart rate.
1663000	1669000	When you can't hear your heart rate, it's a cuff.
1669000	1675000	When you can hear your heart rate again, it's a cuff.
1675000	1679000	Where is this intervention?
1679000	1681000	You can see the watch on the right.
1681000	1683000	It's actually made very small.
1683000	1685000	You can wear it on your wrist.
1685000	1689000	If you press a button, it will stop the process.
1689000	1691000	But it's made on the wrist.
1691000	1697000	The advantage is that you can wear it all day.
1709000	1713000	The advantage is that you can wear it on your wrist.
1713000	1717000	When you want to measure your heart rate, you can press it at any time.
1717000	1721000	But you still need to operate it manually.
1721000	1727000	Ideally, this device will measure your heart rate every fixed time.
1727000	1729000	Even when you sleep.
1729000	1731000	This is what I think is ideal.
1731000	1734000	So there are still some improvements.
1734000	1739000	And it's still under development.
1739000	1742000	So it hasn't been released yet.
1742000	1745000	Because it still needs FDA clearance.
1753000	1757000	Next is the Freestyle company.
1757000	1759000	This is actually a British company.
1759000	1769000	In the United States, I know Metronic and Dexcom are doing blood sugar testing.
1770000	1773000	Why do we need to measure blood sugar?
1773000	1776000	In fact, this device is not for ordinary people.
1776000	1779000	It's actually for diabetes patients.
1779000	1785000	Why do I want to let diabetes patients measure their blood sugar?
1785000	1791000	The reason is that their body can't produce insulin.
1791000	1796000	So they have to inject insulin into their body to control their blood sugar.
1796000	1801000	If their blood sugar is too low, it will be life-threatening.
1801000	1805000	So they want to keep monitoring their blood sugar level.
1805000	1809000	And keep it within the normal range.
1815000	1820000	This device is already very small.
1820000	1825000	Because the needle is only 0.4 mm.
1826000	1830000	It can be regarded as a wearable device.
1830000	1839000	After the needle is inserted into the skin, it can stay on it for about 14 days.
1839000	1840000	Just two weeks.
1840000	1842000	Then you don't have to take it off.
1842000	1844000	It's basically like a patch.
1844000	1846000	It's a bit like a sticker.
1846000	1847000	You just stick it on your body.
1847000	1856000	If you scan the sensor, it will send the glucose reading to your scanner.
1856000	1859000	Then the scanner can pair with your phone.
1859000	1862000	It will send the glucose reading to your phone.
1862000	1877000	The advantage of this device is that if you want to measure blood sugar, you need to poke a hole in your finger.
1877000	1878000	Then squeeze the blood out.
1878000	1880000	You can imagine that the process is very painful.
1880000	1889000	Basically, you just need to poke a hole with this device.
1889000	1894000	You only need to poke it once every two weeks.
1897000	1902000	And the advantage of this device is that you don't have to poke it yourself.
1902000	1904000	This device continues to measure blood sugar.
1904000	1908000	So basically, it can measure blood sugar even when you sleep.
1908000	1918000	OK.
1918000	1923000	The last one is a company called Emotiv.
1923000	1925000	It's actually doing EEG.
1925000	1927000	You can see this in the upper right corner.
1927000	1928000	It's a bit like a headgear.
1928000	1933000	There are actually more than ten electrodes on it.
1933000	1947000	This is basically a device that is not really used for medical diagnosis.
1947000	1951000	It's more like a device that monitors your brain waves.
1952000	1963000	In addition to measuring EEG, it can also measure...
1963000	1969000	For example, if you say a command in your head, it will translate it for you.
1969000	1970000	This is actually pretty cool.
1970000	1975000	It can also detect facial expression changes on your face.
1975000	1982000	This device has a EEG system with Clinical.
1982000	1989000	You can see that this is basically very consistent.
1989000	1994000	Clinical's EEG is actually very expensive.
1994000	1996000	It's about 60k.
1996000	2000000	They developed Emotiv themselves.
2000000	2002000	It's only a few hundred dollars.
2003000	2007000	OK.
2007000	2014000	Let me give you a brief introduction to how EEG came about.
2014000	2021000	Everyone knows that the brain has various cortex.
2022000	2026000	This EEG...
2026000	2028000	You can see these...
2028000	2032000	Have you ever heard of alpha or beta?
2032000	2038000	All kinds of brain waves come from the cortex.
2038000	2045000	It's just that it's not the same as the nervous system.
2045000	2048000	The reason is that this is not the real action potential.
2049000	2057000	It's actually a change in hyperpolarization and depolarization.
2057000	2060000	This cycle is actually very long.
2060000	2062000	You can see that there's a scale at the bottom.
2062000	2064000	This is one second.
2064000	2071000	The action potential is usually only a few dozen milliseconds.
2071000	2074000	So this is not the action potential.
2074000	2079000	This is actually a change in hyperpolarization.
2079000	2083000	After this is produced in the cell,
2083000	2086000	it actually has a local field potential.
2086000	2090000	It's measured near the cell to the junction point.
2090000	2098000	Then this junction point goes all the way through the medium between the cells.
2098000	2102000	Then it's passed on to the cortex.
2102000	2103000	Then it's passed on to the cortex.
2103000	2106000	Then it's passed on to the cortex.
2106000	2115000	So you can see that the cortex is actually just a depolarization of the nerve.
2119000	2124000	Of course, the EEG hasn't been declared to be able to measure while sleeping.
2124000	2129000	So I don't know what happens if it really wears this device when it's sleeping.
2129000	2131000	I think it should be quite interesting.
2135000	2139000	Okay, let's move on to the third part.
2141000	2148000	The third part is mainly some relatively new technologies.
2148000	2151000	There are mainly...
2153000	2156000	The first one is continuous blood pressure monitoring.
2156000	2162000	As I just said, it still needs you to measure it yourself.
2162000	2166000	So its measurement speed can't be that fast.
2166000	2172000	Continuous blood pressure is a new device.
2172000	2180000	It uses the ultrasound to track the blood pressure in the blood vessel.
2180000	2185000	This is the normal distribution range of blood pressure in general.
2185000	2200000	This is the basic structure of the device.
2200000	2212000	The main signal source is the piezoelectric material.
2212000	2216000	It's sealed in epoxy.
2216000	2221000	Then some electrodes are applied to the surface.
2221000	2226000	At the same time, the piezoelectric material is actually in two directions.
2226000	2229000	One is when you give it electricity, it will generate a current.
2229000	2232000	The other is when you have a current, it will generate a signal of electricity.
2232000	2234000	So it's actually in both directions.
2235000	2244000	The principle is that you give a pulse at the beginning.
2244000	2251000	So the piezoelectric material will generate a pulse.
2251000	2255000	Then it presses the blood vessel.
2255000	2260000	So it will see how the blood vessel is changing with the blood pressure.
2261000	2268000	According to the time-of-flight, it can reverse the environment of the blood vessel.
2268000	2273000	Then this signal can be reversed into blood pressure.
2273000	2280000	The two positions are in the pulmonary artery.
2280000	2283000	So it's just a little patch on top of it.
2283000	2289000	There are some sensor arrays in this patch.
2289000	2295000	Maybe there are a few sensor arrays on top of the blood vessel.
2295000	2297000	It can measure the blood pressure.
2309000	2312000	The next one is actually quite interesting.
2313000	2319000	This is actually a device that can measure sweat.
2319000	2322000	So why are we interested in sweat?
2327000	2333000	The reason is that a lot of metabolism will come out with sweat.
2333000	2340000	Such as glucose and lactate.
2340000	2343000	They all show up in the sweat.
2343000	2352000	And their concentration is quite similar to the concentration in the blood.
2352000	2359000	So sweat can be thought of as a substitute for blood.
2359000	2365000	Then you don't really need to put a needle into your blood vessel.
2365000	2368000	So it has the advantage of non-invasive.
2369000	2375000	Then it can measure the concentration of electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium.
2375000	2398000	I'm curious about the time difference between glucose and lactate in sweat and in blood.
2398000	2403000	I would say about ten minutes.
2405000	2408000	They actually did a similar research.
2408000	2419000	Look at the concentration of glucose in your blood.
2419000	2426000	Then you will see that if there is a spike in the blood, there will be a delay in the spike in the sweat.
2426000	2428000	That delay is usually about ten minutes.
2429000	2435000	So it's a delay, but the timing resolution is higher.
2435000	2438000	So even if it's a very short spike, you can still see it.
2438000	2440000	It's just a delay, right?
2440000	2447000	If it's a very short spike, it's not very certain.
2447000	2452000	Because the spike I'm talking about is usually like a step.
2452000	2457000	For example, after you eat, your blood sugar will suddenly rise and then slowly fall.
2457000	2460000	So it's actually not a really short spike.
2460000	2463000	It's actually a step up and then slowly decay.
2477000	2482000	This device is actually made like a wristband.
2483000	2493000	Its principle is basically to detect your target with a variety of different coating electrodes.
2493000	2500000	Like glucose and lactate, it uses enzymes to detect.
2500000	2508000	It basically puts the enzyme on the permeable film.
2508000	2513000	Then let it react with the target.
2513000	2518000	After the target is reacted, the enzyme dissolves the target and releases the electron.
2518000	2522000	Then the electron is picked up as a voltage signal.
2522000	2529000	The other part is the concentration of sodium and potassium.
2530000	2533000	It uses ion-selective electrodes.
2533000	2539000	It uses a variety of coatings on the surface.
2539000	2547000	This improves the professionalism of the ion.
2547000	2552000	So there won't be any interference problems.
2552000	2555000	It's the same as converting it into an electrode.
2556000	2565000	Finally, it's sent to a wireless ECB and sends the signal to the mobile phone.
2570000	2574000	This is what it actually measured when it was running.
2574000	2581000	You can see that there are five different data.
2581000	2594000	The temperature on the skin, lactate, sodium, potassium, and potassium.
2594000	2599000	It also has a collaboration with the device.
2599000	2602000	This collaboration is very good.
2602000	2606000	Because it matches the commercial device.
2607000	2615000	The only bad thing about this device is that it needs to let this person sweat.
2615000	2620000	Basically, you can see that there is a period of time after the exercise.
2620000	2624000	Then he started to sweat to get this reading.
2636000	2643000	The last one is the pressure in the eye.
2643000	2647000	It's actually measured...
2651000	2653000	It's different for each eye.
2658000	2661000	Jump to the structure of the eye.
2663000	2665000	This is the structure of the human eye.
2665000	2670000	Basically, the pressure we're talking about is the small part in front of the eye.
2670000	2673000	It's called aqueous humor.
2675000	2677000	In Chinese, it's called aqueous liquid.
2677000	2684000	Basically, it's the space between your mucous membrane and the crystal.
2684000	2687000	There's actually a little bit of aqueous liquid in it.
2687000	2690000	It's only a few microliters.
2690000	2696000	In fact, these microliters determine the balance of pressure in your eyes.
2696000	2700000	Because the vitreous body in the back is a glass body.
2700000	2702000	Basically, the volume won't change.
2702000	2710000	So if the pressure in the front increases, it will start to compress the mucous membrane and blood vessels in the back.
2710000	2712000	That's why it's called this disease.
2712000	2714000	This disease is called glaucoma.
2721000	2722000	OK.
2735000	2742000	So we want to monitor this 24-hour eye pressure change.
2742000	2744000	Can you imagine the same thing?
2744000	2746000	It's actually hard to sleep.
2746000	2748000	And there's an interesting phenomenon.
2748000	2752000	In fact, when you sleep, your eye pressure is the highest.
2752000	2758000	So, in fact, ophthalmologists are very interested in eye pressure changes when they sleep.
2758000	2766000	So we started to think about whether or not we could put a wearable device on your eyes and measure the eye pressure change.
2766000	2774000	Someone suggested that you could actually use this wearable glasses as your platform to measure eye pressure changes.
2776000	2781000	This is actually a new company's idea.
2781000	2786000	It actually uses existing wearable glasses materials.
2786000	2796000	Then they added a strain gauge to measure the change in the curvature of the mucous membrane.
2796000	2800000	They claim that this can be connected to intraocular pressure.
2800000	2803000	In fact, FDA has also approved this device.
2803000	2808000	It can actually be placed on the glasses and continue to measure 24 hours.
2808000	2814000	OK.
2814000	2824000	Then the main target is still these patients with light eyes or patients who are about to get light eyes.
2824000	2830000	As you can see, the structure of this device is very simple.
2830000	2835000	There is a coil.
2835000	2845000	It is actually used to receive power and send information back to the microcontroller.
2845000	2850000	There is also a small microcontroller here.
2850000	2860000	But its function is just to help modulate the signal and measure the strain gauge itself.
2861000	2865000	As you can see, this device does not have a battery.
2865000	2871000	It actually needs a larger coil outside the glasses to provide this power.
2871000	2876000	This power is also a receiver coil.
2876000	2881000	It can digitize the signal and send it to the recorder.
2881000	2886000	I personally don't really appreciate this.
2887000	2891000	Because it feels a little strange.
2891000	2896000	You can actually make it like a blindfold device.
2896000	2898000	You don't have to make it so complicated.
2898000	2904000	And this wire is not very convenient when you sleep.
2904000	2906000	Then back to Glocoma.
2906000	2907000	This is what I just talked about.
2907000	2910000	When you sleep, the eye pressure is actually higher.
2910000	2915000	The black one in the middle is actually the eye pressure when you sleep.
2916000	2924000	Generally, the standard eye pressure for Glocoma is 21 mmHg.
2924000	2927000	It's about this line.
2927000	2930000	21 is here.
2930000	2935000	The upper line is actually the real Glocoma patient's eye pressure.
2935000	2944000	The bottom line is normal.
2944000	2958000	In fact, there is a big difference between standing up and squatting.
2958000	2966000	Because when you stand up, there is a pressure difference caused by the height.
2966000	2971000	It even has something to do with standing or lying down.
2971000	2974000	So when you lie down, your posture changes.
2974000	2977000	Basically, the eye pressure will be a little higher.
2977000	2979000	Compare with when you stand up.
2979000	2985000	They maintain the same posture.
2985000	2988000	If you stand up, it will be colder during the day.
3001000	3008000	The last new technology is the battery technology.
3008000	3012000	I just talked about so many wearable devices.
3012000	3020000	If they put batteries in, they will basically use lithium-ion batteries.
3020000	3023000	The reason is that its energy density is the highest.
3023000	3030000	Of course, this is also why smartphones and laptops use lithium-ion batteries.
3031000	3033000	You can see this picture.
3033000	3038000	This is the current structure of the mainstream lithium-ion battery.
3038000	3045000	It has two levels, one level and a separator in the middle.
3045000	3050000	What's the bad thing about this?
3050000	3053000	It's very fragile.
3053000	3061000	The reason is that when the lithium-ion battery is charged, it will heat up easily.
3061000	3070000	Once it reaches a certain temperature, it will start to affect the electrolyte inside.
3070000	3075000	After the electrolyte breaks down, it releases gas.
3075000	3081000	The gas is more serious because it causes internal pressure to increase.
3081000	3089000	After the internal pressure increases, the structure of the separator is destroyed.
3089000	3095000	Once the structure is damaged, the battery is like a short-circuit.
3095000	3099000	A short-circuit is a positive feedback.
3099000	3102000	It will cause more heat to be released.
3102000	3104000	The whole thing will break down.
3104000	3116000	If you insert a nail into the lithium-ion battery, it will start to ignite and explode.
3116000	3125000	We don't want this scenario to happen to wearable devices.
3125000	3127000	It's basically wearing on your body.
3128000	3136000	If there is a problem with the battery, it will be a big problem.
3136000	3142000	Recently, someone proposed a new design.
3142000	3148000	It uses the same structure as the solar panel.
3148000	3151000	The structure is on the right.
3152000	3158000	It uses a 3D structure.
3158000	3168000	Basically, the structure of the battery is changed to a solid-state silicon.
3168000	3176000	So there is no weak and easy-to-puncture problem.
3176000	3182000	The traditional lithium-ion battery has a very fragile structure.
3182000	3184000	It's easy to break through.
3184000	3192000	But if you change it to a solid-state substrate, it's not easy to be affected by external forces.
3192000	3201000	On the other hand, you can use the photolithography method to pattern the structure of the two-stage and one-stage.
3201000	3205000	It can increase the density a lot.
3205000	3210000	On the one hand, it is safer.
3210000	3215000	On the other hand, the density of its unit has also been increased.
3215000	3221000	In the future, it is very likely to see this new lithium-ion battery being used on wearable devices.
3221000	3244000	In the last part, we will discuss the problems that wearable devices may encounter in addition to this technology.
3244000	3249000	The first one is privacy.
3249000	3258000	When a sensor starts to collect very personal data,
3258000	3260000	and there is a lot of data,
3260000	3263000	there will be a question mark.
3263000	3266000	What kind of people can access this data?
3266000	3270000	What kind of people can't access it?
3271000	3282000	You may have heard of Google Glass before.
3282000	3296000	The reason why it was scared was because it was collecting data.
3297000	3302000	If the camera is not approved by other people,
3302000	3305000	it will randomly shoot everywhere.
3305000	3309000	It violates other people's privacy.
3309000	3312000	The same goes for wearable devices.
3312000	3317000	It collects personal data all the time.
3317000	3320000	If it is not approved,
3320000	3323000	for example, you wear a wearable device today,
3323000	3325000	and the watch is lost.
3325000	3329000	Can other people easily access your data?
3329000	3332000	This is a privacy issue.
3332000	3345000	The following table is a survey on wearable devices.
3346000	3357000	On the left, you can see how people react to wearable devices.
3357000	3359000	Most people are very happy.
3359000	3361000	There is a new toy to play with.
3361000	3366000	But when it comes to trust,
3366000	3371000	people start to have questions.
3371000	3378000	The most trusted people are doctors, hospitals,
3378000	3380000	or health insurance.
3380000	3383000	These people are more trustworthy.
3383000	3387000	The following categories are cell phone providers,
3387000	3389000	entertainment providers, etc.
3389000	3392000	People's trust suddenly dropped.
3392000	3394000	This is also a trend.
3394000	3397000	If you want to collect data,
3397000	3407000	it is recommended to start from hospitals or doctors' offices.
3407000	3415000	Traditionally, people are more confident in health care providers.
3415000	3418000	They know they won't use these data.
3427000	3432000	The second discussion is about business.
3432000	3435000	This is an interesting issue.
3435000	3441000	Everyone sees that wearable devices have a good market.
3441000	3449000	But it is difficult to enter this market.
3449000	3459000	The reason is that it requires a lot of investment.
3459000	3463000	First, if you want to use wearable devices for diagnosis,
3463000	3466000	you need to get FDA approval.
3466000	3470000	Basically, whether it is class 2 or class 3,
3471000	3477000	you need to invest in research and development,
3477000	3481000	or even apply for a patent.
3481000	3484000	Then you can get FDA approval.
3484000	3491000	But consumers care a lot about the price of wearable devices.
3491000	3492000	You can see the following.
3492000	3498000	Whether it is fitness band, smart glasses, smart watch, or smart clothing.
3498000	3501000	The first thing everyone cares about is the price.
3501000	3505000	The second is that you may not use it.
3507000	3509000	Then there are others.
3509000	3515000	The first is that the cost of investment is high,
3515000	3518000	but you can't lower the price.
3529000	3536000	The last one is the difficulties that wearable devices may face.
3538000	3542000	There are five points.
3544000	3552000	The first is that consumers don't know why they need to use wearable devices.
3552000	3557000	What can wearable devices do?
3558000	3560000	As mentioned earlier,
3563000	3567000	for example, sleep tracking.
3567000	3572000	Even if I know that my sleep is divided into these weeks,
3572000	3577000	what are the possible applications?
3577000	3581000	For example, can it assist me in diagnosing what diseases I may have?
3582000	3586000	Or when I go to see a doctor,
3586000	3591000	can it give the doctor some judgment criteria?
3593000	3598000	The second is that wearable devices are easy to lose.
3598000	3604000	This is the same problem as mobile phones or other portable devices.
3604000	3607000	And it's quite troublesome to lose it.
3607000	3614000	Currently, wearable devices do not have ID settings.
3614000	3618000	Basically, it's wearable.
3618000	3622000	It won't be linked to your account.
3625000	3629000	The third is that
3630000	3638000	is it attractive or comfortable to wear?
3638000	3644000	This is a question worth thinking about.
3644000	3651000	When we don't know what function this device can do,
3651000	3656000	there is no reason to want to wear it.
3656000	3659000	For example,
3659000	3661000	if you don't wear glasses,
3661000	3665000	you may not want to wear glasses.
3665000	3671000	Wearing glasses only provides you with some minimal benefits.
3675000	3679000	The fourth is battery life.
3679000	3685000	Currently, most wearable devices only last 7 to 10 days.
3685000	3690000	Some people may complain that they can't last longer.
3692000	3696000	The fifth is about syncing.
3696000	3705000	Can it pair well with your smartphone?
3709000	3712000	This is a technical problem.
3712000	3714000	It's easy to solve.
3714000	3722000	But if you want to design a new wearable device,
3722000	3724000	you need to read.
3733000	3736000	This is the last video.
3736000	3744000	If you have any questions or experiences with wearable devices,
3744000	3747000	please feel free to ask.
3747000	3749000	If you have any questions,
3749000	3751000	please feel free to ask.
3751000	3753000	Thank you.
3756000	3759000	Thank you, Zijie.
3759000	3763000	Let's give him a round of applause.
3764000	3767000	Please turn on your microphones.
3769000	3772000	Let's open the Q&A session.
3772000	3776000	Do you have any questions?
3781000	3784000	I have a question.
3784000	3786000	Can you hear me?
3786000	3788000	Yes, I can hear you.
3789000	3793000	Let's say 10 or 15 years later,
3793000	3797000	everyone wears a certain wearable device.
3797000	3804000	Your data will be uploaded to a data center for 24 hours.
3804000	3809000	The manager of the data center is basically a group of MDs.
3809000	3813000	They can see the data and know where the person's body may have problems.
3813000	3818000	In other words, this system can replace the current GP.
3818000	3820000	After the initial diagnosis,
3820000	3824000	the GP may be suffering from a skin disease.
3824000	3827000	The GP will be transferred to the relevant department.
3827000	3832000	In other words, this whole system will become the first line of defense of the medical system.
3832000	3834000	Imagine this society.
3834000	3836000	If this society really exists,
3836000	3838000	what do you think is the technical problem?
3839000	3843000	I can imagine other problems in society or politics.
3843000	3846000	But what do you think is the technical problem?
3852000	3855000	Now there is a fundamental question.
3855000	3858000	How far can this wearable device go?
3861000	3866000	If you don't want an invasive action,
3866000	3868000	it's actually very limited.
3870000	3875000	So I think the first technical problem is
3875000	3881000	how to measure all the data you need in a minimally invasive situation.
3881000	3885000	Then your data can distinguish between different diseases.
3886000	3888000	I think this is the first problem.
3889000	3890000	And it's a must-solve problem.
3890000	3895000	If you want to get into the ideal scenario,
3896000	3897000	you have to be able to do it.
3900000	3901000	Hello, I have a question.
3901000	3902000	Can you hear me?
3902000	3903000	Yes.
3903000	3905000	Hello, I would like to ask.
3905000	3910000	You just said that there are some minimally invasive devices.
3910000	3912000	I do cancer research.
3912000	3918000	I know that some of the current scientific cancer fields
3918000	3922000	are already targeting some cancer prevention methods.
3922000	3931000	For example, there are some so-called tumor DNA in the blood of cancer patients.
3931000	3935000	I wonder if this technology has been applied
3935000	3939000	or is already being developed on this wearable device.
3939000	3942000	How will it develop in the future?
3942000	3944000	OK, thank you, William.
3944000	3945000	Basically, yes.
3945000	3947000	Someone is already doing this.
3949000	3950000	I didn't mention it just now.
3950000	3953000	In fact, many people are doing so-called lab-on-a-chip.
3953000	3956000	Basically, using a single chip,
3956000	3963000	you can do what a whole lab can do.
3963000	3966000	For tumor cells, yes.
3966000	3969000	But because it needs to use a protocol.
3969000	3971000	Basically, it's still a protocol.
3971000	3973000	Because it basically looks at the circulating tumor cells.
3973000	3977000	So it needs to first design a filter
3977000	3979000	to filter out these tumor cells.
3980000	3981000	After filtering out,
3981000	3987000	it will look at which tumor cells belong to which cancer.
3987000	3991000	For example, doing DNA sequencing and so on.
3991000	3996000	If you want to turn it into a wearable device,
3996000	4002000	you still have to solve the invasive problem first.
4002000	4004000	Because if you want to take a blood sample,
4004000	4008000	the trouble with blood is that it is easy to coagulate.
4008000	4010000	Coagulation occurs.
4010000	4016000	So how do you get it from your bloodstream
4016000	4018000	to the cancer cell?
4018000	4021000	At the same time, it doesn't coagulate.
4021000	4024000	This is actually a problem that needs to be solved.
4024000	4027000	But if you can get this blood sample,
4027000	4029000	it's technically feasible.
4031000	4034000	So now in this wearable device,
4034000	4037000	there is no way to make this breakthrough, right?
4038000	4042000	If you don't want human intervention,
4042000	4044000	I don't think it's there yet.
4044000	4047000	But if you can do it like a blood sugar machine,
4047000	4049000	you poke a hole and squeeze the blood out,
4049000	4052000	and then drop it on the lab arm chip,
4052000	4054000	it can actually be done.
4054000	4056000	So the difference is whether it can be automated.
4056000	4058000	So the difficulty now is that
4058000	4060000	the coagulation situation you just mentioned,
4060000	4062000	that is, in a long-term surveillance,
4062000	4064000	instead of a single-point,
4064000	4066000	time-point time to detect.
4066000	4068000	That's it.
4068000	4070000	Thank you.
4076000	4078000	Hi.
4078000	4081000	I'm from the Taiwan University Student Association.
4081000	4084000	Thank you for your wonderful speech.
4084000	4087000	I'm the president of this year.
4087000	4089000	I'm also from the Electrical Engineering Institute.
4089000	4092000	But I'm studying electrical waves now.
4092000	4094000	And then in this regard,
4094000	4096000	maybe it's related to you.
4096000	4099000	Maybe it's like Energy Harvesting.
4099000	4103000	And then I'm doing the topic now.
4103000	4104000	It's UCLA.
4104000	4109000	They're developing how to make the antenna satellite.
4109000	4111000	It's possible to do the level of micrometer.
4111000	4114000	It should also be related to wearable.
4114000	4116000	But I'm pretty curious.
4116000	4120000	Like in the topic you're studying,
4120000	4123000	now it's more of an application.
4123000	4126000	What are the more common
4126000	4129000	or specific hardware bottlenecks?
4129000	4132000	For example, the most common is of course the battery.
4132000	4135000	Or is there anything that is still difficult to overcome?
4135000	4140000	Or is it just that you need to find a better application?
4140000	4141000	Thank you.
4141000	4143000	OK, thank you for your question.
4143000	4145000	Yes, you just mentioned the battery.
4145000	4148000	It's already a big concern.
4148000	4150000	In terms of hardware.
4150000	4152000	The reason is because, think about it.
4152000	4160000	If you want to put a battery inside the body,
4160000	4165000	the size has a big limit.
4165000	4168000	Because the bigger the size,
4168000	4171000	the stronger the immune response.
4171000	4174000	Of course, we want to make the battery smaller and better.
4174000	4175000	Even without the battery.
4175000	4179000	Just use the wireless power transfer to provide energy.
4179000	4183000	So the battery is a concern.
4183000	4185000	In fact, everyone has been thinking about
4185000	4190000	how to give the power to the device.
4190000	4196000	Either by inductive coupling.
4196000	4199000	Or even using ultrasound.
4199000	4203000	In fact, I have been doing this kind of wireless power transfer project before.
4203000	4208000	Then I studied how to use ultrasound to provide this energy.
4208000	4210000	So everyone is also brainstorming
4210000	4213000	how to make this power better.
4213000	4216000	Because you don't want the battery to get into the body.
4216000	4220000	There is also a biocompatibility.
4220000	4226000	So basically all the batteries you need to use in the implant.
4226000	4228000	Like your pacemaker battery.
4228000	4230000	It also needs special design.
4230000	4233000	It must be placed in a good enclosure.
4233000	4238000	It must ensure that the electrolyte will not leak out.
4238000	4240000	And it won't short-circuit.
4240000	4243000	Because FDA has a lot of concerns about this.
4243000	4247000	Then you just talked about hardware.
4247000	4248000	There is another question.
4248000	4250000	Because you are doing antenna related.
4250000	4253000	So I would like to talk about communication.
4254000	4260000	How to get the signal out with the minimum energy per bit.
4260000	4262000	This is also a problem.
4262000	4264000	Because your body.
4264000	4266000	For example, if you use gigahertz.
4266000	4270000	It actually has a lot of energy damping.
4270000	4275000	It is actually wasted in your interstitial space.
4275000	4277000	Because your tissue is also for power supply.
4277000	4279000	And in the gigahertz range.
4280000	4283000	Whether it's water or ion.
4283000	4286000	It actually absorbs a lot of energy.
4286000	4288000	So if you want to use wireless.
4288000	4290000	If you send this data out.
4290000	4295000	It will waste a lot of energy.
4295000	4298000	So how to use this.
4298000	4302000	Maybe you want to find a frequency band.
4302000	4304000	Optimize your energy.
4304000	4307000	This is also a research question.
4307000	4309000	Then, of course, other things.
4309000	4310000	Like this sensor design.
4310000	4313000	Because now we can use the sensor on the left.
4313000	4315000	In fact, it is also limited.
4315000	4318000	Then how to improve this sensor design.
4318000	4321000	Then make it energy efficient.
4321000	4323000	Or this.
4323000	4326000	The smaller the bone factor.
4326000	4327000	So basically.
4327000	4330000	Let this patient.
4330000	4333000	When you put these devices in your body.
4333000	4334000	You almost don't feel pain.
4334000	4336000	This is also a direction.
4336000	4338000	So yeah.
4338000	4341000	These three aspects are actually Howard.
4341000	4344000	Especially in our lab that does this kind of device.
4344000	4347000	In fact, I have been working hard.
4347000	4350000	Hello, I have a more naive question.
4350000	4353000	But you just talked about the battery.
4353000	4354000	Then I thought at the beginning.
4354000	4356000	Hey, since the battery has its limitation.
4356000	4359000	Then why don't you use something like solar cells?
4359000	4360000	In this way.
4360000	4363000	To work hard in this direction.
4364000	4366000	You talk about solar cells.
4366000	4370000	Does it mean that you harvest energy from the environment?
4370000	4371000	Correct.
4371000	4372000	OK.
4372000	4374000	Yes.
4374000	4376000	Someone is also doing this direction.
4376000	4379000	But basically.
4379000	4381000	The current problem.
4381000	4382000	Because everyone.
4382000	4385000	May say.
4385000	4388000	If you want to harvest energy from the environment.
4388000	4390000	Where is your source?
4390000	4392000	The first one is probably.
4392000	4394000	Temperature.
4394000	4396000	But your body temperature is only 37 degrees.
4396000	4398000	So with you.
4398000	4400000	The room temperature is 25 degrees.
4400000	4402000	There is only a dozen degrees difference in the middle.
4402000	4404000	So this temperature may not be enough.
4404000	4406000	You use it to generate electricity.
4406000	4409000	Then the second one may be.
4409000	4411000	Is the motion produced by the body itself.
4411000	4413000	But there is a problem here.
4413000	4414000	The first one you are.
4414000	4417000	To make sure this motion is.
4417000	4420000	Is.
4420000	4422000	It has been happening.
4422000	4423000	Not like this.
4423000	4425000	For example, your muscles move.
4425000	4426000	Then it's gone.
4426000	4428000	You may want to.
4428000	4430000	For example, heartbeats.
4430000	4432000	Or breathing.
4432000	4435000	This kind of motion that has been happening all the time.
4435000	4437000	Then use this motion to generate electricity.
4437000	4438000	Someone is doing this.
4438000	4440000	Then the third type.
4440000	4444000	Is from chemical chemistry.
4444000	4447000	For example, glucose.
4447000	4450000	Someone is studying how to use glucose to generate electricity.
4450000	4453000	But this is still in the research stage.
4453000	4456000	There is no real commercial device.
4456000	4458000	The reason is that.
4458000	4461000	Its conversion efficiency is still too low.
4461000	4463000	There is no way to provide this.
4463000	4466000	The lowest power needed by the sensor.
4466000	4468000	So most of it is still.
4468000	4471000	It's all about providing power to the outside world.
4471000	4474000	What about solar energy?
4474000	4476000	Solar energy.
4476000	4479000	The first problem you encounter is the problem of light.
4479000	4482000	Because once the light enters the tissue.
4482000	4484000	For example, the skin.
4484000	4485000	It begins to diffuse.
4485000	4488000	After the diffusion, you can really penetrate the depth.
4488000	4490000	Only a few millimeters.
4490000	4493000	So after a few millimeters.
4493000	4495000	Basically, you can't see the light.
4495000	4497000	So there is no way to use solar energy.
4497000	4500000	Unless you put it directly on the surface of the body.
4500000	4502000	There is still a possibility.
4518000	4520000	Hello.
4520000	4522000	Hello.
4522000	4524000	I am currently doing.
4524000	4526000	Biological research.
4526000	4528000	Then I am also studying.
4529000	4532000	I want to ask some questions about animals.
4532000	4534000	For example.
4534000	4536000	Now these devices are being developed.
4536000	4538000	Although I don't think so.
4538000	4540000	But still at some stage.
4540000	4542000	Because of safety factors.
4542000	4544000	Like traditional experiments.
4544000	4546000	Do you use experimental animals?
4546000	4548000	Or say.
4548000	4550000	These devices are for.
4550000	4552000	Because we know that animal experiments.
4552000	4554000	It is also necessary, for example, to draw blood every day.
4554000	4556000	Or measure blood pressure every day.
4556000	4558000	Or look at some of their physical changes.
4558000	4560000	Does anyone already use these devices?
4560000	4562000	Do some applications for animal experiments.
4562000	4564000	Thank you.
4568000	4570000	In fact, there is.
4570000	4572000	Basically, we.
4572000	4574000	These sensors.
4574000	4576000	Especially implant.
4576000	4578000	Is the device that is really placed in the human body.
4578000	4580000	Basically, all have to go through animal experiments first.
4580000	4582000	So actually animal experiments.
4582000	4584000	It is also a very good platform.
4584000	4586000	Can these sensors really work?
4586000	4588000	OK.
4588000	4590000	Like I have a colleague.
4590000	4592000	He is doing this.
4592000	4594000	I just talked about intraocular pressure.
4594000	4596000	This is the device for measuring eye pressure.
4596000	4598000	He basically puts it in first.
4598000	4600000	For example, to study in the eyes of rabbits.
4600000	4602000	Then look at his sensor.
4602000	4604000	Is it a good response?
4604000	4606000	Because basically.
4606000	4608000	The advantage of animal experiments is.
4608000	4610000	It's easy.
4610000	4612000	So.
4612000	4614000	Generally, if you are really doing implants.
4614000	4616000	Will use animal experiments first.
4616000	4618000	Then you just talked about.
4618000	4620000	Is there a device?
4620000	4622000	Really used to measure animal.
4622000	4624000	That.
4624000	4626000	For example, blood pressure or the like.
4626000	4628000	In fact, there is really a company doing this.
4628000	4630000	Is specifically for animal experiments.
4630000	4632000	Then.
4632000	4634000	It basically provides a.
4634000	4636000	A whole set of complete wireless.
4636000	4638000	This measuring system.
4638000	4640000	For example, blood pressure.
4640000	4642000	Then.
4642000	4644000	I forgot the other parameters.
4644000	4646000	But it can measure a lot of.
4646000	4648000	Basically very similar to people.
4648000	4650000	It basically can measure.
4650000	4652000	Because the lab often uses mice.
4652000	4654000	So it can measure the mouse's blood pressure.
4654000	4656000	Then, for example, heartbeats and the like.
4656000	4658000	Then it can put this.
4658000	4660000	Integrated into a platform.
4660000	4662000	Then give the lab people a reference.
4662000	4664000	So what you say is actually done.
4664000	4666000	OK, thank you.
4666000	4668000	Hello.
4668000	4670000	Hello, I am Red Stone.
4670000	4672000	Now at the University of Michigan.
4672000	4674000	As a postdoc.
4674000	4676000	Then I have a.
4676000	4678000	I have two questions.
4678000	4680000	The first one is that I heard before.
4680000	4682000	Is to use Fitbit.
4682000	4684000	These products.
4684000	4686000	They usually use it for a year or two.
4686000	4688000	Will be broken.
4688000	4690000	I want to know.
4690000	4692000	These are the devices.
4692000	4694000	Is the problem solved?
4694000	4696000	I didn't mention these questions.
4698000	4700000	OK.
4700000	4702000	Durability.
4702000	4704000	If the problem is.
4704000	4706000	In fact, I have been using Fitbit myself.
4706000	4708000	Its durability.
4708000	4710000	In fact, the main thing is.
4710000	4712000	Mechanical durability.
4712000	4714000	Its sensor itself is not broken.
4714000	4716000	But he.
4716000	4718000	For example, his wristband.
4718000	4720000	With this sensor.
4720000	4722000	The junction of the wristband.
4722000	4724000	There is actually a problem with the connection.
4724000	4726000	For example, you often go to this.
4726000	4728000	Exercise.
4728000	4730000	Then stretch it.
4730000	4732000	It is easy to produce mechanical fatigue.
4732000	4734000	Then the place where the fatigue is easy to break off.
4734000	4736000	OK, but this.
4736000	4738000	It has nothing to do with its sensor itself.
4738000	4740000	Because the sensor itself uses this optical method.
4740000	4742000	So unless you go on purpose.
4742000	4744000	To break it down.
4744000	4746000	Otherwise, it is actually very difficult to break down.
4746000	4748000	OK, so in fact.
4748000	4750000	This problem has already been solved.
4750000	4752000	So basically.
4752000	4754000	In fact, you just solve it.
4754000	4756000	Mechanical strength is OK.
4756000	4758000	So this is actually with the sensor.
4758000	4760000	It is not related to the problem itself.
4760000	4762000	It's just that it's designed.
4762000	4764000	I don't think so much.
4764000	4766000	OK, then the second question is.
4766000	4768000	About that EEG.
4768000	4770000	I want to know that.
4770000	4772000	When you use this.
4772000	4774000	EEG device.
4774000	4776000	You have to wear it on your head.
4776000	4778000	That is the helmet.
4778000	4780000	But you still have hair.
4780000	4782000	Those EEG.
4782000	4784000	Can't directly touch your scalp.
4784000	4786000	Then these.
4786000	4788000	In this case, those EEG.
4788000	4790000	Can still work?
4790000	4792000	Oh, yes, that's a good question.
4792000	4794000	They actually have a special design.
4794000	4796000	For this EEG.
4796000	4798000	It's not like what you think.
4798000	4800000	It's just a flat EEG.
4800000	4802000	It's actually a bit like an octopus's foot.
4802000	4804000	It has this.
4804000	4806000	For example, a few.
4806000	4808000	This helmet.
4808000	4810000	It's actually a bit like.
4810000	4812000	Add a little pressure.
4812000	4814000	On that EEG.
4814000	4816000	It can actually.
4816000	4818000	Go through your hair.
4818000	4820000	Then directly touch your scalp.
4820000	4822000	That EEG.
4822000	4824000	It's actually a special design.
4824000	4826000	Yes, thank you.
4826000	4828000	Hello.
4832000	4834000	Hello.
4834000	4836000	I would like to ask a question.
4836000	4838000	Related to materials.
4838000	4840000	Because these wearable devices.
4840000	4842000	Relative to the skin.
4842000	4844000	Or any part of the body.
4844000	4846000	So their.
4846000	4848000	Capability is relatively better.
4848000	4850000	I can imagine.
4850000	4852000	Consider some mechanical properties.
4852000	4854000	If you consider these properties.
4854000	4856000	Biocompatible.
4856000	4858000	Bioresorption.
4858000	4860000	So it will be weaker.
4860000	4862000	Based on these.
4862000	4864000	Material selection.
4864000	4866000	What kind of material do you use most often?
4866000	4868000	Or is there any.
4868000	4870000	Already commercial.
4870000	4872000	Or is it special.
4872000	4874000	To synthesize these.
4874000	4876000	Polymer or organic.
4876000	4878000	To be able to do these things.
4878000	4880000	This is also a good question.
4880000	4882000	Basically.
4882000	4884000	Currently.
4884000	4886000	Whether in this.
4886000	4888000	The medical world.
4888000	4890000	Or this.
4890000	4892000	Medical equipment.
4892000	4894000	Everyone uses this most often.
4894000	4896000	PDMS.
4896000	4898000	That is.
4898000	4900000	This.
4900000	4902000	This.
4902000	4904000	Silicone.
4904000	4906000	It's a bit like silicone.
4906000	4908000	Its advantage is because.
4908000	4910000	First of all, its material is very soft.
4910000	4912000	Second.
4912000	4914000	Its extensibility is very good.
4914000	4916000	You can pull it.
4916000	4918000	For example, more than 200%.
4918000	4920000	It still won't break.
4920000	4922000	Flexibility is also very good.
4922000	4924000	It can confirm.
4924000	4926000	Confirm to your skin surface.
4926000	4928000	Then it is.
4928000	4930000	Water and air.
4930000	4932000	It actually has this inside.
4932000	4934000	Porosity.
4934000	4936000	It has this nanostructure inside.
4936000	4938000	Porosity.
4938000	4940000	These small molecules.
4940000	4942000	Structure passed.
4942000	4944000	So basically.
4944000	4946000	Everyone's first choice is to use PDMS.
4946000	4948000	Then.
4948000	4950000	If you don't want to.
4950000	4952000	Let these.
4952000	4954000	For example, water vapor.
4954000	4956000	Or something else.
4956000	4958000	We will be outside PDMS.
4958000	4960000	Outside.
4960000	4962000	Coat a thin layer.
4962000	4964000	Polymer to protect it.
4964000	4966000	Like our lab.
4966000	4968000	A kind of.
4968000	4970000	Polymer material.
4970000	4972000	It can.
4972000	4974000	By chemical.
4974000	4976000	Then directly.
4976000	4978000	On top of PDMS.
4978000	4980000	It's a bit like.
4980000	4982000	Two-layer structure.
4982000	4984000	It's just that the outer layer is very thin.
4984000	4986000	It won't affect.
4986000	4988000	Overall mechanical property.
4988000	4990000	Then.
4990000	4992000	And this material.
4992000	4994000	It's actually a biochemical.
4994000	4996000	Then.
4996000	4998000	It's basically.
4998000	5000000	It's a bit different from PDMS.
5000000	5002000	Because it doesn't have this inside.
5002000	5004000	Nanoporous.
5004000	5006000	So it.
5006000	5008000	So it won't let this.
5008000	5010000	Water vapor to pass.
5010000	5012000	So if you want.
5012000	5014000	If it's a barrier.
5014000	5016000	In fact, you can add this outside.
5016000	5018000	Polymer.
5018000	5020000	Then you can ask.
5020000	5022000	What kind of standard.
5022000	5024000	Biofluid barrier.
5024000	5026000	Because we know these.
5026000	5028000	Protocols or biological.
5028000	5030000	It may be an electrolyte.
5030000	5032000	If it's on both sides of EEG or ECG.
5032000	5034000	These will not form noise.
5034000	5036000	Or other concerns.
5036000	5038000	OK.
5040000	5042000	Basically.
5042000	5044000	Of course, it depends on you.
5044000	5046000	What about the process of adding this material?
5046000	5048000	Like PDMS, it's almost.
5048000	5050000	If there is no process.
5050000	5052000	Just a few microns.
5052000	5054000	Just a few micrometers.
5054000	5056000	It basically won't have any.
5056000	5058000	This transparency.
5058000	5060000	So basically.
5060000	5062000	That's our criteria.
5062000	5064000	Of course, he started.
5064000	5066000	When commercialized.
5066000	5068000	At first.
5068000	5070000	It's actually used to protect the circuit board.
5070000	5072000	Is to protect the circuit board.
5072000	5074000	Not corroded by this water vapor.
5074000	5076000	So.
5076000	5078000	Their initial criteria.
5078000	5080000	It's about 10 or 20 microns.
5080000	5082000	Then we.
5082000	5084000	If you take it.
5084000	5086000	If you do this, it's probably the same thickness.
5086000	5088000	So it won't be much different.
5088000	5090000	OK.
5090000	5092000	Thank you.
5096000	5098000	I would like to continue the last question.
5098000	5100000	That is, why would you choose Perlin?
5100000	5102000	Don't choose PolyMNL.
5102000	5104000	Oh.
5104000	5106000	Actually.
5106000	5108000	There are a few reasons.
5108000	5110000	That is.
5110000	5112000	The first one is.
5112000	5114000	The two of them.
5116000	5118000	The physical nature is a bit different.
5118000	5120000	The first one.
5120000	5122000	PolyMNL is.
5122000	5124000	It's a bit like.
5124000	5126000	Semi-transparent material.
5126000	5128000	Then Perlin is completely transparent.
5128000	5130000	So if you want.
5130000	5132000	For example, optical.
5132000	5134000	If you want to use an optical device.
5134000	5136000	Perlin is a better choice.
5136000	5138000	Then the second one is.
5138000	5140000	PolyMNL.
5142000	5144000	That is.
5144000	5146000	Glass transition temperature.
5146000	5148000	Higher.
5148000	5150000	So basically you heat it up.
5150000	5152000	For example, 200 or 300 degrees.
5152000	5154000	It still won't deform.
5154000	5156000	Then Perlin.
5156000	5158000	It's when you heat it up.
5158000	5160000	200.
5160000	5162000	Around 200 degrees.
5162000	5164000	It's kind of like a semi-melted state.
5164000	5166000	So it's easier to shape.
5166000	5168000	If you need to shape.
5168000	5170000	Because.
5170000	5172000	Generally speaking, when we do Perlin.
5172000	5174000	There are usually two layers of Perlin.
5174000	5176000	So how do you put these two layers of Perlin.
5176000	5178000	Just put it together.
5178000	5180000	I usually use this.
5180000	5182000	Is the heating method.
5182000	5184000	To put it together.
5184000	5186000	PolyMNL.
5186000	5188000	I don't know if it is.
5188000	5190000	Easier than Perlin.
5190000	5192000	So generally.
5192000	5194000	We usually choose to use Perlin.
5194000	5196000	When the temperature is relatively low.
5196000	5198000	Yes.
5198000	5200000	So these are two.
5200000	5202000	More different places.
5202000	5204000	Of course.
5204000	5206000	Some people use PolyMNL.
5206000	5208000	His life.
5208000	5210000	It won't be as long as Perlin.
5210000	5212000	Some people in our lab.
5212000	5214000	Is the same.
5214000	5216000	Circuit.
5216000	5218000	The same circuit.
5218000	5220000	One is using PolyMNL.
5220000	5222000	The other is using Perlin.
5222000	5224000	He found that PolyMNL.
5224000	5226000	It can only last about a month.
5226000	5228000	And then the top ones.
5228000	5230000	Layout is starting to melt.
5230000	5232000	Is to be dissolved.
5232000	5234000	Then but.
5234000	5236000	Perlin.
5236000	5238000	Because it has a very poor water permeability.
5238000	5240000	So basically the water is not easy to pass through.
5240000	5242000	If there is no water.
5242000	5244000	Basically your ion can't work.
5244000	5246000	So his device.
5246000	5248000	Yes.
5248000	5250000	Thank you.
5264000	5266000	Do you have any other questions?
5272000	5274000	If not.
5274000	5276000	Then our speech is here.
5276000	5278000	Then I will turn off the recording first.
