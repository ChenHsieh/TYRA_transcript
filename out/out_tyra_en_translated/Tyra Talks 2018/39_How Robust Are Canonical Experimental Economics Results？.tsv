0	10000	I'm very happy to have you all here today for Lin Bo-xuan's talk.
10000	14000	Let me first introduce our speaker, Lin Bo-xuan.
14000	20000	She studied economics at NTU, and is now a sophomore at NTU Economics.
20000	29000	Currently, she is an intern at a startup company called ModLab in Pasadena, California.
29000	35000	Her main topic is game-related data analysis.
35000	39000	Today, we are very happy to invite Lin Bo-xuan to give a talk
39000	43000	about how to use class experiment data to test the stability of the final window match
43000	46000	and the results of the double-sided auction experiment.
46000	50000	Let's welcome Lin Bo-xuan to start her talk.
50000	52000	Thank you, Director Lin.
52000	55000	Without further ado, I'll get started.
55000	57000	Today's topic is very simple.
57000	59000	I'll just ask one question.
59000	65000	Are the results of the economic experiment we see on paper stable?
65000	68000	To be honest, in the field of economic experiments,
68000	70000	people are the ones doing the research.
70000	73000	So, if you want to say that a result is stable,
73000	75000	you can't just say,
75000	78000	if I were in Taiwan, I'd do this result.
78000	80000	Or, if I were in a victim group, I'd do that.
80000	84000	Often, we need to do a lot of different victim groups.
84000	87000	If we were to say that this result is right for all humans,
87000	90000	then it should be right to take the same result
90000	93000	and do the same experiment in every place.
93000	96000	But in fact, we often know that
96000	98000	this situation is often not necessarily right.
98000	102000	For example, let's say we measure the risk.
102000	104000	In Taiwan alone,
104000	106000	if you only measure the risk for men or women,
106000	108000	the set of risks may be different.
108000	111000	So, in fact, if we want to measure stability,
111000	113000	that is, if we want to do the same experiment
113000	116000	in many places, the result is wrong.
116000	118000	But often,
118000	120000	what we want to do
120000	123000	is actually very difficult in the experiment.
123000	125000	First, because economists know
125000	127000	that our research funds are limited.
127000	129000	Second, our time is limited.
129000	131000	So, often, it's hard for us to think about
131000	133000	whether we can do the same experiment
133000	134000	in every corner of the world.
134000	136000	So, this is a very difficult thing.
136000	138000	Because, mainly, there is a big limitation in economic experiments.
138000	141000	In fact, we hope to provide real benefits to consumers.
141000	143000	Because of this,
143000	146000	we need a lot of money and a lot of time.
146000	148000	We need to have a good enough time design.
148000	151000	Basically, it will be impossible to measure in every place in the world.
151000	153000	So, because of this,
153000	155000	we did not give up
155000	157000	to test whether our experiment results are stable or not.
157000	159000	So, there are two main ways
159000	161000	to do this on our website.
161000	163000	First,
163000	165000	for example,
165000	167000	in the case of Ultraman Game,
167000	169000	in fact, in the past 50 years,
169000	171000	there have been a lot of studies on the series of Ultraman Game.
171000	173000	So, basically,
173000	175000	there is a method
175000	177000	that we take the previous experimental data
177000	179000	and break it into a very large database
179000	181000	to do some meta-analysis here.
181000	183000	Just like what Usterbeck did in 2004.
183000	185000	But, like this,
185000	187000	there is a problem.
187000	189000	In fact, many times,
189000	191000	all the previous studies of Ultraman Game
191000	193000	are the same game,
193000	195000	but their context is a bit different.
195000	197000	So, in practice,
197000	199000	many times, your usage is different,
199000	201000	or your context is different,
201000	203000	which may affect the result of the experiment.
203000	205000	So, when we use this method,
205000	207000	we have already lost the control
207000	209000	of our experimental design.
209000	211000	Although this method
211000	213000	can make our database very rich.
213000	215000	The other way is that
215000	217000	we control the same experimental design,
217000	219000	but go to other places
219000	221000	to do the same experiment.
221000	223000	Just like Roth,
223000	225000	he has been to four countries in the world.
225000	227000	One is the United States,
227000	229000	one is Slovenia,
229000	231000	one is Israel,
231000	233000	and the other is Japan.
233000	235000	He went to these four countries
235000	237000	to do the same final analysis
237000	239000	and market game
239000	241000	to see if the results of these four countries
241000	243000	were stable or not.
243000	245000	This is the largest experiment
245000	247000	so far.
247000	249000	But, from this point of view,
249000	251000	even so,
251000	253000	we can only do it in a small number of places.
253000	255000	So, in this way,
255000	257000	although you can
257000	259000	control your experimental design,
259000	261000	but you can't make
261000	263000	your database very large.
263000	265000	So, today,
265000	267000	what we are doing is
267000	269000	using the third method.
269000	271000	It's like
271000	273000	you want to test the stability
273000	275000	of a result of an experiment.
275000	277000	There are three things to do.
277000	279000	One is the real sound,
279000	281000	and the third is to have a large enough sample.
281000	283000	The first two methods
283000	285000	are to give up
285000	287000	and control the experimental design.
287000	289000	The other is to give up a large enough database.
289000	291000	But what we are going to do today
291000	293000	is to have a large enough database,
293000	295000	and the design
295000	297000	is exactly the same.
297000	299000	But what we give up today is to give up
299000	301000	and control the sound.
301000	303000	In this case,
303000	305000	I can only say that we are the first article
305000	307000	to do this.
307000	309000	We have a lot of data.
309000	311000	But when we give up
311000	313000	and control the sound,
313000	315000	our experiment
315000	317000	will be done in a very
317000	319000	no-easy situation.
319000	321000	So, if we can
321000	323000	reproduce
323000	325000	all the experimental results
325000	327000	in the lab,
327000	329000	it means that the experimental results
329000	331000	are very stable.
331000	333000	As I said,
333000	335000	what we are going to use today
335000	337000	is MobLab.
337000	339000	MobLab is an experimental platform
339000	341000	for all class economics experiments.
341000	343000	If we take all the data from the class,
343000	345000	it is actually good and bad.
345000	347000	Of course, the two biggest concerns are
347000	349000	that all the students in the class
349000	351000	do not use money
351000	353000	to provide their sound.
353000	355000	Most of the time, they just use
355000	357000	the grade of the course
357000	359000	or other random numbers
359000	361000	to provide their sound.
361000	363000	This is what we have lost control of.
363000	365000	The two biggest concerns are
365000	367000	that many students in class
367000	369000	may not necessarily be
369000	371000	the representative sample
371000	373000	of the culture.
373000	375000	However, there are still
375000	377000	a lot of benefits
377000	379000	for us to try this method.
379000	381000	First of all,
381000	383000	there is no publication bias
383000	385000	in our database.
385000	387000	For example,
387000	389000	if you take the results
389000	391000	of the previous article
391000	393000	as a meta-analysis,
393000	395000	you may get too good results.
395000	397000	This is called publication bias.
397000	399000	However,
399000	401000	all the results, good or bad,
401000	403000	are recorded in our database.
403000	405000	Another thing is that
405000	407000	our company is
407000	409000	at least in the class of
409000	411000	experimental economics.
411000	413000	If you want to do a class experiment
413000	415000	in the world,
415000	417000	you basically use our company.
417000	419000	In fact, our sample is very diverse.
419000	421000	There are many different areas.
421000	423000	This gives us a lot of
423000	425000	variation to test.
425000	427000	Thirdly,
427000	429000	the environment in which our data is generated
429000	431000	is exactly the same.
431000	433000	The interface, language,
433000	435000	and the entire experiment process
435000	437000	are exactly the same.
437000	439000	This means that we have
439000	441000	completely controlled
441000	443000	the process of their game.
443000	445000	These are the three advantages
445000	447000	that we think
447000	449000	are very important.
449000	451000	Before talking about these two areas,
451000	453000	I would like to talk about
453000	455000	how big our dataset is.
455000	457000	First of all,
457000	459000	we can see that
459000	461000	this table is a total of
461000	463000	10 areas in our dataset.
463000	465000	You can see that
465000	467000	this data is across North America,
467000	469000	Europe, and Asia.
469000	471000	In Ultraman Game,
471000	473000	we have more than
473000	475000	15,000 sample points.
475000	477000	For those of you who do not know
477000	479000	the economics of time,
479000	481000	the data in Ultraman Game
481000	483000	is about 10 times more than
483000	485000	a normal article,
485000	487000	or 0 to 2.0.
487000	489000	In DoubleAction,
489000	491000	there are basically 2.0 more.
491000	493000	This is a very large sample
493000	495000	that we can test.
495000	497000	Next,
497000	499000	I will talk about these two areas.
499000	501000	These two areas are actually very simple.
501000	503000	The first is Ultraman Game.
503000	505000	In addition,
505000	507000	why do we choose these two areas?
507000	509000	The first is because these two areas
509000	511000	are the most abundant in our database.
511000	513000	The second is that these two areas
513000	515000	are basically the origin of
515000	517000	the economics of time.
517000	519000	In Ultraman Game,
519000	521000	there are two people in this game.
521000	523000	One is Proposer,
523000	525000	the other is Responder.
525000	527000	Proposer can decide
527000	529000	how much to give to the other party.
529000	531000	This game is very simple.
531000	533000	There is a ball in the middle.
533000	535000	You can decide how much to give to the other party.
535000	537000	You can pull the ball
537000	539000	and decide how much to give to the other party.
539000	541000	If you decide,
541000	543000	you can press Submit.
543000	545000	In this way, the other party can see
545000	547000	how much you gave to the other party.
547000	549000	Next,
549000	551000	suppose I decide to give the other party $45.
551000	553000	In this way,
553000	555000	the other party can see
555000	557000	that this is
557000	559000	a Proposer you have provided.
559000	561000	Proposer can decide
561000	563000	how much to give to the other party.
563000	565000	If you decide to give $45,
565000	567000	the other party can see
567000	569000	how much to give to the other party.
569000	571000	If you decide to give $45,
571000	573000	the other party can see
573000	575000	how much to give to the other party.
575000	577000	This is a very simple game.
577000	579000	It is like a simple negotiation
579000	581000	in a simulation game.
581000	583000	For example,
583000	585000	when you go to a night market
585000	587000	to buy vegetables,
587000	589000	don't pull the ball.
589000	591000	It is like a simulation game.
593000	595000	This is the game interface
595000	597000	of the Ultraman Game.
597000	599000	Next, I will talk about
599000	601000	double-sided auction.
601000	603000	The most classic example
603000	605000	of a double-sided auction
605000	607000	is like Wall Street.
607000	609000	They are selling stocks.
609000	611000	You may often see some pictures
611000	613000	or news photos
613000	615000	that there are many machines
615000	617000	and many traders
617000	619000	raising their hands and shouting.
619000	621000	This means that
621000	623000	everyone is shouting
623000	625000	how much to give to this person
625000	627000	and how much to give to that person.
627000	629000	Double-sided auction is like
629000	631000	Ultraman Game.
631000	633000	Ultraman Game has only one side
633000	635000	and you are given a Proposer.
635000	637000	In Double-sided auction,
637000	639000	no matter which side,
639000	641000	the buyer or seller
641000	643000	can shout at the same time.
643000	645000	One is the buyer, the other is the seller.
645000	647000	If you are the buyer,
647000	649000	you want to buy something.
649000	651000	We are buying oranges.
651000	653000	In this game interface,
653000	655000	the first thing you can see is
655000	657000	how much satisfaction you will get
657000	659000	when you buy an orange.
659000	661000	Next, you want to bid.
661000	663000	You can pull a slider bar.
663000	665000	You can move left and right
665000	667000	to decide how much you want to bid
667000	669000	to bid for this orange.
669000	671000	If you buy an orange,
671000	673000	the benefit is
673000	675000	the value deducted
675000	677000	and how much you spent to buy it.
677000	679000	If you are buying,
679000	681000	there are two ways to buy.
681000	683000	One is to bid here.
683000	685000	The other is
685000	687000	if there are many buyers
687000	689000	and they are already bidding
689000	691000	so you can also buy
691000	693000	at the lowest price.
693000	695000	The next one is
695000	697000	the seller.
697000	699000	The seller actually has the same
699000	701000	interface as the buyer.
701000	703000	If you sell an orange,
703000	705000	you have the cost
705000	707000	so you can see the cost here.
709000	711000	Next,
711000	713000	you can pull a slider bar
713000	715000	to decide how much you want to bid.
715000	717000	You can ask the price here.
717000	719000	Or you can decide
719000	721000	to sell the highest price here.
721000	723000	So I can sell it here.
723000	725000	Please note that
725000	727000	there is a special design
727000	729000	here.
729000	731000	When you decide to
731000	733000	ask the price here,
733000	735000	if the price is
735000	737000	negative,
737000	739000	I will change it to red
739000	741000	to warn you
741000	743000	that
743000	745000	this transaction
745000	747000	may result in a negative price.
747000	749000	So this is the double option
749000	751000	game interface.
751000	753000	Let me introduce
753000	755000	the game settings here.
755000	757000	This is because
757000	759000	in such a simple game interface,
759000	761000	many teachers
761000	763000	can adjust the game parameters
763000	765000	by themselves.
765000	767000	But in most cases,
767000	769000	many teachers use the pre-set options.
769000	771000	In Ultimatum Game,
771000	773000	the pre-set price is $100.
773000	775000	In the case of double option,
775000	777000	the pre-set market is
777000	779000	5 buyers
779000	781000	and each buyer
781000	783000	can buy 3 items.
783000	785000	In other words,
785000	787000	there are a total of 15 items in the market.
787000	789000	If we draw the value here,
789000	791000	the black line
791000	793000	is the demand curve.
793000	795000	The gray line
795000	797000	is the supply curve.
797000	799000	Before I start,
799000	801000	I want to talk about
801000	803000	the theoretical prediction
803000	805000	of these two games.
805000	807000	In Ultimatum Game,
807000	809000	the theoretical prediction is very simple.
809000	811000	If we look at it
811000	813000	from the perspective of the respondent,
813000	815000	the balance of a game
815000	817000	is basically
817000	819000	that if I do this option,
819000	821000	the reward is higher than the other option,
821000	823000	I should do this.
823000	825000	So if you look at the responder,
825000	827000	no matter what positive reward he sees,
827000	829000	I should accept it.
829000	831000	If I take $1, it's better than $0.
831000	833000	If I take $2, it's better than $0.
833000	835000	So in this case,
835000	837000	if I get a positive reward,
837000	839000	I should accept it.
839000	841000	If I get a negative reward,
841000	843000	I should accept it.
843000	845000	If I get a positive reward,
845000	847000	I should accept it.
847000	849000	This is the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Game.
849000	851000	However, in the past 50 years of research,
851000	853000	we all know that
853000	855000	this theory is basically written to be overturned.
855000	857000	Because a lot of times
857000	859000	when we do research,
859000	861000	we will find that
861000	863000	basically all the recipients
863000	865000	will not only give the other party $1,
865000	867000	because a lot of times you will be very unhappy.
867000	869000	This is Ultimatum Game.
869000	871000	In Double Option,
871000	873000	this is like the high school science textbook,
873000	875000	you will see Supply and Demand Curve.
875000	877000	If you want to solve this game, it's actually very simple.
877000	879000	You have to find a price
879000	881000	to clear all the markets.
881000	883000	So if you are here,
883000	885000	this gray curve is our
885000	887000	theoretical prediction price,
887000	889000	which is just the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.
889000	891000	If this price
891000	893000	is higher,
893000	895000	if it is higher than the balance price,
895000	897000	it means that
897000	899000	there are more sellers who want to sell things at this time,
899000	901000	and fewer sellers want to sell.
901000	903000	So if the supply and demand are uneven at this time,
903000	905000	this force will force the price down.
905000	907000	But if the price is lower,
907000	909000	then there are more people who want to sell,
909000	911000	and fewer people want to sell.
911000	913000	So this force will push the price back.
913000	915000	This is also the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.
915000	917000	This is our balance price.
917000	919000	Then in our predicted market,
919000	921000	the number of balances is 13,
921000	923000	and the price of the balance is $112.
923000	925000	So this is our game setting.
927000	929000	I want to stop here for a while.
929000	931000	Is everyone OK?
931000	933000	If there is no problem,
933000	935000	I will continue to talk about the results.
937000	939000	Wait a minute,
939000	941000	let me confirm first.
941000	943000	So here
943000	945000	the buyer's demand price
945000	947000	is $150.
947000	949000	The forecast is $150, $145,
949000	951000	$140, and so on.
951000	953000	Then it is reduced to $130.
955000	957000	So $150
957000	959000	and then $130.
959000	961000	What is the last one?
961000	963000	The last one is
963000	965000	$120 and $117.
967000	969000	Then the other side is from $50
969000	971000	and then continue to add $50.
975000	977000	Then I will continue.
977000	979000	First of all,
979000	981000	let's talk about
981000	983000	the overall result.
983000	985000	First of all, I want to show you
985000	987000	this table.
987000	989000	To summarize,
989000	991000	we mainly looked at the five outcome variables.
991000	993000	What are their numerical statistics?
993000	995000	First of all, in the Ultimation Game,
995000	997000	we mainly looked at two outcome variables.
997000	999000	One is how many proposals you give to the other party.
999000	1001000	The other is how much your acceptance rate is.
1001000	1003000	First of all, we see the first one.
1003000	1005000	In the case of $100,
1005000	1007000	on average,
1007000	1009000	you will give the other party about $36.
1009000	1011000	This number is actually
1011000	1013000	very close to the result of our experiment.
1013000	1015000	For example, if we take
1015000	1017000	Rock's article in 1991 as a benchmark,
1017000	1019000	the average of the article
1019000	1021000	is 40.
1021000	1023000	So our difference is only 4%.
1023000	1025000	So I think it's a very close result.
1025000	1027000	Then the second one we looked at
1027000	1029000	is the acceptance rate.
1029000	1031000	What we are looking at now is unconditional.
1031000	1033000	If we look at
1033000	1035000	the unconditional acceptance rate,
1035000	1037000	the acceptance rate is 66%.
1037000	1039000	Rock's result is about 73%.
1039000	1041000	So the difference is only 6% or 7%.
1041000	1043000	But because our offer
1043000	1045000	is relatively low,
1045000	1047000	I think our result
1047000	1049000	is able to reproduce
1049000	1051000	Rock's result on the aggregate level.
1051000	1053000	Hello, I have a question.
1053000	1055000	You just said
1055000	1057000	he made 40 and then 36.
1057000	1059000	Or let's just say
1059000	1061000	how much is the experimental
1061000	1063000	and how much is the theoretical expectation.
1063000	1065000	I think it's very close.
1065000	1067000	I want to ask
1067000	1069000	what do you think?
1069000	1071000	Because you didn't show
1071000	1073000	your uncertainty range.
1073000	1075000	Maybe it's actually a very stable difference,
1075000	1077000	so it's not very close.
1077000	1079000	This is
1079000	1081000	what I will continue to talk about later.
1081000	1083000	Because I'm going to show you a statistic now.
1083000	1085000	I'll show you an approximate
1085000	1087000	numerical statistic.
1087000	1089000	But actually you're right.
1089000	1091000	If I have to do it,
1091000	1093000	I have to look at whether there is a significant difference.
1093000	1095000	But actually
1095000	1097000	the first one is
1097000	1099000	this is one point.
1099000	1101000	If I want to do an assessment,
1101000	1103000	there is another problem.
1103000	1105000	Our sample number is very unbalanced.
1105000	1107000	Very unbalanced.
1107000	1109000	So it means that our sample number
1109000	1111000	is about more than 10,000 points,
1111000	1113000	and their sample number is only more than 1,000 points.
1113000	1115000	So in fact, when you do an assessment,
1115000	1117000	sometimes there are some
1117000	1119000	bad points.
1119000	1121000	You need to pay attention.
1121000	1123000	But in fact,
1123000	1125000	at least in the case of showing data now,
1125000	1127000	I can only say it out loud.
1127000	1129000	I can only say it out loud now.
1129000	1131000	It depends on whether it's close or not.
1131000	1133000	Next,
1133000	1135000	the other three are
1135000	1137000	the results of the double option.
1137000	1139000	For the double option, I'm going to use three indexes
1139000	1141000	to talk about whether this market
1141000	1143000	has been able to
1143000	1145000	refine
1145000	1147000	the prediction of the theory.
1147000	1149000	The first three indexes we look at
1149000	1151000	are the average error.
1151000	1153000	The definition of the average error is actually below.
1153000	1155000	DQ is the price of
1155000	1157000	each unit
1157000	1159000	of each contract.
1159000	1161000	Subtract it.
1161000	1163000	This means
1163000	1165000	how much is the difference
1165000	1167000	from our theoretical prediction.
1167000	1169000	Next, I look at the average.
1169000	1171000	Because we often have
1171000	1173000	about 800 different market configurations.
1173000	1175000	So in order to make everyone
1175000	1177000	comparable, I use
1177000	1179000	the average price to standardize it.
1179000	1181000	So we can actually use this index
1181000	1183000	to see how much is our accuracy.
1183000	1185000	The next one is
1185000	1187000	our
1187000	1189000	Smith Alpha.
1189000	1191000	Smith is to commemorate
1191000	1193000	Brown-Smith, so that's why it's called this name.
1193000	1195000	Next, this index
1195000	1197000	is actually very simple.
1197000	1199000	It's the distance between
1199000	1201000	my price and
1201000	1203000	my theoretical prediction price.
1203000	1205000	So I take the square here.
1205000	1207000	Then I take another one.
1207000	1209000	Next, I look at the average distance.
1209000	1211000	Then I open a number.
1211000	1213000	So it's actually very similar to
1213000	1215000	my standard error.
1215000	1217000	But what I'm doing today is not average.
1217000	1219000	What I'm doing today is
1219000	1221000	theoretical prediction.
1221000	1223000	Next, I still use
1223000	1225000	my average price to standardize it.
1225000	1227000	So I can use this index
1227000	1229000	to measure the fluctuation of price.
1229000	1231000	The next
1231000	1233000	and the third index is Efficiency.
1233000	1235000	For Efficiency, I want to use
1235000	1237000	the above graph to explain.
1237000	1239000	So in this
1239000	1241000	market balance,
1241000	1243000	if this seller
1243000	1245000	makes a deal with this buyer,
1245000	1247000	then in the middle,
1247000	1249000	the upper part
1249000	1251000	is the
1251000	1253000	profit I make.
1253000	1255000	It's the buyer's profit.
1255000	1257000	The lower part is the seller's profit.
1257000	1259000	So that means
1259000	1261000	the total length of this segment
1261000	1263000	is the
1263000	1265000	profit I can make
1265000	1267000	from this deal.
1267000	1269000	So I take the
1269000	1271000	supply curve and demand curve
1271000	1273000	and divide it by the area.
1273000	1275000	So in theory,
1275000	1277000	how much surplus
1277000	1279000	can I get?
1279000	1281000	So the efficiency
1281000	1283000	definition is
1283000	1285000	the efficiency I achieve
1285000	1287000	in this market
1287000	1289000	and the efficiency
1289000	1291000	I expect in theory.
1291000	1293000	How much can I get?
1293000	1295000	So what I can see here is
1295000	1297000	first,
1297000	1299000	my average error is about 6%.
1299000	1301000	That means my average price
1301000	1303000	is about 6% higher than the theory.
1303000	1305000	Next,
1305000	1307000	my Smith Alpha,
1307000	1309000	my price fluctuation
1309000	1311000	is about 30%.
1311000	1313000	Next, my efficiency
1313000	1315000	is about 84%.
1315000	1317000	So in theory,
1317000	1319000	these numbers
1319000	1321000	are significantly different.
1321000	1323000	However,
1323000	1325000	this is related to another problem.
1325000	1327000	In our lab,
1327000	1329000	we usually let our customers
1329000	1331000	play the same game for 10 or 20 rounds.
1331000	1333000	At this time,
1333000	1335000	after more than 10 rounds,
1335000	1337000	the price will become very stable.
1337000	1339000	But here,
1339000	1341000	if we play 10 rounds,
1341000	1343000	the customer might have already
1343000	1345000	played 2 or 3 rounds.
1345000	1347000	This is why the price here is unstable.
1347000	1349000	But later on,
1349000	1351000	I will try to show
1351000	1353000	if
1353000	1355000	our students can play
1355000	1357000	enough rounds,
1357000	1359000	where will they end up?
1359000	1361000	This is the result of the double option.
1361000	1363000	I will show it.
1363000	1365000	Let's continue to look at
1365000	1367000	the whole distribution.
1367000	1369000	Sorry to interrupt you.
1369000	1371000	This has nothing to do with your speech.
1371000	1373000	I don't know if you have noticed
1373000	1375000	the Chrome dialogue next to you.
1375000	1377000	I don't know which computer
1377000	1379000	you are using.
1381000	1383000	I don't know what to do.
1385000	1387000	Thank you for reminding me.
1387000	1389000	I hope you don't interrupt me.
1389000	1391000	I don't want to leave the group.
1391000	1393000	Thank you.
1393000	1395000	Let's continue.
1395000	1397000	First, let's look at
1397000	1399000	the whole distribution of Proposal Offer.
1399000	1401000	Because
1401000	1403000	in our game design,
1403000	1405000	the teacher can decide
1405000	1407000	whether to play 1 round, 2 rounds,
1407000	1409000	or how many rounds.
1409000	1411000	If you play more than 2 rounds,
1411000	1413000	it will become a repeated game.
1413000	1415000	If we divide the data
1415000	1417000	into repeated and repeated games,
1417000	1419000	we can see
1419000	1421000	that
1421000	1423000	the first point
1423000	1425000	is
1425000	1427000	the theoretical expectation.
1427000	1429000	This is the theoretical expectation.
1429000	1431000	This is the theoretical prediction.
1431000	1433000	So here,
1433000	1435000	whether it's 1 shot game or repeated game,
1435000	1437000	only about 10% of the audience
1437000	1439000	play on the theoretical prediction.
1439000	1441000	Then we have 50%
1441000	1443000	of the audience
1443000	1445000	play on the theoretical prediction.
1445000	1447000	Next,
1447000	1449000	let's look at
1449000	1451000	the distribution.
1451000	1453000	The first observation is
1453000	1455000	that we have a lot of proposal offers
1455000	1457000	which means
1457000	1459000	I play on the whole number.
1459000	1461000	I play on 0, 10, 20, 30.
1461000	1463000	This is the first observation.
1463000	1465000	The second observation is
1465000	1467000	that only about 6% of the audience
1467000	1469000	play on the theoretical prediction.
1469000	1471000	I give myself less
1471000	1473000	and I give myself more.
1473000	1475000	In this game,
1475000	1477000	there should be a first-mover advantage.
1477000	1479000	I should give you 50%
1479000	1481000	if I'm great.
1481000	1483000	I shouldn't lose to you.
1483000	1485000	I should give you more.
1485000	1487000	This is the first observation.
1487000	1489000	Next, let's compare
1489000	1491000	the distribution with ROC.
1491000	1493000	This is ROC's distribution
1493000	1495000	in 1990.
1495000	1497000	As Zhang said,
1497000	1499000	we didn't do a statistical assessment.
1499000	1501000	So we can only see
1501000	1503000	whether we can catch the distribution.
1503000	1505000	The first observation is
1505000	1507000	that the density
1507000	1509000	is about 50 to 40.
1509000	1511000	is about 50 to 40.
1511000	1513000	We can capture this.
1513000	1515000	We can capture this.
1515000	1517000	At this level,
1517000	1519000	we can replicate their results.
1519000	1521000	At this level, we can replicate their results.
1521000	1523000	In fact, the biggest difference
1523000	1525000	between our distribution and their distribution is
1525000	1527000	that almost no one here plays on
1527000	1529000	the theoretical prediction.
1529000	1531000	But about 10% of people
1531000	1533000	play on the theoretical prediction.
1533000	1535000	In fact,
1535000	1537000	at least me and Colin
1537000	1539000	are not sure.
1539000	1541000	Maybe this is the prediction option.
1541000	1543000	In the beginning of a game,
1543000	1545000	the prediction ball
1545000	1547000	is placed on the theoretical prediction.
1547000	1549000	is placed on the theoretical prediction.
1549000	1551000	If the student
1551000	1553000	doesn't think about it,
1553000	1555000	I will throw it away
1555000	1557000	without any strategy.
1557000	1559000	So 10% of people
1559000	1561000	may play on the theoretical prediction
1561000	1563000	and may be affected by the prediction option.
1563000	1565000	But this is...
1565000	1567000	Do you have response time here?
1567000	1569000	I will show it later.
1569000	1571000	According to your hypothesis,
1571000	1573000	the response time should be the lowest.
1573000	1575000	But the response time is very high.
1575000	1577000	But I will show the result later.
1577000	1579000	So it's not necessarily the predicted result.
1579000	1581000	So it's not necessarily the predicted result.
1581000	1583000	But...
1583000	1585000	Sorry, can you show the previous video?
1585000	1587000	Sorry, can you show the previous video?
1587000	1589000	OK.
1589000	1591000	Because I was thinking
1591000	1593000	if you said it's because of the default option,
1593000	1595000	if you said it's because of the default option,
1595000	1597000	I can see...
1597000	1599000	Because there are very few people
1599000	1601000	who mentioned 1 in Rose's data.
1601000	1603000	But the people who mentioned 1 here
1603000	1605000	seem to be
1605000	1607000	significantly higher than 0.
1607000	1609000	But the people who mentioned 1 here
1609000	1611000	seem to be
1611000	1613000	significantly higher than 0.
1613000	1615000	So although 0 is so high,
1615000	1617000	it may be the effect of the default option.
1617000	1619000	But it seems that there are more people
1619000	1621000	who seem to be significant.
1621000	1623000	If you look at the balance behavior as 0 or 1,
1623000	1625000	there are more people who seem to be significant.
1625000	1627000	There are more people who seem to be significant.
1627000	1629000	That's what I think.
1629000	1631000	Thank you for this comment.
1631000	1633000	It should be said that
1633000	1635000	it should be said that
1635000	1637000	it should be said that
1637000	1639000	there should be quite a lot of people
1639000	1641000	playing with the theory.
1641000	1643000	But it is true that the effect of the default option is a confirmation.
1643000	1645000	But I will continue to talk about it.
1645000	1647000	Next, this is our acceptance rate.
1647000	1649000	Next, this is our acceptance rate.
1649000	1651000	Because I think this result is very cool.
1651000	1653000	It doesn't matter if I talk about it later.
1653000	1655000	I must make this result clear.
1655000	1657000	First of all, because what we talked about earlier
1657000	1659000	is the unconditional acceptance rate.
1659000	1661000	What is more interesting now
1661000	1663000	is to measure the conditional acceptance rate.
1663000	1665000	Unconditional
1665000	1667000	is the number of offers I see.
1667000	1669000	That is to say, because we measure
1669000	1671000	the expected value of the conditions.
1671000	1673000	This is actually a function of an offer.
1673000	1675000	This is actually a function of an offer.
1675000	1677000	So on this graph, my X axis
1677000	1679000	shows how many proposal offers I see.
1679000	1681000	Then my Y axis shows
1681000	1683000	what is my average acceptance rate.
1683000	1685000	In this graph,
1685000	1687000	the black dot represents the information of one-shot game.
1687000	1689000	The orange dot represents the information of a repeat game.
1689000	1691000	Next, the size of each point
1691000	1693000	represents
1693000	1695000	the density of the
1695000	1697000	histogram we saw earlier.
1697000	1699000	So if you put
1699000	1701000	the size of the size of the ball on the X axis,
1701000	1703000	it becomes the full
1703000	1705000	histogram.
1705000	1707000	Next, because
1707000	1709000	when I was checking the data,
1709000	1711000	I found that between 49 and 50,
1711000	1713000	there is actually a
1713000	1715000	20% jump.
1715000	1717000	So I think it's weird.
1717000	1719000	So I used a specification
1719000	1721000	to measure
1721000	1723000	the P-splice linear
1723000	1725000	specification.
1725000	1727000	So what you can see is
1727000	1729000	that if you are
1729000	1731000	less than 50,
1731000	1733000	you see that your acceptance rate is this curve.
1733000	1735000	When it is greater than 50,
1735000	1737000	there will be a big break point here.
1737000	1739000	This is completely obvious.
1739000	1741000	It is very obvious.
1741000	1743000	When we measure the standard error,
1743000	1745000	we also use
1745000	1747000	cluster. Then we have a cluster
1747000	1749000	at the session level.
1749000	1751000	We use the most conservative calculation
1751000	1753000	to estimate our variability.
1753000	1755000	So in this case, it is also very obvious.
1755000	1757000	If we put all the data
1757000	1759000	together, there is about
1759000	1761000	20% to 21% jump.
1761000	1763000	If we divide it into one-shot game and
1763000	1765000	repeated game,
1765000	1767000	one-shot game is about 16%.
1767000	1769000	Then again, in repeated game,
1769000	1771000	this jump becomes 26%.
1771000	1773000	First of all,
1773000	1775000	this phenomenon has not been seen in the first 50 years.
1775000	1777000	So I think it's a very
1777000	1779000	cool discovery.
1779000	1781000	Next, let's talk about 1.
1781000	1783000	First of all,
1783000	1785000	this interpretation is actually very complicated.
1785000	1787000	Because we have a lot of confounds here,
1787000	1789000	which our database can't detect.
1789000	1791000	But what we can be sure of is that
1791000	1793000	the source of this point is not
1793000	1795000	the difference in your payoff.
1795000	1797000	Because you can see that when we come from the left
1797000	1799000	B, you can come from 49.99999.
1799000	1801000	Then the next step is to come from the right B,
1801000	1803000	which is about 50.0000001.
1803000	1805000	In fact, this gap is less than
1805000	1807000	how small your Epsilon should be.
1807000	1809000	So the effect of this is definitely not
1809000	1811000	from monetary payoff.
1811000	1813000	Or even if you are in a hypothetical state,
1813000	1815000	it is basically not from
1815000	1817000	how much your payoff is.
1817000	1819000	So it is very possible that this point is
1819000	1821000	your other regarding preference.
1821000	1823000	That is to say, at this time, you must
1823000	1825000	consider what other people
1825000	1827000	in this proposal offer.
1827000	1829000	What does it look like?
1829000	1831000	Next, there are many ways to say
1831000	1833000	that we can't uniquely pin down.
1833000	1835000	It may be like
1835000	1837000	because you are from 49.999 to 50.
1837000	1839000	You have a big gap here,
1839000	1841000	which is equality.
1841000	1843000	Because this paragraph can also mean
1843000	1845000	that I may be very, very care.
1845000	1847000	Am I equal to you?
1847000	1849000	Or this is the first one.
1849000	1851000	Or the other is to say that
1851000	1853000	if you don't give me 50,
1853000	1855000	I may have to punish you.
1855000	1857000	So this is why this paragraph may be
1857000	1859000	10% more in the repeated game.
1859000	1861000	It may be that this 10% is more
1861000	1863000	and I have to punish you.
1863000	1865000	Or I may care about my fairness.
1865000	1867000	Or I just say that since
1867000	1869000	we are not playing real money,
1869000	1871000	I just don't want to lose you.
1871000	1873000	So it means that if I am below,
1873000	1875000	my acceptance rate is relatively low.
1875000	1877000	So basically it's the same as
1877000	1879000	you and Yuqi.
1879000	1881000	This is what we see in the data.
1881000	1883000	I would like to ask
1883000	1885000	what your thoughts are.
1891000	1893000	Actually, I don't know.
1895000	1897000	Before you do this,
1897000	1899000	there is a question.
1899000	1901000	Although you know a lot,
1901000	1903000	but in fact,
1903000	1905000	even if you just showed us,
1905000	1907000	there are very few offers
1907000	1909000	that exceed 50.
1909000	1911000	There are about 600.
1911000	1913000	If you look at the group,
1913000	1915000	there are 600.
1915000	1917000	For example,
1917000	1919000	your estimate of acceptance rate
1919000	1921000	because you are not using strategy method,
1921000	1923000	you are showing offer.
1923000	1925000	So it means that
1925000	1927000	you are now running this break point return.
1927000	1929000	I think that
1929000	1931000	when it is below 50,
1931000	1933000	the variation is actually better.
1937000	1939000	But the part above 50
1939000	1941000	is probably more unstable.
1943000	1945000	But it looks like
1945000	1947000	this break point is really interesting.
1947000	1949000	Because
1949000	1951000	I think about it.
1951000	1953000	Because
1955000	1957000	Have you ever tried
1957000	1959000	you don't use
1959000	1961000	in the part below 50,
1961000	1963000	you don't use linear return to run.
1963000	1965000	I haven't tried it yet,
1965000	1967000	but I want to try quadratic.
1967000	1969000	Because there is another possibility
1969000	1971000	that it is actually not
1971000	1973000	presented as a break point,
1973000	1975000	but a more complex
1975000	1977000	non-linear.
1977000	1979000	Just because you fit linear,
1979000	1981000	it doesn't look like a break point.
1981000	1983000	Because if you look at the data directly,
1983000	1985000	it looks at least
1985000	1987000	I think it's quite linear.
1989000	1991000	If you look at the part of the orange repeat game,
1991000	1993000	it looks like
1993000	1995000	it's actually
1995000	1997000	a strange fall first,
1997000	1999000	but it's more stable
1999000	2001000	when it reaches 40.
2001000	2003000	This may be more like quadratic.
2003000	2005000	If you only look at black,
2005000	2007000	it looks like
2007000	2009000	it's a
2009000	2011000	it's a
2011000	2013000	between 20 and above
2013000	2015000	50 is a shakier
2015000	2017000	drop, but
2017000	2019000	below 20
2019000	2021000	it's more stable.
2021000	2023000	So
2023000	2025000	it's possible here,
2025000	2027000	just because
2027000	2029000	you fit a one-point
2029000	2031000	linear relationship.
2031000	2033000	Anyway, I will try quadratic.
2033000	2035000	But this is
2035000	2037000	what I estimated.
2037000	2039000	I think it's quite interesting.
2039000	2041000	If this is true,
2041000	2043000	how do we
2043000	2045000	at least I think
2045000	2047000	how to reproduce this break point in the lab
2047000	2049000	I think it's quite interesting.
2049000	2051000	Let's look at the results of ROS.
2051000	2053000	If we look at the data of ROS,
2053000	2055000	this break point is completely invisible.
2055000	2057000	So
2057000	2059000	this result
2059000	2061000	I think it's quite special.
2061000	2063000	This means that we have a lot of work hypothesis
2063000	2065000	running here at the same time.
2065000	2067000	However, we have tried
2067000	2069000	a power test.
2069000	2071000	This means that if we only draw 10%
2071000	2073000	because our sample number is about 0.
2073000	2075000	So if we only draw 10%
2075000	2077000	can we estimate this break point?
2077000	2079000	This means that we still have a way to estimate this break point.
2079000	2081000	So it may not be because
2081000	2083000	the problem of power in statistics.
2083000	2085000	Then another
2085000	2087000	our work hypothesis may be because of
2087000	2089000	hypothetical stake.
2089000	2091000	Is it because it's all
2091000	2093000	invisible?
2093000	2095000	So I care more about the ranking between you and me.
2095000	2097000	At least I don't want to lose to you.
2097000	2099000	So
2099000	2101000	this is my current work hypothesis.
2101000	2103000	This may be
2103000	2105000	the next article that can be done
2105000	2107000	is how to reproduce this break point in the lab.
2107000	2109000	I think it's quite interesting.
2109000	2111000	Can you remind us again
2111000	2113000	about the population composition
2113000	2115000	of your data?
2115000	2117000	For example,
2117000	2119000	the proportion of each state or
2119000	2121000	province?
2121000	2123000	We have seen that
2123000	2125000	in the United States, there are western states,
2125000	2127000	central and western states.
2127000	2129000	Then there are northeastern states.
2129000	2131000	Then there are southern states.
2131000	2133000	Then there is Canada.
2133000	2135000	Then in Europe, there are
2135000	2137000	the United Kingdom and Spain.
2137000	2139000	Then in Asia,
2139000	2141000	there are China, Japan and Singapore.
2141000	2143000	What about the proportion?
2143000	2145000	About 80% of the data is in the north.
2145000	2147000	Then about 10% in Europe
2147000	2149000	and about 10% in Asia.
2149000	2151000	OK.
2151000	2153000	So overall,
2153000	2155000	this result
2155000	2157000	is more conservative.
2157000	2159000	It is the result of the main cultural circle
2159000	2161000	in North America, right?
2161000	2163000	Yes.
2163000	2165000	OK. I just want to ask.
2165000	2167000	But I want to add
2167000	2169000	that the problem is
2169000	2171000	that all the results of the lab
2171000	2173000	are not in North America.
2173000	2175000	Yes.
2175000	2177000	This is true.
2177000	2179000	OK.
2179000	2181000	Then I will...
2181000	2183000	Bo-xuan,
2183000	2185000	if you want to compare with
2185000	2187000	Ross's work,
2187000	2189000	Ross's work is mainly not in North America.
2189000	2191000	Then the data of
2191000	2193000	the other works,
2193000	2195000	such as Madden Game,
2195000	2197000	can you observe?
2197000	2199000	I have almost never seen any points.
2199000	2201000	Yes. OK.
2201000	2203000	OK.
2203000	2205000	Because of the time...
2205000	2207000	OK.
2207000	2209000	Let me continue.
2209000	2211000	I have a question.
2211000	2213000	This article was made
2213000	2215000	about 20 years ago,
2215000	2217000	right?
2217000	2219000	Yes.
2219000	2221000	Do you think that the evolution of time
2221000	2223000	has a big impact on the data?
2223000	2225000	Of course it is possible.
2225000	2227000	Because a lot of social preferences
2227000	2229000	may follow the evolution of time.
2229000	2231000	For example, the value of Taiwanese
2231000	2233000	has changed over the past few years.
2233000	2235000	So it is true that this may be
2235000	2237000	different.
2237000	2239000	But we can see that
2239000	2241000	the social preferences
2241000	2243000	have a big impact on the game.
2243000	2245000	If this has any impact on the data,
2245000	2247000	it may be OK.
2247000	2249000	Because the data may be a mirror effect.
2249000	2251000	But this is a big problem.
2251000	2253000	We can talk about it later.
2253000	2255000	Then I will continue.
2255000	2257000	Finally, the teacher just said
2257000	2259000	that we need to show the reaction time.
2259000	2261000	Our server does record the reaction time.
2261000	2263000	Then...
2263000	2265000	Because
2265000	2267000	OneShotGame and RePDGame
2267000	2269000	have similar patterns.
2269000	2271000	So I only use OneShotGame
2271000	2273000	to show the result.
2273000	2275000	First of all, the black line
2275000	2277000	represents the reaction time.
2277000	2279000	The black line represents the reaction time.
2279000	2281000	The black line represents
2281000	2283000	the lowest estimation.
2283000	2285000	The orange line
2285000	2287000	represents the acceptance rate.
2287000	2289000	Then...
2289000	2291000	This is also my lowest estimation.
2291000	2293000	Then...
2293000	2295000	The X-axis represents
2295000	2297000	my offer.
2297000	2299000	If you don't have any concept,
2299000	2301000	the lowest estimation is
2301000	2303000	the return time
2303000	2305000	in each section.
2305000	2307000	This means that
2307000	2309000	I am fitting the data
2309000	2311000	when I am close to 0.
2311000	2313000	It is close.
2313000	2315000	So what the teacher saw at the beginning
2315000	2317000	is that
2317000	2319000	he spent a lot of time
2319000	2321000	to make the decision.
2321000	2323000	He spent almost 20 seconds to make the decision.
2323000	2325000	But you can see
2325000	2327000	that 50 is very short.
2327000	2329000	There is a drop.
2329000	2331000	It only takes about 8 seconds to make the decision.
2331000	2333000	This means that
2333000	2335000	50 is a very special allocation
2335000	2337000	for the number.
2337000	2339000	At least for them,
2339000	2341000	if I see 50,
2341000	2343000	I don't need to think too much
2343000	2345000	to make the decision.
2345000	2347000	Another thing is that
2347000	2349000	we see a sharp kink
2349000	2351000	in the acceptance rate.
2351000	2353000	This means that
2353000	2355000	it is possible that
2355000	2357000	no matter what the
2357000	2359000	probability is,
2359000	2361000	at least we can still see something.
2361000	2363000	This is the data
2363000	2365000	on the reaction time.
2365000	2367000	However, the interpretation is
2367000	2369000	quite special.
2369000	2371000	At least for the show data,
2371000	2373000	we can spend very little time
2373000	2375000	to make the decision.
2375000	2377000	Bo-xuan,
2377000	2379000	is there no way to record
2379000	2381000	the time for the proposer to enter the game
2381000	2383000	and his proposal?
2383000	2385000	Because if you want to see if it is D4...
2385000	2387000	Let me think about it.
2387000	2389000	What we can see is that
2389000	2391000	we only start to calculate the time
2391000	2393000	when we enter the game.
2393000	2395000	Because it depends on whether
2395000	2397000	the effect caused by the default option
2397000	2399000	causes many people to raise 0.
2399000	2401000	Right.
2401000	2403000	You are right.
2405000	2407000	We do see the time for the proposer.
2407000	2409000	However, I remember that
2409000	2411000	it took a lot of time.
2411000	2413000	OK.
2413000	2415000	This is...
2415000	2417000	Hello?
2417000	2419000	Let me answer.
2419000	2421000	At the time close to 0,
2421000	2423000	you said that
2423000	2425000	it took a lot of time.
2425000	2427000	You mentioned that
2427000	2429000	you were thinking...
2429000	2431000	At the beginning,
2431000	2433000	you said that
2433000	2435000	there were many results at 0, right?
2435000	2437000	Yes.
2437000	2439000	At that time,
2439000	2441000	you thought that
2441000	2443000	the starting point of SliderBar was 0, right?
2443000	2445000	Yes.
2445000	2447000	In fact,
2447000	2449000	they spent a lot of time thinking about it.
2449000	2451000	It seems that
2451000	2453000	it is not because...
2453000	2455000	I think it is like
2455000	2457000	canceling the explanation
2457000	2459000	you mentioned at the beginning.
2459000	2461000	Is it because
2461000	2463000	they just accepted it?
2463000	2465000	That's right.
2465000	2467000	However,
2467000	2469000	it took a lot of time.
2469000	2471000	It took a lot of time.
2471000	2473000	It took a lot of time.
2473000	2475000	I should show you the time for the proposer.
2475000	2477000	The time for the proposer.
2477000	2479000	However,
2479000	2481000	the explanation of calling is quite interesting.
2481000	2483000	Why did it take a lot of time
2483000	2485000	to think about it?
2485000	2487000	Many people were reluctant to accept it.
2487000	2489000	It took a lot of time
2489000	2491000	to accept it.
2491000	2493000	That's right.
2493000	2495000	Bo-xuan,
2495000	2497000	you can split the responder
2497000	2499000	into accepted and unaccepted.
2499000	2501000	OK.
2501000	2503000	This is a special point.
2503000	2505000	I will split it.
2505000	2507000	I will write it down.
2509000	2511000	Next,
2511000	2513000	I still have some time.
2513000	2515000	I want to talk about the result of double option.
2515000	2517000	Double option is...
2517000	2519000	Sorry, Bo-xuan.
2519000	2521000	Before you talk about double option,
2521000	2523000	can I talk about the point of
2523000	2525000	Automaton Game?
2525000	2527000	I was just thinking that
2527000	2529000	you just said that
2529000	2531000	one possibility is that
2531000	2533000	everyone cares about fairness.
2533000	2535000	The other possibility is that
2535000	2537000	everyone cares about
2537000	2539000	not losing.
2539000	2541000	Is the acceptance rate
2541000	2543000	particularly high?
2543000	2545000	Yes.
2545000	2547000	Or is it a whole point?
2547000	2549000	There is a point that goes up
2549000	2551000	and then forms a square curve.
2551000	2553000	If you care about fairness,
2553000	2555000	maybe 50 is particularly high,
2555000	2557000	and then 51, 52,
2557000	2559000	there will be another point.
2559000	2561000	One-shot game is like this.
2561000	2563000	There is no repeated game.
2563000	2565000	OK.
2565000	2567000	I will continue to talk about it.
2567000	2569000	OK.
2569000	2571000	I'm afraid I don't have enough time.
2571000	2573000	Next, double option is...
2573000	2575000	First, I want to show you
2575000	2577000	what the data looks like.
2577000	2579000	This is our predicted market.
2579000	2581000	Next, the whole price changes.
2581000	2583000	This is just an example.
2583000	2585000	I have 10 regions here.
2585000	2587000	I choose a market for each region.
2587000	2589000	I draw it out
2589000	2591000	to show you what it looks like.
2591000	2593000	You can see that I only draw four levels.
2593000	2595000	Because the length is about four levels.
2595000	2597000	If you look at the first level,
2597000	2599000	everyone may be very noisy.
2599000	2601000	Next, look at the second level
2601000	2603000	and the third level,
2603000	2605000	the price changes less.
2605000	2607000	In the fourth level,
2607000	2609000	the more you play, the more stable it becomes.
2609000	2611000	What we want to see here is
2611000	2613000	that under the market mechanism of double option,
2613000	2615000	as long as you play about three or four times,
2615000	2617000	consumers can find
2617000	2619000	a balanced price, even if I don't tell them anything.
2619000	2621000	Next, another thing,
2621000	2623000	as I said before,
2623000	2625000	the market is very short.
2625000	2627000	So we want to estimate
2627000	2629000	what it is like.
2629000	2631000	If it can play a lot of games,
2631000	2633000	where will it end up?
2633000	2635000	We spent
2635000	2637000	about a month
2637000	2639000	to come up with this.
2639000	2641000	First of all,
2641000	2643000	let's talk about intuition.
2643000	2645000	Let's talk about an example.
2645000	2647000	Let's say
2647000	2649000	a lot of people here have the same experience.
2649000	2651000	When you apply for a PhD,
2651000	2653000	I want to know
2653000	2655000	what this student will do
2655000	2657000	in the rest of his career.
2657000	2659000	But the only thing I can know
2659000	2661000	is what his GPA
2661000	2663000	will look like in the next four years.
2663000	2665000	So at this time,
2665000	2667000	for a school,
2667000	2669000	if it wants to estimate
2669000	2671000	what will happen next,
2671000	2673000	the only thing it can do is
2673000	2675000	to increase his GPA in different periods.
2675000	2677000	So it's possible that
2677000	2679000	I put more weight on the GPA at the end
2679000	2681000	You can look at two parts.
2681000	2683000	The first one is
2683000	2685000	the Dependent Variable on the left.
2685000	2687000	On the right,
2687000	2689000	if we look at T as 1,
2689000	2691000	this means that I am in the first period.
2691000	2693000	In this case,
2693000	2695000	this is back to the simplest return.
2695000	2697000	This is very common.
2697000	2699000	In the first period,
2699000	2701000	if you use the example of GPA,
2701000	2703000	your first semester
2703000	2705000	is likely to have a lot of variables.
2705000	2707000	Maybe it's because you're a middle school student
2707000	2709000	and you don't know what's wrong with your GPA in the first semester.
2709000	2711000	However,
2711000	2713000	in the second period,
2713000	2715000	I only give you one-second weight
2715000	2717000	to explain your starting point,
2717000	2719000	such as building a house or something like that.
2719000	2721000	I only give you one-second weight.
2721000	2723000	I also give you one-second weight
2723000	2725000	for your GPA at that time.
2725000	2727000	This means that your GPA at this time
2727000	2729000	may be only half of the population
2729000	2731000	in front of you.
2731000	2733000	In the third period,
2733000	2735000	I put two-thirds weight on your GPA.
2735000	2737000	In this case,
2737000	2739000	I only give you one-third weight
2739000	2741000	for your starting point.
2741000	2743000	So you can see that
2743000	2745000	if I can make T
2745000	2747000	as large as infinite,
2747000	2749000	then my beta2
2749000	2751000	is actually
2751000	2753000	the progressive estimate of
2753000	2755000	our dependent variable.
2755000	2757000	In other words,
2757000	2759000	if we put this Y
2759000	2761000	on all the indicators of the first three markets,
2761000	2763000	then where will this market end up?
2763000	2765000	If consumers can play enough,
2765000	2767000	then we put this Y
2767000	2769000	on all the indicators of the first three markets,
2769000	2771000	then we can see that
2771000	2773000	the first one is mean error deviation.
2773000	2775000	Its final price is only
2775000	2777000	1% higher than the average price.
2777000	2779000	It is not significantly different
2779000	2781000	from the theoretical estimate.
2781000	2783000	Then the final price change
2783000	2785000	is reduced to 11%.
2785000	2787000	Although the estimate is a bit big,
2787000	2789000	it is also not significantly different
2789000	2791000	from the theoretical estimate.
2791000	2793000	The final price change is reduced to 97%.
2793000	2795000	It is also not significantly different from the first one.
2795000	2797000	So these results are basically
2797000	2799000	completely the same as the results of the lab.
2799000	2801000	So at least
2801000	2803000	we can prove that
2803000	2805000	double auction is a very stable
2805000	2807000	price mechanism
2807000	2809000	to reach 100% efficiency.
2809000	2811000	So we can see that
2811000	2813000	our data also shows the same thing.
2813000	2815000	When our students can play enough,
2815000	2817000	all of our welfare
2817000	2819000	should be exhausted.
2819000	2821000	Can I go back to the last page?
2821000	2823000	Yes, you can.
2823000	2825000	I want to confirm
2825000	2827000	the quantitative model.
2827000	2829000	Why is there no variable
2829000	2831000	next to Beta 2?
2831000	2833000	Because this means
2833000	2835000	what I want to see is
2835000	2837000	where your final GPA is.
2837000	2839000	What I bring here is a constant.
2839000	2841000	What I multiply here
2841000	2843000	is a constant.
2845000	2847000	The point is that I am
2847000	2849000	multiplying your
2849000	2851000	current GPA
2851000	2853000	with your original demographic
2853000	2855000	variation.
2857000	2859000	Is it OK?
2859000	2861000	It doesn't matter.
2861000	2863000	If you don't understand,
2863000	2865000	I will discuss with you later.
2865000	2867000	I will continue.
2867000	2869000	What we see in the end is that
2869000	2871000	although we can basically
2871000	2873000	get the theoretical estimate,
2873000	2875000	what we want to see is that
2875000	2877000	where your final GPA is.
2877000	2879000	What we see in the end is the amount of transactions.
2879000	2881000	The horizontal axis
2881000	2883000	is the theoretical estimate amount.
2883000	2885000	The vertical axis is the amount of transactions.
2885000	2887000	The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.
2887000	2889000	The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.
2889000	2891000	The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.
2891000	2893000	The point is that
2893000	2895000	if the market is not balanced,
2895000	2897000	we are often under-traded.
2897000	2899000	It is possible that
2899000	2901000	the last one or two transactions
2901000	2903000	may bring us only 1% or 2% of efficiency.
2903000	2905000	In this case,
2905000	2907000	it is possible that
2907000	2909000	I am too lazy to make the last 1 or 2 cents.
2909000	2911000	This is the main result of
2911000	2913000	the double option.
2913000	2915000	I have about 10 minutes left.
2915000	2917000	I want to talk about
2917000	2919000	what I said earlier.
2919000	2921000	We have a lot of
2921000	2923000	variations in different countries.
2923000	2925000	I want to use some
2925000	2927000	meta-analysis tools
2927000	2929000	to analyze
2929000	2931000	the composition of these variations.
2931000	2933000	First,
2933000	2935000	we look at
2935000	2937000	the variations between countries.
2937000	2939000	Basically,
2939000	2941000	we need to use
2941000	2943000	a
2943000	2945000	meta-analysis
2945000	2947000	to calculate
2947000	2949000	I squared.
2949000	2951000	If you look at
2951000	2953000	this graph,
2953000	2955000	you can see that
2955000	2957000	these are
2957000	2959000	the average variations of the proposal offer.
2959000	2961000	Next,
2961000	2963000	we have all the variations,
2963000	2965000	the variations between countries,
2965000	2967000	and the variations within countries.
2967000	2969000	What we want to know is
2969000	2971000	what is the proportion of
2971000	2973000	the variations between countries.
2973000	2975000	We calculate I squared.
2975000	2977000	Since we don't have much time,
2977000	2979000	I won't talk about
2979000	2981000	how to calculate I squared.
2981000	2983000	What we can figure out is
2983000	2985000	the proportion of
2985000	2987000	the variations
2987000	2989000	within countries.
2989000	2991000	We can see that
2991000	2993000	86.6% of the variations
2993000	2995000	in the proposal offer
2995000	2997000	are significant.
2997000	2999000	Although we can't say
2999000	3001000	that this is a cultural difference,
3001000	3003000	we can say that
3003000	3005000	the variations within countries
3005000	3007000	are significant.
3007000	3009000	From the same perspective,
3009000	3011000	we look at the acceptance rate.
3011000	3013000	The acceptance rate is special
3013000	3015000	because we look at
3015000	3017000	the shape of the probability function.
3017000	3019000	In order to make it comparable,
3019000	3021000	what we can do is
3021000	3023000	we look at
3023000	3025000	a logic regression.
3025000	3027000	On the left, we put 0 and 1 variables,
3027000	3029000	which is whether you accept or reject.
3029000	3031000	On the right, we put
3031000	3033000	10 dummy variables
3033000	3035000	in addition to the offer.
3035000	3037000	The result is that
3037000	3039000	the dummy variable
3039000	3041000	is the shape of the probability function.
3041000	3043000	We take the coefficient
3043000	3045000	to measure the variations.
3045000	3047000	We can see that
3047000	3049000	only 30% of the variations
3049000	3051000	come from countries.
3051000	3053000	This is not significant.
3053000	3055000	We can see that
3055000	3057000	in the Ultimatum Game,
3057000	3059000	the proposal offer has a significant
3059000	3061000	variation between countries,
3061000	3063000	but the acceptance rate is not significant.
3063000	3065000	This also responds to
3065000	3067000	Roth's conjecture in 1991.
3067000	3069000	Roth proposed a hypothesis
3069000	3071000	in 1991.
3071000	3073000	In the Ultimatum Game,
3073000	3075000	the cultural difference between
3075000	3077000	countries should be
3077000	3079000	reflected by
3079000	3081000	the proposal offer,
3081000	3083000	but it does not affect
3083000	3085000	the acceptance rate.
3085000	3087000	This is a very good
3087000	3089000	evidence
3089000	3091000	to respond to
3091000	3093000	Roth's initial hypothesis.
3093000	3095000	Next, we look at
3095000	3097000	the variation between double options.
3097000	3099000	We take two things,
3099000	3101000	the first one is the price.
3101000	3103000	We look at the first round
3103000	3105000	of each market.
3105000	3107000	Then we look at
3107000	3109000	the first and last price
3109000	3111000	in the predicted market.
3111000	3113000	We want to know
3113000	3115000	how the market price
3115000	3117000	is balanced.
3117000	3119000	First, we look at
3119000	3121000	the first price of each market.
3121000	3123000	We can see that
3123000	3125000	the first one is
3125000	3127000	only 27.3% of the variations
3127000	3129000	are not written.
3129000	3131000	The second one,
3131000	3133000	we can see that
3133000	3135000	the first price
3135000	3137000	is very noisy
3137000	3139000	in some places
3139000	3141000	like Spain or Singapore.
3141000	3143000	Although the number of variations
3143000	3145000	is small,
3145000	3147000	it causes the standard error
3147000	3149000	to be large.
3149000	3151000	However,
3151000	3153000	in other countries,
3153000	3155000	the standard error bar
3155000	3157000	is very small.
3157000	3159000	Moreover,
3159000	3161000	every country can
3161000	3163000	predict the market price.
3163000	3165000	Next,
3165000	3167000	if we look at
3167000	3169000	the overall price distribution,
3169000	3171000	the first price
3171000	3173000	is about 0.33%.
3173000	3175000	The second one is
3175000	3177000	only 14% of the overall price,
3177000	3179000	so it is almost 60%.
3179000	3181000	This tells us that
3181000	3183000	you may not know
3183000	3185000	the market price,
3185000	3187000	but you can
3187000	3189000	stabilize the balance.
3189000	3191000	This is the reason
3191000	3193000	why many economists
3193000	3195000	like the market.
3195000	3197000	Even if you don't know anything,
3197000	3199000	the market will tell you
3199000	3201000	what the balance looks like.
3201000	3203000	Finally,
3203000	3205000	I want to summarize
3205000	3207000	with this video.
3207000	3209000	In this project,
3209000	3211000	we use the lab data
3211000	3213000	to predict the market price.
3213000	3215000	In Ultimate Game,
3215000	3217000	we can see that
3217000	3219000	more than 94% of the proposals
3219000	3221000	are below 50%.
3221000	3223000	Many proposals
3223000	3225000	are above the natural
3225000	3227000	poker point.
3227000	3229000	In terms of acceptance rate,
3229000	3231000	we see a 20% breakpoint.
3231000	3233000	In the reaction,
3233000	3235000	we see 10% more breakpoints.
3235000	3237000	In response time,
3237000	3239000	it is the lowest
3239000	3241000	of the three.
3241000	3243000	Finally,
3243000	3245000	no matter which of the three
3245000	3247000	we use,
3247000	3249000	accuracy,
3249000	3251000	fluctuation,
3251000	3253000	or efficiency
3253000	3255000	will all be calculated.
3255000	3257000	Finally,
3257000	3259000	we can see that
3259000	3261000	in Ultimate Game,
3261000	3263000	the proposal offer
3263000	3265000	has more breakpoints
3265000	3267000	than acceptance rate.
3267000	3269000	This is in response to
3269000	3271000	Roth's 1990 contracture.
3271000	3273000	Finally,
3273000	3275000	if we compare Ultimate Game
3275000	3277000	with Double Option,
3277000	3279000	we can see a big difference
3279000	3281000	between the two countries.
3281000	3283000	This is in response to
3283000	3285000	Double Option is a very stable mechanism
3285000	3287000	in all countries.
3287000	3289000	I think this is all
3289000	3291000	I want to say.
3291000	3293000	I will show my email.
3293000	3295000	If you have any questions,
3295000	3297000	we have about 5 minutes left.
3297000	3299000	Let's see what questions you want to ask.
3299000	3301000	Mr. He,
3301000	3303000	do you want to comment?
3311000	3313000	Mr. He, please comment.
3317000	3319000	I want to ask
3319000	3321000	if you have any questions.
3321000	3323000	I will ask first.
3323000	3325000	Wait a minute.
3325000	3327000	The first question is for Mr. He.
3331000	3333000	Do you want to estimate
3333000	3335000	the result of long-term training?
3335000	3337000	There is a way.
3337000	3339000	You can show us
3339000	3341000	the data
3341000	3343000	in the lab.
3343000	3345000	If you only use the previous few rounds,
3345000	3347000	then you can estimate
3347000	3349000	the result of long-term training.
3349000	3351000	This way,
3351000	3353000	you can estimate the result of long-term training.
3353000	3355000	I'm not sure
3355000	3357000	how you estimate the result
3357000	3359000	of long-term training
3359000	3361000	in the country.
3361000	3363000	I'm not sure
3363000	3365000	how you estimate the result of long-term training.
3365000	3367000	I will talk about it first.
3367000	3369000	No, no.
3369000	3371000	What I mean is
3371000	3373000	what is the hypothesis
3373000	3375000	you want to verify.
3375000	3377000	If it is a double auction,
3377000	3379000	why do you
3379000	3381000	say that
3381000	3383000	Asians are more polite?
3383000	3385000	No, what I want to say is
3385000	3387000	double auctions
3387000	3389000	in different places around the world
3389000	3391000	have similar results.
3391000	3393000	However,
3393000	3395000	there is a big difference
3395000	3397000	between each country.
3399000	3401000	That's what I want to say.
3409000	3411000	Let me think about it.
3411000	3413000	Let me think about it.
3417000	3419000	There is a problem here.
3419000	3421000	You think the market
3421000	3423000	is universal.
3423000	3425000	You think the market
3425000	3427000	is universal.
3427000	3429000	You think the market
3429000	3431000	is universal.
3431000	3433000	However,
3433000	3435000	there is a problem here.
3435000	3437000	There is a problem here.
3437000	3439000	If you don't use the strategy method,
3439000	3441000	you can't see
3441000	3443000	the complete strategy
3443000	3445000	of the respondent.
3449000	3451000	You think
3451000	3453000	what you see is
3453000	3455000	what you see is
3455000	3457000	acceptable or not,
3457000	3459000	you can only explain
3459000	3461000	30% of the variation.
3461000	3463000	However,
3463000	3465000	what is the actual strategy?
3465000	3467000	I'm not sure
3467000	3469000	I'm not sure
3469000	3471000	where you can check.
3471000	3473000	It is possible
3473000	3475000	that because
3475000	3477000	different countries
3477000	3479000	have already explained
3479000	3481000	most of the proposal
3481000	3483000	that is,
3483000	3485000	everyone
3485000	3487000	has proposed
3487000	3489000	a social standard
3489000	3491000	that meets
3491000	3493000	the social standard
3493000	3495000	of the proposal.
3495000	3497000	But that part
3497000	3499000	may be because it is all
3499000	3501000	hidden in the
3501000	3503000	proposal.
3503000	3505000	This is also the point I want to talk about.
3505000	3507000	This is also the point I want to talk about.
3507000	3509000	OK.
3509000	3511000	Can I ask a question?
3511000	3513000	Can I ask a question?
3513000	3515000	Hi.
3515000	3517000	0 and 100
3517000	3519000	0 and 100
3519000	3521000	0 and 100
3521000	3523000	I agree with what Meng just said.
3523000	3525000	I agree with what Meng just said.
3525000	3527000	The default reaction time
3527000	3529000	The default reaction time
3529000	3531000	is a test
3531000	3533000	to see if it is a default effect.
3533000	3535000	You said you have
3535000	3537000	experimental instructions.
3537000	3539000	You said you have
3539000	3541000	experimental instructions.
3541000	3543000	Can you tell
3543000	3545000	which ones are
3545000	3547000	really incentivized?
3547000	3549000	Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?
3549000	3551000	Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?
3551000	3553000	Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?
3553000	3555000	Usually, the incentive for
3555000	3557000	an experiment is
3557000	3559000	how many points I give you
3559000	3561000	if you take part in the experiment.
3561000	3563000	But I don't know what their design is like.
3563000	3565000	But I don't know what their design is like.
3565000	3567000	Some may be related to
3567000	3569000	your test result.
3569000	3571000	Some may be related to
3571000	3573000	your test result.
3573000	3575000	Some may be related to
3575000	3577000	a participation experiment.
3577000	3579000	But the result is not affected by it.
3579000	3581000	But the result is not affected by it.
3581000	3583000	You will see more than 100 points.
3583000	3585000	You will see more than 100 points.
3585000	3587000	You will see more than 100 points.
3587000	3589000	It may be normal.
3589000	3591000	Because the result may be
3591000	3593000	a naive or unexpected behavior.
3593000	3595000	a naive or unexpected behavior.
3595000	3597000	About the more than 0 points,
3597000	3599000	I think
3599000	3601000	it is a
3601000	3603000	inherent problem.
3603000	3605000	In general, those who do experiments with
3605000	3607000	telecom all use
3607000	3609000	Marbled.
3609000	3611000	Marbled.
3611000	3613000	I don't know whether it is right.
3613000	3615000	But, I think it is.
3615000	3617000	What about after-graduate students?
3617000	3619000	What about after- graduate students?
3619000	3621000	What about after- graduate students?
3621000	3623000	The third option is
3623000	3625000	the course of
3625000	3627000	Ultimatum Gate.
3627000	3629000	The third option is
3629000	3631000	the course of Ultimatum Gate.
3631000	3633000	The 3rd option is
3633000	3635000	for example,
3635000	3637000	after-graduate students finish the course,
3637000	3639000	the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Gate is 0.
3639000	3641000	Then, they do the experiment.
3641000	3643000	Or, they do the experiment before the theoretical prediction.
3643000	3645000	There is a difference.
3645000	3647000	There is a difference.
3647000	3649000	Because, after-graduate students do the experiment,
3649000	3651000	the 3rd option
3651000	3653000	is the default of many people.
3653000	3655000	I know.
3655000	3657000	We have seen
3657000	3659000	different courses.
3659000	3661000	The smallest course is the course of Game Theory.
3661000	3663000	OK.
3663000	3665000	This is a sample.
3665000	3667000	OK.
3667000	3669000	You can imagine
3669000	3671000	the degree of
3671000	3673000	interaction between
3673000	3675000	the scope of each course,
3675000	3677000	this is Ludger' class.
3679000	3681000	Because we have a class name,
3681000	3683000	So, we may roughly know the degree of interaction.
3683000	3685000	The only difference is
3685000	3687000	after-shared theory prediction
3687000	3689000	of Ultimatum Gate is 0,
3689000	3691000	I can't see it.
3691000	3693000	For 0 and 100,
3693000	3695000	in the data of Google Earth,
3695000	3697000	the two peaks
3697000	3699000	are very different.
3699000	3701000	So, I think
3701000	3703000	if you can
3703000	3705000	clear those data,
3705000	3707000	or find the way
3707000	3709000	like just now,
3709000	3711000	and then compare with the kink,
3711000	3713000	OK.
3713000	3715000	Maybe it will be closer.
3715000	3717000	I don't know if it will affect.
3717000	3719000	OK.
3719000	3721000	I have a notebook.
3725000	3727000	OK.
3727000	3729000	You ask first.
3729000	3731000	OK. Thank you.
3731000	3733000	This is not a question.
3733000	3735000	It's more like a comment.
3735000	3737000	Since
3737000	3739000	you have the default option
3739000	3741000	bias,
3741000	3743000	it seems to be a very serious thing.
3743000	3745000	It will make your two curves
3745000	3747000	and theory different.
3747000	3749000	My idea is
3749000	3751000	whether you can...
3751000	3753000	I don't know if it will be too difficult.
3753000	3755000	When you change your program,
3755000	3757000	when you change your game,
3757000	3759000	you make every starting point different.
3759000	3761000	You can choose a starting point
3761000	3763000	to solve your next problem.
3763000	3765000	Let me respond.
3765000	3767000	This is technically
3767000	3769000	very simple.
3769000	3771000	But there is another problem
3771000	3773000	in economics.
3773000	3775000	There is a friction effect.
3775000	3777000	I'm afraid there will be an anchoring result.
3777000	3779000	So...
3779000	3781000	Oh.
3781000	3783000	If
3783000	3785000	your starting point is a very high offer,
3785000	3787000	it is very likely that people will be affected
3787000	3789000	by that point.
3789000	3791000	OK. My offer is higher.
3791000	3793000	If my starting point is lower,
3793000	3795000	I may be affected by this point.
3795000	3797000	So we are...
3797000	3799000	About this,
3799000	3801000	we can't control
3801000	3803000	the standard time.
3803000	3805000	Usually,
3805000	3807000	the way to control the prediction effect
3807000	3809000	is to put $100
3809000	3811000	directly on the table.
3811000	3813000	Don't put it on both sides.
3813000	3815000	Put it one by one.
3815000	3817000	OK.
3817000	3819000	But
3819000	3821000	in their operation,
3821000	3823000	they choose
3823000	3825000	to put it directly at the beginning.
3825000	3827000	So there will be a prediction effect.
3827000	3829000	But in terms of reaction time,
3829000	3831000	the effect should be very small.
3831000	3833000	I have a response.
3833000	3835000	Or just change the interface
3835000	3837000	to fill in the numbers directly.
3837000	3839000	Don't use the LaBar method.
3839000	3841000	Of course,
3841000	3843000	this is also possible.
3843000	3845000	But this may have to talk
3845000	3847000	to the engineer.
3847000	3849000	But this is also possible.
3849000	3851000	But we want to change it.
3851000	3853000	We want to use LaBar mainly to
3853000	3855000	make the picture interesting
3855000	3857000	and make consumers want to buy it.
3857000	3859000	I don't know why.
3859000	3861000	Everyone thinks LaBar is fun.
3861000	3863000	I don't know why.
3863000	3865000	Everyone likes LaBar.
3865000	3867000	But there will be a lot of problems.
3867000	3869000	Of course.
3869000	3871000	LaBar is because
3871000	3873000	a lot of people are operating
3873000	3875000	with a tablet.
3875000	3877000	This is also...
3877000	3879000	I have a question.
3879000	3881000	You say.
3881000	3883000	Hello.
3883000	3885000	You say.
3885000	3887000	This question is like this.
3887000	3889000	You know that Zhang Anping
3889000	3891000	is studying social psychology.
3891000	3893000	They often play this kind of
3893000	3895000	game.
3895000	3897000	But they like to do one thing,
3897000	3899000	which is to manipulate the victim.
3899000	3901000	For example, let you play the game first,
3901000	3903000	then teach you game theory,
3903000	3905000	then let you play the game,
3905000	3907000	then look at the difference.
3907000	3909000	But what they do more often is
3909000	3911000	to let you play the game first,
3911000	3913000	then let you watch Hitler's documentary,
3913000	3915000	do you try to manipulate the victim?
3915000	3917000	This is what we can't do.
3917000	3919000	Because we...
3919000	3921000	Because it means
3921000	3923000	different treatments for the victim.
3923000	3925000	We can compare the experimental group and the control group.
3925000	3927000	But we are basically because
3927000	3929000	we don't have an experimental group and a control group.
3929000	3931000	So this is what we can't do.
3931000	3933000	There is no way to look at this information.
3933000	3935000	But of course, if we are in the lab,
3935000	3937000	it can be done completely.
3937000	3939000	But you can sell the product to the psychology department.
3939000	3941000	This is what I am sure of.
3941000	3943000	This is what I am sure of.
3943000	3945000	So now we are going to hire a psychologist.
3945000	3947000	I think this will be a pretty interesting tour.
3947000	3949000	Because they are indeed writing.
3949000	3951000	And they are going to write the first book
3951000	3953000	by themselves in MATLAB.
3953000	3955000	In fact, I think the meeting is ugly.
3955000	3957000	That's what you're doing.
3957000	3959000	So I think there is
3959000	3961000	marketing potential.
3961000	3963000	I should tell the boss about this.
3963000	3965000	And science, in terms of science,
3965000	3967000	is actually interesting, I think.
3967000	3969000	I want to tell the boss about this.
3969000	3971000	I want to tell the boss about this.
3971000	3973000	And Bozun,
3973000	3975000	let me ask you again.
3975000	3977000	As long as you can see
3977000	3979000	all the regions,
3979000	3981000	you should be able to see which schools
3981000	3983000	use MATLAB, right?
3983000	3985000	Yes.
3985000	3987000	Do you have a proposal for
3987000	3989000	the education level or the income level?
3989000	3991000	No income.
3991000	3993000	But we have a division
3993000	3995000	for each school.
3995000	3997000	I want to say that the school itself is an income proxy.
3997000	3999000	It must be some library.
3999000	4001000	Yes.
4001000	4003000	But I haven't connected yet.
4003000	4005000	I haven't connected with the income in that area.
4005000	4007000	I propose that you can
4007000	4009000	take a look.
4009000	4011000	Because you have income data now.
4011000	4013000	You have similar income or education
4013000	4015000	level data.
4015000	4017000	You should be able to find it up there.
4017000	4019000	But don't give me homework, please.
4019000	4021000	OK.
4021000	4023000	In fact, if you have any
4023000	4025000	questions, I can't think of it now.
4025000	4027000	You can e-mail me.
4027000	4029000	Or you can find me on Facebook.
4029000	4031000	Then...
4031000	4033000	The small question I just wanted to ask is
4033000	4035000	that you said that
4035000	4037000	ROTH is between
4037000	4039000	the proposer and the responder.
4039000	4041000	You said that the variation comes from the
4041000	4043000	proposer, which is the ROTH hypothesis.
4043000	4045000	Does this hypothesis come from
4045000	4047000	the observation of its data or from
4047000	4049000	some theory?
4049000	4051000	It comes from the observation of its data.
4051000	4053000	Because there are only four
4053000	4055000	countries, and each country basically
4055000	4057000	compares the last round of data.
4057000	4059000	So you're talking about
4059000	4061000	comparing 100 data points.
4061000	4063000	So
4063000	4065000	for ROTH, it can't do
4065000	4067000	statistical analysis. It can only say
4067000	4069000	what the four distributions look like.
4069000	4071000	And what my observation looks like.
4071000	4073000	OK.
4077000	4079000	OK.
4079000	4081000	So are there any questions
4081000	4083000	from the audience?
4083000	4085000	Our speech time is
4085000	4087000	almost over.
4087000	4089000	Can you stay for a while?
4089000	4091000	I want to talk to you.
4091000	4093000	Sure.
4093000	4095000	OK.
4095000	4097000	That's all for today's speech.
4097000	4099000	Thank you, everyone.
4101000	4103000	Thank you.
4103000	4105000	Applause, please.
4105000	4107000	Thank you.
4107000	4109000	I'll pause the recording.
