00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome to the Terra Talks on September 8th.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's topic is Non-Verbal Applications of Hyperbolic Metamaterials.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We are honored to have Dr. Lin Hong-Yi, a Ph.D. student at NTU.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me briefly introduce Dr. Hong-Yi's background.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She is a non-verbal application of hyperbolic metamaterials.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
She is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
First, let me introduce what metamaterials are.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You may have heard of metamaterials before.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Some people even use the concept of positive reflection.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Some people even use the concept of positive reflection.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The direction I made is called Hyperbody Metamaterial.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It is a Metamaterial, another one of the branches.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is Hyperbody?

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hyperbody is the color curve.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Metamaterial color curve is like this.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You can see, like this, double-curve.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Up and down, or it is left and right.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you open up and down, it is Type I.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Type I like this.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The circle is basically a general material.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
My Hyperbody Metamaterial is this up and down, Type I or Type II.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How to achieve the color curve of this Type I material?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There are some simple ways.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Basically, there are two components.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The first one is metal, and the second one is a catalyst.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Metal is a metal nanofiber in a dielectric environment.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This metal nanofiber needs a regular arrangement.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If it is random, its color curve distribution will not be so uniform.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The distribution of Hyperbody.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So, like this metal nanofiber, it can be like a metal nanorod.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or a metal nanorod in a dielectric, like a polymer environment.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I have seen some people say that this is also the Hyperbody Metamaterial of Type I.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Another Type II Hyperbody Metamaterial is like this multi-layer film.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Multi-layer film is like a multi-layer film of metal and catalyst.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Convex structure.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then it needs a lot of pairs.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
About three or four pairs, five or six pairs or more.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course, I have seen some people do more than ten or twenty pairs.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In this case, the quality of the coating is very good.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Otherwise, the coating is not the distribution of Hyperbody Metamaterial.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Basically, HMM is called Hyperbody Metamaterial.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
HMM has these two structures.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I often do this kind of multi-layer film.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Because this is very simple.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We use thermal to coat.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Then coat some metal film and catalyst film.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is a cross-layer film.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There are other ways to achieve this kind of multi-layer structure.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I will also introduce this thing in addition today.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are the benefits of this HMM?

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What are the features?

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can see that this is its Wave Vector.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So it will have a lot of Wave Vector Modes in it.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What are the benefits of having a Wave Vector Mode?

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The biggest benefit is that its Density of State is very large.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can take a look at the Fermi's Golden Rule.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll just mention it a little bit.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Fermi's Golden Rule's Transition Rate is proportional to my Density of State.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The Density of State is also proportional to my Wave Vector.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So my Wave Vector Mode is very high.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My Density of State is large.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If the Density of State is large, it means that my Transition Rate is high.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What does Transition Rate mean?

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can take a look at it.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's like if my PO is a fluorescent molecule.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It can make my radiation more.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So if a fluorescent molecule is placed on top of my HMM, it will radiate more.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because it's in my Excited State.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Jump to Ground State.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It can store more energy.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So what it means is that it consumes less radiation.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because it stores more radiation.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Basically, we put some fluorescent molecules or fuels.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There will be a stronger trend on this HMM base.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's compare HMM with other materials.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What is the concept of HMM and other materials?

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What is the concept of HMM and other materials?

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Usually, we have some diagrams.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
For example, SL2 or TL2.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Its radiation curve is a very regular linear radiation curve.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Its Isofrequence Surface is like what you just saw.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a circle.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Its Density of State is like this.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not so much.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You can see this picture.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The phenomenon of Metal Directory is like...

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This base is the Directory.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I may have some metal nanoparticles on it.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You may have seen the enhancement of POSMONICS.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Gold particles or silver particles.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's because the interface of metal and solid electrons will have a very strong local field.

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This local field is called Surface POSMON Polariton.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This Surface POSMON can only be activated at a certain ray light and frequency.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So, like this metal or solid electrons.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Enhancement behavior on these large electrons.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is what we call Surface POSMON Polariton Enhancement.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The one on the far right is Metal Nanoparticle.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is a metal nanoparticle.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There will be different field enhancement behaviors after the light hits.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But this kind of field enhancement behavior also has a certain frequency.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Or a certain direction can trigger more energy.

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So this kind of enhancement behavior is also a kind of separation.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not a very broadband enhancement.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The reason why I chose HMM is like this.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The third column is because HMM has a lot of Density of State.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then different angles can also trigger different modalities.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So it can make my luminous molecules above.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Or other materials or dyes.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It hits the PL enhancement.

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PL is Photoluminescence Enhancement.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or hit the laser enhancement.

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All have a certain effect.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I will also introduce you a little bit in the following video.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is the basic concept of material.

132
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I listed a little bit about what HMM has to do.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
HMM has a High Wave Vector Mode.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So the light that comes into the factory can be transmitted to the original factory.

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Instead of the electromagnetic wave.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Instead of the evanescence field disappear.

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So HMM's early application is to do this.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Far Field Image.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
For example, the light that comes into the factory can be transmitted to the original factory.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Not like ordinary metal or other materials.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Decay at the front.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because the light can be transmitted in this multi-layer film.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So some people used to do waveguide.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have seen some people do some patterns on the multi-layer film.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then the pattern is retained.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is IN and this is OUT.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can be used as a biosensor.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then they put some detectors.

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then use the form of light.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can measure the change of different penetrations.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then come to a biosensor.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is published on Natural Material.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then there are people who use simulation to calculate.

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This kind of ring multi-layer film.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It can be INVISIBLE COAT.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
For example, the things inside me can be covered.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So I come in from here.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My scattering things go out from here.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The electromagnetic wave will not be affected at all.

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So some people use this concept to do INVISIBLE COAT.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But this concept is only at a certain frequency.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
May be at a certain frequency.

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Can achieve this INVISIBLE COAT behavior.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That may not work in a broadband.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So this is just a simulation result.

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have seen some people use this to say.

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This kind of HM energy can be transmitted inside.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So some people say this kind of HM structure.

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like this is a multi-layer film structure.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Then this is the NETWORK.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Plugged in the Type-1 structure.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It is said that it can be used as a light communication behavior.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because the energy can be transmitted inside.

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So they say this.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Maybe this can be used in the future.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is an optical transmission behavior.

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's look at the top here.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The top here is this year.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Cai Dingming Laboratory published on Advanced Material.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They use Pattern HM structure.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is a multi-layer film structure.

182
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then use FOX-3B to make Pattern.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can see this kind of tofu-like structure.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Then the top is Multicorner Well.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Then I use a short-wave 266 pumping laser to fight.

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Then there will be a long-wave 289.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
A long-wave 289 laser comes out.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That 289 is a Deep UV.

189
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So this thing is 266 Pump.

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Then 289 Lacing is a Deep UV laser.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The width is only about 2-3 nm.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The result of this HM Pattern.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It can also be regarded as an enhanced behavior of LED.

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This is published on Nano Energy.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It was also published by Cai Dingming Laboratory this year.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Because this HM has a large Density of State.

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So it can enhance this Light Matter Interaction.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So it can reach the enhancement of laser or LED.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In the early days, there were only two PL enhancements.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
PL enhancement is...

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is published on the Nature Nano Technology Shop in 2014.

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
For example, I patterned a multi-layer film structure.

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Then the top is mixed with some dye.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Like R6G or PMMA.

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Because the concept of PL enhancement is spontaneous radiation.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Spontaneous Emission.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This year is to achieve Stimulant Emission.

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is published by Cai Dingming Laboratory.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because of its high purity rate.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So this pattern structure, multi-layer film structure.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I saw someone use it as a color film emitter.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Basically, this is the application of HM.

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's quite a wide range.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not just a simple theoretical application.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So now, in addition to doing Biosensor and Laser.

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And PL enhancement.

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now more and more people.

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Will also use this HM to do different applications.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So now I see that the main thing is to publish this trend.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
How to design a good HM?

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Usually HM is with me.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because my HM multi-layer structure.

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's about the thickness of my metal and solder.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
First of all, let's take a look at what Feofixion is.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Feofixion is the thickness of metal.

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The thickness of metal is the thickness of metal and solder.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is the thickness of a pair.

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So different Feofixion.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
In different wavelengths, this is the wavelength.

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What you see is different.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is the fun part of HM.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If it's like this one, for example.

233
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Feofixion is at 0.5.

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Its short wavelength is Type 1.

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Type 1 is the color curve is up and down.

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Type 2 is left and right.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If Feofixion is a little less.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because Feofixion is less.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It means that the metal component is less.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The metal component is less.

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Overall, what it sees is a capacitance.

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So it's not HM.

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's elliptical metameter.

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Elliptical is elliptical.

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's like the general kind of material.

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We call it EMF.

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If the metal component is more.

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's a metal material compared to it.

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Not HM.

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So it's also a type of EMF.

251
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Does EMF have a lot of difference in optical measurement?

252
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sometimes it's a few times worse.

253
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is ACS Photonics.

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In 2007, it also measured some of Peo's enhancements.

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It also put the fuel molecule.

256
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
On my multi-layer HM board.

257
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You can see that on the HM board.

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Its enhancement is quite strong.

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It can be more than 1,000.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If it's on EMF, it's about 400.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So if it's the same multi-layer HM board.

262
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But my metal and fuel molecule thickness ratio is wrong.

263
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The behavior of my enhancement is much worse.

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This type of EMF will also enhance.

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The reason it will also enhance.

266
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Because it may be the enhancement of effective metal.

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That is to say, at least my board will reflect a little.

268
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So it will also enhance a little.

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But it's not as much as HM.

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is 2012's Photoscience.

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
EMF will have a longer lifetime.

272
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
HM will have a shorter lifetime.

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
For a fluorescent molecule.

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The longer the lifetime, the longer it will stay in the activation state.

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It will jump out.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It will jump to the ground state for a longer time.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
For example, if it jumps to the ground state for a longer time.

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It means it may be damaged by some other heat energy.

279
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So if I want to enhance PO.

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The shorter my lifetime, the better.

281
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That is to say, the shorter it stays in the activation state, the better.

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Then it can achieve a lot of PO enhancement purposes.

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So when we look at this kind of light-metal interaction.

284
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We all look at the first PO.

285
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is it enhanced?

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Second, does it have a shorter lifetime?

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That is usually the EMF's lifetime will be longer.

288
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Then its PO will be less.

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is the basic concept of light-metal interaction.

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm here with Mr. Chen Yongfang.

291
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Mainly do something called random laser.

292
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let me mention a little bit about what random is.

293
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sorry, I have a question.

294
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I guess you're going to talk more specifically about your lab.

295
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I want to ask a more out-of-the-box question.

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because I don't make materials.

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Basically, from the point of view of electronics.

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Now the focus of metal materials is on.

299
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
For example, you are now showing these hundreds of nanometers of wavelength.

300
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Because basically you have to have a wavelength.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Far greater than a field, a pair, right?

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So you are equal to the unequality of the material.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then it becomes that you can adjust it.

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Then let the light see an average effect.

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If I want to operate today.

306
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
For example, if it is a wave, I can.

307
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
For example, a layer is 100 nanometers.

308
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Then pass two or three layers.

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Will it have the same effect of metal material?

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I have seen this kind of thing at the beginning.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Their thickness is very thick.

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can see it with your eyes.

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This kind of multi-layer film.

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Unlike our film is more than 10, 20, 30 nanometers.

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Unless you have seen, for example, sub-micron.

316
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
100 nanometers or something.

317
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes, I have seen a very thick one.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Then it may not be the way to grind.

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because the grinding may be 1-2 nanometers at a time.

320
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Because they are all 1-second ENSO.

321
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
1 ENSO is 0.1 nanometer.

322
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If I want to do 1000 nanometers.

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Then you have to do a lot of pairs.

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That is to be very high-strength.

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Of course, I have seen someone like Weibo or Terahertz.

326
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Use the same concept to explain.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Then it will also have an effect.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Also have.

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Because it was in the early stage.

330
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Such a long wave.

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Now everyone is more interested in visible light.

332
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The structure of visible light multi-layer film is very small.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
OK.

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So there is still such a feature.

335
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I have a second question.

336
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The second question is.

337
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Your metal is basically operating at a constant temperature.

338
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So its skin depth is basically 1 over the square root of the wavelength.

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's right.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If today.

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
For example, the metal you grind up.

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It will become a super conductor at a very low temperature.

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That super conductor.

344
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Its skin depth is 1 over the length.

345
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Not.

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Wait a minute.

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
1 over the wavelength.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Anyway, it will not be the same.

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But it will have the same effect.

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If I want to operate at a very low temperature.

351
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There will also be the effect of metamaterial.

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I haven't seen this yet.

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But because.

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This may also be a good research direction.

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Right.

356
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Measure at a very low temperature.

357
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
See what will happen.

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I guess.

359
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It will be different in terms of brightness.

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But it should still have some effect in terms of straightness.

361
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because it is basically a skin depth.

362
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Here.

363
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Not sure.

364
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because standing at such a low temperature.

365
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The concept of super conductor.

366
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I remember this HMM.

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't think I've done this yet.

368
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Because it may be limited to experiments.

369
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I guess this low temperature is also the kind of ethyl chloride.

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Very low, very low temperature.

371
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I guess.

372
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
OK.

373
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I haven't seen this yet.

374
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But I guess it should be a good topic.

375
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
OK.

376
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Basically, this is the concept of my HMM.

377
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Then I will skip a little bit.

378
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Another topic is.

379
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Random laser.

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What is random laser?

381
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then we first introduce.

382
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What is a general laser?

383
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
General laser.

384
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I need a fixed rectifier.

385
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Then my quality.

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The quality must be very good.

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a game medium.

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
In a.

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
A.

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
A.

391
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
A.

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
In a rectifier.

393
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then when I pass the light inside.

394
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Back and forth.

395
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The round trip.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Uh.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Uh.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Propagate.

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When the gain is greater than the loss.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Will be from a certain direction.

401
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Specific frequency.

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Then.

403
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Lacing out.

404
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Then this is the general concept of laser.

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It can be applied to a lot of things like a laser pen.

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Visography.

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Cutting.

408
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And light.

409
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
A lot of surgery.

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This kind of.

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Behavior.

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
On the application.

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is the general concept of laser.

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What is it called?

415
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I am now mainly.

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Focus on.

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
HM.

418
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Combined.

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The concept of random laser.

420
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What is that random laser?

421
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Random laser.

422
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Also want this kind of game medium.

423
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Like ZMO.

424
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This.

425
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Very irregular.

426
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Uh.

427
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Nanoparticle.

428
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
In this.

429
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That.

430
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
In this environment.

431
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Then when I am very focused.

432
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Very.

433
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Uh.

434
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hit me this.

435
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
On top of the game medium.

436
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It will be here.

437
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A process of multiple scattering.

438
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Just like this.

439
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That is.

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Multiple scattering.

441
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When it comes to this kind of game.

442
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
When it's bigger than Rose.

443
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It will also be.

444
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Very.

445
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Very wide.

446
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
To reach a type.

447
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The level of laser.

448
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That kind of laser.

449
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Uh.

450
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Because it's this kind of random laser.

451
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So it's light.

452
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Will be inside.

453
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Scattering everywhere.

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So the direction it comes out.

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Is.

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Uh.

457
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
We call it both.

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Angular.

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Or.

460
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Angle free.

461
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This kind of emission.

462
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Unlike general laser.

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Only in a specific direction.

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Will come out.

465
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So he.

466
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We are this kind of random laser.

467
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a different angle.

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Can be lighted up.

469
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This kind of laser signal.

470
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So it's a little bit like the general laser.

471
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Not the same.

472
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's it.

473
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Uh.

474
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
General laser.

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
With random laser.

476
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Concept.

477
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That.

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What.

479
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That.

480
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Mechanism.

481
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The random laser.

482
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Is.

483
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's just like I just said.

484
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's me.

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
A pump laser.

486
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And then.

487
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Hit me this.

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
On top of the game medium.

489
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Then.

490
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
When it's bigger than Rose.

491
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So.

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
There will be a laser effect.

493
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Come out.

494
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That.

495
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We will say.

496
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is called.

497
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Cross loop.

498
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And then.

499
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Represents its light.

500
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
In some places.

501
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The game medium.

502
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Will.

503
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Be very strong.

504
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So he.

505
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The probability of getting bigger than Rose.

506
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Will be greater.

507
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So he.

508
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Can be received from different angles.

509
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That.

510
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We usually discuss with randomness.

511
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
When.

512
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We will discuss.

513
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Say he's a.

514
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Scattering.

515
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
One thing.

516
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That.

517
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Random laser.

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Signal.

519
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That.

520
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Random laser.

521
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Signal.

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Probably like this.

523
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is me.

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Peel.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I.

526
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Generally.

527
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If it's like.

528
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I.

529
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I hit it with a laser.

530
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Will get a peel.

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
A bag.

532
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
A bag of peel.

533
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Signal.

534
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That.

535
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
When I'm strengthening my power.

536
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will get.

537
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Amplify.

538
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Spontaneous emission.

539
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's like this green thing.

540
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That.

541
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm strengthening my power.

542
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I will get this.

543
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Random laser.

544
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Peak.

545
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is a typical.

546
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Random laser.

547
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Peak.

548
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's like this.

549
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The peak I measured with the next second.

550
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's a little bit different.

551
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Because he.

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The last second and the next second.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Light in there.

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Scattering everywhere.

555
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The process is different.

556
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That.

557
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Not all.

558
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The material.

559
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Will hit this.

560
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Random laser.

561
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That.

562
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Need.

563
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Like my material.

564
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Need to have a certain.

565
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Scattering things.

566
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Or scattering.

567
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He will hit this.

568
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Random laser.

569
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The.

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Peak out.

571
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That.

572
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The advantage of random laser.

573
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Is that I measure different angles.

574
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You can take a look.

575
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I might be 30 degrees.

576
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Or 45 degrees.

577
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Or 60 degrees.

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Different angles of light.

579
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I can get this.

580
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Random laser.

581
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Peak.

582
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Out.

583
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That.

584
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This kind of random laser.

585
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He has his own.

586
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Advantage.

587
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If applied to this kind of lighting.

588
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
He is from different angles.

589
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can have this.

590
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Very strong signal.

591
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And.

592
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Uh.

593
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And he's a very.

594
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Wide-angle behavior.

595
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's it.

596
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Uh.

597
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Typical.

598
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Random laser.

599
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
A feature.

600
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He's a board.

601
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Angle.

602
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Uh.

603
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Emission.

604
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That.

605
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
My first.

606
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The first thing I do is.

607
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Here is the combination of the teacher.

608
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
HMM.

609
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The board.

610
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There's this mess on it.

611
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This kind of.

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Uh.

613
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Zin-R-Side.

614
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Nanoparticle.

615
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
His size is very irregular.

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's maybe 50 nanometers.

617
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
To.

618
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Maybe.

619
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Two or three hundred nanometers.

620
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There are.

621
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So I use the green light.

622
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
If.

623
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm going to be in my.

624
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This.

625
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
ZMO nanoparticle.

626
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
A scattering process.

627
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Then.

628
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Will be different angles.

629
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Uh.

630
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Random laser.

631
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Out.

632
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That.

633
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You can.

634
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Right.

635
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I've seen it before.

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The first one.

637
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Uh.

638
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Cai Liming.

639
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's already been used.

640
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Uh.

641
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Payton.

642
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
HMM.

643
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Stemming emission.

644
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
He's a single.

645
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That.

646
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm using this.

647
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Uh.

648
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ZMO nanoparticle.

649
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
On the HMM board.

650
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
To achieve a random laser.

651
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Behavior.

652
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That.

653
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This is what I compared.

654
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Different.

655
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HMM sample.

656
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
There's my EMA sample.

657
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And my reference.

658
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Reference is.

659
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Control.

660
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Simple.

661
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That's ZMO nanoparticle.

662
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
On the general.

663
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Silicon.

664
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's his original.

665
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
ZMO nanoparticle.

666
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He's going to have some.

667
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Random laser.

668
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Peak.

669
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's what I want.

670
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Uh.

671
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Intensity.

672
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's going to be a little bit bigger.

673
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He's going to have.

674
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That.

675
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Power.

676
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
A little bit.

677
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He's just a general PL signal.

678
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That.

679
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
If I zoom in here.

680
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
He's just a general PL signal.

681
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That.

682
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
EMA sample.

683
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Uh.

684
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I designed this work.

685
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Two.

686
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Different.

687
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Multi-layer model ratio.

688
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
One is.

689
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
He's in this.

690
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
HMM.

691
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The other one is.

692
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He's in this.

693
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
EMF.

694
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You can also.

695
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You can see that he's in this.

696
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
When this wave section.

697
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
His brilliance.

698
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Stronger is a bit weaker.

699
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But he was in hours.

700
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Of this.

701
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
amp Wave.

702
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Of the word.

703
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Of his.

704
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Scare him.

705
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Lazys effect.

706
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Is very powerful.

707
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You can see this.

708
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
There's a lot of it.

709
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
This kind of prickles.

710
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Speak.

711
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The signal.

712
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That is.

713
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
La RES一樣不好就是也不重要

714
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's like this one.

715
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That.

716
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That.

717
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm in this design.

718
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
At.

719
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
AM.

720
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
This is just to.

721
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Task.

722
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm on this side.

723
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's at 45 degrees.

724
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Uh.

725
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Angle on both sides.

726
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That.

727
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You can see this intensity.

728
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
With.

729
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Uh.

730
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Power density is.

731
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Uh.

732
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Uh.

733
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Uh.

734
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Uh.

735
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Uh.

736
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Uh.

737
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Uh.

738
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Uh.

739
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Uh.

740
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Uh.

741
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh.

742
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Uh.

743
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Uh.

744
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Uh.

745
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Uh.

746
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Uh.

747
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Uh.

748
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Uh.

749
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Uh.

750
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Uh.

751
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Speak.

752
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
At.

753
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
AndPlayback.

754
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If it is probably, it doesn't matter.

755
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Uh.

756
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Speaker.

757
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What's going on?

758
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The force should not be heavy.

759
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Once under massage together.

760
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't want to fall every time.

761
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Uh.

762
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Uh.

763
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Uh.

764
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Come on those days.

765
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Power use guy.

766
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's all I'm saying wait.

767
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Don't get that.

768
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Just lazer.

769
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Speak.

770
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Scientist.

771
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
What's on Picachin night?

772
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
That doesn't sound like it's working.

773
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
There's my alligator.

774
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And that's how deep it is.

775
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That data is.

776
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You can see that I'm usually different.

777
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That.

778
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm different.

779
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Power.

780
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Uh.

781
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In the measurement test, my HM machine board.

782
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He's two.

783
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It.

784
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The enhancement is stronger than the men and the reference.

785
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That we can even see an additional.

786
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
What are you looking at?

787
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
There will even be a.

788
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The phenomenon of a child on the HMS board.

789
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That I'm a little bit.

790
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm going to use a little bit of simulation to explain why this thing is there.

791
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That.

792
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We have different angles of measurement.

793
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Maybe this is the color of the road.

794
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The angle of the road is 30 degrees.

795
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The other one is 60 degrees.

796
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That's basically what my HMS is.

797
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Enhancement will be stronger than others.

798
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's what this is.

799
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because it's a random laser.

800
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So I measured it in the last second.

801
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Emission stability.

802
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's going to be a distribution of the curve.

803
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
In other words, HMS.

804
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He may be from more than 800 to about 1100.

805
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That.

806
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
We measured it several times.

807
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's probably a.

808
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's kind of a stable.

809
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That.

810
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So, on behalf of me, this random laser.

811
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
This one.

812
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Zero nanoparticle.

813
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And my whole material.

814
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He won't because.

815
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Uh, the longer it takes.

816
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Uh, uh.

817
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So his, uh, intensity will drop.

818
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So it's basically a very stable emission process.

819
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That's what I'm going to do with a little bit of power.

820
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The laser to measure.

821
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He's going to have a P.O. signal.

822
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
That's why I'm going to use the stronger power to measure.

823
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
He's going to have a random laser.

824
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You can see his.

825
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Uh, I'm going to measure it with a 3G4 laser.

826
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
His.

827
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, the energy is.

828
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
More than 100 millijoules.

829
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's what I'm looking for.

830
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The energy is used.

831
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
More than 20 millijoules.

832
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

833
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
This is more than 100 microjoules.

834
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This is more than 20 millijoules.

835
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So he's a very large number.

836
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So I'm going to have to be stronger.

837
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm going to be able to get a random laser signal.

838
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So this is the behavior of measuring my life.

839
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So you can see that my HM machine.

840
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
My life is probably more than 2 nanoseconds.

841
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's going to be shorter than my EMM.

842
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The shorter the life.

843
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
His.

844
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Uh, uh.

845
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Uh.

846
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's going to be bigger.

847
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The resolution Ray will be bigger.

848
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's the shortest I can get.

849
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's easier to get a random laser behavior.

850
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So this is my FD numerical FDD.

851
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
A little run simulation.

852
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This is my input signal.

853
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I can take a look at my.

854
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This is where I put a ZN or NaN particle.

855
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This is my HM machine.

856
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Let's take a look at how he affects the overall.

857
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Uh, what's the effect of the barfield?

858
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
You can see my HM machine.

859
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
In this area, there is a relatively strong.

860
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
A strong barfield.

861
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That's a little bit weaker.

862
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is what I'm doing.

863
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
After a normalization.

864
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So you can see it clearly.

865
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If it's a real machine.

866
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
My ray beam will go under me.

867
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That's my HM machine.

868
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
He's going to my positive.

869
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
A very strong scattering phenomenon.

870
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So this is a very strong scattering phenomenon.

871
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It will also be conducive to my.

872
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
A random laser behavior.

873
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So this is the continuation of the simulation.

874
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
This is my original distribution map.

875
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So you can see my.

876
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
0 to 180 is my positive.

877
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
180 to 360 is.

878
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Go down.

879
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So you can see my HM machine.

880
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He's a lot more.

881
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's going to my original direction.

882
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Positive direction.

883
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's ZMO.

884
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's going to ZMO.

885
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So it's going to help me.

886
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
One of the ZMO.

887
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Uh, the scattering process.

888
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So this is me.

889
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I ran some simulations from different angles.

890
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So you can see my.

891
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Red is HM.

892
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The red HM.

893
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's basically stronger than the green EMM.

894
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Scattering is even stronger.

895
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The blue is my reference board.

896
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So I.

897
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because random laser.

898
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's a scattering process.

899
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So I did some math.

900
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Scattering efficiency.

901
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So first of all, I.

902
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I put a ZMO nanoparticle first.

903
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It may be a 40 nanometer radius.

904
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The height is 100 nanometers.

905
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Put it on my different HM board.

906
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Or EMM board.

907
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Or reference board.

908
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You can see my HM board.

909
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
His scattering efficiency.

910
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's going to be a lot higher than my EMM.

911
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's going to be a lot higher.

912
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And my HM board.

913
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
He's in.

914
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Especially in the 389 long-wave field.

915
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
This one will be more.

916
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So.

917
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I jumped back here to explain.

918
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Here.

919
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I have more long-wave fields.

920
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So.

921
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was thinking about this thing.

922
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
In addition, there will be a phenomenon of redness.

923
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's because my HM is on the long-wave field.

924
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's stronger.

925
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Scattering is more likely to result in.

926
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Of course I.

927
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I have a simulation.

928
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
ZMO nanoparticle.

929
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
If it's round.

930
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He's on different boards.

931
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
His scattering.

932
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The effect is probably like this.

933
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Of course.

934
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
With this ZMO nanoparticle.

935
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's hexagonal.

936
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It's a little bit like that.

937
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's just that the real situation is different.

938
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So this is my.

939
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
The distribution of the scattering curve of this HM.

940
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So you can see.

941
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I have this.

942
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
ZMO nanoparticle.

943
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The lacing place is probably in this area.

944
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Then I.

945
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm on this HM board.

946
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm set to be 300.

947
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
After 375 nanometers.

948
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's a.

949
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's a.

950
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hyperbody dispersion curve.

951
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So this kind of thing.

952
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He will be in.

953
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So my multi-layered board.

954
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
He can be in my ZMO nanoparticle.

955
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Lacing time.

956
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
There will be.

957
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
There will be a stronger lacing effect.

958
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then I.

959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
In addition, I ran some more.

960
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like Persil Factor.

961
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Persil Factor is.

962
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The value of Persil Factor is.

963
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have this thing with me.

964
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I have this dipole.

965
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
When ZMO shines.

966
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
In this environment.

967
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
With me in FreeSpace.

968
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
FreeSpace.

969
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's when you don't have this board.

970
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
To get along.

971
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Made a pen.

972
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Then you can see my HM.

973
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Especially in the long wave field.

974
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
38.

975
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The place of 390 will be longer.

976
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's with my EMM.

977
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It's going to be a little bit weaker in this place.

978
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
In fact, this.

979
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This multi-layered strengthening concept.

980
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He is a.

981
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
An action of exponential decay.

982
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
The black line is HMM.

983
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
That red is EMM.

984
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That.

985
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
If it's blue, it's Riffen.

986
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It's a line lying on the ground.

987
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Then you can see.

988
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
In fact, this kind of strengthening.

989
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You can see that this is.

990
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Uh.

991
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Within 50 nanometers.

992
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Within 50 nanometers.

993
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's probably.

994
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Uh.

995
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
For HMM.

996
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's about four times.

997
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's EMM.

998
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
EMM.

999
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's about twice.

1000
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That.

1001
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But if I put this whole thing together.

1002
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's an average.

1003
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
For HMM.

1004
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
HMM.

1005
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The proportion of enhanced.

1006
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Can be up to.

1007
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
More than 30 times.

1008
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But because he.

1009
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Enter the field.

1010
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The main.

1011
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The main.

1012
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The most enhanced contribution is still in the field.

1013
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That.

1014
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The original factory is about 50 nanometers.

1015
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
In terms of words.

1016
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
It's about four times.

1017
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But the previous few nanometers.

1018
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
It's very, very, very strong.

1019
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That I have calculated.

1020
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Denser loop state.

1021
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That his.

1022
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
The density.

1023
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Will be.

1024
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
In terms of HMM.

1025
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
His density.

1026
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's higher than EMM.

1027
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So he.

1028
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Can reach the optiogame.

1029
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Will be more.

1030
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That I have calculated.

1031
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
His decay rate.

1032
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Decay rate.

1033
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
In contrast to.

1034
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Lifetime.

1035
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So my lifetime is shorter.

1036
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
My decay rate is higher.

1037
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This means he's in.

1038
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Excited state.

1039
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Jump down.

1040
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Time.

1041
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Faster.

1042
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That's what decay rate means.

1043
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's what decay rate means.

1044
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
That's what decay rate means.

1045
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's what decay rate means.

1046
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That's what decay rate means.

1047
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's what decay rate means.

1048
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So.

1049
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That I have run for a while.

1050
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
For a while.

1051
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
That's what I'm getting at.

1052
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's.

1053
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's relatively new.

1054
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's what EMM does.

1055
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And that's what we're talking about.

1056
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's bigger.

1057
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
More about.

1058
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
With.

1059
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
VVV is the power factor.

1060
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There.

1061
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The power main quantity is coming.

1062
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Uh.

1063
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
If it's bigger.

1064
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Good for him.

1065
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The space was getting smaller.

1066
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Well.

1067
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Power machine causes.

1068
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
In other words.

1069
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The greater the power of the largest power plant.

1070
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The meaning is.

1071
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I.

1072
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
My light can be very strong.

1073
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Localize in my.

1074
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
HMM.

1075
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Near the zeo nanoparticle.

1076
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's not like EMM.

1077
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Or reference board.

1078
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's harder to get my light.

1079
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Uh.

1080
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
In the local unit area.

1081
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's going to be stronger.

1082
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So.

1083
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The less I touch you.

1084
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The smaller.

1085
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The stronger I get.

1086
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Because the smaller the touch.

1087
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The bigger my Perseverance is.

1088
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So this is also a.

1089
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's also a concept that can be explained to each other.

1090
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Uh.

1091
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Then I.

1092
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This thing.

1093
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
The following.

1094
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Is.

1095
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I can look at me.

1096
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I looked at my TV.

1097
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
In my EMM.

1098
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
On top of my HMM.

1099
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's going to be a little longer.

1100
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And the strength of the resonance is going to be longer.

1101
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This is after I've normalized it.

1102
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So you can see a clear comparison.

1103
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's what it is.

1104
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's gone in a second.

1105
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
EMM.

1106
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's also going to be a resonance.

1107
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But it's gone in a second.

1108
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This time scale is.

1109
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
The level of Phenosecond.

1110
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And then HMM.

1111
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Its resonance strength.

1112
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Of course, it's going to be better than the other.

1113
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Uh.

1114
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The other two are basically stronger.

1115
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This is.

1116
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
This is.

1117
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
One of mine.

1118
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The first work in the PhD class.

1119
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's the concept of Random Laser Combined HMM.

1120
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That was accepted by ACS Photon at the end of last year.

1121
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
That's what we saw this year.

1122
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So if you're interested.

1123
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You can take a look at this one.

1124
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And the above.

1125
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The above data are all in.

1126
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
On this work.

1127
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So this is my.

1128
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The first work of the PhD class.

1129
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So I'm the first one.

1130
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's the first one.

1131
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's the first one.

1132
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Combine HMM and Random Laser.

1133
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Concept.

1134
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And then to achieve a.

1135
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Lacing enhanced.

1136
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Random Lacing enhanced behavior.

1137
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So let me just sum up my work.

1138
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So my work is a little bit.

1139
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's a little bit new.

1140
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Because he's.

1141
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
We're using the first one to use HMM.

1142
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Random Laser Concept.

1143
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Then we'll think it's interesting.

1144
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's because we can enhance.

1145
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Random Laser Peak.

1146
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And then our measurement came out.

1147
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Lifetime is short again.

1148
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Then we'll think this is a very.

1149
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
A very useful concept.

1150
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Because we can.

1151
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Reduce the Lacing demand.

1152
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And then this.

1153
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Concept.

1154
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
This Random Laser is a board.

1155
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Angular emission.

1156
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Just like me.

1157
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
This is what I showed you a long time ago.

1158
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
The work.

1159
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, basically, this is my PhD.

1160
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The first one.

1161
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I.

1162
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Combine HMM and Random Laser.

1163
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So I'm going to give you a little bit of an introduction.

1164
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We have other in our lab.

1165
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Random Laser.

1166
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
In this year.

1167
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
The article published.

1168
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So this is a few months ago.

1169
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
In.

1170
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It should be last month.

1171
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Or the last month.

1172
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Advanced Optical Material.

1173
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Accept.

1174
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It looks like.

1175
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Work.

1176
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
He's a.

1177
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
One of our labs.

1178
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
After a PhD.

1179
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
That's what he's doing now.

1180
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Change to two teachers.

1181
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Two labs to continue.

1182
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Continue to finish this work.

1183
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
That's it.

1184
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Finished.

1185
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Published.

1186
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's his concept.

1187
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It's also very simple.

1188
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That is.

1189
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They are using PurpleSky.

1190
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And then use the combined.

1191
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Graphene Nanowall.

1192
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Graphene Nanowall.

1193
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And then sprinkle some.

1194
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like silver granite.

1195
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
As a scattering.

1196
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So why do this?

1197
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The graphene that stands up.

1198
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's because of my light.

1199
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's even more scattering inside.

1200
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's a three-dimensional structure.

1201
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then you can get to.

1202
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And then you can get to.

1203
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
A very low level of laser.

1204
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
A very low level of laser.

1205
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
A very low level of laser.

1206
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So you can see.

1207
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
This is in.

1208
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Nanogel.

1209
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You can even get to the laser.

1210
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Because I'm using the graphene that stands up.

1211
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
The concept of three-dimensional.

1212
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Random Laser.

1213
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Random Laser.

1214
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So you can see.

1215
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
This is a lot of peaks.

1216
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
This is a.

1217
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This is some random CIs this year.

1218
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Random Laser Peaks.

1219
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Random Laser Peaks.

1220
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What about last month?

1221
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This is a covered paper.

1222
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What about last month?

1223
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
This is a covered paper.

1224
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Then this is another one we have in the laboratory.

1225
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
This is another one we have in the laboratory.

1226
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
An article recently published.

1227
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
An article recently published.

1228
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This article was taken last year.

1229
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This article was taken last year.

1230
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,800
Last year the end was accepted to publish

1231
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
In scientiFLEport.

1232
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
This article is also a very simple concept.

1233
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We put three RGBs.

1234
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Different materials.

1235
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And then the laser meets in the middle.

1236
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So it will hit a white laser.

1237
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Then I put down the YouTube video.

1238
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Then I put down the YouTube video.

1239
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What is the situation when measuring?

1240
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So when the RED light hits

1241
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
The middle piece will hit a white light.

1242
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
The middle piece will hit a white light.

1243
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Random Laser Peak.

1244
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Put another one.

1245
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So it's like this.

1246
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
The middle is white light.

1247
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If the focus is here.

1248
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's green and blue mixed out.

1249
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
If the focus is here.

1250
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's red and green mixed out.

1251
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
What is the selling point of this concept?

1252
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
If I want to make a lot of pixel.

1253
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If I want to make a lot of pixel.

1254
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Overall, it's a white light.

1255
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Overall, it's a white light.

1256
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Random laser.

1257
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Then we just mix the demo RGB first.

1258
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Mixed into this shape.

1259
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Then hit the middle.

1260
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It is also a white light signal.

1261
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
This is the laser peak on both sides.

1262
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
If I turn on the power,

1263
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Of course, my RGB peaks will be displayed.

1264
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
If we mix out the CIE image.

1265
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You can see that it is very, very close to the white light.

1266
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You can see that it is very, very close to the white light.

1267
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This one is also a good one.

1268
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This one is also a good one.

1269
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
In fact, I have another topic for today's report.

1270
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
This is my HMM.

1271
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
This is my HMM.

1272
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
To combine the concept of up-switching.

1273
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
In fact, because I will introduce first.

1274
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What is the concept of up-switching?

1275
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The concept of up-switching energy is.

1276
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
My YB nanoparticle.

1277
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
My YB nanoparticle.

1278
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It may have a lot of different chemical elements.

1279
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It may have a lot of different chemical elements.

1280
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Like my YB.

1281
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
To absorb the long-wave field.

1282
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Like 980.

1283
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We usually use 980 or 8080.

1284
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We usually use 980.

1285
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So after YB absorbs 980.

1286
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It will give the energy to other materials.

1287
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The other materials are absorbed several times.

1288
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
After YB gives the long-wave field energy.

1289
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It will jump out in a relatively short-wave form.

1290
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Because the short-wave field is more powerful.

1291
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The long-wave field is less energy.

1292
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So this energy transfer process is called up-switching.

1293
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Because in general.

1294
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The PL or type on both sides are down-switching.

1295
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Down-switching is that I give a short-wave field.

1296
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The short-wave field means that the energy is more powerful.

1297
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The short-wave field is like 266 laser.

1298
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Hit my ZMO.

1299
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It releases 388.

1300
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
About 388.

1301
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The up-switching is.

1302
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Hit 980 and put the visible light.

1303
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
4500, 300 can be.

1304
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It depends on the ratio of my friction.

1305
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Basically, the up-switching nanoparticle is.

1306
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Different friction ratios.

1307
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I just hit 980.

1308
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Of course, this is the paper of others.

1309
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Just hit 980.

1310
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I can see different colors.

1311
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The signal of different colors comes out.

1312
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So this up-switching nanoparticle.

1313
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Everyone is.

1314
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It will look like this.

1315
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
These are all TM photos.

1316
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Between different layers.

1317
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because I need different.

1318
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
A distinction between different elements.

1319
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So if you synthesize different dyes.

1320
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I need to connect with different ligands.

1321
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So that my different elements.

1322
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It will be very close together.

1323
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Basically, this is a concept of up-switching.

1324
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This is the light of 980.

1325
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Put visible light.

1326
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
In fact, my work.

1327
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The work I focused on today is also this one.

1328
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But because of this work.

1329
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
This work is still under review.

1330
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
In ACS content.

1331
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I am a co-author with an Indian doctor.

1332
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
In fact, I thought this work.

1333
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Can be accepted in my report today.

1334
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
But now it's the second time.

1335
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So wait a minute.

1336
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Because our first reviewer.

1337
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
There are four reviewers on the first floor.

1338
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Later on the first floor.

1339
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
When we revised.

1340
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The editor sent it to reviewer 4.

1341
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Reviewer 4.

1342
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
He said we answered all the questions.

1343
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But he suggested that we turn to Advanced Material.

1344
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So the editor is looking for the fifth reviewer.

1345
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
We are now replying to the fifth reviewer's questions.

1346
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So wait for it to be accepted later.

1347
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'll show it to you again.

1348
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Basically, this work is still under review in ACS content.

1349
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
In fact, the concept of this work is very simple.

1350
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So I didn't show my Lacing Peak today.

1351
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Then I'll talk a little bit about it.

1352
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
How did I do this work?

1353
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Also, I need a multi-layer model.

1354
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Then put on top of it.

1355
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Upgraded Nanoparticle.

1356
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Then the upgraded Nanoparticle.

1357
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He himself has to have RGB light.

1358
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Then we actually want this work.

1359
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I want to get a white laser thing out.

1360
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Then we actually have three designs.

1361
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
HM board.

1362
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Put it in the same way.

1363
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Upgraded material.

1364
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
That simple upgrade.

1365
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
He would have his own RGB light.

1366
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But he would be more blue light here.

1367
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
For example, blue light and red light here.

1368
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
If I want to hit the white light.

1369
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I need to go up.

1370
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I need a little bit more green.

1371
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Then I designed different boards.

1372
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The closest to the HM1 board.

1373
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
HM1 is already very, very close.

1374
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This 0.333 0.333 place.

1375
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Because 0.333 0.333 is a pure white place.

1376
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Because it hasn't been accepted yet today.

1377
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So I didn't show the data.

1378
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
The upgrade mechanism is the same as mine.

1379
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
As I said in the last video.

1380
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I need a YB.

1381
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Need different.

1382
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Can put out RGB.

1383
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
These three kinds of dye.

1384
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
This kind of material.

1385
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Then my upgrade is to ask.

1386
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Taiwan Chemicals.

1387
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
YT-TEN laboratory cooperation.

1388
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That is also looking for a doctor in India.

1389
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Chen Yichong laboratory.

1390
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Then there are ER, TM, and EU.

1391
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
All three will put RGB.

1392
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's hard to get a white light through synthesis.

1393
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It's hard because this kind of jumping process.

1394
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's all a nonlinear.

1395
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Assuming that my green light is already weaker.

1396
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I want to enhance my green light behavior.

1397
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Once I can enhance my green light.

1398
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I may eat other light.

1399
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
A thing that eats other light.

1400
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That synthesis is also not an easy thing.

1401
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But as long as we use this kind of HM1.

1402
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
This kind of basic enhancement.

1403
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It can be very, very close to white light.

1404
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That kind of HM1.

1405
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You can see that this is my Perseverance simulation.

1406
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
HM1, then there will be more places to enhance the green light.

1407
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Compared with other HM2 or HM3 places.

1408
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So I combine this top conversion.

1409
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And HM.

1410
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I can make my green light stronger.

1411
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Then it's very, very close to white light.

1412
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
This is my other work.

1413
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
With an Indian.

1414
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Now in ACS Neo.

1415
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I'll have a chance to show it to you later.

1416
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But I want to say.

1417
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Since it's not convenient to show too much information to everyone.

1418
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'll show you another one.

1419
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
This is a topic that the doctoral class has already published.

1420
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
In fact, this is also last summer.

1421
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
At this time.

1422
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
With a student in the math class.

1423
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
The topic that came to mind in Xiaofu.

1424
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Because the math class is mainly to do.

1425
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Tension.

1426
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
This kind of flexible thing.

1427
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The photo detector.

1428
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Tension.

1429
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
There is also a flexible photo detector.

1430
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
On the base of Kerala.

1431
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Then I was wondering if I could use this concept.

1432
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
To do my one.

1433
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
This is the concept of the novel HM.

1434
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
This HM.

1435
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I did it last summer.

1436
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I did it for two or three months.

1437
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Then I wrote it.

1438
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Then I went to the scientific report.

1439
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Do you still remember?

1440
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
This is my HM.

1441
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I need a metal and a lithium-ion base.

1442
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
A multi-layer.

1443
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
This is very simple for me.

1444
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I use gold and PVA.

1445
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
As a base.

1446
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
HM's base.

1447
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
My PVA.

1448
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's also a polymer.

1449
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Its detection rate is 1.5.

1450
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Like.

1451
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Just like the general material.

1452
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's just the advantage of PVA.

1453
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It is durable.

1454
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The first one.

1455
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It can be melted.

1456
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
For example, if it is put in water.

1457
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It will melt.

1458
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So we want to say.

1459
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Can you do a tension.

1460
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There is also a flexible HM.

1461
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That's it.

1462
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
This is what I have done.

1463
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Materials.

1464
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I do four pairs.

1465
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Because in fact, every pair.

1466
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I need to grind once.

1467
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Then break the cavity.

1468
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Spin coating again.

1469
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So in fact.

1470
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
After a lot of pairs.

1471
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
This material is not easy to do.

1472
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This is the material I just finished.

1473
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Put it in the water.

1474
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Then after 1.5 hours.

1475
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's gone.

1476
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So I.

1477
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Tension HM.

1478
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
This thing is flexible again.

1479
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Published this year's scientific report.

1480
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
This topic is actually.

1481
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Last year, with a math class.

1482
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Studied together.

1483
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Why do tension?

1484
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because tension.

1485
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
In the early days.

1486
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
A few years ago.

1487
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
At that time.

1488
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It was also very fierce.

1489
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Especially in 2012.

1490
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
This piece of science.

1491
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Is tension electronics.

1492
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Is this kind of.

1493
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Electronics.

1494
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Its material is made of like coal.

1495
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The coal melts in the water.

1496
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The coal is melted in the water.

1497
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So you can see this.

1498
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Tension electronics.

1499
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Is my one-time.

1500
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Or short-term use.

1501
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
After using it, throw it away.

1502
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That.

1503
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I see.

1504
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I see their old paper.

1505
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The introduction says.

1506
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
This can be used in the future.

1507
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Some military use.

1508
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
For example, after I use it.

1509
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't want to take it away.

1510
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Or what?

1511
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Just throw it on the ground.

1512
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Solved.

1513
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That kind of thing.

1514
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Because it can be melted by water.

1515
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That.

1516
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I see some people are using.

1517
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
In vivo.

1518
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
In vivo.

1519
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
In vivo.

1520
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
The experiment.

1521
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
He.

1522
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
He can point it at me.

1523
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
One.

1524
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
A human body or machine.

1525
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Uh.

1526
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Inside the organ.

1527
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Then measure.

1528
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
After the test.

1529
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I don't have to open it again.

1530
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Until I take this material out.

1531
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
He.

1532
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
In this material.

1533
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
In this environment.

1534
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
In the biological body.

1535
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It will disappear on its own.

1536
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So this is the concept of tension electronics.

1537
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Concept of tension optics.

1538
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That.

1539
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The concept of horizontal optics.

1540
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
We first issued one in hs-nano last year.

1541
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
He is very simple here.

1542
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
That's.

1543
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Disori balalasporsp.

1544
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Publicity.

1545
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Also, we use.

1546
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
We do this with the topic.

1547
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We use PVA.

1548
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
PVA is.

1549
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Shh.

1550
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Soil melt.

1551
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Ah.

1552
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Is the magnification is 1.

1553
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Then we mix it with PBA.

1554
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Anyway, there are other problems.

1555
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Zn or nanoparticle.

1556
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
There are other.

1557
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Uh.

1558
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Tl2 nanoparticle.

1559
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Then measure the light.

1560
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Then this.

1561
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This device to measure the light.

1562
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
The.

1563
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The data.

1564
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
After that, this thing.

1565
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You can melt it.

1566
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
That's basically the concept of this spring.

1567
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Spring concept.

1568
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That we.

1569
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Last year, we put it together first.

1570
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Uh.

1571
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
This kind of random laser.

1572
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Then I told the teacher class.

1573
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The junior thought.

1574
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Can you.

1575
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Do a spring.

1576
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Spring spring HMM out.

1577
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
This is my ASEAN photo.

1578
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Corsasia ASEAN photo.

1579
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I designed a different HMM sample.

1580
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
The first one is HMM1.

1581
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
HMM1 is gold and PVA.

1582
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Is 25 and 42 nanometers.

1583
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
That gold.

1584
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's because PVA.

1585
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
This is more difficult.

1586
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Is that he needs to test his parameters.

1587
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So we're testing out about four different speeds.

1588
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Can reach 42 or 49 nanometers.

1589
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Then I can design different HMM.

1590
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
The color curve.

1591
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
The sample comes out.

1592
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Then we do four pairs.

1593
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Then you can see this HMM1.

1594
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's a different wavelength.

1595
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's also this kind of hyperbolic dispersion.

1596
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That HMM2.

1597
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It's HMM in different wavelengths.

1598
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Then he is also EMM.

1599
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
This is EMM.

1600
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So his PL is in this 530.

1601
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
He will be weaker.

1602
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Then we have this kind of HMM.

1603
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Sample to measure different fuels.

1604
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then you can find HMM1.

1605
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
In different fuels.

1606
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Because HMM1 is in this place.

1607
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
He belongs to me.

1608
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
He's stronger.

1609
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Will HMM be a little weaker?

1610
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Then you can see this HMM.

1611
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's basically weaker than reference.

1612
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So my HMM concept.

1613
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I use it here.

1614
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Lifetime.

1615
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
For Lifetime.

1616
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's also a relatively short trend.

1617
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Of course, I also calculated the Skeleton cross-section.

1618
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Then I also calculated.

1619
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I have different wavelengths.

1620
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Perceived effect enhancement behavior.

1621
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Of course, the closer to the base.

1622
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
My enhancement ratio will be larger.

1623
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
The farther he will be weaker.

1624
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
That.

1625
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
This is a little demo.

1626
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I'm in this trend HMM.

1627
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
In different like silicon base.

1628
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Then the other is like glass glass base.

1629
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
He put it in the water.

1630
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
He will melt the same.

1631
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
In fact, you can see.

1632
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
After putting it in the water for five minutes.

1633
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
He will be a little bit broken.

1634
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
After 1.5 hours.

1635
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
His material will be melted in the water.

1636
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Just like this.

1637
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Next to the water.

1638
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's the kind of metal that's broken.

1639
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
That kind of metal.

1640
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The components come out like this.

1641
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Of course, we have.

1642
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Demo some of his work.

1643
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Or on the PET base.

1644
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Then he can even stick it on his hand.

1645
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
As a bending.

1646
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Then we even want to say in the future.

1647
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
This concept can be combined.

1648
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
That smart phone.

1649
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
For the future to do this.

1650
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Lens may be helpful.

1651
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
That's just a demo of this concept.

1652
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Then we also did some bending test.

1653
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
That's on a different bending base.

1654
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
He can also measure a.

1655
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Strengthening behavior.

1656
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Uh, it's not like that.

1657
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
He still has a certain.

1658
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
PL signal out.

1659
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That's Fred.

1660
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Of course, it will be stronger.

1661
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That's in different bending radius.

1662
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
This is the signal we measured.

1663
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That.

1664
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That.

1665
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
This kind of polymer-made.

1666
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
What are the benefits of HM?

1667
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
It's that he can bend.

1668
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
That's not like the usual SL2.

1669
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Or what?

1670
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Uh, pick a rabbit.

1671
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
If it's an electrolyte.

1672
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
He could bend a few times.

1673
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's broken.

1674
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's not a good mold.

1675
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That.

1676
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
This is our bending cycle.

1677
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
This is a motor that looks like a four-wheel drive.

1678
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Give him one.

1679
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Go on.

1680
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Give him a bending.

1681
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
That.

1682
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
After a few thousand times of bending.

1683
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
He.

1684
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
His PL signal still exists.

1685
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So we feel like this kind of polymer-based.

1686
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Uh, HM.

1687
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
He's a future.

1688
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Maybe in Flexible Electronics.

1689
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Or Flexible Optics.

1690
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It's also one of the moves.

1691
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That's what we did before.

1692
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
He can do this thing.

1693
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That.

1694
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
That.

1695
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I.

1696
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
This is.

1697
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I proved that he could.

1698
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
That is.

1699
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Uh, put it in the water for five minutes.

1700
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And then take out the sample.

1701
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Blow dry.

1702
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
After taking it out and drying it.

1703
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And then the first dye.

1704
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Five minutes later.

1705
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
He's actually going to be DK.

1706
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Because the general R6G.

1707
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
His enhancement is about 100.

1708
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
More than 100.

1709
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
More than 100.

1710
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So strong.

1711
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
That.

1712
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Soak for 30 minutes.

1713
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Take it out in 30 minutes.

1714
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Two more PO.

1715
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
He's a little bit weaker.

1716
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
He's a lot weaker.

1717
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Okay, so I'm going to conclude a little bit.

1718
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Uh, I'm just going to conclude a little bit.

1719
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
This is.

1720
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
This is.

1721
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It's the first one to make spring.

1722
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And then again.

1723
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Flexible HM.

1724
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Then he is.

1725
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Polymer.

1726
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
The main material.

1727
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That.

1728
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We'll find it interesting.

1729
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Because he.

1730
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It still retains the HM.

1731
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The general kind of metal.

1732
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
The characteristics of the metal film.

1733
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That.

1734
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This kind of thing.

1735
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's kind of interesting.

1736
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Because he might have used it.

1737
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
After a while.

1738
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It's still there.

1739
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
It's still there.

1740
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's still there.

1741
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It's still there.

1742
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's still there.

1743
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Maybe it will melt after a while.

1744
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
That's the future.

1745
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
First of all.

1746
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah.

1747
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Environmental friendly.

1748
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
One concept.

1749
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Then he can also retain.

1750
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
If there is any.

1751
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Data in there.

1752
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
He can.

1753
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Uh, go away.

1754
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
ERS4201

1755
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
That's the CONCLSIR stream.

1756
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's a flexible.

1757
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The conception of optoelectron.

1758
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
That's the relationship.

1759
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So we.

1760
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Would you think this is a good job for the future.

1761
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I see a lot of things.

1762
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
A group like Stanford.

1763
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Someone calling ESKEET electronic feat.

1764
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Then we're going to do this maybe.

1765
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
In the future, we can do electron.

1766
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Optical electronic skin.

1767
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
An application.

1768
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Then this work.

1769
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Just a little demo.

1770
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
This concept.

1771
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So this work.

1772
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It actually took about 30.

1773
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Later.

1774
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Uh.

1775
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
It took about two or three months.

1776
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's over.

1777
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Because in fact, this time.

1778
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It's all very simple.

1779
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Then we're going to measure.

1780
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
P2 enhance.

1781
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Then melt.

1782
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Bending.

1783
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So this work.

1784
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's almost like this.

1785
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Hey.

1786
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That's basically my work.

1787
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's probably like this.

1788
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Let's see what's wrong with everyone.

1789
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
That's our lab.

1790
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
This was taken last year.

1791
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Then we are actually a very large team.

1792
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
The teacher is here.

1793
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Then there are other Indians.

1794
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Then we will cooperate with other labs.

1795
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Mainly like this.

1796
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Because.

1797
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I'm sorry.

1798
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Because this time I didn't introduce too much.

1799
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
My.

1800
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
This work.

1801
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Because this work is still under review.

1802
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So I'll just show you a little bit.

1803
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
How did we achieve this concept?

1804
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And then the next one.

1805
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
My question is.

1806
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That's it.

1807
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
He is.

1808
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
You put it in a flexible.

1809
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
It's kind of like a substrate.

1810
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Anyway, it's a flexible film.

1811
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
PET or something, right?

1812
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
That's right.

1813
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
You have a concept.

1814
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Your response.

1815
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
How sensitive is the deformation of this film?

1816
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You mean the deformation?

1817
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Correct.

1818
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
In fact.

1819
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Uh.

1820
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Wait a minute.

1821
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Let me see.

1822
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
In fact, if it is.

1823
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Let me see you like this.

1824
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Let's say it's like this.

1825
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Suppose he's in a bend.

1826
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
He might have some angles.

1827
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's not H.

1828
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
M.

1829
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Some angles.

1830
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Because my concept of H.

1831
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
M.

1832
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
To be in.

1833
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Uh.

1834
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Specific direction.

1835
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Specific frequency.

1836
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
If he bends.

1837
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
He might not be H.

1838
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
M.

1839
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
As for how to bend.

1840
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Uh.

1841
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm not going to prove this thing.

1842
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Correct.

1843
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Because like this bending.

1844
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
If you measure the side.

1845
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
We are bending.

1846
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
When the surface.

1847
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Measure the signal above.

1848
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
How is it?

1849
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
See if this thing will be.

1850
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Because of the process of bending.

1851
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
And affect.

1852
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
My light.

1853
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Come out.

1854
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It looks okay.

1855
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But if I bend.

1856
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Like this.

1857
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Because what I think of is.

1858
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That is.

1859
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You are equal to.

1860
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's kind of like.

1861
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Just to prove that he said.

1862
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You bend.

1863
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Do 500 times.

1864
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
1000 times.

1865
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
3000 times.

1866
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And then put it back.

1867
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
He will have the effect.

1868
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So he can.

1869
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
He can bear it.

1870
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Such.

1871
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Is bending.

1872
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But.

1873
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
What I think of is.

1874
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
For example.

1875
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
If you take this thing.

1876
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Can replace.

1877
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
For example.

1878
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Like a pressure material.

1879
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Or.

1880
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Like that.

1881
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
That kind of thing.

1882
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You can become.

1883
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Super sensitive.

1884
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
The pressure.

1885
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Pressure sensor.

1886
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Or.

1887
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
The change of the sensor.

1888
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Uh.

1889
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I think maybe.

1890
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Just.

1891
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It depends on you.

1892
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Because you are doing light.

1893
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So.

1894
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Your sensitivity.

1895
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
To change.

1896
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Just like you just said.

1897
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Maybe a little bit of deformation.

1898
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
He.

1899
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Uh.

1900
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
He didn't have that effect in an instant.

1901
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Then you know he's deformed.

1902
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You know what I mean.

1903
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Then if you choose.

1904
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
More correct.

1905
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
For example.

1906
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Your substrate.

1907
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
The material.

1908
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Let him.

1909
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Hardness.

1910
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Just.

1911
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
That.

1912
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It's equal to.

1913
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Hardness is high enough.

1914
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Then he won't deform so much.

1915
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
You may be able to slightly increase your.

1916
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Dynamic.

1917
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Is that you can measure things.

1918
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Dynamic window.

1919
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Then you.

1920
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You can become a super sensitive.

1921
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The shape of the sensor.

1922
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I think.

1923
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
I guess.

1924
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't know.

1925
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It must be calculated.

1926
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Correct.

1927
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Oh.

1928
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
OK.

1929
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Because this is also a direction.

1930
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Correct.

1931
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Just combine this.

1932
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
My this.

1933
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Flexible concept.

1934
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
To combine.

1935
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
This kind of.

1936
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Uh.

1937
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Uh.

1938
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Uh.

1939
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Uh.

1940
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Uh.

1941
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
The software.

1942
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
The whole thing.

1943
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So I'm going to combine the concept.

1944
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Uh.

1945
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It's piezo.

1946
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
This.

1947
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
incidence of kind of concept.

1948
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah.

1949
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Okay, so.

1950
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Basically, this.

1951
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I will introduce you to my previous ones.

1952
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And this one.

1953
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
PH.

1954
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
verbs.

1955
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Back to a Louis bonneture.

1956
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
9889,

1957
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
says,

1958
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Yeah.

1959
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Then.

1960
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
What are the other questions?

1961
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Questions.

1962
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I am.

1963
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Comment.

1964
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That word.

1965
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
That worrit.

1966
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Then, later.

1967
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'll tell you about it again if I have a chance.

1968
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Because we.

1969
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We actually have more.

1970
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Do other.

1971
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
White laser.

1972
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Come out.

1973
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Then this is still on both sides.

1974
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Then we have a work.

1975
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Will be this.

1976
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The surface is still.

1977
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
We think it's still cool.

1978
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
The structure.

1979
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Then this is still on both sides.

1980
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yeah.

1981
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Tomorrow will be on both sides.

1982
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah.

1983
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And it is expected to be white light.

1984
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Then.

1985
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
What else do you have?

1986
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Questions.

1987
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I have a question.

1988
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Or.

1989
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yo, yo, yo.

1990
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Uh.

1991
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Just.

1992
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I want to ask.

1993
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Is.

1994
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Generally put a.

1995
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Is.

1996
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Something that glows.

1997
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Put it on.

1998
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Metal surface.

1999
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It was.

2000
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Will be coupled to.

2001
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Surface plasma.

2002
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Oh, right.

2003
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Then.

2004
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Its.

2005
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Decay rate.

2006
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Will be faster.

2007
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That's right.

2008
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Is.

2009
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
How do you make sure.

2010
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Is.

2011
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Uh.

2012
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Because.

2013
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Because your material.

2014
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The top is also a layer of gold.

2015
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Metal.

2016
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
How do you make sure.

2017
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That is.

2018
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
That is.

2019
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
That is.

2020
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That is.

2021
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
How do you make sure.

2022
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
That is.

2023
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Not because of this reason.

2024
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
But because it has.

2025
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
HMM.

2026
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
What caused it.

2027
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
In fact.

2028
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Like doing this experiment.

2029
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
We will.

2030
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
With.

2031
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Simple.

2032
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
The same thickness.

2033
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Mirror.

2034
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Like gold.

2035
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
To compare.

2036
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
That.

2037
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You can.

2038
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
If it is gold.

2039
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It is.

2040
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Where it is strong.

2041
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It won't be like HMM.

2042
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It is a.

2043
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Boehming.

2044
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That.

2045
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I have seen.

2046
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
If I.

2047
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
If I use the same thickness of metal.

2048
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Count.

2049
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
In this case.

2050
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Then strengthen.

2051
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
If it is possible.

2052
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's like this.

2053
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It's a very strong.

2054
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
A rumor.

2055
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's in other waves.

2056
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Zengqian.

2057
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Just no.

2058
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
It's not as strong as HMM.

2059
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So of course it's right.

2060
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Like Xu Yang.

2061
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You just said.

2062
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
It mirrors.

2063
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Gold.

2064
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
The general metal.

2065
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Neutron.

2066
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It's also a strength.

2067
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But if I want to do one.

2068
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Boehm.

2069
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Different wavelengths.

2070
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That is.

2071
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
For metal.

2072
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
The particles.

2073
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
May be impossible.

2074
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
That.

2075
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I can still control this.

2076
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It.

2077
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Strengthen a rumor of different wavelengths.

2078
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
About.

2079
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Is there any strength?

2080
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
That's right.

2081
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
The main thing is to look.

2082
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The main thing is to look at the application.

2083
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
See what kind of application you want.

2084
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
That's like me.

2085
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's the strength of white light.

2086
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So I need to design this.

2087
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Different.

2088
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Different wavelengths.

2089
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Strengthening behavior.

2090
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
That's simple.

2091
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The same thickness of metal.

2092
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Uh.

2093
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Gold.

2094
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It just can't reach.

2095
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It's close to a white light.

2096
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
A strength.

2097
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The light.

2098
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
So simple metal.

2099
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
It will also strengthen.

2100
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Then the other question is.

2101
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Is it possible.

2102
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's not.

2103
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's not.

2104
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's not.

2105
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's not.

2106
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It's not.

2107
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
It's not.

2108
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Then the other question is.

2109
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
This kind of metal material.

2110
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Usually the problem is absorption.

2111
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
That's.

2112
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
That's.

2113
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
In.

2114
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
In these.

2115
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Uh.

2116
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Lacing.

2117
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Or.

2118
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
You started with.

2119
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Enhance this.

2120
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
These.

2121
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
In the work.

2122
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Will this absorption.

2123
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Have caused some problems.

2124
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Hey.

2125
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I hope your question is.

2126
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Will the base be absorption?

2127
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Or.

2128
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's still.

2129
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's still.

2130
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's still.

2131
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's still.

2132
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It's still.

2133
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
It's still.

2134
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
It's still.

2135
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It's still.

2136
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It's still.

2137
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Is it.

2138
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It's still.

2139
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Does it carry a lot of metal?

2140
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Uh.

2141
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yeah.

2142
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Because he will absorb some things himself.

2143
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
But as a whole.

2144
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It will make me.

2145
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
The top.

2146
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
The top.

2147
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Medial.

2148
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Medial.

2149
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
The.

2150
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Memory function will become higher.

2151
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
The.

2152
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's basically a little bit of absorption.

2153
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
That's right.

2154
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So that's.

2155
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
A little bit.

2156
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It's.

2157
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
It's a little bit.

2158
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
It's a little bit.

2159
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's.

2160
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
It's a little bit.

2161
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So.

2162
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
How much.

2163
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But the reflection is OK.

2164
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Reflection is OK.

2165
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It won't absorb everything.

2166
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Of course, I can also design.

2167
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
At some stages.

2168
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It absorbs very strongly.

2169
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
At some stages.

2170
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Its reflection is very strong.

2171
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It can rely on me.

2172
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Different.

2173
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Like.

2174
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Uh.

2175
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
A little bit.

2176
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Like.

2177
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Different.

2178
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Feel Fiction.

2179
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Can reach.

2180
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Wait a minute.

2181
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Like.

2182
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Like this.

2183
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I can.

2184
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Through different.

2185
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Feel Fiction.

2186
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
To adjust.

2187
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So.

2188
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Not to say.

2189
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I.

2190
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
This one.

2191
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
HMM comes out.

2192
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
For all the materials.

2193
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Perfect.

2194
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I want.

2195
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Case by case.

2196
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
To design.

2197
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
So.

2198
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Basically.

2199
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I.

2200
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
HMM.

2201
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
If it's different.

2202
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
If it's different.

2203
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
My thickness ratio.

2204
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's a little bit different.

2205
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Just.

2206
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Case by case.

2207
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
To design.

2208
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I.

2209
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I have a question.

2210
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Is that.

2211
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Is that.

2212
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
How much is the mold volume?

2213
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
How much is the mold volume?

2214
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And that.

2215
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Why.

2216
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Mold volume.

2217
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Mold volume.

2218
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Mold volume.

2219
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Mold volume.

2220
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Mold volume.

2221
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Mold volume.

2222
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Mold volume.

2223
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Just.

2224
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Generally its.

2225
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
MOLD.

2226
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
How much is the mold volume.

2227
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It's like you said it.

2228
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It is.

2229
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
She is very small.

2230
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
But I don't know how little she is.

2231
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Ah.

2232
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Right.

2233
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I see you here.

2234
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
HMM.

2235
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Um.

2236
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But uh.

2237
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This is a plane.

2238
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So.

2239
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That plane.

2240
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
The height of the.

2241
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
What is it?

2242
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
This.

2243
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The unit.

2244
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
What is it?

2245
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
This unit is.

2246
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Uh.

2247
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
The height of the plane.

2248
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
The height of the plane.

2249
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Uh.

2250
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I think.

2251
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
UM3.

2252
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's changed to NANO3.

2253
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's ten.

2254
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Multiplied by ten to the ninth.

2255
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It should be.

2256
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Or ten to the sixth.

2257
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So it's this thing.

2258
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Multiply it by ten to the sixth.

2259
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Or ten to the sixth.

2260
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It is.

2261
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
How many MM3.

2262
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So it's actually.

2263
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It's a very small thing.

2264
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That.

2265
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
This kind of thing.

2266
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
My question is.

2267
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
This thing is a plane.

2268
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Yeah.

2269
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
It's a plane.

2270
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
If it's a plane.

2271
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You.

2272
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That.

2273
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Uh.

2274
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Volume should be a length.

2275
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
The length.

2276
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It's a length.

2277
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
That.

2278
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Unit.

2279
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Oh.

2280
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Because actually we.

2281
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Is.

2282
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It's a plane.

2283
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
But we.

2284
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I.

2285
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
When using.

2286
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Calculation.

2287
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It also needs a.

2288
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
The volume to surround it.

2289
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
A.

2290
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
An overall calculation.

2291
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Area.

2292
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Yeah.

2293
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So it.

2294
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So the volume will bring you.

2295
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That.

2296
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
The size of your calculation.

2297
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Inside.

2298
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Yeah.

2299
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
This is.

2300
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
This is.

2301
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So.

2302
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So actually I.

2303
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
How much is it?

2304
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Do you know?

2305
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Hey.

2306
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I haven't counted this.

2307
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Of course.

2308
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
OK.

2309
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But actually I'm different.

2310
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Depends on different.

2311
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Uh.

2312
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Uh.

2313
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
