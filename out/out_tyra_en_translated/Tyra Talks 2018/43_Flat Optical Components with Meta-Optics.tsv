0	3000	Okay, let's get started.
3000	5000	Oh, I hear the recording has started.
7000	11000	Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today is
11000	14000	Phylogenetic Components with Meta-Optics.
14000	17000	Because my main research background is
17000	22000	the interaction between light and matter,
22000	25000	and then, through this interaction,
25000	28000	we can further manipulate light's behavior.
28000	31000	So the main application we want to do is
31000	34000	how to reduce the size of the current
34000	36000	phylogenetic components on the market.
36000	41000	For example, transparency or bias.
41000	44000	So, what is meta?
44000	46000	I'll talk about it later.
46000	48000	The word meta-optics is actually
48000	51000	the Greek word for meta.
51000	54000	I'll talk about it later.
54000	62000	Before we get into the topic,
62000	64000	I want to share a picture.
64000	66000	I don't know if you've seen this picture.
66000	69000	This is from the ancient Roman era.
69000	71000	The picture on the left is from the ancient Roman era.
71000	75000	This is a wine cup.
75000	77000	What's amazing about this is
77000	79000	you can see that the colors are different.
79000	81000	But they are actually the same cup.
81000	84000	The color is different because
84000	88000	they found that when they put the light source outside,
88000	91000	the color of the cup is green.
91000	93000	But if they put the light source inside the cup,
93000	96000	the cup will turn red.
96000	99000	That is to say, the material on the cup is very special.
99000	102000	If you look at the cup from the perspective of reflection,
102000	103000	it is green.
103000	105000	But if you put the light source inside,
105000	108000	the color you see is transparent.
108000	111000	So after you put the light source inside the cup,
111000	113000	the color you see is red.
113000	116000	At this time, people think this is amazing.
116000	118000	They also use this kind of material
118000	121000	to make church colored glass.
121000	123000	We all know that
123000	125000	churches in Europe
125000	129000	have very beautiful colored glass.
129000	133000	Why are there so many different colors?
133000	138000	The reason is the same as the cup.
138000	142000	The principle of its operation is very similar.
142000	144000	Why does this phenomenon occur?
144000	147000	Later, people found that
147000	150000	there is a thing called localized surface plasma.
150000	152000	What does this mean?
152000	154000	Why doesn't it move?
154000	156000	They found that
156000	159000	if we have a colored light source,
159000	163000	it will interact with a metal nanoparticle.
163000	165000	After interacting with it,
165000	168000	it will accumulate some free electrons
168000	171000	on the surface of the nanoparticle
171000	174000	under the appropriate conditions.
174000	176000	These free electrons
176000	181000	will allow it to produce a similar dipole inside,
181000	184000	an H-ray dipole or a magnetic dipole.
184000	186000	Let it further produce,
186000	190000	let it radiate electrons from other dipoles.
190000	192000	Then we will see different colors.
195000	197000	When will this phenomenon occur?
197000	200000	It mainly occurs
200000	203000	when our nanoparticles
203000	206000	are smaller than the dipole of the colored light.
206000	208000	This thing will only occur.
208000	210000	So the high-angle cup,
210000	212000	the colored high-angle cup,
212000	215000	later they did a further study
215000	217000	and found that the high-angle cup
217000	221000	actually contained a lot of gold particles of different size.
221000	223000	This is gold particle.
223000	226000	The size of these metal particles
226000	228000	compared with the dipole of the visible light,
228000	231000	the visible light dipole is about 400 to 700 nanometers.
231000	234000	Compared with it, it is smaller than the size of the dipole.
234000	236000	So they thought that
236000	238000	the reason for the different color
238000	240000	may come from this
240000	243000	local surface plasmon resonance.
243000	246000	The result of localized surface plasmon resonance.
246000	248000	After this resonance,
248000	251000	what special phenomenon will we have?
251000	254000	It actually has a lot of advantages that we can control,
254000	256000	that is, we can have.
256000	258000	For example, they found that
258000	261000	this resonance has a bias with the dipole of the colored light.
261000	264000	The bias is the direction in which the electron waves resonate.
264000	267000	You can see that this picture may be more obvious.
267000	270000	For example, the color here is very colorful,
270000	271000	very beautiful,
271000	274000	there are five or six colors.
274000	276000	Here you can't see any color at all.
276000	279000	These two pictures are actually the same sample
279000	280000	color.
280000	282000	Their only difference is that
282000	285000	they changed the direction of the dipole of the colored light.
285000	288000	This red and white arrow is the direction of its dipole resonance.
288000	290000	When the direction of the dipole of the colored light
290000	292000	is along the y-axis,
292000	294000	they will see that the chip above
294000	296000	will produce different colors.
296000	298000	In fact, you can imagine that
298000	300000	the chip uses some micro-imaging technology
300000	303000	to make some metal disks
303000	306000	that are smaller than visible wavelengths.
306000	307000	Like this disk.
307000	311000	Then they change its diameter or cycle.
311000	314000	We can see different colors
314000	318000	in the reflected light part.
318000	320000	But when they turn a bias,
320000	322000	the colors are all gone.
322000	324000	So you can use it to do something.
324000	326000	For example, this thing can be used to make
326000	331000	color filters that have a bias control feature.
331000	333000	Another special thing is that
333000	335000	we used to know that
335000	336000	for example,
336000	338000	why are we so interested in this thing now?
338000	342000	For example, we know that gold is often used to make decorations.
342000	344000	For example, rings and necklaces.
344000	345000	But gold,
345000	348000	as long as we use gold to make a decoration,
348000	350000	whether I pinch it into a square,
350000	351000	a circle,
351000	352000	or a ring,
352000	354000	its color is yellow.
354000	355000	But like I just said,
355000	356000	if we put this gold,
356000	358000	all the particles here are gold,
358000	361000	but they are at a very small scale.
361000	364000	If its scale is smaller than the wavelength,
364000	365000	we can find that
365000	368000	as its size changes,
368000	370000	the colors we see are different.
370000	373000	This is very different from the optical phenomenon
373000	376000	that we see on the object.
376000	378000	The main reason for this is because
378000	381000	of the localized surface plasma.
384000	385000	The next feature is that
385000	389000	if the two metals are very close together,
389000	391000	there is a very small nano gap
391000	394000	between the two metal particles,
394000	396000	there will be a very strong near-field coupling.
396000	398000	The two of them will interweave each other.
398000	400000	This interweaving will make them
400000	405000	a bit like the simple electronics we learned before.
405000	407000	It's like the feeling of end-to-end power generation.
407000	410000	Because its scale is very small,
410000	414000	the more end-to-end power it can accumulate,
414000	417000	the stronger the near-field power generation it produces.
417000	418000	If it is very close,
418000	419000	the interweaving between the two
419000	422000	will cause it to have a stronger field enhancement.
423000	425000	Finally, this resonance
425000	429000	has a lot to do with the surrounding environment.
429000	432000	It is very sensitive to the environment.
432000	433000	That is to say,
433000	436000	if the surrounding environment's resolution changes,
436000	438000	its resonance wavelength,
438000	441000	which is the color we saw in the original factory, will change.
441000	443000	For example, this stick now,
443000	445000	if it is in the air,
445000	446000	I see blue.
446000	448000	But if I put it in the water
448000	449000	and look at it again,
449000	451000	it may turn red.
451000	453000	This feature
453000	454000	is also used by some people
454000	457000	to say that we can do some sound sensing.
458000	461000	It is based on the change in color
461000	463000	to judge what is the object
463000	465000	in the surrounding environment.
468000	469000	OK.
469000	473000	After introducing the Localized Surface Plasma,
473000	474000	I will tell you
474000	476000	what is Metamaterial.
476000	477000	As I said,
477000	478000	the word Meta
478000	480000	comes from Greek.
480000	482000	It means the same in English.
482000	486000	Metamaterial is a kind of material.
486000	488000	It has some features.
488000	491000	These features are not found in natural materials.
491000	493000	We call it Metamaterial.
493000	494000	Simply put,
494000	497000	we can use the shape of it
497000	500000	or the distance between the particles
500000	502000	to change its optical properties.
502000	503000	These are called Metamaterial.
503000	505000	Why do we have these features?
505000	506000	It should be said that
506000	508000	we need to produce Metamaterial properties.
508000	510000	What is the strict condition?
510000	511000	As I said,
511000	513000	we generally know that natural materials
513000	515000	are composed of atoms.
515000	517000	For example, CO2, H2O.
517000	518000	Because we know that
518000	521000	the distance between them is very small.
521000	524000	If I take the surface plasma as 500 nm,
524000	526000	which is about the surface plasma of green light,
526000	527000	as an example,
527000	528000	these two
528000	531000	have a very, very big difference in their magnitude.
531000	533000	So its optical properties
533000	536000	are mainly determined by this molecule or atom.
536000	538000	For example, gold is AU.
538000	540000	No matter how I rub it,
540000	541000	it is yellow.
543000	544000	Metamaterial is what I just said.
544000	546000	If we now put the distance
546000	548000	or size between the particles
548000	549000	to be reduced to the original size,
549000	551000	which is the level of the magnetic field,
551000	553000	which is about Lambda over 4 to Lambda over 10,
553000	555000	at this magnitude,
555000	558000	we can use man-made methods
558000	562000	to change the optical properties of the material itself.
562000	564000	Then we can further manipulate
564000	567000	some of the behavior of light or electromagnetic waves.
567000	571000	This can be produced by the resonance
571000	575000	at the magnitude of the magnetic field.
575000	578000	By using this method to manipulate light,
578000	580000	we call it metamaterial.
580000	582000	It is mainly triangular.
582000	584000	Although my structure is very small,
584000	587000	its thickness in the z-direction can be very thick.
587000	589000	My very thick is only compared with the surface plasma of green light.
589000	592000	For example, it can be one or two microns.
595000	596000	Let me ask you a question.
596000	599000	10 to 100 microns?
599000	601000	No, 1 to 10 microns is fine.
601000	603000	It can be several microns.
604000	608000	So 10 nanometers to 100 micrometers is fine.
610000	613000	The magnitude I'm talking about here is a bit broad.
613000	616000	Mainly because the example I gave earlier is visible light.
616000	618000	But the advantage of this thing is that
618000	620000	my work plasma may not necessarily be visible light.
620000	623000	I can even be a microwave wave.
623000	628000	So 10 micrometers is Terahertz?
628000	630000	100 microns.
630000	632000	If it is 100 microns,
632000	637000	it should be 3 Terahertz.
637000	639000	If I'm not mistaken.
639000	641000	It's about the range of Terahertz.
641000	643000	It's far away.
643000	645000	So its work plasma can be very broad.
648000	652000	Here is a very special example.
652000	654000	The metamaterial I just mentioned.
654000	658000	When I first saw this phenomenon,
658000	660000	there was no such word as metamaterial.
660000	662000	It's called left-hand material.
662000	664000	Why is it called left-hand material?
664000	666000	Because they found that
666000	669000	the structure of man-made
669000	672000	can control the behavior of light.
672000	677000	We know that the characteristic of light transmission
677000	680000	mainly comes from the refractive index of the ring.
680000	682000	So they thought,
682000	684000	is it because of the refractive index?
684000	686000	Metamaterial is used to manipulate
686000	688000	the refractive index of the ring.
688000	690000	That's why it affects the behavior of light.
690000	692000	Here is a schematic diagram.
692000	695000	We used to study chemistry in high school.
695000	697000	If a cup is an empty cup,
697000	699000	the air refractive index is 1.
699000	701000	If I put a chopstick here, it will be straight.
701000	705000	If I put a refractive index of 1.3 in it,
705000	707000	it's probably water.
707000	709000	We know that because of the refractive index,
709000	712000	it looks like the chopstick is broken.
712000	716000	But if we put a negative refractive index in it,
717000	720000	the chopstick we see at this time will look like this.
720000	722000	This is actually just an experiment.
722000	724000	This is not the result of the experiment.
724000	726000	Another interesting thing is that
726000	728000	if we have this negative refractive index,
728000	730000	we usually know that the beam of light will be full.
732000	734000	In other words, the beam of light is orange here.
734000	736000	If it is a beam of light,
736000	739000	it is along N1sinθ1 and N2sinθ2.
739000	741000	So it keeps refracting.
741000	743000	But if the material in the middle
743000	745000	is a negative refractive material,
745000	748000	the beam of light and the beam of refractive light
748000	752000	will be located on both sides of the beam.
752000	755000	This makes them very interested.
755000	757000	That is to say,
757000	759000	is it true that because of these characteristics,
759000	761000	we can create some real
761000	764000	boundaries that naturally cannot exist,
764000	766000	and then achieve some
766000	769000	light and snow characteristics that we can't imagine at all?
769000	770000	This kind of negative refractive index,
770000	771000	I am trying to prove it here.
771000	773000	But in fact, there is already an experiment to prove
773000	775000	that this thing is really feasible.
775000	778000	But I didn't put their experiment results here.
780000	782000	It is to prove that by
782000	785000	properly designing the size of this material,
785000	790000	or the elements of the material itself,
790000	794000	they can achieve the negative refractive index phenomenon.
796000	799000	I think I can skip here.
800000	802000	Next, I will talk about
802000	804000	the Metamaterial I just mentioned.
804000	805000	I just said it can be very thick,
805000	807000	it can be three-dimensional.
807000	809000	But in fact, our main purpose is to
809000	811000	control the light.
811000	814000	Can we further reduce the element?
814000	815000	They want to say,
815000	818000	if I make Metamaterial only one layer,
818000	820000	because I just said that Metamaterial can be many layers,
820000	821000	it means that it can be very thick.
821000	823000	If I only have one layer,
823000	825000	can I achieve the same effect?
825000	827000	This one-layer Metamaterial,
827000	829000	they call it Metasurface.
829000	833000	A surface that is the same as a general surface.
833000	835000	Yes, so it's called Metasurface.
835000	837000	Here is an example.
837000	839000	For example, I now have a metal stick.
839000	842000	After I inject a electromagnetic wave into it,
842000	844000	because this magnitude is much smaller
844000	846000	than the injected light wave field,
846000	848000	so I can directly use the concept of
848000	849000	injecting electromagnetic waves to
849000	851000	see the result of this resonance.
851000	852000	So if my injected light wave field
852000	854000	vibrates along this direction,
854000	857000	I can theoretically accumulate positive and negative electrons
857000	860000	at both ends of the stick.
860000	861000	This accumulated positive and negative electron
861000	863000	can make us equivalent to an electrode.
863000	865000	After this electrode vibrates,
865000	868000	another electromagnetic wave will be radiated.
868000	870000	If we take a closer look at this structure
870000	872000	of penetrating light waves and phase light waves,
872000	874000	under a fixed wavelength,
874000	875000	it is obvious that
875000	877000	if the length of the stick changes,
877000	878000	just like I just said,
878000	880000	because this material,
880000	882000	this Metasurface or Metamaterial,
882000	884000	has a lot to do with its
884000	886000	resonance characteristics and size.
886000	888000	So when I make the length longer
888000	889000	or shorter,
889000	892000	we can see that its resonance wave
892000	894000	will gradually be flattened.
894000	895000	At this time,
895000	897000	if I look at a fixed wavelength,
897000	900000	its magnitude or phase
900000	902000	can be changed.
902000	904000	A point that everyone is very concerned about
904000	905000	is the phase.
905000	906000	Is this a simulation?
906000	907000	Yes, this is a simulation.
907000	909000	Both of these are simulations.
910000	913000	If we can manipulate the phase,
913000	915000	we can further manipulate
915000	917000	the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave,
917000	921000	which is the characteristics of its transmission.
921000	923000	For example, if I now have a
923000	926000	sample substrate,
926000	929000	and I record a flat wave,
929000	931000	if I put some of the
931000	934000	Metasurface nanostructure on the surface,
934000	936000	because its size is different,
936000	939000	the phase deviation they feel
939000	940000	will be different.
940000	942000	The different phase deviations
942000	944000	will make the phase delay
944000	947000	of the original wave
947000	948000	different,
948000	950000	which means that after the original interference,
950000	953000	they can reconstruct
953000	954000	another wave front.
954000	955000	And this wave front
955000	957000	is completely different from the Metasurface.
957000	959000	Although this magnitude is less than
959000	960000	the Metasurface wavelength,
960000	962000	we can control the electromagnetic wave
962000	964000	characteristics
964000	967000	with the Metasurface nanostructure.
967000	970000	Here are some examples of applications.
970000	972000	This is probably
972000	974000	to say that
974000	976000	we can not only manipulate the electromagnetic wave
976000	978000	government and phase,
978000	980000	in fact, the wavelength and deviation
980000	982000	can be manipulated
982000	984000	by Metasurface.
984000	985000	For example, they can
985000	987000	do some optical image
987000	989000	or do some deviation conversion,
989000	992000	which I will introduce later.
992000	995000	Here is a very simple image
995000	997000	that is, why this thing
997000	999000	can be so interesting
999000	1001000	and help us to design some
1001000	1004000	flat optical components.
1004000	1006000	I use the simplest one before
1006000	1008000	is our deflection law
1008000	1009000	to explain to you.
1009000	1011000	For example, if we used
1011000	1013000	Hagen's principle to explain
1013000	1014000	the deflection of this thing,
1014000	1016000	that is, if I have two materials
1016000	1017000	in the space now,
1017000	1021000	the deflection rate is N1 and N2 respectively.
1021000	1024000	After the deflection wave comes in,
1024000	1027000	every point on this interface
1027000	1031000	is reflected by the deflection light,
1031000	1033000	I can think of it as a
1033000	1035000	two-point light source.
1035000	1037000	So here is a little bit gray,
1037000	1039000	gray and white dots,
1039000	1040000	round dots.
1040000	1044000	I just split it
1044000	1046000	into a very small point
1046000	1048000	in each space.
1048000	1050000	This small point is reflected by the deflection light
1050000	1052000	and interacts with the deflection light.
1052000	1054000	I think of it as a two-point light source.
1054000	1056000	The deflection wave
1056000	1058000	coming out of the point light source
1058000	1059000	will be a circle.
1059000	1061000	This circle will eventually
1061000	1063000	reconstruct another deflection wave in the original factory.
1063000	1065000	Because each of them
1065000	1067000	has the same surface,
1067000	1069000	the phase coming out of their radiation
1069000	1071000	has no delay.
1071000	1074000	So their
1074000	1076000	original transmission
1076000	1078000	will be as flat as the deflection light,
1078000	1080000	which is the tradition.
1080000	1082000	How did they explain this thing
1082000	1084000	with Higgins before?
1084000	1086000	When I am now in the diagonal direction,
1086000	1088000	you can see that the red part
1088000	1092000	is the wave front.
1092000	1094000	This wave front
1094000	1097000	touches the time on this interface
1097000	1099000	will be different.
1099000	1102000	It will first touch the point on the left.
1102000	1104000	So after the point on the left is touched by the light,
1104000	1106000	it will be regarded as the first
1106000	1108000	two-point light source
1108000	1110000	to start radiation.
1110000	1112000	Then this point is touched.
1112000	1114000	But because it is slower to be touched,
1114000	1116000	it will produce
1116000	1118000	this radiation slower.
1118000	1120000	In this way,
1120000	1122000	to the end here.
1122000	1124000	Because the time they were touched
1124000	1126000	is different, we can think of it as
1126000	1128000	their radiation
1128000	1130000	is different.
1130000	1132000	So you can see that the shape of the radiation
1132000	1134000	produced by them is different from here.
1134000	1136000	The radiation is getting smaller from left to right.
1136000	1138000	This will cause
1138000	1140000	the wave front to be oblique.
1140000	1142000	Bing Jie, Zhang Yang has a question.
1142000	1144000	He has a question.
1144000	1146000	He said
1146000	1148000	Transmittance's light source
1148000	1150000	is mainly a design decision.
1150000	1152000	What about Resonance's Q-factor?
1152000	1154000	How high and low can it be now?
1156000	1158000	This thing?
1158000	1160000	How high can the Q-factor be?
1160000	1162000	How is it determined?
1162000	1164000	Q-factor
1164000	1166000	has a lot of things.
1166000	1168000	It will be affected by a lot of things.
1168000	1170000	First of all, the most intuitive
1170000	1172000	is its loss.
1172000	1174000	Because the material I designed here
1174000	1176000	is made of metal.
1176000	1178000	The metal in the visible light,
1178000	1180000	or the part outside the mirror,
1180000	1182000	after it has been resonance,
1182000	1184000	because of the dipole,
1184000	1186000	we can think of it as
1186000	1188000	a movement of free current.
1188000	1190000	This part will cause
1190000	1192000	The second thing that will affect it
1192000	1194000	is the loss of the original radiation.
1194000	1196000	In theory, we divide it into two categories.
1196000	1198000	One is Intrinsic.
1198000	1200000	One is Extrinsic.
1200000	1202000	Intrinsic is the heat radiation
1202000	1204000	that the material itself produces.
1204000	1206000	The other is the loss of the original radiation
1206000	1208000	caused by the original radiation.
1208000	1210000	I classify both of them as the part of the loss.
1210000	1212000	This part will reduce my Q-factor.
1212000	1214000	The other part is whether my cavity
1214000	1216000	is strong enough.
1216000	1218000	Because my current structure
1218000	1220000	is based on the loss of the original radiation.
1220000	1222000	So even if there is a shock
1222000	1224000	on it,
1224000	1226000	I can think of it as a movement of free current.
1226000	1228000	But this movement of free current
1228000	1230000	cannot be perfect
1230000	1232000	because this cavity is not very strong.
1232000	1234000	If I want a very strong cavity,
1234000	1236000	in theory, we should have
1236000	1238000	almost 100% reflectivity on both sides.
1238000	1240000	At this time, my Q-factor can be very high.
1240000	1242000	But because of my current structure,
1242000	1244000	I just wait for it to accumulate
1244000	1246000	and let it accumulate radiation on both sides.
1246000	1248000	But this cavity is not that strong.
1248000	1250000	So my Q-factor will be reduced.
1250000	1252000	These factors
1252000	1254000	result in the
1254000	1256000	Plasmon Resonance
1256000	1258000	produced by this kind of metal.
1258000	1260000	Its Q-factor will not be too high.
1260000	1262000	As far as I know,
1262000	1264000	if it is made of metal,
1264000	1266000	without considering
1266000	1268000	any cavity,
1268000	1270000	that is, without considering any mirror,
1270000	1272000	that is, the perfect mirror in this system,
1272000	1274000	its Q-factor
1274000	1276000	can only reach a few hundred.
1276000	1278000	This is already the highest.
1278000	1280000	But usually it is only a few tens.
1284000	1286000	He said he understood.
1286000	1288000	OK, thank you.
1288000	1290000	Then,
1290000	1292000	if I have the
1292000	1294000	nanoparticle I just talked about,
1294000	1296000	I am now
1296000	1298000	in the same direction.
1298000	1300000	But because of my nanoparticle,
1300000	1302000	each nanoparticle has a different size.
1302000	1304000	The size is different,
1304000	1306000	just like what I just showed in this picture.
1306000	1308000	Under the same wavelength,
1308000	1310000	the phase delay
1310000	1312000	felt by each different size will be different.
1312000	1314000	At this time,
1314000	1316000	it works as if
1316000	1318000	each particle,
1318000	1320000	although they both feel the
1320000	1322000	electromagnetic wave,
1322000	1324000	but after their resonance,
1324000	1326000	the radiation phase will also be delayed.
1326000	1328000	This is very interesting.
1328000	1330000	It allows us to achieve
1330000	1332000	transparency.
1332000	1334000	In theory,
1334000	1336000	I am transparent.
1336000	1338000	But if I design the structure
1338000	1340000	appropriately above,
1340000	1342000	I can see that it is written out.
1342000	1344000	I can use
1344000	1346000	Momentum's picture to explain it.
1346000	1348000	I don't think it needs to be explained.
1348000	1350000	Basically, it is the phase delay.
1350000	1352000	Here is a simple experiment result.
1352000	1354000	If I design a stick
1354000	1356000	of different lengths on the surface,
1356000	1358000	you can see that
1358000	1360000	Can you go back to the page
1360000	1362000	and explain Momentum? I don't quite understand.
1366000	1368000	Momentum, in theory,
1368000	1370000	we know that its K
1370000	1372000	is 2π除λ.
1372000	1374000	If I have
1374000	1376000	different structures here,
1376000	1378000	in theory, I can equate it to
1378000	1380000	each structure
1380000	1382000	can provide a
1382000	1384000	horizontal momentum.
1384000	1386000	How does this horizontal momentum decide?
1386000	1388000	This horizontal momentum is determined by
1388000	1390000	2π除λ.
1390000	1392000	What does this λ mean?
1392000	1394000	This λ of 2π除λ
1394000	1396000	means that my structure
1396000	1398000	has a phase delay
1398000	1400000	from 0 to
1400000	1402000	the minimum length of 360 degrees.
1402000	1404000	That is, I can see it as a
1404000	1406000	pixel of light.
1406000	1408000	A pixel of light.
1408000	1410000	If a pixel of light is λ,
1410000	1412000	we know that its K is 2π除λ.
1412000	1414000	Because I have a
1414000	1416000	phase change of T,
1416000	1418000	I can equate it to
1418000	1420000	the horizontal momentum of
1420000	1422000	2π除λ on this
1422000	1424000	surface.
1424000	1426000	And these two
1426000	1428000	Momentum boxes
1428000	1430000	can let us see through the light.
1430000	1432000	These two boxes
1432000	1434000	are obviously in this direction.
1434000	1436000	This is why we can
1436000	1438000	achieve the phenomenon of
1438000	1440000	paranormal penetration.
1442000	1444000	This is a
1444000	1446000	simple experiment result.
1446000	1448000	After designing different
1448000	1450000	lengths of sticks on the
1450000	1452000	surface, if my light
1452000	1454000	is perpendicular to the light,
1454000	1456000	I want to see if it can
1456000	1458000	reflect back in the opposite direction.
1458000	1460000	This is the result of the experiment.
1460000	1462000	This is the result of the calculation.
1462000	1464000	The curve of different colors represents
1464000	1466000	different angles of light.
1466000	1468000	Black is when the light
1468000	1470000	is perpendicular to the light,
1470000	1472000	and white is when the light
1472000	1474000	is perpendicular to the light.
1474000	1476000	The reflection angle is
1476000	1478000	about 45 degrees.
1478000	1480000	This proves that we
1480000	1482000	give it a horizontal momentum
1482000	1484000	in the horizontal direction.
1484000	1486000	Why don't I see through the light here?
1486000	1488000	Because the structure of this design
1488000	1490000	has a thick metal at the bottom.
1490000	1492000	This thick metal helps
1492000	1494000	us block all the light.
1494000	1496000	So we only see the reflected light.
1496000	1498000	Why do we only see the reflected light here?
1498000	1500000	You can also see that
1500000	1502000	when the light is perpendicular to the light,
1502000	1504000	if you look at the scattering,
1504000	1506000	you can see that the light
1506000	1508000	is perpendicular to the light.
1512000	1514000	Let me ask you a question.
1518000	1520000	What wavelength is the light
1520000	1522000	reflected?
1522000	1524000	The working wavelength is
1524000	1526000	about 780 nm.
1526000	1528000	This is the boundary between
1528000	1530000	the reflected light and the reflected light.
1532000	1534000	After doing this demo,
1534000	1536000	we also want to demonstrate
1536000	1538000	that its efficiency can be very high.
1538000	1540000	You can see that the efficiency of the calculation
1540000	1542000	can be more than 90%.
1542000	1544000	The experimental beam is also 80%.
1544000	1546000	I'm talking about the time when the reflection was recorded.
1546000	1548000	So why do we have to choose this wavelength?
1548000	1550000	Because the inter-beam scattering
1550000	1552000	is at 550 nm,
1552000	1554000	so if we use gold to make
1554000	1556000	the inter-beam scattering,
1556000	1558000	its resonance will never happen before 550 nm.
1558000	1560000	Because the loss is too big.
1560000	1562000	So the farther we work from 550 nm,
1562000	1564000	in theory, its efficiency can be better.
1564000	1566000	Of course, this is just the characteristic of the material itself.
1566000	1568000	Other factors also affect
1568000	1570000	its efficiency, such as
1570000	1572000	structural design.
1572000	1574000	This is the final optimization result.
1578000	1580000	I want to share with you
1580000	1582000	most of my work.
1584000	1586000	The first part is that we want to use aluminum
1586000	1588000	to make a visible Metasurface,
1588000	1590000	and then make some
1590000	1592000	flat components.
1592000	1594000	The other part is that
1594000	1596000	we want to make a transparent mirror.
1596000	1598000	Why do we want to make a transparent mirror?
1598000	1600000	Because what I just said is
1600000	1602000	that the most important thing
1602000	1604000	about Metasurface now
1604000	1606000	is that it can greatly reduce
1606000	1608000	the size of the components
1608000	1610000	we can buy on the market.
1610000	1612000	For example,
1612000	1614000	the simplest
1614000	1616000	and most impressive
1616000	1618000	is the iPhone
1618000	1620000	or our smartphone
1620000	1622000	camera lens.
1622000	1624000	After the iPhone 6,
1624000	1626000	you can find that
1626000	1628000	its body is actually very thin,
1628000	1630000	but its lens protrudes a piece.
1630000	1632000	This is because
1632000	1634000	when the body becomes thin,
1634000	1636000	it has to maintain
1636000	1638000	the resolution of the image
1638000	1640000	it takes
1640000	1642000	.
1642000	1644000	This premise
1644000	1646000	will cause it to
1646000	1648000	not be able to greatly reduce
1648000	1650000	the size of the mirror.
1650000	1652000	It has to insert a lot of different mirror groups
1652000	1654000	and stack them up,
1654000	1656000	so that the image produced after taking pictures
1656000	1658000	will be clearer,
1658000	1660000	so that some contrast and color difference can be eliminated.
1660000	1662000	I will introduce this later.
1662000	1664000	I don't know if I have enough time,
1664000	1666000	so I may be a little faster.
1666000	1668000	In fact, if you
1668000	1670000	take a look at the
1670000	1672000	current direction of the
1672000	1674000	battery wave,
1674000	1676000	we call it bias.
1676000	1678000	In fact, whether it is
1678000	1680000	the linear bias of the y-direction
1680000	1682000	or the linear bias of the x-direction,
1682000	1684000	or when it rotates,
1684000	1686000	it produces a circular bias.
1686000	1688000	No matter what the bias is,
1688000	1690000	I can split its positive and negative
1690000	1692000	into three components, x, y, and z.
1692000	1694000	I can easily stack
1694000	1696000	these three components
1696000	1698000	in the same way.
1698000	1700000	I should say that I can split
1700000	1702000	any bias light into these three components.
1702000	1704000	So our future design
1704000	1706000	will be based on this logic.
1706000	1708000	Bias is actually quite useful
1708000	1710000	in life.
1710000	1712000	For example, 3D images are the most common.
1712000	1714000	If you go to see a 3D movie,
1714000	1716000	it will give you a 3D glasses.
1716000	1718000	These 3D glasses are
1718000	1720000	what the left eye sees
1720000	1722000	and what the right eye sees.
1722000	1724000	Its bias is also perpendicular to each other.
1724000	1726000	When it causes this illusion,
1726000	1728000	the image you see will look like a 3D.
1728000	1730000	So why do you see
1730000	1732000	that the image is foggy when you take off your glasses?
1732000	1734000	Because your two eyes
1734000	1736000	detect the image of two biases at the same time.
1736000	1738000	Or
1738000	1740000	we often see that
1740000	1742000	some people who play photography
1742000	1744000	will know that
1744000	1746000	they will put some filters related to bias
1746000	1748000	in front of the lens,
1748000	1750000	which can shoot some light
1750000	1752000	on some slower
1752000	1754000	or stronger surface
1754000	1756000	to make
1756000	1758000	them more clear.
1758000	1760000	Or
1760000	1762000	do some
1762000	1764000	biological or chemical molecules detection.
1764000	1766000	Because some biological or chemical molecules
1766000	1768000	will take the initiative
1768000	1770000	to bias
1770000	1772000	the bias of the light.
1772000	1774000	Different molecules
1774000	1776000	have different angles of bias.
1776000	1778000	Some are big and some are small.
1778000	1780000	Some people use this thing
1780000	1782000	to make chemical molecules
1782000	1784000	detection.
1784000	1786000	What are the
1786000	1788000	most common
1788000	1790000	ways to manipulate
1790000	1792000	bias on the market?
1792000	1794000	Let me give you three examples.
1794000	1796000	The first one is linear bias.
1796000	1798000	For example,
1798000	1800000	if there is a dirty battery,
1800000	1802000	the battery factory is messy.
1802000	1804000	If you want to turn it into a pure
1804000	1806000	battery factory,
1806000	1808000	for example,
1808000	1810000	the battery factory is a
1810000	1812000	horizontal wire.
1812000	1814000	If the battery factory is along this wire,
1814000	1816000	it will be absorbed.
1816000	1818000	The volume of the battery
1818000	1820000	will be penetrated.
1820000	1822000	So it uses this method
1822000	1824000	to filter out the bias it doesn't want.
1824000	1826000	This is what I found on the Internet.
1826000	1828000	You can buy it on the market.
1828000	1830000	Because we need to effectively
1830000	1832000	absorb all the light in the x-direction.
1832000	1834000	So its thickness must be thick enough.
1834000	1836000	Usually this thickness is about a millimeter.
1836000	1838000	This diameter is one inch.
1838000	1840000	This diameter is half an inch.
1840000	1842000	Another one is that after we produce
1842000	1844000	linear bias, we want to do
1844000	1846000	a rotation of bias light.
1846000	1848000	For example, the linear bias of the
1848000	1850000	green light is 45 degrees.
1850000	1852000	If I want to rotate it to negative 45 degrees,
1852000	1854000	we will use 1 in 2 waves.
1854000	1856000	The main thing is that this material
1856000	1858000	itself can provide different
1858000	1860000	phase differences
1860000	1862000	in the x- and y-directions,
1862000	1864000	so that when the light penetrates,
1864000	1866000	the bias of the x-direction
1866000	1868000	slowly slows down,
1868000	1870000	and the y-direction slowly speeds up,
1870000	1872000	so that the x- and y-directions
1872000	1874000	of the green light are in the positive direction
1874000	1876000	respectively.
1876000	1878000	After coming out, it will become
1878000	1880000	a negative and a positive,
1880000	1882000	and then use this method to rotate it.
1882000	1884000	Because it has to accumulate
1884000	1886000	enough bias delay,
1886000	1888000	so its thickness must be thick enough.
1888000	1890000	Or to produce linear bias light.
1890000	1892000	This is to give the
1892000	1894000	x- and y-dimensions
1894000	1896000	an additional bias delay,
1896000	1898000	so that the angle of the bias delay
1898000	1900000	is large enough that the
1900000	1902000	x- and y-directions of the x- and y-directions
1902000	1904000	are exactly 90 degrees.
1904000	1906000	Then it can become the original bias light.
1906000	1908000	It also has to have enough bias delay,
1908000	1910000	so its thickness must also be very thick.
1910000	1912000	What are the benefits of using linear bias light?
1912000	1914000	We don't need to use the thickness of
1914000	1916000	the minimiter level,
1916000	1918000	we can produce any bias light we want.
1918000	1920000	For example, we provide a
1920000	1922000	design method called
1922000	1924000	Geometry Faced Metasurface,
1924000	1926000	which is a superimposed interface that combines
1926000	1928000	the positions of the x- and y-directions.
1928000	1930000	What does this mean?
1930000	1932000	For example, if I have a stick now,
1932000	1934000	I record a right-handed light
1934000	1936000	and look at the penetration of the left-handed light.
1936000	1938000	At this time, because the
1938000	1940000	bias light of the penetrating light
1940000	1942000	is different from the recorded light,
1942000	1944000	so I call it conversion efficiency.
1944000	1946000	We can see that the conversion efficiency is here.
1946000	1948000	Then I look at the x- and y-directions of the
1948000	1950000	bias light, and I will see a value.
1950000	1952000	At this time, if I rotate it
1952000	1954000	a theta angle, this theta angle is
1954000	1956000	the angle with the y-axis.
1956000	1958000	We will find a very magical thing
1958000	1960000	that its efficiency will hardly change,
1960000	1962000	and its
1962000	1964000	position will change to 2 theta.
1964000	1966000	Then,
1966000	1968000	as long as I let it rotate
1968000	1970000	at the same angle
1970000	1972000	on this surface,
1972000	1974000	I can make
1974000	1976000	its position change from 0
1976000	1978000	to 2π.
1978000	1980000	Every time I rotate a theta angle,
1980000	1982000	its bias delay will become 2 theta.
1982000	1984000	Another interesting point is that
1984000	1986000	if the same structure,
1986000	1988000	the direction of my rotation is exactly the same,
1988000	1990000	but at this time I turn into a left-handed light
1990000	1992000	and look at the penetration of the right-handed light.
1992000	1994000	At this time, I will find a
1994000	1996000	more interesting thing,
1996000	1998000	its bias delay can reach 360 degrees,
1998000	2000000	but it is from 0 to 360 and becomes
2000000	2002000	0 to negative 360.
2002000	2004000	This thing can help us design
2004000	2006000	some components that can be manipulated by bias.
2006000	2008000	For example, if you look at it with the right-handed light,
2008000	2010000	it will become a focal penetration.
2010000	2012000	If you look at it with the left-handed light,
2012000	2014000	it will become a scattered penetration.
2014000	2016000	In other words, I can combine
2016000	2018000	many different optical functions
2018000	2020000	on the same optical component,
2020000	2022000	and its
2022000	2024000	magnitude is very thin.
2024000	2026000	The thickness of this metal is only
2026000	2028000	50 nanometers,
2028000	2030000	so it is much smaller
2030000	2032000	than the previous
2032000	2034000	50 nanometers.
2034000	2036000	This is what we are talking about,
2036000	2038000	because its magnitude is very small,
2038000	2040000	so the concept we propose here is that
2040000	2042000	we can integrate all the different chips
2042000	2044000	on the same sample.
2044000	2046000	Then after I enter the color light,
2046000	2048000	I hit different chips
2048000	2050000	and the reflected light can produce a different fragrance.
2052000	2054000	Compared with the general traditional components,
2054000	2056000	I want to produce the original light,
2056000	2058000	for example, I at least need a
2058000	2060000	linear light,
2060000	2062000	a linear polarizer,
2062000	2064000	and a quarter wave,
2064000	2066000	to produce the original light.
2066000	2068000	But now if I only use our metasurface,
2068000	2070000	my thickness only needs about
2070000	2072000	dozens of nanometers to complete
2072000	2074000	this thing.
2074000	2076000	Let me tell you
2076000	2078000	why we use aluminum,
2078000	2080000	because I just mentioned that gold,
2080000	2082000	because its intervention coefficient is around 500 to 550 nanometers,
2082000	2084000	so it is impossible
2084000	2086000	to work on the entire optical spectrum.
2086000	2088000	Silver can work on the entire optical spectrum,
2088000	2090000	but there is a big disadvantage of silver,
2090000	2092000	which is that it is very easy to oxidize,
2092000	2094000	so the components cannot last long.
2094000	2096000	So we choose aluminum here.
2096000	2098000	Here is a demo for everyone,
2098000	2100000	that is to say,
2100000	2102000	we use LISO to pattern
2102000	2104000	some different aluminum sticks
2104000	2106000	of different lengths and sizes,
2106000	2108000	and its color will change drastically.
2108000	2110000	This is its tradition.
2110000	2112000	Indeed, its resonance can
2112000	2114000	expand from 400 nanometers of blue light
2114000	2116000	to 750 nanometers of red light.
2118000	2120000	Here is the design of the component.
2120000	2122000	I won't talk about it.
2122000	2124000	Simply put, we optimized
2124000	2126000	its structure dimension
2126000	2128000	so that it can produce the highest
2128000	2130000	work efficiency.
2130000	2132000	Next, I will tell you
2132000	2134000	how to use the same component
2134000	2136000	to achieve the production
2136000	2138000	of any parameter.
2138000	2140000	First of all,
2140000	2142000	after I design a stick here,
2142000	2144000	as I just said,
2144000	2146000	I make it rotate
2146000	2148000	in the direction of change.
2148000	2150000	I can let it produce 0 to 2π
2150000	2152000	and I can produce an abnormal reflection.
2152000	2154000	The interesting thing about this abnormal reflection
2154000	2156000	is that my rotation angle is fixed,
2156000	2158000	so if I enter the color light
2158000	2160000	at this time,
2160000	2162000	it will produce an abnormal reflection
2162000	2164000	of the right light here.
2164000	2166000	Conversely, if I enter the color light
2166000	2168000	and it is the right light,
2168000	2170000	it will produce an abnormal reflection
2170000	2172000	of the left light,
2172000	2174000	but it is on the other side
2174000	2176000	and it is already achieved.
2176000	2178000	If I enter a linear parameter light,
2178000	2180000	which is horizontal,
2180000	2182000	I mean the x-parameter light.
2182000	2184000	Because the x-parameter light
2184000	2186000	can be regarded as the addition of
2186000	2188000	the right light and the left light,
2188000	2190000	so it can let me produce
2190000	2192000	the left and right parameters at the same time.
2192000	2194000	So I use a simple rotation
2194000	2196000	to achieve the adjustment of the original parameter light
2196000	2198000	if I enter the color light as a linear parameter light.
2198000	2200000	How do I produce any linear parameter light?
2200000	2202000	We introduce another
2202000	2204000	parameter light that looks exactly the same as it,
2204000	2206000	but the rotation direction of the structure is opposite.
2206000	2208000	The first group of rotation is clockwise,
2208000	2210000	and the second group of rotation is counterclockwise.
2210000	2212000	In this case,
2212000	2214000	when I enter a linear parameter light,
2214000	2216000	I can achieve the reflection of
2216000	2218000	the right and left parameters at the same time on the same side.
2218000	2220000	Then I make a spatial parallelism
2220000	2222000	between the two of them.
2222000	2224000	This parallelism will make a difference
2224000	2226000	in the position between the two of them.
2226000	2228000	This difference in the position
2228000	2230000	can be determined by this d.
2230000	2232000	As mentioned earlier,
2232000	2234000	the difference in the position
2234000	2236000	can be equal to 2πd divided by Lx.
2236000	2238000	Lx is the length.
2238000	2240000	So you can see that the difference in the position
2240000	2242000	can be changed by the change in d.
2242000	2244000	So after the two of them interfere with each other,
2244000	2246000	they can be multiplied into
2246000	2248000	different linear parameters.
2248000	2250000	For example, if d is 0,
2250000	2252000	it means that the difference in the position
2252000	2254000	between the two original parameters is 0.
2254000	2256000	At this time, their reflection light
2256000	2258000	will also be an x-parameter light.
2258000	2260000	It's a bit like a mirror.
2260000	2262000	If I let its d
2262000	2264000	be designed to
2264000	2266000	have a difference in the position
2266000	2268000	of π,
2268000	2270000	it will become a y-parameter light.
2270000	2272000	That is, Lx's reflection light will become y.
2272000	2274000	In this way, I can make it
2274000	2276000	a positive 45-degree linear light
2276000	2278000	or a negative 45-degree linear light.
2278000	2280000	So it's all reflected.
2280000	2282000	Now there's no way to do the refraction.
2282000	2284000	Isn't it just a projection?
2284000	2286000	We can do projection here,
2286000	2288000	but the efficiency of projection will be very low.
2288000	2290000	Because I just said that the loss of metal is relatively large.
2290000	2292000	So our demo here is mainly reflected.
2292000	2294000	The work I will do later will be projected.
2294000	2296000	But our material will be converted from metal
2296000	2298000	to electrolyte.
2298000	2300000	OK, good, continue.
2300000	2302000	Then here is its SEM map.
2302000	2304000	That is, we integrate
2304000	2306000	the six samples together.
2306000	2308000	Then the optical system.
2308000	2310000	Here is a test result.
2310000	2312000	We usually use
2312000	2314000	this POSCALISphere
2314000	2316000	to show
2316000	2318000	what the
2318000	2320000	refraction of light
2320000	2322000	is.
2322000	2324000	In fact, this map is very simple to see.
2324000	2326000	If this map is the earth,
2326000	2328000	its north pole represents the purest right-axis light.
2328000	2330000	The south pole is the purest left-axis light.
2330000	2332000	The four points on the equator
2332000	2334000	represent the
2334000	2336000	linear light.
2336000	2338000	The four points in the east, west, south and north
2338000	2340000	represent the purest
2340000	2342000	x, y, positive 45
2342000	2344000	and negative 45-degree linear light.
2344000	2346000	And these three maps are based on
2346000	2348000	the experiment results of these three
2348000	2350000	green light wavelengths.
2350000	2352000	The black dots are the theoretical results
2352000	2354000	of ideal prediction.
2354000	2356000	And the
2356000	2358000	black dots with colors
2358000	2360000	are the results of our experiment measurement.
2360000	2362000	It can be said that they are almost very match.
2362000	2364000	Some may have some miscalculations,
2364000	2366000	but they are still quite close to our theoretical prediction results.
2366000	2368000	Then it proves that we can
2368000	2370000	achieve different equilibrium states
2370000	2372000	based on our experimental results.
2400000	2402000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2430000	2432000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2520000	2522000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2550000	2552000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2610000	2612000	We can use a lot of aperture in our lives.
2612000	2614000	We can use a lot of aperture in our lives.
2614000	2616000	For example, a microscope or a camera lens.
2616000	2618000	We can use a lot of aperture in our lives.
2618000	2620000	For example, a microscope or a camera lens.
2620000	2622000	At present, there are many problems
2622000	2624000	with the so-called aperture.
2624000	2626000	One of them is the differential.
2630000	2632000	The difference between the different approaches
2632000	2634000	will be focused in different places.
2634000	2636000	There is a great influence
2636000	2638000	when I want to do full-screen images.
2638000	2640000	The difference means that
2640000	2642000	I use the same aperture,
2642000	2644000	but it will be focused in different places.
2644000	2646000	This will also make it impossible
2646000	2648000	for us to do full-screen images.
2648000	2650000	So in order to meet this requirement,
2650000	2652000	they will stack two apertures
2652000	2654000	to compensate for the difference.
2654000	2656000	So that they can be focused
2656000	2658000	at the same point in different places.
2658000	2660000	This will make it possible
2660000	2662000	to do full-screen images.
2662000	2664000	That's why we can't do full-screen images.
2664000	2666000	That's why we can't do full-screen images.
2666000	2668000	So that the difference between the different approaches
2668000	2670000	will be focused at the same point in different places.
2670000	2672000	In theory, if you add one more aperture,
2672000	2674000	you can only do one more compensation.
2674000	2676000	For example, if I want to do full-screen images,
2676000	2678000	you can imagine that
2678000	2680000	I need at least 10 or 20 shots.
2680000	2682000	It may not be enough.
2682000	2684000	Here is a picture of why
2684000	2686000	our smart phone's aperture is so thick.
2686000	2688000	It is because there are many different
2688000	2690000	apertures in it.
2690000	2692000	In order to meet the compensation
2692000	2694000	of these differences,
2694000	2696000	the resulting image will not have distortion.
2696000	2698000	Or the color will not run away.
2698000	2700000	It's the same as what the eyes see.
2702000	2704000	That's why we want to use
2704000	2706000	MetaServer as a lens.
2706000	2708000	As mentioned earlier,
2708000	2710000	we want to do high-efficiency processing.
2710000	2712000	If I use metal,
2712000	2714000	all the examples I just mentioned are only reflective.
2714000	2716000	On the other hand, if I want to do a penetrative,
2716000	2718000	I have to convert it into an anodized material.
2718000	2720000	Because the anodized material itself
2720000	2722000	has no distortion,
2722000	2724000	no heat loss,
2724000	2726000	it can greatly reduce
2726000	2728000	the efficiency of work.
2730000	2732000	Here is a history.
2732000	2734000	This may also be skipped.
2736000	2738000	First of all, we use GetInNitro as a material.
2738000	2740000	It has a high reflectivity in visible light.
2740000	2742000	We want to use anodized metal
2742000	2744000	to do MetaService.
2744000	2746000	The prerequisite is that its reflectivity
2746000	2748000	is at least greater than 2.
2748000	2750000	Because anodized metal is not like metal,
2750000	2752000	it has a free electron accumulation.
2752000	2754000	So its resonance must rely on the membrane current.
2754000	2756000	If the membrane current has resonance,
2756000	2758000	it means that its reflectivity
2758000	2760000	must be large enough to compare
2760000	2762000	with the surrounding environment.
2762000	2764000	Only then can it produce a strong enough
2764000	2766000	membrane current to produce fragrance accumulation.
2766000	2768000	At least as far as I can see,
2768000	2770000	if compared with air, it is at least 2.
2770000	2772000	Similarly, we use PPFace,
2772000	2774000	which is the MetaService of GeometryFaceFace,
2774000	2776000	which is the rotating method I just mentioned,
2776000	2778000	to adjust its fragrance.
2778000	2780000	This is called focusing.
2780000	2782000	Focusing means that I am now
2782000	2784000	injecting a flat light into it.
2784000	2786000	The light in different positions
2786000	2788000	will feel different fragrance delays
2788000	2790000	before it can reach the same point.
2790000	2792000	So this is the fragrance distribution
2792000	2794000	that I have to satisfy in different structures
2794000	2796000	in the space.
2796000	2798000	This is the final design result.
2798000	2800000	If I inject an experiment,
2800000	2802000	this is the experimental electronic microscope photo.
2802000	2804000	This is the MetaService lens we designed.
2804000	2806000	We call it MetaLens.
2806000	2808000	In order to detect its focus,
2808000	2810000	when we inject light into it,
2810000	2812000	this super photoreceptor will focus
2812000	2814000	on a certain point in a certain space.
2814000	2816000	We use a flat platform at the back
2816000	2818000	to detect how well it focuses the light.
2818000	2820000	You can see that
2820000	2822000	we just match
2822000	2824000	a very beautiful green light spot
2824000	2826000	on its focusing surface.
2826000	2828000	I injected green light and laser light.
2828000	2830000	If I stay away from it,
2830000	2832000	it will not focus.
2832000	2834000	In addition to green light,
2834000	2836000	we can also do different things.
2836000	2838000	How far is the distance?
2838000	2840000	How far can it move?
2840000	2842000	You mean this stage?
2842000	2844000	Yes.
2844000	2846000	This stage can move up to 7mm.
2846000	2848000	What about its step size?
2848000	2850000	Its step size can reach
2850000	2852000	500nm.
2852000	2854000	OK.
2854000	2856000	Thank you.
2856000	2858000	Not only green light,
2858000	2860000	we can also do red, blue, and green.
2860000	2862000	Just change its size.
2862000	2864000	Regularity depends on its size.
2864000	2866000	Next,
2866000	2868000	in addition to doing positive focus,
2868000	2870000	we can also do oblique focus
2870000	2872000	on a flat surface.
2872000	2874000	But this is very difficult
2874000	2876000	to do in traditional photoreceptors.
2876000	2878000	Because traditional photoreceptors
2878000	2880000	mainly use manual grinding
2880000	2882000	to achieve the surface frequency I want.
2882000	2884000	A photoreceptor is a glass with a curve.
2884000	2886000	Different thicknesses will cause
2886000	2888000	different fragmentation.
2888000	2890000	If I want to use traditional photoreceptors
2890000	2892000	you can imagine that
2892000	2894000	this is a curve.
2894000	2896000	It becomes a curve on one side.
2896000	2898000	This is very difficult
2898000	2900000	in terms of technology.
2900000	2902000	Our technology is very simple.
2902000	2904000	I just need to change the distribution of the surface structure
2904000	2906000	so that its center
2906000	2908000	slowly deviates a little to the left
2908000	2910000	or a little to the right.
2910000	2912000	Then I can do oblique focus.
2912000	2914000	For example, this picture.
2914000	2916000	Here is the experiment result.
2916000	2918000	You can see that red, blue, and green are focused.
2918000	2920000	This refers to the position of the lens.
2922000	2924000	The focus is in the upper right corner.
2924000	2926000	We designed it in the upper right corner.
2926000	2928000	We proposed an application.
2928000	2930000	If we integrate all of them
2930000	2932000	on the same chip
2932000	2934000	because it is very small
2934000	2936000	we can easily integrate them all together.
2936000	2938000	After I insert a wide-screen light source
2938000	2940000	I will see a different color distribution.
2940000	2942000	I can use it to divide the light.
2942000	2944000	For example, this is the photo of our sample.
2944000	2946000	If I insert a red light now
2946000	2948000	I can see that the focus is in the upper right corner
2948000	2950000	of the same sample.
2950000	2952000	If I insert a green light now
2952000	2954000	I can see that there is a focus light on the upper left and lower right.
2954000	2956000	The blue light is in the lower left.
2956000	2958000	If I insert three wavelengths at the same time
2958000	2960000	I will see the effect of division of light.
2960000	2962000	The biggest application of this thing
2962000	2964000	is on CMOS.
2964000	2966000	CMOS is currently
2966000	2968000	an important component
2968000	2970000	in the image sensor.
2970000	2972000	Traditionally, you have to do a
2972000	2974000	micro lens, which is what I just said.
2974000	2976000	You have to focus first
2976000	2978000	and then go through a filter and a detector.
2978000	2980000	Because the detector can't
2980000	2982000	distinguish colors,
2982000	2984000	that's why it has to put a filter here.
2984000	2986000	It has to make sure that
2986000	2988000	this filter can only receive blue light.
2988000	2990000	So it has to put a blue light filter
2990000	2992000	to filter out the white light, red light, and green light.
2992000	2994000	This causes
2994000	2996000	the red light and green light
2996000	2998000	to be wasted
2998000	3000000	and so on.
3000000	3002000	But our sample
3002000	3004000	can put all the white light in
3004000	3006000	and divide all the red light here.
3006000	3008000	The green light is in the middle, and the blue light is on the other side.
3008000	3010000	We can effectively use
3010000	3012000	all the energy of the green light
3012000	3014000	to greatly increase its S-N ratio.
3014000	3016000	The other biggest advantage
3016000	3018000	is what I just said.
3018000	3020000	Our thickness is only 600 nanometers.
3020000	3022000	Traditionally, it's about 1 to 10 microns.
3022000	3024000	So we can shrink down its physical dimension.
3024000	3026000	The other thing
3026000	3028000	we want to do
3028000	3030000	is to eliminate
3030000	3032000	the difference in color.
3032000	3034000	As I just said, different wavelengths
3034000	3036000	will focus on different positions.
3036000	3038000	This is the work of the people in the past.
3038000	3040000	But this is our work.
3040000	3042000	Traditionally,
3042000	3044000	different wavelengths of green light
3044000	3046000	would focus on different positions in the space,
3046000	3048000	so it's hard to make a full-color image.
3048000	3050000	We designed
3050000	3052000	some special designs
3052000	3054000	to provide different flavor compensations
3054000	3056000	in different positions
3056000	3058000	to create a white light focus point.
3058000	3060000	This is a demonstration
3060000	3062000	using a metal part as a reflector.
3064000	3066000	This is the design principle.
3066000	3068000	I won't talk about it.
3068000	3070000	This is the sample photo.
3070000	3072000	This is the measurement result.
3072000	3074000	This is the calculation result.
3074000	3076000	You can see that my wavelength
3076000	3078000	changes from 1.2 to 1.65 microns.
3078000	3080000	Basically, its focal length
3080000	3082000	has hardly changed.
3082000	3084000	If I do a different
3084000	3086000	lens measurement,
3086000	3088000	I can see that
3088000	3090000	the focal length
3090000	3092000	is almost the same.
3092000	3094000	If I compare it with
3094000	3096000	a traditional metal lens,
3096000	3098000	the deviation is quite large
3098000	3100000	in the same wavelength.
3100000	3102000	This proves that
3102000	3104000	we can completely eliminate the color difference.
3104000	3106000	This is another example.
3106000	3108000	I skipped it.
3108000	3110000	Another example is
3110000	3112000	that the biggest use of transparency
3112000	3114000	is to make a full-color image.
3114000	3116000	Transparency is actually very difficult to make a full-color image.
3116000	3118000	So our work here is to
3118000	3120000	make a high-efficiency
3120000	3122000	focal length transparency
3122000	3124000	and further apply it to make a full-color image.
3124000	3126000	What I just said
3126000	3128000	is why we can use
3128000	3130000	metal materials to
3130000	3132000	adjust the angle.
3132000	3134000	The main reason is that
3134000	3136000	there is a big difference in the refraction rate,
3136000	3138000	so it can produce a cavity-like resonance.
3138000	3140000	So different wavelengths
3140000	3142000	can produce different
3142000	3144000	cavities.
3144000	3146000	Here is our photo.
3146000	3148000	This studio is
3148000	3150000	located in the visible light,
3150000	3152000	so the refractive spectrum
3152000	3154000	ranges from 400 to 640.
3154000	3156000	We can actually eliminate it to 660,
3156000	3158000	but because of the deviation here,
3158000	3160000	I only fix it to 640.
3160000	3162000	The last is to make a full-color image.
3162000	3164000	After I use a photo to come in,
3164000	3166000	we want to be able to
3166000	3168000	make a full-color image
3168000	3170000	through our metalance
3170000	3172000	analysis.
3172000	3174000	Here is a full-color image
3174000	3176000	made with our lens.
3176000	3178000	You can see that
3178000	3180000	even white or yellow
3180000	3182000	have very clear colors.
3182000	3184000	Compared with the original photo,
3184000	3186000	there is not much difference in color.
3186000	3188000	It proves that we can
3188000	3190000	eliminate color difference in the entire
3190000	3192000	refractive spectrum and make a full-color image application.
3192000	3194000	That's about it.
3194000	3196000	Sorry, I talked a little too fast,
3196000	3198000	because the time is a bit delayed.
3198000	3200000	This is my report for today.
3200000	3202000	Thank you everyone.
3202000	3204000	I don't know if there are any questions.
3204000	3206000	If I talk too fast later,
3210000	3212000	I think it's good.
3214000	3216000	Do you have any questions?
3216000	3218000	Can you hear me?
3218000	3220000	Yes, we can hear you now.
3220000	3222000	Thank you.
3226000	3228000	What is this?
3228000	3230000	My question is
3230000	3232000	basically
3232000	3234000	your device
3234000	3236000	is roughly scaled
3236000	3238000	as the working
3238000	3240000	frequency.
3240000	3242000	Basically.
3242000	3244000	Yes, it should be smaller than the frequency.
3244000	3246000	I mean it should have the same effect.
3246000	3248000	If you want
3248000	3250000	the working frequency
3250000	3252000	to be doubled,
3252000	3254000	the length,
3254000	3256000	the scale should be 2.
3256000	3258000	So the area should be 4.
3258000	3260000	No,
3260000	3262000	it's not a linear scale.
3262000	3264000	It's not a linear scale.
3264000	3266000	It's not.
3266000	3268000	Because of the resonance,
3268000	3270000	it's different from the material.
3270000	3272000	For example,
3272000	3274000	this thing is very intuitive.
3274000	3276000	For example,
3276000	3278000	I just talked about this thing.
3278000	3280000	For example,
3280000	3282000	if we have resonance,
3282000	3284000	we can think that
3284000	3286000	it produces an equivalent
3286000	3288000	resonance here.
3288000	3290000	So if you say
3290000	3292000	my working frequency
3292000	3294000	is doubled,
3294000	3296000	in theory, the length should be doubled.
3296000	3298000	The premise of this thing is
3298000	3300000	that the scale of the structure itself does not change.
3300000	3302000	Oh.
3302000	3304000	In different wavelengths,
3304000	3306000	the scale of the material will change.
3306000	3308000	So its equivalent wavelength,
3308000	3310000	the effective lambda is actually
3310000	3312000	lambda over n.
3312000	3314000	This n is also the wavelength function.
3314000	3316000	Oh, yes.
3316000	3318000	So it's not a linear scale.
3318000	3320000	Now for this kind of material,
3320000	3322000	can you do it
3322000	3324000	in
3324000	3326000	millimeter wave
3326000	3328000	or infrared
3328000	3330000	or deep IR
3330000	3332000	devices?
3332000	3334000	You can do it in Terahertz or microwave,
3334000	3336000	but most people do it in microwave.
3336000	3338000	Now there are several companies in the United States
3338000	3340000	that have established this principle of doing it in microwave.
3340000	3342000	Because microwave is easy to do
3342000	3344000	and the loss is super low.
3344000	3346000	And
3346000	3348000	military use is the widest.
3348000	3350000	And its materials are basically
3350000	3352000	aluminum or some
3352000	3354000	silicon base, which are cheaper
3354000	3356000	and easy to make materials.
3356000	3358000	Yes, that's right.
3358000	3360000	Although we have been talking about metal for a long time,
3360000	3362000	the main reason why
3362000	3364000	there is no commercial product for metal
3364000	3366000	is here.
3366000	3368000	Because metal is not yet
3368000	3370000	silicon path fabrication compatible.
3370000	3372000	These CMOS semiconductor companies
3372000	3374000	are compatible.
3374000	3376000	I see.
3376000	3378000	So why do we want to do gallium nitride later?
3378000	3380000	Because gallium nitride is at least
3380000	3382000	a semiconductor company.
3382000	3384000	The current manufacturing can be compatible.
3384000	3386000	Let me talk about
3386000	3388000	Maybe you can think about it.
3388000	3390000	Because we are looking for
3390000	3392000	Terahertz absorber,
3392000	3394000	but it has to be very, very
3394000	3396000	low radioactivity.
3396000	3398000	So we have very, very
3398000	3400000	restrictions on materials.
3400000	3402000	We can't use some
3402000	3404000	very fancy elements, you know.
3406000	3408000	So if you can do this thing,
3408000	3410000	it should be usable.
3410000	3412000	And it's quite complicated.
3412000	3414000	What do you mean by Terahertz?
3414000	3416000	What are the requirements?
3416000	3418000	We need it to be
3418000	3420000	able to adjust its optical quality
3420000	3422000	in Terahertz.
3422000	3424000	It's EM wave quality.
3424000	3426000	But all the materials it uses
3426000	3428000	have to be very low radioactivity.
3428000	3430000	In other words,
3430000	3432000	its natural isotope
3432000	3434000	has to be very low.
3434000	3436000	So there are not many materials we can use.
3436000	3438000	So if you can use some pure elements,
3438000	3440000	such as silicon
3440000	3442000	or aluminum,
3442000	3444000	not alloy or super heavy metals,
3444000	3446000	or super heavy metals,
3446000	3448000	you can do it.
3448000	3450000	That's a very good choice.
3450000	3452000	For example, can you accept gold and copper?
3452000	3454000	Yes, gold and copper.
3454000	3456000	But what do you want to use?
3456000	3458000	For example, silver.
3458000	3460000	It's weird.
3460000	3462000	If it's Terahertz,
3462000	3464000	gold and copper
3464000	3466000	can be used.
3466000	3468000	These are very common materials.
3468000	3470000	On the contrary,
3470000	3472000	it's rare to see
3472000	3474000	low radioactivity.
3474000	3476000	In Terahertz,
3476000	3478000	it doesn't seem to reach
3478000	3480000	such a high value.
3480000	3482000	Because usually
3482000	3484000	the radioactivity of
3484000	3486000	natural materials
3486000	3488000	decreases as the wavelength increases.
3488000	3490000	So its visible light
3490000	3492000	has the highest radioactivity
3492000	3494000	and decays slowly.
3494000	3496000	So in my mind,
3496000	3498000	I haven't seen anyone
3498000	3500000	use Terahertz materials
3500000	3502000	such as silicon,
3502000	3504000	gallium nitride,
3504000	3506000	or germanium,
3506000	3508000	such as silicon nitride
3508000	3510000	to make Terahertz components.
3510000	3512000	But there's a lot of metal.
3512000	3514000	Like I said, there's a lot of copper and gold.
3514000	3516000	Okay, thank you.
3516000	3518000	You're welcome.
3518000	3520000	What kind of radioactivity
3520000	3522000	did you mean
3522000	3524000	when you said
3524000	3526000	radioactivity?
3527000	3529000	No, I mean
3529000	3531000	the radioactivity of the material itself.
3531000	3533000	Like bananas
3533000	3535000	also have beta decay.
3535000	3537000	Oh, okay.
3537000	3539000	So you mean like tin
3539000	3541000	has a higher radioactivity?
3541000	3543000	Yes, if you want to use
3543000	3545000	something below the
3545000	3547000	elemental cycle,
3547000	3549000	it won't work.
3549000	3551000	The reason why it doesn't work is because
3551000	3553000	it naturally has the same value
3553000	3555000	and it's easy to change.
3555000	3557000	So if you put in a particle,
3557000	3559000	the particle will affect the quality
3559000	3561000	of the particle detector.
3561000	3563000	Because it will become noise.
3563000	3565000	Okay, got it.
3565000	3567000	Let me ask,
3567000	3569000	I didn't understand
3569000	3571000	what kind of materials
3571000	3573000	are usually used
3573000	3575000	in the microwave range.
3575000	3577000	Aluminum or gallium nitride?
3577000	3579000	No, if it's microwave,
3579000	3581000	the most common thing is copper.
3581000	3583000	Because copper can print
3583000	3585000	very cheaply.
3585000	3587000	So the printed pattern
3587000	3589000	is like the nanostructure
3589000	3591000	you just made?
3591000	3593000	Yes, it may not be nanoscale,
3593000	3595000	it may be millimeter scale.
3595000	3597000	Because the wavelength of microwave
3597000	3599000	may be dozens of millimeters
3599000	3601000	or even centimeters.
3601000	3603000	So it's actually easier to do.
3603000	3605000	Yes, so it's very easy to do.
3605000	3607000	And what they print
3607000	3609000	is a large area.
3609000	3611000	Maybe you can stick it
3611000	3613000	on the whole wall of your house.
3613000	3615000	Oh, got it.
3615000	3617000	What other materials
3617000	3619000	are also very effective
3619000	3621000	in doing the same thing?
3621000	3623000	The most common metal
3623000	3625000	we see right now
3625000	3627000	is
3627000	3629000	gold, silver, copper.
3629000	3631000	No, not copper.
3631000	3633000	Gold, silver, aluminum.
3633000	3635000	These three are the most common.
3635000	3637000	Oh, thank you.
3637000	3639000	Thank you.
3639000	3641000	And if it's...
3641000	3643000	No, you go first.
3643000	3645000	Yes, and if it's
3645000	3647000	electrolyte, it's actually quite a lot.
3647000	3649000	There should be more choices.
3649000	3651000	For example, as long as the resolution is high enough.
3651000	3653000	So silicon,
3653000	3655000	gallium nitride,
3655000	3657000	silicon nitride,
3657000	3659000	titanium oxide,
3659000	3661000	and gallium phosphate.
3661000	3663000	But gallium phosphate has
3663000	3665000	absorption, so the effect may not be as good.
3667000	3669000	You have a video
3669000	3671000	where you hit the light
3671000	3673000	and there's a left and right
3673000	3675000	rotation.
3683000	3685000	This one?
3685000	3687000	Yes.
3687000	3689000	This one?
3689000	3691000	No, the previous one.
3691000	3693000	The one you just mentioned.
3693000	3695000	The one you just showed.
3695000	3697000	Oh,
3697000	3699000	so how efficient is it?
3699000	3701000	If you hit the light
3701000	3703000	and it's linearly polarized,
3703000	3705000	it will be left and right
3705000	3707000	rotation.
3707000	3709000	In our experiment,
3709000	3711000	let me see.
3715000	3717000	In our experiment,
3717000	3719000	it's about
3719000	3721000	30 to 50%
3721000	3723000	efficient.
3723000	3725000	Okay,
3725000	3727000	so this is its wavelength.
3727000	3729000	Yes, the next one is wavelength.
3731000	3733000	Theoretically,
3733000	3735000	we expect it to be
3735000	3737000	about 70%.
3737000	3739000	But after we published this,
3739000	3741000	there's one thing
3741000	3743000	we didn't consider.
3743000	3745000	In our calculation,
3745000	3747000	we know that aluminum oxidizes easily.
3747000	3749000	So when it oxidizes, there will be 3 to 5 nanometers of aluminum on the surface.
3749000	3751000	This will affect its resonance
3751000	3753000	efficiency.
3753000	3755000	So this picture is about this.
3755000	3757000	This is someone else's work.
3757000	3759000	He's talking about the average pure aluminum.
3759000	3761000	If I design it,
3761000	3763000	its resonance is this high.
3763000	3765000	And then after the oxidation,
3765000	3767000	it will slowly
3767000	3769000	tilt to the right a little bit
3769000	3771000	and the efficiency will drop a little bit.
3771000	3773000	This is what we saw in our experiment.
3773000	3775000	Indeed, our simulation hopes that
3775000	3777000	its peak is here,
3777000	3779000	but our experiment results
3779000	3781000	show that the peak is
3781000	3783000	a little bit lower.
3783000	3785000	So we speculated that
3785000	3787000	the efficiency of this result
3787000	3789000	is not that high
3789000	3791000	because we didn't consider
3791000	3793000	the oxidation rate
3793000	3795000	when optimizing the structure.
3795000	3797000	The question I want to ask
3797000	3799000	is,
3799000	3801000	assuming that
3801000	3803000	the positive light
3803000	3805000	keeps decreasing
3805000	3807000	the energy,
3807000	3809000	how many lights
3809000	3811000	will it reflect?
3811000	3813000	Will there be
3813000	3815000	a state of
3815000	3817000	entanglement
3817000	3819000	when the light
3819000	3821000	is reflected
3821000	3823000	at the same time?
3823000	3825000	Or you don't care about this?
3825000	3827000	We don't care about this.
3827000	3829000	But what you said
3829000	3831000	is actually
3831000	3833000	what I want to do next.
3833000	3835000	Because
3835000	3837000	the most common
3837000	3839000	entangled photon source
3839000	3841000	is BBO,
3841000	3843000	which is a non-linear crystal
3843000	3845000	to produce entanglement.
3845000	3847000	But it is a entanglement.
3847000	3849000	So I thought about this
3849000	3851000	at that time.
3851000	3853000	If it is an entanglement of
3853000	3855000	both H and V,
3855000	3857000	I will pass the light
3857000	3859000	through this source.
3859000	3861000	What is H plus V?
3861000	3863000	H is horizontal, V is vertical.
3863000	3865000	This is the entanglement of X and Y.
3867000	3869000	If the reflected light
3869000	3871000	is H plus V,
3871000	3873000	can I have
3873000	3875000	a special entanglement
3875000	3877000	at the same time?
3877000	3879000	I'm not sure about this.
3879000	3881000	But I want to do this.
3881000	3883000	Because I'm not sure
3883000	3885000	if the reflected light is H or V,
3885000	3887000	I can't be sure
3887000	3889000	if the reflected light
3889000	3891000	is right or left.
3891000	3893000	If the reflected light is H,
3893000	3895000	the reflected light is left or right.
3895000	3897000	If the reflected light is V,
3897000	3899000	the reflected light is left or right.
3899000	3901000	I think
3901000	3903000	this is possible.
3903000	3905000	Because this kind of source
3905000	3907000	has already been done.
3907000	3909000	We mainly use a bunch of photons
3909000	3911000	to integrate with this structure.
3911000	3913000	If I only have a single photon,
3913000	3915000	it will also work.
3915000	3917000	If a single photon
3917000	3919000	also works,
3919000	3921000	it should be possible.
3921000	3923000	It should be possible.
3927000	3929000	We should work together
3929000	3931000	after you finish this.
3931000	3933000	What I'm going to do next
3933000	3935000	is to transfer
3935000	3937000	the entanglement photon
3937000	3939000	to the spin of the quantum dot.
3941000	3943000	So you're doing quantum mechanics?
3943000	3945000	Yes.
3945000	3947000	My next project
3947000	3949000	will be
3949000	3951000	what I just said.
3951000	3953000	But the entanglement
3953000	3955000	is one is vertical
3955000	3957000	and the other is horizontal.
3957000	3959000	But if
3959000	3961000	we can make entanglement
3961000	3963000	of left and right,
3963000	3965000	we should
3965000	3967000	make it first
3967000	3969000	and think about it
3969000	3971000	after it's confirmed.
3977000	3979000	Okay.
3979000	3981000	Is there any question?
3981000	3983000	Audience?
3983000	3985000	Audience?
3985000	3987000	It seems like no.
3987000	3989000	Thank you, Bing Jie.
3989000	3991000	Thank you.
3991000	3993000	You did a great job.
3993000	3995000	You have a good grasp of the time.
3995000	3997000	I talked too fast
3997000	3999000	at the end.
3999000	4001000	If you have any questions,
4001000	4003000	you can tell me.
4003000	4005000	Right.
4005000	4007000	I want to ask
4007000	4009000	if you really made this
4009000	4011000	or you didn't
4011000	4013000	do this in Caltech?
4013000	4015000	I didn't do this in Caltech.
4015000	4017000	But...
4017000	4019000	Don't ask Cai.
4019000	4021000	Because if
4021000	4023000	we make this...
4023000	4025000	Yes.
4025000	4027000	We should...
4027000	4029000	We're planning to
4029000	4031000	make this
4031000	4033000	recently.
4033000	4035000	Yes.
4035000	4037000	Do you have a good approach?
4037000	4039000	Or you already have some approaches?
4039000	4041000	Like you said, BBO.
4041000	4043000	But BBO can only generate
4043000	4045000	linear light.
4045000	4047000	So I said it can only generate
4047000	4049000	linear light.
4049000	4051000	Yes.
4051000	4053000	If it can generate...
4053000	4055000	If you want to generate
4055000	4057000	spin, you need
4057000	4059000	circular polarizer.
4059000	4061000	Yes.
4061000	4063000	Yes.
4063000	4065000	That's what we're thinking.
4065000	4067000	No problem. We can talk about it.
4067000	4069000	Okay.
4069000	4071000	Okay.
4071000	4073000	That's all for
4073000	4075000	today.
4075000	4077000	Thank you.
4077000	4079000	Thank you, everyone.
4079000	4081000	Bye-bye.
