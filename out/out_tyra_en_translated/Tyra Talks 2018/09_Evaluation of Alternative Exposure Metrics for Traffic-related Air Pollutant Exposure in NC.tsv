0	5000	Hi everyone, welcome to this week's TARA Talk.
5000	7000	The title of today's talk is
7000	11000	The Evaluation of Alternative Exposure Metrics
11000	14000	for Traffic-Related Air Pollutant Exposure
14000	16000	in North Carolina.
16000	18000	Let's welcome our speaker today,
18000	21000	Zhang Shiying, or you can call her Zhang-C.
21000	25000	Let's briefly introduce the speaker's information.
25000	30000	She's currently working at Sonoma Technology,
30000	34000	a company that specializes in this area.
34000	41000	She did her Ph.D. at UNC-North Carolina-Champaign Hill.
41000	44000	Before coming to the United States,
44000	46000	she was a master's student at the University of Texas,
46000	48000	then a master's student at the University of Texas,
48000	50000	then a master's student at the University of Texas.
50000	55000	She's currently working on a topic that's closely related to her research.
55000	59000	Let's welcome our speaker, Zhang Shiying.
62000	64000	Hi everyone.
64000	66000	Before I start, I want to show you my T-shirt.
66000	68000	I won last year.
68000	71000	My name is Zhang Shiying.
71000	73000	You can call me Zhang-C.
73000	77000	Today's topic is
77000	81000	how to use air quality models or model-based methods
81000	85000	to assess human exposure to air pollution.
85000	88000	I'm going to focus on the traffic pollutants.
88000	92000	A few days ago, the host asked me to talk about
92000	95000	the related issues of air pollution.
95000	98000	But because our company has a strict process
98000	103000	of reviewing things and publications,
103000	105000	I didn't have time to make a new video.
105000	108000	So I'm going to talk about my last year's video.
108000	113000	This photo was taken in the United States in 1948.
113000	115000	Why is air pollution important?
115000	120000	This photo was taken in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1948
120000	122000	called Donora.
122000	125000	The photo on the right was taken at noon.
125000	129000	You can see that it wasn't bad weather or raining that day.
129000	132000	No, it was a normal noon.
132000	135000	The streetlights were all on and the sky looked dark.
135000	138000	Air pollution was very serious at that time.
138000	140000	After that incident,
140000	142000	40 people died in the town.
142000	147000	50% of the residents suffered from
147000	152000	serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
152000	156000	People said that it was very difficult to breathe at that time.
156000	161000	This incident caused a lot of resonance in the United States.
161000	164000	People said that air pollution was very serious.
164000	166000	After that incident,
166000	168000	there were a lot of social movements,
168000	171000	protests, and government measures.
171000	173000	Finally, in 1967,
173000	177000	the United States passed the Clean Air Act,
177000	182000	which is the most important law in the United States.
182000	185000	The Clean Air Act was finally passed,
185000	187000	and control began.
187000	189000	Was it useful?
190000	192000	The answer is yes.
192000	194000	Let's take a look at this picture.
194000	196000	The word may be too small to see clearly,
196000	197000	but it doesn't matter.
197000	201000	This is basically the annual air pollution concentration.
201000	204000	This is a measured situation.
204000	206000	I remember I took this.
206000	209000	It should be LA.
209000	215000	Each line represents a different city or county.
215000	216000	You can see this trend.
216000	220000	Every year, air pollution is decreasing.
220000	222000	So it's actually useful.
222000	224000	Since air pollution has decreased,
224000	227000	what are we doing to study air pollution?
227000	229000	It's already so low.
229000	231000	What are we doing here?
231000	233000	The two most important things now
233000	236000	are not only in the United States,
236000	237000	but also in the world.
237000	239000	The two most important air pollutants are
239000	241000	1. Smelly sheep
241000	243000	2. PM2.5
243000	246000	PM2.5 is called a particulate matter
246000	249000	with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.
252000	254000	I won't go into detail.
254000	255000	But basically,
255000	259000	smelly sheep is not directly released.
259000	262000	You won't have something that says it's smelly sheep.
262000	263000	It won't be like that.
263000	265000	The formation of smelly sheep is secondary.
265000	267000	In other words, it's not a smelly sheep gas.
267000	269000	These gases become smelly sheep
269000	272000	after chemical reactions in the air.
272000	275000	These gases that are released
275000	280000	may not be so harmful to the human body.
280000	281000	But after it's released,
281000	284000	it becomes smelly sheep
284000	287000	and is very harmful to the human body.
287000	291000	PM2.5 is simply a very, very small particle.
291000	293000	This is a strand of hair.
293000	295000	We all love to use this picture.
295000	297000	This is a strand of hair.
297000	301000	PM10 is a diameter smaller than 10 micrograms.
301000	302000	It's about this big.
302000	304000	It's a blue circle.
304000	306000	PM2.5 is this small.
306000	309000	What does being small have to do with it?
309000	312000	Being small means that it's easy to pass through your respiratory tract.
312000	314000	It can go deeper.
314000	315000	It can go into the lungs.
315000	317000	It will cause respiratory diseases
317000	319000	and even cardiovascular diseases.
319000	321000	Let's skip this one first.
321000	323000	This is a study
323000	325000	that has been very active in recent years
325000	328000	called Global Burden of Disease.
328000	330000	They publish every year
330000	335000	the current ranking of causes of death
335000	337000	and how many people die.
337000	339000	Why is air pollution important?
339000	342000	After the Clean Air Act,
342000	345000	the concentration of pollutants decreased every year.
345000	347000	But if you look at the whole world,
347000	350000	the cause of death from air pollution
350000	356000	is ranked fourth in the world.
357000	363000	Air pollution is very, very, very important.
363000	372000	This is a paper from Nature in 2015.
372000	376000	They divided the world into countries
376000	380000	and gave the most serious air pollution
381000	389000	emission sector.
389000	391000	They predicted how many emission sectors
391000	392000	would cause death.
392000	394000	So if you look at this table,
394000	396000	there are different pollutants in the horizontal axis.
396000	398000	For example, we have residential energy.
398000	402000	Air pollution caused by using energy.
402000	406000	Agriculture causes air pollution.
406000	411000	Land traffic causes air pollution.
411000	413000	You can see the two red boxes,
413000	415000	USA and Germany.
415000	417000	These two countries
417000	419000	cause the most death
419000	425000	in the traffic sector.
425000	429000	These are some introductions.
429000	433000	What am I going to talk about today?
433000	438000	This paper was published in 2015.
438000	451000	In terms of environmental epidemiology,
451000	454000	it is important to look at the relationship
454000	458000	between diseases and air pollution.
458000	460000	You want to use air pollution variability
460000	462000	to explain whether there is a disease
462000	464000	or whether there is a disease.
464000	467000	In this case,
467000	470000	if there are 10 people today,
470000	473000	5 people have respiratory diseases,
473000	474000	5 people do not.
474000	477000	I wonder if this is related to air pollution.
477000	482000	When I was doing this statistical model,
482000	484000	I found that these 10 people
484000	488000	were exposed to the same amount of air pollution.
488000	490000	For example, they were all exposed to
490000	493000	5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5.
493000	494000	At this time,
494000	496000	the model can't see anything.
496000	497000	5 people are sick, 5 people are not sick,
497000	499000	but everyone is exposed to the same amount of air pollution.
499000	502000	This means that you can't do anything.
502000	505000	This paper talks about
505000	508000	the past epidemiological studies,
508000	513000	the past studies that link diseases
513000	515000	and air pollution.
515000	519000	What can be improved?
519000	521000	This slide has a lot of words.
521000	523000	Basically, the most important thing is
523000	525000	the Health Effect Institute.
525000	527000	This is a 2009 paper.
527000	528000	The Health Effect Institute
528000	531000	is a very famous institution
531000	534000	that studies health effects.
534000	540000	They use data from the American Cancer Society
540000	545000	to re-analyze and link
545000	550000	the relationship between air pollution and death.
550000	552000	As I said before,
552000	553000	when you do this,
553000	555000	you need to have all the information
555000	557000	about whether you are sick or not.
557000	558000	Secondly, you need to have data
558000	560000	about the exposure of air pollution.
560000	563000	How do they do the air pollution exposure data?
563000	569000	Basically, they do it in this area.
569000	571000	Let me translate it for you.
571000	574000	They have a monitoring station
574000	576000	set up by the U.S. Department of Environment
576000	578000	in the United States.
578000	580000	They have a station on both sides,
580000	582000	an air pollution station.
582000	584000	Their approach is
584000	586000	for example,
586000	588000	in San Francisco,
588000	590000	I have 10 stations.
590000	593000	I collect the data of these 10 stations
593000	595000	and calculate the average.
595000	598000	I say that everyone living in San Francisco
598000	603000	has the same air pollution exposure.
603000	605000	That is to say,
605000	607000	everyone living in San Francisco
607000	609000	has the same air pollution exposure.
609000	612000	This is the same as what I just said.
612000	613000	For example,
613000	615000	everyone lives in San Francisco.
615000	616000	Some people are sick.
616000	617000	Some people are not sick.
617000	622000	When I do this epidemiological analysis,
622000	624000	I tell my models that
624000	626000	whether they are sick or not,
626000	627000	as long as they live in San Francisco,
627000	630000	their exposure is this high.
630000	632000	At this time,
632000	633000	you can see that
633000	635000	there seems to be a problem.
638000	640000	Another question is
640000	643000	that the U.S. Department of Environment
643000	646000	set up these stations in the United States
646000	648000	to measure air pollution.
648000	649000	However,
649000	652000	many air pollution is not regional.
652000	654000	It does not mean that
654000	655000	a station can represent
655000	658000	the concentration of pollutants in the entire area.
658000	660000	The table I listed here
660000	663000	is the distance from the road.
663000	665000	The unit is meters.
665000	668000	The axis is normalized to roadside.
668000	669000	That is to say,
669000	671000	the concentration of air pollution
671000	673000	is standardized,
673000	676000	which is the concentration of two roads on the roadside.
676000	679000	On the left side of the table,
679000	680000	you can see that
680000	681000	so many pollutants
681000	684000	actually have a very steep gradient.
684000	685000	That is to say,
685000	688000	between 100 and 150 meters,
688000	691000	the concentration has dropped by almost 60%.
693000	694000	That is to say,
694000	697000	the road distance is only a few meters.
697000	698000	There is such a difference in concentration
698000	700000	within 100 meters.
700000	702000	Can you see such a difference
702000	703000	in concentration
703000	704000	in a station
704000	707000	in a certain corner of the city?
707000	708000	You can't see it.
709000	710000	The first one,
710000	711000	you use that kind of station
711000	714000	to represent exposure,
714000	716000	the exposure of human body to pollution.
716000	718000	You may not be able to catch
718000	721000	the hot spot in the urban.
721000	722000	Hello, I have a question.
722000	723000	Please go ahead.
723000	725000	The first one,
725000	726000	the horizontal axis is the distance,
726000	728000	and the vertical axis is the concentration.
728000	730000	In the first few meters,
730000	734000	their gradient looks almost the same.
734000	736000	But you have,
736000	739000	for example, CO, CON,
739000	745000	and NO, NO, and N.
745000	747000	Don't they have a lot of difference in their atomic mass?
747000	748000	If I take one,
748000	750000	I think it's just an expansion.
750000	752000	Shouldn't the gradient be a lot different?
752000	754000	Because there is still a chemical reaction.
754000	756000	CO may not have much reaction.
756000	759000	NO and NOX may have chemical reactions.
759000	760000	It will generate other things.
760000	761000	So it may laugh faster,
761000	763000	laugh slower, not necessarily.
763000	764000	OK, OK.
764000	765000	Maybe it's all gas.
765000	766000	Even particles are different.
766000	767000	Particles may have
767000	769000	some different characteristics.
769000	770000	I want to add that
770000	772000	you have to consider the gradient.
772000	773000	So,
773000	775000	there is a physical problem.
775000	778000	So there is a chemical process.
778000	779000	That's right.
779000	780000	OK.
782000	783000	OK.
783000	784000	We just talked about outdoor.
784000	785000	For example,
785000	786000	you use outdoor,
786000	789000	you use the concentration of the side station beam
789000	790000	to represent the pollution source.
790000	791000	First, you can't catch the hot spot.
791000	792000	Like this kind of traffic pollution source.
792000	793000	If someone lives,
793000	795000	if someone's house is close to the road,
795000	796000	you can't catch it.
796000	797000	But if it's far away,
797000	798000	you can't catch it.
798000	799000	Second,
799000	800000	in fact,
800000	801000	most people
801000	803000	spend more time indoors
803000	806000	than they spend outdoors.
806000	808000	This is a...
808000	810000	It should be a Canadian study.
810000	811000	They looked at
811000	812000	how much time
812000	813000	children spend
813000	815000	indoors or outdoors.
815000	818000	I used the two red boxes.
818000	819000	You can see
819000	821000	one is in winter,
821000	822000	one is in summer.
822000	823000	In indoor time,
824000	826000	67% in winter,
826000	828000	72% in summer.
828000	829000	It means that
829000	830000	most people
830000	832000	spend more time indoors
832000	834000	than they spend outdoors.
834000	835000	At this time,
835000	837000	you use outdoor pollutants
837000	838000	to represent...
838000	841000	The concentration of the beam
841000	843000	to represent human exposure
843000	844000	may also be a problem
844000	846000	because everyone is indoors.
846000	847000	Right?
847000	849000	So that's why
849000	850000	there is this paper.
850000	851000	The first one is
851000	852000	Central Sites.
852000	853000	Central Sites
853000	854000	means
854000	855000	those
855000	857000	U.S. environmental protection agencies.
857000	858000	They can't catch
858000	860000	these local sources.
860000	861000	Local sources can be
861000	862000	traffic
862000	863000	or any
863000	864000	small sources
864000	866000	next to your house.
866000	868000	They may not be able to...
868000	870000	The second one is
870000	872000	using outdoor air pollution
872000	873000	to represent exposure
873000	875000	may not be very representative
875000	877000	because most people are indoors.
877000	878000	In theory,
878000	880000	you should use indoor air pollution
880000	883000	to represent exposure.
883000	886000	The goal of this paper
886000	888000	is to use model-based...
888000	889000	That is to say,
889000	891000	use model-based methods
891000	894000	to predict...
894000	895000	to estimate
895000	897000	the intensity of indoor and outdoor
897000	898000	and use them
898000	900000	to represent human exposure
900000	901000	to see
901000	903000	how different they are.
903000	905000	We can quantify
905000	909000	these potential exposure errors
910000	912000	This is the model I used.
912000	915000	The three yellow boxes
915000	918000	are STOKE, STOK, R-Line,
918000	920000	and LBL AR models.
920000	923000	These three are models.
923000	924000	STOKE stands for
924000	926000	Spacetime Ordinary Crating.
926000	927000	It represents...
927000	928000	It's actually
928000	930000	an internal and external
930000	931000	technology.
931000	932000	That technology
932000	933000	uses...
933000	934000	Its input data
934000	935000	is the data
935000	938000	from these environmental protection agencies.
938000	940000	We use that data
940000	942000	to push it inwards and outwards
942000	943000	to the census block level.
943000	945000	Census block is...
945000	946000	Imagine...
946000	947000	It's a block.
947000	948000	When you're walking,
948000	950000	there's a block on the road.
950000	951000	It could be a block.
951000	953000	So we push those intensities
953000	954000	inwards and outwards
954000	956000	to these block levels.
956000	958000	This represents
958000	960000	a background level.
960000	961000	I use the data
961000	964000	from the Central Monitoring Site
964000	965000	to push it inwards and outwards
965000	966000	to these places.
966000	967000	But it could miss
967000	968000	these local sources,
968000	970000	such as traffic.
970000	972000	R-Line is a line source
972000	974000	dispersion model.
974000	975000	It's used to predict
975000	977000	traffic-related pollution.
977000	978000	It basically
978000	979000	takes all roads
979000	982000	as a line.
982000	983000	It uses
983000	984000	a simple
984000	985000	high-definition
985000	987000	method
987000	988000	to model
988000	990000	traffic pollution.
990000	992000	It represents local source.
992000	993000	We define local source
993000	995000	as traffic pollution.
995000	997000	The last LVL-AR model
997000	1000000	is Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
1000000	1002000	Air Exchange Rate Model.
1002000	1004000	It's used to
1004000	1006000	predict air exchange rate,
1006000	1008000	which is the air exchange rate
1008000	1011000	for each household.
1011000	1012000	For example,
1012000	1013000	how long
1013000	1014000	will the air
1014000	1015000	in your house
1015000	1016000	be exchanged
1016000	1018000	with the air outside?
1018000	1020000	Using these three models
1020000	1022000	and combining them,
1023000	1025000	we can calculate
1025000	1027000	the six blue boxes.
1027000	1029000	These six boxes
1029000	1031000	represent
1031000	1033000	exposure.
1033000	1034000	We call it
1034000	1035000	exposure metric.
1035000	1036000	We use these six boxes
1036000	1037000	to represent
1037000	1039000	air exposure.
1039000	1040000	What are they?
1040000	1041000	The first one is
1041000	1042000	outdoor stoke,
1042000	1043000	which is
1043000	1045000	outdoor air exposure.
1045000	1047000	It's called stoke.
1047000	1048000	It represents background.
1048000	1049000	Remember,
1049000	1050000	the source of this thing
1050000	1051000	is Central Monitoring Site,
1051000	1052000	which is
1052000	1054000	the U.S. Department of Environment.
1054000	1055000	The second one is
1055000	1056000	outdoor on-road.
1056000	1057000	It represents
1057000	1059000	air pollution
1059000	1061000	caused by
1061000	1063000	traffic.
1063000	1065000	It's modeled
1065000	1067000	by R-Line.
1067000	1069000	Combining these two things,
1069000	1070000	outdoor stoke
1070000	1071000	represents background
1071000	1072000	because it can't
1072000	1074000	capture local source.
1074000	1076000	If you add these two things,
1076000	1078000	you get total exposure.
1078000	1079000	We call it
1079000	1080000	outdoor hybrid,
1080000	1081000	which is hybrid between
1081000	1083000	R-Line and stoke.
1083000	1084000	These three things
1084000	1085000	represent
1085000	1087000	outdoor concentration.
1087000	1088000	Using these three
1088000	1089000	outdoor concentrations
1089000	1090000	as a base,
1090000	1091000	we can combine
1091000	1092000	the air exchange rate.
1092000	1093000	The air exchange rate
1093000	1094000	from the LBL
1094000	1095000	air exchange rate model
1095000	1096000	on the left
1096000	1097000	can be used
1097000	1098000	to calculate
1098000	1099000	the corresponding
1099000	1101000	indoor concentration.
1101000	1102000	We use outdoor concentration
1102000	1103000	to calculate
1103000	1104000	indoor concentration.
1104000	1105000	We have
1105000	1107000	three other metrics,
1107000	1108000	indoor on-road,
1108000	1109000	indoor stoke,
1109000	1110000	and indoor hybrid.
1110000	1112000	There are six metrics in total.
1112000	1114000	I have a question.
1114000	1116000	Go ahead.
1116000	1118000	Do you consider
1118000	1120000	opening and closing
1120000	1121000	the window
1121000	1123000	or just
1123000	1124000	looking at
1124000	1126000	the exchange rate
1126000	1127000	under the air condition?
1127000	1129000	You'll see it later.
1129000	1131000	We'll talk about it later.
1131000	1133000	We'll talk about it later.
1133000	1135000	This slide
1135000	1137000	is about R-Line.
1137000	1139000	R-Line is a dispersion model.
1139000	1141000	You have to use R-Line.
1141000	1143000	In any air pollution model,
1143000	1145000	the most important thing
1145000	1147000	is emission.
1147000	1148000	This slide talks about
1148000	1150000	how emission is calculated
1150000	1152000	and where the data comes from.
1152000	1154000	This is not
1154000	1155000	too important
1155000	1156000	to everyone.
1156000	1157000	Let's not talk about it.
1157000	1158000	This is stoke.
1158000	1160000	It's the same as what I just said.
1160000	1161000	It is an
1161000	1162000	internal and external
1162000	1164000	critting technology.
1164000	1165000	It uses
1165000	1167000	the U.S. Environmental Protection
1167000	1169000	Air Quality System,
1169000	1170000	or AQS,
1170000	1172000	which is
1172000	1174000	the big test stations.
1174000	1175000	Finally,
1175000	1177000	these two things are added up.
1177000	1179000	This is
1179000	1181000	how to calculate
1181000	1183000	the corresponding
1183000	1185000	indoor concentration
1185000	1186000	of the outdoor concentration.
1186000	1188000	This is a very simple
1188000	1190000	mass balance model.
1190000	1192000	The internal
1192000	1194000	concentration
1194000	1196000	and time change
1196000	1198000	are determined by these terms.
1198000	1200000	The first is
1200000	1202000	the outdoor concentration
1202000	1204000	brought in by the
1204000	1206000	air exchange
1206000	1208000	and the
1208000	1210000	internal concentration
1210000	1212000	of the outdoor pollution.
1212000	1214000	This includes
1214000	1216000	deposition,
1216000	1218000	which is the rate
1218000	1220000	of indoor air
1220000	1222000	being excreted.
1222000	1224000	Here are some factors.
1224000	1226000	The penetration factor
1226000	1228000	is the rate of
1228000	1230000	incoming air.
1230000	1232000	The deposition rate
1232000	1234000	is the rate of
1234000	1236000	incoming air.
1236000	1238000	The penetration rate
1238000	1240000	is 1.
1240000	1242000	The deposition rate
1242000	1244000	is 0.5 per hour.
1248000	1250000	The PEM
1250000	1252000	is the rate
1252000	1254000	of incoming air.
1254000	1256000	The particle
1256000	1258000	is lower
1258000	1260000	and the deposition rate
1260000	1262000	is lower.
1262000	1264000	This is
1264000	1266000	the question
1266000	1268000	from the instructor.
1268000	1270000	AER model
1270000	1272000	is to calculate
1272000	1274000	the window.
1274000	1276000	The answer is no.
1276000	1278000	This study
1278000	1280000	is at the census block level.
1280000	1282000	I remember
1282000	1284000	there are
1284000	1286000	330,000 houses
1286000	1288000	in this area.
1288000	1290000	In theory,
1290000	1292000	if you want to use
1292000	1294000	the model,
1294000	1296000	including the window
1296000	1298000	and air conditioning,
1298000	1300000	you won't have the data.
1300000	1302000	Because I can't go to
1302000	1304000	330,000 houses
1304000	1306000	one by one
1306000	1308000	without the data.
1308000	1310000	So we need the simplest
1310000	1312000	model.
1312000	1314000	We don't even consider
1314000	1316000	where the house is.
1316000	1318000	What is the air exchange rate?
1318000	1320000	I won't
1320000	1322000	explain the model
1322000	1324000	in detail.
1324000	1326000	All the parameters,
1326000	1328000	such as how many years
1328000	1330000	the house has been built,
1330000	1332000	how big the floor area is,
1332000	1334000	you need this model.
1334000	1336000	In the past,
1336000	1338000	this model was used
1338000	1340000	to look at 10 or 15 houses.
1340000	1342000	But now
1342000	1344000	I need to look at 330,000 houses.
1344000	1346000	I can't do that.
1346000	1348000	So I need to look for the data.
1348000	1350000	I use the County Property Assessment Record.
1350000	1352000	I can have
1352000	1354000	the data
1354000	1356000	for each house.
1356000	1358000	This is free
1358000	1360000	in North Carolina.
1360000	1362000	It's expensive in California.
1362000	1364000	I'll give you $100.
1364000	1366000	I won't explain
1366000	1368000	the rest of the data.
1368000	1370000	It's basically public available data.
1372000	1374000	There's one thing here.
1376000	1378000	For each census block,
1378000	1380000	I sample
1380000	1382000	about 10 houses.
1382000	1384000	I use the 10 houses
1384000	1386000	to represent the census block.
1386000	1388000	I don't just make 330,000 houses
1388000	1390000	and make them all.
1390000	1392000	This is my modeling domain.
1392000	1394000	These three counties
1394000	1396000	in North Carolina.
1396000	1398000	Orange County is where UNC is.
1398000	1400000	I used to live here.
1400000	1402000	Durham is where
1402000	1404000	Duke University is.
1404000	1406000	Don't go there.
1408000	1410000	This is
1410000	1412000	a snapshot.
1412000	1414000	I use
1414000	1416000	the six exposure metrics
1416000	1418000	I mentioned earlier.
1418000	1420000	This is the map.
1420000	1422000	It's shown here.
1424000	1426000	A is the Outdoor Stoke.
1426000	1428000	It uses
1428000	1430000	the data from the station.
1432000	1434000	B is Outdoor Hybrid.
1434000	1436000	It uses R-Line,
1436000	1438000	the traffic source,
1438000	1440000	and the background,
1440000	1442000	the interpolation
1442000	1444000	data.
1444000	1446000	The two below
1446000	1448000	represent
1448000	1450000	the air quality field
1450000	1452000	in the simple
1452000	1454000	indoor mass balance model.
1458000	1460000	Let's look at the Outdoor Stoke
1460000	1462000	in the upper left corner.
1462000	1464000	Most of the concentration
1464000	1466000	is between
1466000	1468000	24 and 27.
1468000	1470000	There's no spatial
1470000	1472000	variation.
1472000	1474000	That's it.
1474000	1476000	I remember
1476000	1478000	there are only
1478000	1480000	two or three stations
1480000	1482000	in this area.
1482000	1484000	If you have two or three stations
1484000	1486000	with interpolation data,
1486000	1488000	you can only achieve
1488000	1490000	this much.
1490000	1492000	Let's look at the Outdoor Hybrid.
1492000	1494000	If you add the local source
1494000	1496000	data,
1496000	1498000	you can see
1498000	1500000	the map
1500000	1502000	of air pollution.
1502000	1504000	You can tell
1504000	1506000	the difference.
1506000	1508000	Let's look at
1508000	1510000	C, the Indoor Stoke.
1510000	1512000	The station
1512000	1514000	is a transportation source.
1514000	1516000	There are different types of stations.
1516000	1518000	Some are in the background,
1518000	1520000	such as National Park.
1520000	1522000	Some are near the traffic.
1522000	1524000	That's right.
1524000	1526000	We chose the background station
1526000	1528000	for this study.
1528000	1530000	We didn't use urban stations
1530000	1532000	for this study.
1532000	1534000	Did you use
1534000	1536000	the transportation model
1536000	1538000	of R-Line?
1538000	1540000	Yes, I did.
1540000	1542000	I gave the model evaluation
1542000	1544000	in my last talk.
1544000	1546000	Thank you.
1548000	1550000	Let's look at
1550000	1552000	Indoor Stoke.
1552000	1554000	A is the input of C.
1554000	1556000	C and A
1556000	1558000	are compared.
1558000	1560000	First,
1560000	1562000	the color scale is lower.
1562000	1564000	Second,
1564000	1566000	there are more spatial variations.
1566000	1568000	The concentration
1568000	1570000	of C is between
1570000	1572000	7 and 14.
1572000	1574000	Compared to
1574000	1576000	the Outdoor Stoke,
1576000	1578000	it's between 24 and 27.
1578000	1580000	Where do these spatial variations
1580000	1582000	come from?
1582000	1584000	They come from
1584000	1586000	the air exchange rate
1586000	1588000	of different stations.
1588000	1590000	What does this mean?
1590000	1592000	It means that
1592000	1594000	if you only use the Outdoor Stoke,
1594000	1596000	which is what they did,
1596000	1598000	they used that method
1598000	1600000	to predict
1600000	1602000	the exposure.
1602000	1604000	They used that method
1604000	1606000	to estimate the exposure.
1606000	1608000	On the right,
1608000	1610000	you can see
1610000	1612000	the concentration of local source.
1612000	1614000	On the bottom,
1614000	1616000	you can see the map
1616000	1618000	of the Indoor Stoke.
1618000	1620000	You can tell the difference
1620000	1622000	just by looking at the map.
1622000	1624000	The last one,
1624000	1626000	D, is the Indoor Stoke.
1626000	1628000	The input source is B.
1628000	1630000	B to D.
1630000	1632000	You can see
1632000	1634000	the variations are the same.
1634000	1636000	High concentration
1636000	1638000	near the road,
1638000	1640000	low concentration far from the road.
1640000	1642000	However, the concentration
1642000	1644000	on the top
1644000	1646000	is between 90 and 100.
1646000	1648000	On the bottom,
1648000	1650000	it's less than that.
1650000	1652000	When you go to the Indoor Stoke,
1652000	1654000	the absolute concentration
1654000	1656000	will decrease.
1656000	1658000	Here,
1658000	1660000	I'm looking at...
1660000	1662000	Hello.
1662000	1664000	I have a small question
1664000	1666000	about the front page.
1666000	1668000	This is basically a 2D model,
1668000	1670000	right?
1670000	1672000	You can also
1672000	1674000	make it vertical.
1674000	1676000	You can have different heights.
1676000	1678000	Mine is 2 meters
1678000	1680000	away from the ground.
1680000	1682000	2 meters away from the ground.
1682000	1684000	I'm just curious.
1684000	1686000	Is the terrain near here flat?
1686000	1688000	Or is there a hill?
1688000	1690000	This area is quite flat.
1690000	1692000	This area is quite flat.
1692000	1694000	It's a hill to the west.
1694000	1696000	It's quite flat here.
1696000	1698000	Here,
1698000	1700000	I'm using a box plot
1700000	1702000	to show
1702000	1704000	the average concentration.
1704000	1706000	The concentration distribution
1706000	1708000	by pollutant.
1708000	1710000	I forgot
1710000	1712000	what I was going to say.
1712000	1714000	Let's start with CO.
1714000	1716000	Let's start with A.
1716000	1718000	If we only look at...
1718000	1720000	Let's compare
1720000	1722000	the black and white boxes.
1722000	1724000	The black represents
1724000	1726000	the outdoor concentration.
1726000	1728000	The white represents
1728000	1730000	the indoor concentration.
1730000	1732000	You can see that
1732000	1734000	CO is about the same.
1734000	1736000	Look at Stokes.
1736000	1738000	Outdoor and indoor
1738000	1740000	have similar distribution.
1740000	1742000	Why is it similar?
1742000	1744000	It's because
1744000	1746000	the penetration factor
1746000	1748000	and deposition factor
1748000	1750000	of CO is 1.
1750000	1752000	The deposition rate
1752000	1754000	of CO is 0.
1754000	1756000	That's why the indoor and outdoor
1756000	1758000	have similar distribution.
1758000	1760000	Look at Knox.
1760000	1762000	The penetration factor is 1,
1762000	1764000	but the deposition rate is 0.5.
1764000	1766000	You can see that
1766000	1768000	the indoor concentration is lower
1768000	1770000	than the outdoor concentration.
1770000	1772000	It's about half.
1772000	1774000	In the same situation,
1774000	1776000	PM and EC
1776000	1778000	have similar distribution.
1778000	1780000	The indoor concentration is half
1780000	1782000	If the outdoor concentration
1782000	1784000	represents the deposition rate,
1784000	1786000	the PM will stay in the indoor
1786000	1788000	for longer than the deposition rate.
1788000	1790000	After comparing the black and white boxes,
1790000	1792000	let's compare
1792000	1794000	Stokes and Unrow.
1794000	1796000	Stokes and Unrow.
1796000	1798000	The two black and white boxes
1798000	1800000	on the left
1800000	1802000	and the two black and white boxes
1802000	1804000	on the middle.
1804000	1806000	First, look at
1806000	1808000	CO and Knox.
1808000	1810000	CO and Knox.
1810000	1812000	You can see that
1812000	1814000	Stokes is much higher than Unrow
1814000	1816000	in terms of CO.
1816000	1818000	Knox is closer.
1818000	1820000	Why?
1820000	1822000	Because of traffic pollution,
1822000	1824000	the deposition rate of
1824000	1826000	gas cars is very high.
1826000	1828000	I don't have the table here,
1828000	1830000	but I remember
1830000	1832000	that in some places,
1832000	1834000	the deposition rate of gas cars
1834000	1836000	may be up to 40%,
1836000	1838000	which means
1838000	1840000	because gas cars
1840000	1842000	deposit a lot of pollutants,
1842000	1844000	the deposition rate of gas cars
1844000	1846000	is relatively high.
1846000	1848000	In particular,
1848000	1850000	the deposition rate of Stokes and Unrow
1850000	1852000	is actually very low,
1852000	1854000	because the deposition rate
1854000	1856000	of primary PM2
1856000	1858000	is only up to 5%.
1858000	1860000	is only up to 5%.
1860000	1862000	However,
1862000	1864000	the deposition rate of EC
1864000	1866000	is smaller.
1866000	1868000	This is the consequence of
1868000	1870000	the combustion of PM2.5.
1870000	1872000	Because of the combustion of engines,
1872000	1874000	it will burn slightly higher.
1874000	1878000	Here I am looking at
1878000	1880000	the spatial variation
1880000	1882000	after talking about density.
1882000	1884000	I have calculated
1884000	1886000	a value of
1886000	1888000	spatial coefficient
1888000	1890000	of variation.
1890000	1892000	The higher the value
1892000	1894000	of spatial coefficient,
1894000	1896000	the higher the value of
1896000	1898000	spatial variation.
1898000	1900000	What we want to see
1900000	1902000	is whether these things
1902000	1904000	represent exposure.
1904000	1906000	Most people
1906000	1908000	use Stoke's
1908000	1910000	outdoor concentration
1910000	1912000	to represent
1912000	1914000	exposure.
1914000	1916000	The black box
1916000	1918000	on the far left
1918000	1920000	is Stoke's
1920000	1922000	indoor concentration.
1922000	1924000	For example,
1924000	1926000	Stoke's
1926000	1928000	spatial variation
1928000	1930000	is very low.
1930000	1932000	The white box
1932000	1934000	on the far right
1934000	1936000	is Stoke's
1936000	1938000	indoor spatial variation.
1938000	1940000	Why?
1940000	1942000	Because I have added
1942000	1944000	the air exchange rate
1944000	1946000	spatial variation.
1946000	1948000	If you replace
1948000	1950000	the air with air,
1950000	1952000	you get
1952000	1954000	spatial variation.
1954000	1956000	There is a
1956000	1958000	method to
1958000	1960000	classify
1960000	1962000	exposure in
1962000	1964000	epidemiology.
1964000	1966000	Sometimes we do not
1966000	1968000	use absolute density
1968000	1970000	such as 50mcg per cubic meter
1970000	1972000	to represent exposure.
1972000	1974000	Sometimes we just
1974000	1976000	classify it.
1976000	1978000	For example,
1978000	1980000	the low-middle-high
1980000	1982000	group may only expose
1982000	1984000	0-2mcg.
1984000	1986000	The middle group
1986000	1988000	may expose 2-4mcg.
1988000	1990000	The high-middle-high
1990000	1992000	group may expose 4-8mcg.
1992000	1994000	I do the same thing here.
1994000	1996000	I divide the six
1996000	1998000	exposure metrics
1998000	2000000	into five groups,
2000000	2002000	0-20%,
2002000	2004000	20-40,
2004000	2006000	and 50-60.
2006000	2008000	The first group
2008000	2010000	is the indoor
2010000	2012000	hybrid-based exposure.
2012000	2014000	The second group
2014000	2016000	is the
2016000	2018000	indoor hybrid-based
2018000	2020000	exposure.
2020000	2022000	The first group
2022000	2024000	is the
2024000	2026000	indoor hybrid-based
2026000	2028000	exposure.
2028000	2030000	The second group
2030000	2032000	is the
2032000	2034000	indoor hybrid-based
2034000	2036000	exposure.
2038000	2040000	Let's compare
2040000	2042000	the outdoor hybrid-based
2042000	2044000	and the indoor hybrid-based.
2044000	2046000	The red line
2046000	2048000	represents
2048000	2050000	the
2050000	2052000	agreement
2052000	2054000	between
2054000	2056000	the two groups.
2056000	2058000	The higher the number,
2058000	2060000	the more agreeable
2060000	2062000	the agreement is.
2066000	2068000	For example,
2068000	2070000	the 0-20% group
2070000	2072000	is the hybrid-based
2072000	2074000	indoor group.
2074000	2076000	The outdoor hybrid-based
2076000	2078000	group
2078000	2080000	represents
2080000	2082000	50%,
2082000	2084000	49.22% of the
2084000	2086000	exposure.
2086000	2088000	The hybrid-based
2088000	2090000	group
2090000	2092000	represents
2092000	2094000	50% of the
2094000	2096000	exposure.
2096000	2098000	The highest group
2098000	2100000	represents
2100000	2102000	73%,
2102000	2104000	which is
2104000	2106000	the NOx group.
2106000	2108000	The NOx group
2108000	2110000	is the
2110000	2112000	on-road source.
2112000	2114000	The NOx group
2114000	2116000	is the
2116000	2118000	on-road source.
2126000	2128000	Your analysis unit
2128000	2130000	is the sensor's track.
2130000	2132000	No, the sensor's block.
2132000	2134000	What about your spatial resolution?
2134000	2136000	Your model could be run hourly.
2136000	2138000	I mean
2138000	2140000	you have
2140000	2142000	a sensor track
2142000	2144000	with hourly data.
2144000	2146000	Did your contingency
2146000	2148000	match the group?
2148000	2150000	Is the sensor's track
2150000	2152000	hourly data?
2152000	2154000	No, I remember
2154000	2156000	I used annual average.
2156000	2158000	This should be only annual average.
2158000	2160000	This is not hourly data.
2160000	2162000	I used sensor's block,
2162000	2164000	not sensor's track.
2164000	2166000	Sensor's track has a lot of blocks.
2168000	2170000	Let's take a look
2170000	2172000	at the worst case.
2172000	2174000	I remember
2174000	2176000	outdoor stock
2176000	2178000	is widely used
2178000	2180000	in popular
2180000	2182000	epidemiological research.
2182000	2184000	Compare to
2184000	2186000	hybrid-based indoor,
2186000	2188000	the red line
2188000	2190000	is
2190000	2192000	25.54%.
2194000	2196000	It means
2196000	2198000	you could have
2198000	2200000	such a big exposure error.
2200000	2202000	Why?
2202000	2204000	First, you didn't consider local source.
2204000	2206000	Second, you didn't consider
2206000	2208000	indoor concentration.
2208000	2210000	We talked about this.
2210000	2212000	The surprising thing
2212000	2214000	about this analysis unit
2214000	2216000	is that when you use
2216000	2218000	indoor on-road concentration,
2218000	2220000	the performance is good.
2220000	2222000	Remember that
2222000	2224000	indoor on-road concentration
2224000	2226000	is only for on-road.
2226000	2228000	It doesn't consider background level.
2228000	2230000	Why?
2230000	2232000	Because
2232000	2234000	a large part of NOx
2234000	2236000	comes from gas engine.
2236000	2238000	It also controls
2238000	2240000	spatially.
2240000	2242000	When you only use this unit,
2242000	2244000	you can see
2244000	2246000	the high concentration of on-road
2246000	2248000	and the low concentration of off-road.
2248000	2250000	As long as you can capture this,
2250000	2252000	you can capture
2252000	2254000	most of
2254000	2256000	the high concentration.
2256000	2258000	It also considers
2258000	2260000	indoor concentration.
2260000	2262000	It uses air exchange rate
2262000	2264000	to reflect
2264000	2266000	the air exchange rate
2266000	2268000	between each house.
2268000	2270000	The performance is good.
2270000	2272000	The highest group can reach 89%.
2274000	2276000	Here, I'm showing
2276000	2278000	a similar situation.
2278000	2280000	I use hybrid.
2280000	2282000	You can see
2282000	2284000	the area is blank.
2284000	2286000	Because this is
2286000	2288000	the answer.
2288000	2290000	Other things
2290000	2292000	cut out the answer.
2292000	2294000	It becomes a box.
2296000	2298000	Each box
2298000	2300000	represents
2300000	2302000	when you use
2302000	2304000	a specific exposure metric
2304000	2306000	to represent exposure,
2306000	2308000	what is the error?
2308000	2310000	Let's see
2310000	2312000	the most widely used
2312000	2314000	exposure metric,
2314000	2316000	Stoke Outdoor Concentration.
2316000	2318000	You can see
2318000	2320000	the normalized difference
2320000	2322000	is very high.
2322000	2324000	The average of NOx
2324000	2326000	is about 80-90%.
2332000	2334000	The conclusion is
2334000	2336000	that
2336000	2338000	it's complicated.
2338000	2340000	There are many
2340000	2342000	different analysis and pollution.
2342000	2344000	The pollution
2344000	2346000	and traffic
2346000	2348000	are different.
2348000	2350000	Bear with me.
2350000	2352000	Basically,
2352000	2354000	CO and PN2.5
2354000	2356000	traffic
2358000	2360000	is lower.
2360000	2362000	14% and 6%.
2362000	2364000	NOx and ECO
2364000	2366000	are higher.
2366000	2368000	40% and 44%.
2370000	2372000	When you use
2372000	2374000	the indoor infiltration model,
2374000	2376000	the indoor concentration
2376000	2378000	is about 60% of
2378000	2380000	the outdoor concentration.
2380000	2382000	It will be reduced by 40%.
2382000	2384000	When you use the outdoor concentration
2384000	2386000	to represent the exposure,
2386000	2388000	it's not right.
2388000	2390000	The concentration is not that high.
2390000	2392000	The exposure is not that high.
2392000	2394000	Okay.
2404000	2406000	It's too complicated.
2406000	2408000	This is my
2408000	2410000	acknowledgment.
2410000	2412000	I used to work at UNC.
2412000	2414000	The funding source is
2414000	2416000	EPA's contract.
2416000	2418000	EPA provides emissions
2418000	2420000	and meteorological data.
2420000	2422000	It's not on the slide.
2422000	2424000	This is a reference.
2426000	2428000	That's it.
2428000	2430000	Thank you.
2434000	2436000	Thank you.
2436000	2438000	Do you have
2438000	2440000	any questions?
2450000	2452000	I don't think so.
2452000	2454000	Yay!
2454000	2456000	On Saturday afternoon,
2456000	2458000	stay healthy.
2458000	2460000	Don't be so academic.
2460000	2462000	This is interesting.
2462000	2464000	You can see it with R-Line.
2464000	2466000	For example,
2466000	2468000	why is there a basketball court?
2468000	2470000	When I started
2470000	2472000	doing this,
2472000	2474000	especially after I moved here,
2474000	2476000	the Golden Gate Bridge
2476000	2478000	next to San Francisco
2478000	2480000	is a place
2480000	2482000	for jogging and cycling.
2482000	2484000	There are six lanes.
2484000	2486000	There are three lanes
2486000	2488000	on each side.
2488000	2490000	Normally, cars drive very slowly.
2490000	2492000	In terms of emissions,
2492000	2494000	the slower the car drives,
2494000	2496000	the higher the emissions.
2496000	2498000	People jogging and cycling
2498000	2500000	are enjoying
2500000	2502000	the air pollution.
2502000	2504000	My idea is
2504000	2506000	if you move
2506000	2508000	the basketball court
2508000	2510000	to the middle,
2510000	2512000	you can save
2512000	2514000	a lot of energy.
2514000	2516000	That's it.
2516000	2518000	Is there a way
2518000	2520000	to do it in Taiwan?
2524000	2526000	I have a question.
2526000	2528000	Please go ahead.
2528000	2530000	The question is
2530000	2532000	if you look at
2532000	2534000	the road emission data,
2534000	2536000	you won't stand
2536000	2538000	next to the road
2538000	2540000	and check
2540000	2542000	if every car
2542000	2544000	is a Tesla
2544000	2546000	or a diesel car.
2546000	2548000	However,
2548000	2550000	there is a free parameter.
2550000	2552000	If all the cars
2552000	2554000	are Tesla,
2554000	2556000	half Tesla, half pickup,
2556000	2558000	and all are big trucks,
2558000	2560000	how much improvement
2560000	2562000	can be made?
2562000	2564000	Is there a way
2564000	2566000	to justify
2566000	2568000	how much
2568000	2570000	public sector resources
2570000	2572000	are needed
2572000	2574000	to change the air quality
2574000	2576000	in a static way?
2576000	2578000	That's a very important point.
2578000	2580000	It's called fleet distribution.
2580000	2582000	When we talk about
2582000	2584000	traffic pollution,
2584000	2586000	a very important parameter
2586000	2588000	is fleet distribution.
2588000	2590000	Is there a difference
2590000	2592000	between fleet distribution
2592000	2594000	and model distribution?
2594000	2596000	The difference is
2596000	2598000	that we use
2598000	2600000	MOOVS,
2600000	2602000	Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator.
2602000	2604000	In terms of models,
2604000	2606000	we use MOOVS.
2606000	2608000	In terms of models,
2608000	2610000	you can tell MOOVS
2610000	2612000	that if half of
2612000	2614000	the fleet distribution
2614000	2616000	is electric vehicles
2616000	2618000	and half is diesel cars,
2618000	2620000	you can do it
2620000	2622000	in terms of models.
2622000	2624000	But if you want
2624000	2626000	to block a street
2626000	2628000	and make the entire fleet
2628000	2630000	50% Tesla,
2630000	2632000	it's a bit difficult.
2632000	2634000	You made a very good point.
2634000	2636000	I don't remember
2636000	2638000	having seen
2638000	2640000	a similar study
2640000	2642000	in fleet distribution.
2642000	2644000	Have you seen a similar study,
2644000	2646000	coach?
2646000	2648000	He's probably taking care of the kids.
2648000	2650000	I don't remember
2650000	2652000	having seen a similar study
2652000	2654000	where we changed the fleet distribution
2654000	2656000	and changed it to electric vehicles.
2656000	2658000	I haven't seen such a study.
2660000	2662000	Thank you.
2664000	2666000	I have a question.
2666000	2668000	I'm a bit curious.
2668000	2670000	When I first saw this topic,
2670000	2672000	I thought it was very interesting.
2672000	2674000	Why did you choose that place?
2674000	2676000	I looked it up on the Internet.
2676000	2678000	North Carolina
2678000	2680000	seems to have more
2680000	2682000	air pollution.
2682000	2684000	This area is
2684000	2686000	the NC Piedmont region.
2686000	2688000	There are four areas in North Carolina.
2688000	2690000	Coastline,
2690000	2692000	Piedmont, Mountain,
2692000	2694000	and I forgot the other one.
2694000	2696000	Piedmont is like a triangle.
2696000	2698000	This area is an RTP area,
2698000	2700000	so the air pollution
2700000	2702000	is a bit more severe.
2702000	2704000	Another reason
2704000	2706000	why I chose these three counties
2706000	2708000	is because we had a project
2708000	2710000	with the EPA.
2710000	2712000	They wanted to use
2712000	2714000	the metrics I just mentioned
2714000	2716000	to do their epidemiological research.
2716000	2718000	They did a study
2718000	2720000	on heart disease
2720000	2722000	and wanted to use
2722000	2724000	air pollution data.
2724000	2726000	We had a contract
2726000	2728000	with the EPA
2728000	2730000	to do this research.
2730000	2732000	When I talked to them last time,
2732000	2734000	they said they were already
2734000	2736000	writing a paper.
2736000	2738000	I don't know where it went.
2738000	2740000	So the research you did
2740000	2742000	in this area
2742000	2744000	is quite valuable, right?
2744000	2746000	Because the EPA
2746000	2748000	is located there.
2748000	2750000	The EPA's R&D office
2750000	2752000	is located there.
2752000	2754000	A lot of research
2754000	2756000	is done there.
2756000	2758000	Yesterday,
2758000	2760000	a few people from UNC
2760000	2762000	came to the lab.
2762000	2764000	I asked them,
2764000	2766000	I heard the air pollution
2766000	2768000	in UNC is quite severe.
2768000	2770000	They were surprised.
2770000	2772000	I said, really?
2772000	2774000	The air there is much better than California.
2774000	2776000	I said it's severe
2776000	2778000	compared to
2778000	2780000	North Carolina.
2780000	2782000	Even in Piedmont,
2782000	2784000	although it's a severe area,
2784000	2786000	it's still very low.
2786000	2788000	Okay.
2788000	2790000	North Carolina is a very clean area.
2790000	2792000	The population of North Carolina
2792000	2794000	is only 9 million,
2794000	2796000	which is four times the population of Taiwan.
2796000	2798000	In South California,
2798000	2800000	the population of
2800000	2802000	one county is 20 million.
2802000	2804000	Yes.
2804000	2806000	So I believe
2806000	2808000	air pollution is more severe.
2808000	2810000	Yes.
2810000	2812000	In California,
2812000	2814000	there are a lot of
2814000	2816000	near-road studies
2816000	2818000	and children's health studies.
2818000	2820000	A lot of those papers
2820000	2822000	are done by our company's
2822000	2824000	senior scientists.
2824000	2826000	They do a lot of research
2826000	2828000	in LA.
2828000	2830000	The first project
2830000	2832000	I joined our company on
2832000	2834000	was to use R-Line
2834000	2836000	to predict the air flow
2836000	2838000	of children
2838000	2840000	because of air pollution.
2840000	2842000	The system
2842000	2844000	is also
2844000	2846000	targeted at
2846000	2848000	the entire South Coast
2848000	2850000	area.
2850000	2852000	The entire South Coast area.
2852000	2854000	That area is
2854000	2856000	well-known
2856000	2858000	for air pollution.
2858000	2860000	Actually,
2860000	2862000	in Joe's
2864000	2866000	presentation,
2866000	2868000	I think
2872000	2874000	this is
2874000	2876000	a newspaper
2876000	2878000	from the 1970s.
2878000	2880000	This is
2880000	2882000	the Los Angeles Times.
2882000	2884000	It's an LA newspaper
2884000	2886000	from that time.
2886000	2888000	At that time,
2888000	2890000	they talked about
2890000	2892000	the problem of
2892000	2894000	bad oxygen.
2894000	2896000	I remember
2896000	2898000	they said
2898000	2900000	bad oxygen can reach
2900000	2902000	70 ppb.
2902000	2904000	That's high.
2904000	2906000	It can reach 700 ppb
2906000	2908000	at that time.
2908000	2910000	Some of our senior scientists
2910000	2912000	lived in LA when they were young
2912000	2914000	and they said
2914000	2916000	standing outside
2916000	2918000	can make you cry.
2918000	2920000	That's an older magnitude difference.
2920000	2922000	It's very exaggerated.
2922000	2924000	LA is a basin.
2924000	2926000	It's an air basin.
2926000	2928000	The air quality
2928000	2930000	is relatively stable.
2930000	2932000	Air pollution can't escape.
2936000	2938000	Thank you for your answer.
2938000	2940000	I want to ask
2940000	2942000	if there are any other questions.
2942000	2944000	If not,
2944000	2946000	let me promote Taira.
2946000	2948000	Got it?
2948000	2950000	I want to
2950000	2952000	simply say
2952000	2954000	that
2954000	2956000	Do you have a question?
2956000	2958000	No.
2958000	2960000	OK.
2960000	2962000	You know what I'm doing.
2962000	2964000	Let me...
2964000	2966000	Right.
2968000	2970000	Let me talk about it.
2970000	2972000	Basically,
2972000	2974000	many epidemiologists
2974000	2976000	and epidemiologists
2976000	2978000	make
2978000	2980000	underestimated responses.
2980000	2982000	The main reason is
2982000	2984000	from an economic point of view,
2984000	2986000	when you know
2986000	2988000	the air quality is bad,
2988000	2990000	you optimize your behavior.
2990000	2992000	So,
2992000	2994000	acute hospital admission
2994000	2996000	or all the endpoints
2996000	2998000	are the results
2998000	3000000	after people optimize their behavior.
3000000	3002000	So,
3002000	3004000	for example, ozone,
3004000	3006000	CO,
3006000	3008000	you may not see anything
3008000	3010000	in low concentration.
3010000	3012000	But in fact,
3012000	3014000	it's gone.
3014000	3016000	So,
3016000	3018000	from an economic
3018000	3020000	and epidemiological
3020000	3022000	point of view,
3022000	3024000	it's a big difference.
3024000	3026000	When the air quality is bad,
3026000	3028000	you can choose
3028000	3030000	a different transportation mode.
3030000	3032000	For example,
3032000	3034000	in Taiwan,
3034000	3036000	you ride a scooter,
3036000	3038000	but if the air quality is bad,
3038000	3040000	you ride a bus.
3040000	3042000	So,
3042000	3044000	it has nothing to do
3044000	3046000	with today's topic.
3046000	3048000	Interesting.
3048000	3050000	So, what's your name?
3050000	3052000	Yi.
3052000	3054000	Yi Xu.
3054000	3056000	I'd like to ask
3056000	3058000	if you work on energy policy.
3058000	3060000	Yes, I do.
3060000	3062000	I have an article
3062000	3064000	about Taipei Metro
3064000	3066000	and air pollution.
3066000	3068000	In the U.S.,
3068000	3070000	for example,
3070000	3072000	when the Energy Bureau
3072000	3074000	wants to change
3074000	3076000	their policy,
3076000	3078000	do they refer to
3078000	3080000	researchers or companies?
3080000	3082000	Or do they take an average?
3082000	3084000	No,
3084000	3086000	policy set up is basically
3086000	3088000	a political negotiation process.
3088000	3090000	For example,
3090000	3092000	in California,
3092000	3094000	renewable energy
3094000	3096000	will be 50% in 2030.
3096000	3098000	So,
3098000	3100000	the government's policy
3100000	3102000	will be like this.
3102000	3104000	The next step is
3104000	3106000	to hand it over to California
3106000	3108000	Air Resources Board
3108000	3110000	or other government agencies
3110000	3112000	to implement.
3112000	3114000	So,
3114000	3116000	under my overall policy
3116000	3118000	target,
3118000	3120000	how do I use
3120000	3122000	economic instruments?
3122000	3124000	For example,
3124000	3126000	I can force companies
3126000	3128000	to use renewable energy.
3128000	3130000	So,
3130000	3132000	our target is to
3132000	3134000	come up with a way
3134000	3136000	to use market instruments.
3136000	3138000	For example,
3138000	3140000	I can close subsidy
3140000	3142000	renewable energy
3142000	3144000	from the fossil fuel
3144000	3146000	or dirty energy.
3146000	3148000	In this way,
3148000	3150000	those firms
3150000	3152000	will endogenous
3152000	3154000	and use market
3154000	3156000	to achieve the result.
3156000	3158000	I think policy is important
3158000	3160000	for researchers.
3160000	3162000	For example,
3162000	3164000	I'm doing CO2 reduction here.
3164000	3166000	So,
3166000	3168000	our institute's funding source
3168000	3170000	is based on the government's policy.
3170000	3172000	For example,
3172000	3174000	if Trump doesn't support
3174000	3176000	energy,
3176000	3178000	we will be worried.
3178000	3180000	Will you be fired?
3180000	3182000	I don't think so.
3182000	3184000	But others are worried
3184000	3186000	about our institute.
3186000	3188000	Our institute is not only in Caltech,
3188000	3190000	but also in Stanford and Berkeley.
3190000	3192000	So,
3192000	3194000	everyone is worried about it.
3194000	3196000	But now,
3196000	3198000	it seems to be guaranteed
3198000	3200000	to be implemented in 2020.
3200000	3202000	So,
3202000	3204000	except Trump,
3204000	3206000	everyone else is supportive.
3206000	3208000	I think it's impossible in California.
3208000	3210000	Our institute is a pioneer
3210000	3212000	in environmental policy.
3212000	3214000	So,
3214000	3216000	even if the government's funding
3216000	3218000	is not enough,
3218000	3220000	we have a lot of state funding.
3220000	3222000	Thank you for your comment.
3222000	3224000	I think it's interesting.
3224000	3226000	I'll send you an email later.
3226000	3228000	I think we can work together.
3232000	3234000	Let me interrupt.
3234000	3236000	As I mentioned,
3236000	3238000	I'm a policy designer.
3238000	3240000	If I'm not mistaken,
3240000	3242000	next week's talk
3242000	3244000	is about economics.
3244000	3246000	The speaker will talk about
3246000	3248000	mechanical design.
3248000	3250000	It's not specific
3250000	3252000	about energy
3252000	3254000	or energy policy design.
3254000	3256000	But it's about
3256000	3258000	mechanical design itself
3258000	3260000	from an economic perspective.
3260000	3262000	I just realized it's related to
3262000	3264000	what you just discussed.
3264000	3266000	Yixu,
3266000	3268000	we can keep in touch.
3268000	3270000	You should have it.
3270000	3272000	I'm in control of everything.
3272000	3274000	Okay.
3274000	3276000	I'm just cyber-stalking you
3276000	3278000	right now.
3278000	3280000	Please.
3280000	3282000	I already have Zhang Xi.
3282000	3284000	I can stalk others.
3284000	3286000	Keep tracking.
3286000	3288000	Okay.
3288000	3290000	I don't know
3290000	3292000	if Jiao Yan has joined
3292000	3294000	Tyra's members.
3294000	3296000	If you're interested in joining Tyra...
3296000	3298000	She gave a talk last year.
3298000	3300000	Okay.
3300000	3302000	Yixu,
3302000	3304000	are you in Tyra?
3304000	3306000	You're a passerby.
3306000	3308000	I'm a passerby.
3308000	3310000	You can join us next time.
3310000	3312000	Okay.
3312000	3314000	I'll send you the membership form
3314000	3316000	right away.
3316000	3318000	If you're interested,
3318000	3320000	you're welcome to join Tyra.
3320000	3322000	There's a lot of people.
3322000	3324000	Okay.
3324000	3326000	The biggest problem is
3326000	3328000	you can't find students
3328000	3330000	even if you want to.
3330000	3332000	What kind of students?
3332000	3334000	PhD students.
3334000	3336000	You mean me?
3336000	3338000	I mean me.
3338000	3340000	I can't find students
3340000	3342000	if I want to.
3342000	3344000	Not necessarily.
3344000	3346000	We'll have students
3346000	3348000	after the promotion.
3348000	3350000	We'll have students after the promotion.
3350000	3352000	Thank you.
