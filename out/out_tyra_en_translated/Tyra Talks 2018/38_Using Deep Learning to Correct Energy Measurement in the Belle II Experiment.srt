00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome everyone to today's TARA speech. First of all, welcome everyone to listen to Huang Kun-hsieh to tell us about Python to play with particles physics experiment.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TARA is an online platform. Our goal is to use a free and cross-border way to connect young people all over the world who are engaged in research.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We can quickly share each other's results and ideas. We have a website and a fan group. The name of our fan group is Project TARA.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can find us on Facebook.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let me introduce today's speaker. Today's speaker is Huang Kun-hsieh.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's quite interesting. When I was preparing to introduce the speaker, I did a little calculation. I think we have known each other for 10 years.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Huang Kun-hsieh studied at the University of Taiwan Physics Department and the University of Taiwan Physics Institute.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When he was in the doctor's class, he went to the University of Kyoto. During this period, he was engaged in the study of micro-needle telescope.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Later, he did T2K at the University of Kyoto. So Huang Kun-hsieh can be said to be a micro-needle expert.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:28,000
After Huang Kun-hsieh got his doctorate, he went to Bell Institute to do hardware development. He is now a post-doctorate researcher.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The topic he will talk to us today is to use Python to play the particle physics experiment.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
An example of using a convolutional neural network to correct gamma-ray energy measurement.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Without further ado, let's give a round of applause to welcome Huang Kun-hsieh.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry, I forgot to say one thing. Please mute your microphone if you don't want to speak in the speech.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But when you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone so that our speaker can feel your enthusiasm.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's welcome Huang Kun-hsieh.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Thank you for the introduction. I have been a speech therapist for a long time.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am very happy that you gave me the opportunity to speak here today.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Actually, my speech was shot in Taiwan.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So I'm sorry. If you have been to Taiwan, you may have heard the same thing over and over again.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My name is Huang Kun-hsieh. I am a post-doctorate student at Taiwan University.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I am currently working on a project called Bell 2.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I am currently doing a particle physics experiment.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I am studying the field of particle physics.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In the particle physics experiment, you may take a lot of data.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you take data, you may need to do data analysis.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you do data analysis, it is a very good language.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you want to download it, you can download it here.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is my own photo.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I am currently doing post-doctoral research at Taiwan University.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am currently doing research in the field of particle physics.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I also like to use my voice.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is my research?

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The screen you are sharing is your PowerPoint.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's not the part you play. You may have to re-share it.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then choose that.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, okay. Let's do it again.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is there such a thing?

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Choose the screen.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes?

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What I'm doing now is in a Japanese studio.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There is an organization called KK.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you want to listen to Japanese, it's Koe-nen-ruki-kasoku-ken-kyu-kiko.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's simply called KK.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There is such a big research device called Bell 2.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a detector.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mainly, we use Python to simulate and analyze.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There is also some data storage.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And even push the data to the whole world.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because we have Google Earth that pushes the data to the whole world.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They will provide their computing resources.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then I will talk about how to push the data to the whole world.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The first thing to talk about is particle physics.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because the data I prepared is scientific.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Some people may not know what particle physics is.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So let's talk about what particle physics is.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
At the beginning, for example, water molecules.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You must have heard of water molecules.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
High school physics should have heard of water molecules.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There will be atoms in it.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Atoms will have electrons and the nucleus inside.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Electrons are the so-called basic particles.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In addition, you will find neutrons and neutrons in the nucleus.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Neutrons and neutrons are composed of quarks.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In fact, the most basic discovery is that there are electrons and quarks.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
To form the universe we see in our daily lives.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Particle physics is to study the interaction between these basic particles and their group.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And how to form the law of the universe.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How do we study particle physics?

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We usually do one thing.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We will use the accelerator to accelerate the particles to a very fast speed.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
For example, like this animation.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let the particles and the antiparticles accelerate to a very fast speed.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then there will be a collision in the middle.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
After we let it collide, it will produce a new one.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We rarely see this example in the current universe.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's a more unfamiliar example.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In our daily lives.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not like that kind of thing.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We rarely see this kind of thing in the current universe.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So we study these new examples.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And see what their interaction is like.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Neutrons are one of them.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In fact, we have a lot of large-scale particle physics experiments.

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There are many large-scale physics experiments in the world.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The first is the collision experiment.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
For example, if you have heard of similar LHC.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What kind of experiments are there under LHC?

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The biggest three experiments are actually four.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The biggest four experiments are CNS, ATLAS.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The other experiment is not included.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
CNS, ATLAS, and LHC-B.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In addition, our protagonist today is BELL-2.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It is also a collision experiment.

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's about electrons.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's about electrons and positive electrons.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That is, positive electrons.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Electrons are negative electrons.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Positive electrons are negative electrons.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a collision experiment.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There are also other kinds of experiments.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For example, T2K, which I used to participate in.

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then the pressure back in China.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Or SNOPLUS in Canada.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There are other examples.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, alpha in LHC.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Alpha in SNOPLUS.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And the Koto experiment in Japan.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I am very happy.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
When we received the number on April 26th.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
BELL-2 is the first operation.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is a report at the time.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is the release press.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And the first collision event.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's why we're doing BELL-2 experiments.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Please give me three minutes.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
At the beginning, the BELL-2 detector.

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Actually, it's a detection of B particles.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
B particles are rare in the universe.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We will learn about CP-Violation.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That is, the universe is not uniform.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
With other new physics.

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What is the universe not uniform?

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If the universe is not uniform.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It will be with us.

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's why we only have materials now.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Related to our universe.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have a YouTube video.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Please take a look.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know if YouTube is okay.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Wait a minute, I'll play it again.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is the theory of the Big Bang.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The universe after the Big Bang.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
At the time of the Big Bang.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Matter and antimatter.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It should be the same level.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now there's only matter in the universe.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Other antimatter has disappeared.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Matter and antimatter.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There should be a difference.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So they say.

145
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
In addition to the difference between the electron box and the symmetry.

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
There should be other differences.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Other differences are called CP-Violation.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now known as the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It was a revolutionary theory.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Which introduced a model that contained six quarks.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Even though only three quarks were known at the time.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In 2001.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The Bell experiment successfully measured CP-Violation.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
In B meson decays.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
As predicted by the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There are six quarks.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Three or four quarks.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Three or four quarks decays.

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They should have.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Matter and antimatter.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
An asymmetry.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Later in the Bell experiment.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It was confirmed.

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Now it's more accurate.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In 2008.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
30 years after their theory paper was published.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Professor Kobayashi.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And Professor Masukawa.

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Experimental confirmation of the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
By the Bell and Babar experiments.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Greatly contributed to their Nobel Prize.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's easy to get the Nobel Prize.

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Electrons and neutrons.

175
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Accelerate to the light.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let them collide.

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then they will.

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If the antimatter is converted to the electron.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They will produce.

180
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Other kinds.

181
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Heavier particles.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This annihilation.

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Transforms the electron and positron.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Into a pair of B mesons.

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Which consists of bottom quarks.

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Two B mesons.

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
B mesons.

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
These two B mesons.

189
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Will decay.

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because they have a lot of life.

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They will decay.

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Into other kinds.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Other kinds of particles.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Usually negative.

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In your detector.

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Measure their decay.

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
After the example.

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Then calculate.

199
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It should be B mesons.

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Particles then pass through.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The central drift chamber.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Here they ionize the gas.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Which fills the detector.

204
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In this way.

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
A particle's trajectory and momentum.

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Is obtained.

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Next comes the top counter.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And the aerogel rich counter.

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A charged particle.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Emits Cherenkov radiation.

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When it enters these detectors.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The timing and pattern information.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Of the detected Cherenkov radiation.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Tells us what kind of particle it is.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then there is an electromagnetic calorimeter.

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This detector precisely measures.

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The energy of photons.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Electrons.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The outermost detector.

220
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Is the long living neutral.

221
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And muon detector.

222
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It detects muons.

223
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Which penetrate most of the detector.

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And neutral chaos.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Which cannot be measured.

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
With the inner detectors.

227
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It does not have an electrolyte.

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because the light does not have an electrolyte.

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So it is in the middle.

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Before it touches the ECL.

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
From the point of collision.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Before it touches the ECL.

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It will not be detected.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why is the ECL detected?

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Because it is denser.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So it is easier for light.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It is easier to produce a reaction.

238
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It will be here.

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
After the reaction.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It will be broken down into many kinds.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
These electrons.

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
In the crystal.

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It will glow in the crystal.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This crystal.

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Will add a light sensor.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Photosensor.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can look at the photosensor.

248
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Its energy size.

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The light on both sides.

250
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The intensity of the light.

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The intensity of the gamma radiation.

252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
All the detectors.

253
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This is the most important thing today.

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you want to go in.

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I have a link here.

256
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You can go back and see for yourself.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is the history of the universe.

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
At the beginning of the big explosion.

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The universe is very hot.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The universe is very cold.

261
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Relatively cold.

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
In the primordial universe.

263
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We have a lot.

264
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There will be a lot in the universe.

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In real life.

266
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In the cold universe.

267
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There are many strange examples.

268
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
In the universe.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Our accelerator.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Super KKB.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He knows.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What we are not familiar with now.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Strange examples.

274
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It often appeared in the universe.

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
These examples.

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We can understand.

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
From the past to the present.

278
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What happened.

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There may be some.

280
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Strange behavior.

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The universe.

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Only matter.

283
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Still very mysterious.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
OK.

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
CP violation.

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Not familiar with the universe.

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In 1960.

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
These two people.

289
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Not discovered.

290
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
In the K-on ring.

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Found in the K-on ring.

292
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Found in the K-on ring.

293
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Xiaoling and Yichuan in 1973.

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They.

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Established.

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Three quarks era.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Six quarks.

298
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In the standard model.

299
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Six quarks.

300
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
We will.

302
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
B quark decay.

303
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There will be a CP violation.

304
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
In 1980.

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
These two people.

306
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There will be a CP violation.

307
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In the K-on ring.

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
OK.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You may not know.

310
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Simply put.

311
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Quarks and.

312
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Quarks.

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In fact, most of the quarks are the same.

314
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In addition to.

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They are not the same.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They are not the same.

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Correct.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
These two.

319
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Charge and parity.

320
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Quarks and quarks.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Different.

322
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Quarks and quarks.

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There is another.

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
In addition to these two properties.

325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Other different properties.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Will be called by us.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
CP violation.

328
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
For example, like life.

329
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Or like.

330
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Decay branching ratio.

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Only here.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
B quark situation.

333
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Of course there are other CP violations.

334
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That kind.

335
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Only here.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Life or decay ratio.

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What is B quark?

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What is B quark?

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is from the website.

340
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Take it over.

341
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
B quark.

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It is actually a B and a D.

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
To constitute.

344
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It has B 0 and B 0 bar.

345
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It has B plus and B minus.

346
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Now the universe is.

347
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The left side is more material.

348
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The right side is less anti-material.

349
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Of course now.

350
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
B quark is very rare.

351
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Then.

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How do we measure.

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
CP violation in B quark.

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
For example, life.

355
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
After the confrontation.

356
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They will fly in the same direction.

357
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
B quark and B quark.

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Will fly in the same direction.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The longer the life, the longer the flight.

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The shorter the life, the shorter the flight.

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That is.

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Use this to measure B quark or B quark.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Life difference.

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Of course there are some decay modes.

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
B is more.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But this.

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
At the same time to verify.

368
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They should be.

369
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's different in life.

370
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
OK.

371
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It has a lot of new physics.

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
For example, like.

373
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Some of you may have heard of.

374
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Maybe it's too difficult.

375
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There will be some.

376
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Intermediate particles.

377
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It may not be.

378
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The example we know.

379
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So it will be different.

380
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And the other one is.

381
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Of course it's not just.

382
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This is.

383
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yan Yong is also.

384
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Researched.

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
His research is.

386
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Direct detection.

387
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The method.

388
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
B quark.

389
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's also direct detection.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
OK.

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Physics is over.

392
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You should be blind.

393
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Then.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's more interesting to talk about this.

395
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Because I am.

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Most of them are.

397
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
People who do software.

398
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So the next thing.

399
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Should be more.

400
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Talk about software.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And some examples.

402
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
For example, like.

403
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You know this is.

404
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Our Bell 2 detector.

405
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's actually.

406
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Its channel number is very amazing.

407
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There may be one.

408
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
One million pixels.

409
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That.

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You have a million pixels.

411
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Then every time the collision occurs.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Then there will be a lot of B.

413
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The event is to remember.

414
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Of course, in addition to B.

415
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There are a lot of background events.

416
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So add up.

417
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Very, very much.

418
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Then our data size.

419
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Then of course this is.

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You are in the inside of the FPGA.

421
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Then put this one million.

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
After throwing away the things you don't want.

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Then the data size.

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The size is probably one megabyte.

425
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then the trigger rate is your event rate.

426
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
If the accelerator is running.

427
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Probably.

428
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Maximum is 30.

429
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
30 kilohertz.

430
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Like this.

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This is the maximum.

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Of course, it's not that high now.

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The maximum is like this.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So the maximum data rate is probably.

435
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
34 gigabytes per second.

436
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Of course, there are only two or three gigabytes now.

437
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
When running now.

438
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Because we are not so high now.

439
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That is to run.

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The accelerator is not fully operational yet.

441
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's not fully operational yet.

442
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So it's not as much as 30 gigabytes.

443
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Then there are probably only two or three gigabytes.

444
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
A lot.

445
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That.

446
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But in fact, two or three gigabytes.

447
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Then add some of your simulation.

448
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The data produced is actually a lot.

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Then this page here.

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's like this.

451
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How much data does it have?

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's it.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The data is about 30 times a year.

454
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Petabyte.

455
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Up to 50 petabytes.

456
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's the data.

457
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If you don't change the simulation.

458
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's probably 50 petabytes.

459
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's the experiment.

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you add the simulation.

461
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's about 200.

462
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can see that Google is about 98.

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then Google's search is 98.

464
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Then Facebook Upload is 180.

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Then Google's Internet Archive is 11.

466
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
11 bytes.

467
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Petabyte.

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It should be petabyte.

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I forgot how to read it.

470
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Then you can know that Bell can actually be with.

471
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Google, Facebook.

472
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Their data can be compared.

473
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It means it's really big.

474
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Of course, it's bigger.

475
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We're really doing big data.

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Then the following words are talking about.

477
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's more in-depth.

478
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Because we're big data.

479
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We need a set of processes.

480
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
To analyze our data.

481
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
This is how we do it.

482
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Analyze the structure of our data.

483
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Where do we put it?

484
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Then we save it.

485
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The data format is called MDST.

486
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's called Mini Data Summary Table.

487
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
We want to start with this MDST.

488
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
There are a lot of unorganized files in MDST.

489
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
For example, we just saw that.

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There's no track in detail.

491
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There's something else.

492
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
There's this one in ECL.

493
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That's it.

494
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
We haven't sorted it out yet.

495
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Particle or something.

496
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Actually turn it into a particle.

497
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Or something.

498
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We haven't sorted it out yet.

499
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We've introduced a module chain.

500
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There's a data store.

501
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
These are a few things.

502
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We're basically.

503
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We're input data.

504
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Put it in the data store.

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Then put it in the data store.

506
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
We'll use the module.

507
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Then use a path first.

508
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Then put in what you need.

509
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Put it in.

510
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's called a module.

511
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It has different functions.

512
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's actually written in C14.

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's written in C14.

514
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's what you just did.

515
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What's the track?

516
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Then make it an example.

517
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The example we see.

518
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Then this path.

519
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
How to put this module in.

520
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We use Python to do it.

521
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
There's something else.

522
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
After we're done.

523
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We output data.

524
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We have a root.

525
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Our own format.

526
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We'll develop a root format.

527
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
We can also use Python.

528
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Analyze this root file.

529
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
An example like this.

530
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
For example.

531
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We're done with the experiment.

532
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
We're going to put the NDST.

533
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
For example, module 1 is low.

534
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
NDST.

535
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then the particle list.

536
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Take it out.

537
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There's a track in there.

538
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
We'll put it in.

539
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Turn it into a proton.

540
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Or turn it into an electron.

541
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Then there's a particle list.

542
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And then put that.

543
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Some particles.

544
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
For example, I'm going to make it a bmeson.

545
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
bmeson will change.

546
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Many kinds.

547
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's his daughter's particle.

548
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Then put these daughter's particles together.

549
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Then combine it into bmeson.

550
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Then there will be a new bmeson.

551
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That's right.

552
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Then we'll make some more choices.

553
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's bmeson.

554
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The bmeson he made.

555
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
The quality is with us.

556
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The bmeson we know is too far away.

557
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So we don't want this bmeson.

558
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Just make some choices.

559
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then write it out at the end.

560
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It becomes a root file.

561
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The function of Python is.

562
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The first aspect is.

563
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Build this path.

564
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Build this module chain.

565
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then the other one is.

566
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You're in the back of the root file.

567
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You can use PyRooter to analyze.

568
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Or use other packages.

569
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Python packages for free.

570
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What packages can be used?

571
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'll talk about it later.

572
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Two more pages.

573
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Let's start with what Rooter is.

574
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
If you're interested in what Rooter is.

575
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Rooter is.

576
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's a way to do data storage.

577
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Data analysis.

578
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In Hynology Physicist.

579
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Hynology Physicist.

580
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You can go to his website.

581
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll write some.

582
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Installation instructions here.

583
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The most important thing is.

584
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Although it is written in C++.

585
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can also use C++ to do it.

586
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But you can integrate with the other languages.

587
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Such as Python and R.

588
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Python is much more resourceful than R.

589
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So it's better to use Python.

590
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If you don't want to use C++.

591
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There's a choice here.

592
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You want to use.

593
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You want to use Rooter.

594
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Then Rooter is in C++.

595
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You still use Python Rooter.

596
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's Python by default Rooter.

597
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Then there's another option.

598
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
For example.

599
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Rooter on NuPy.

600
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Interface between Rooter.

601
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Numerical Python.

602
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Then there's another one.

603
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Rooter Pandas.

604
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You can put Rooter's file format.

605
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Write it into Pandas DataFrame.

606
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The easier one is.

607
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Rooter Pandas.

608
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Rooter NumPy.

609
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You know it doesn't have.

610
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It can also be used.

611
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But I'm more used to Rooter Pandas.

612
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
With Rooter.

613
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I like Rooter.

614
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I use Rooter most often.

615
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Then we build.

616
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
In fact, many people started to use Rooter Pandas.

617
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
There are some here.

618
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's the same installation instructions.

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If you are interested.

620
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You can install Rooter Pandas.

621
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The installation method I wrote.

622
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I've tried it myself.

623
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Of course, there are other suggestions.

624
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
For example, PIP.

625
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I've tried PIP.

626
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I can't install it.

627
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I think I can install it.

628
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
For example.

629
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Then.

630
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Like LHC.

631
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Those experiments.

632
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The four experiments.

633
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We actually started.

634
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Use Jupyter Notebook to start training.

635
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It's our new energy.

636
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
To write analysis programs.

637
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We call it StarKit.

638
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's usually three days.

639
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
There will be three days in about four months.

640
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We'll have a meeting in four months.

641
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The meeting is held once.

642
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Then everyone gathers to have a meeting.

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
For new energy.

644
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
In the first three days of the collaboration meeting.

645
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Then there will be a training.

646
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Called StarKit Workshop.

647
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Then there will be a meeting for three days.

648
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
In fact, everyone sits down.

649
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Then teach the new energy.

650
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
How to do our direct analysis.

651
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Data processing.

652
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Then we use Jupyter Notebook.

653
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
To do this thing.

654
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You can see Jupyter Notebook.

655
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Its characteristics are unmistakable.

656
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You can see it directly.

657
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
For example.

658
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
If you use Lulupandas.

659
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You can make it into a table.

660
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Then count, min, etc.

661
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
If you draw a picture.

662
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can keep it on top.

663
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Then it's easier for people to see.

664
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Of course, this is actually production.

665
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You may not need to use Jupyter Notebook.

666
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The big advantage of Jupyter Notebook.

667
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
If you are.

668
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Teaching.

669
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or some.

670
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
After the root analysis.

671
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
After.

672
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If you want to call the picture again.

673
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It will be better.

674
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
There are some.

675
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
This picture is.

676
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
How to do software training in high-performance.

677
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Basic C++.

678
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Basic Data Science.

679
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Programming.

680
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
For example, RootData.

681
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Python, Git.

682
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Then there are some training.

683
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
For example, Advanced Root.

684
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Then there are others.

685
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Then even someone.

686
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I want to write NVIDIA.

687
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
OpenCL.

688
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
CUDA or OpenCL.

689
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There are some.

690
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The right side is the training course.

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
For example, like Bell 2 training course.

692
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
With Atlas CNX HCB.

693
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Then there are some advanced training courses.

694
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
For example, I went to INFN last year.

695
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
SDC School.

696
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That is.

697
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
After you finish learning.

698
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But.

699
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Everything is a little bit like this.

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Then.

701
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
There is.

702
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Here is also possible.

703
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Software people may be more interested.

704
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Maybe it has nothing to do with physics.

705
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I am also participating in this area.

706
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
In the Bell era.

707
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Is.

708
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
K1K.

709
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
About ten years ago.

710
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We are using Cluster.

711
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Central Cluster.

712
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Provide everyone Central Cluster.

713
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Then everyone comes in.

714
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Calculate.

715
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But Bell 2.

716
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It is obvious.

717
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Its accelerator.

718
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Already 50 times.

719
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So it will.

720
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It will be more even rate.

721
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Backlight rate will be more.

722
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Even rate.

723
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Will be more.

724
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So of course.

725
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There is a lot of backlight.

726
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Then we need more.

727
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
CPU and memory.

728
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If it is only K1K.

729
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Maybe you only give him money.

730
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Then ask him to pay for it.

731
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Maybe not.

732
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But we have 25 countries.

733
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Then 100 institutes.

734
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
100 institutions participate in this experiment.

735
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Then each institution.

736
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
A little machine to do it.

737
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
But each institution.

738
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It may have different Cluster.

739
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Then it may have different grades.

740
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Even some institutions.

741
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It may be from Amazon.

742
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Or Google.

743
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Then buy their Cloud Service.

744
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's all right.

745
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Then we are very welcome.

746
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
They do this thing.

747
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Then we need to say.

748
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
There are two important things.

749
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So we have to find a way.

750
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
For example, everyone.

751
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Still want to log in.

752
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
K1K Cluster.

753
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Then we can put the job.

754
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Is what we need to calculate.

755
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We spread all over the world.

756
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Is within these 100 institutions.

757
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
What they provide.

758
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What each institution provides.

759
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Calculation resources.

760
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Then of course they are.

761
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Their resources are different.

762
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
For example, some Cluster.

763
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then of course.

764
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Our information will also spread all over the world.

765
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Then here.

766
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Then we say.

767
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
How do we do it?

768
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
There is a software.

769
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Then from LCCB.

770
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This experiment.

771
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
LCCB developed this experiment.

772
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Our opponent developed it.

773
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Then called Dirac.

774
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Called Distribute Infrastructure.

775
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
With Remote Agent Control.

776
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
When he developed it.

777
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He also considered.

778
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Everyone will use different things.

779
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's very simple.

780
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
User Interface.

781
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Then you are below.

782
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
All kinds of Cloud Cluster.

783
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
If you are interested.

784
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
GitHub is here.

785
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
If you look at it yourself.

786
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
GitHub is here.

787
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Then everyone will notice.

788
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's all written in Python.

789
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
In GitHub.

790
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
100% is Python.

791
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I plug my mouth.

792
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Kun Xian's speech.

793
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The link of the video.

794
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I put it on the side.

795
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The place to chat.

796
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There is a link.

797
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
If you want to see those webpages.

798
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Go back and look at the webpages.

799
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I just didn't copy it.

800
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You can go and see.

801
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Build Dirac.

802
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Build is.

803
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Bring LCCB Dirac.

804
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Then put your database in.

805
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
This way.

806
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The picture on the left.

807
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Data transmission.

808
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Data transmission.

809
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Green is successful.

810
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Red is a failure.

811
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You can see the Japanese team.

812
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
To the United States has been a failure.

813
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I don't know what happened.

814
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Have been a failure.

815
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Other places are successful.

816
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
More.

817
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The prototype is a success.

818
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
The ratio of failure.

819
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Basically we are.

820
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We did the experiment.

821
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
After.

822
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Because we are at the end.

823
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Will save a copy.

824
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Then we will.

825
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Push to the United States.

826
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
BNL.

827
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Blue Heaven.

828
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
In New York.

829
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
There is a copy.

830
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Experimental data.

831
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There are some others.

832
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Do you have 100 institutes?

833
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
100 institutes.

834
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Every institute.

835
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
There are a few more.

836
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
A few more.

837
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
There will be a total of three.

838
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
After we do the experiment.

839
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We will put two copies of data.

840
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Push out to BNL.

841
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
With other sites.

842
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So every site will have.

843
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Their own.

844
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Data copy.

845
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Of course.

846
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
This is actually the data of the experiment.

847
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
For example, the simulation.

848
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Put it on BNL.

849
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Or put it on KK.

850
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Put it on other sites.

851
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
For example, Taiwan also has.

852
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
In the computer.

853
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
We also provide resources to them.

854
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
There is also a storage unit.

855
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It will be stored there.

856
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Then.

857
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
For example, I submitted a job.

858
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I may need a certain file.

859
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He will go to the database.

860
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I submitted a job.

861
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
This job.

862
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
For example, Italy.

863
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
This is a job in Italy.

864
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
For example.

865
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
In Bologna.

866
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
In Bologna.

867
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He will look for nearby.

868
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
For example, I want a file.

869
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Where is the file in the database?

870
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Where is it?

871
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He will look for nearby.

872
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Nearby storage unit.

873
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
See if he has it.

874
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This is pretty much the case.

875
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This time frame.

876
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Time relationship.

877
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I do not speak in great detail.

878
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It is probably such a frame.

879
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
To do the analysis.

880
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
OK, then the last thing is.

881
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
To support.

882
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
The spirit of implementation.

883
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So I say.

884
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
A case of NNW.

885
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
In fact, in the high-end.

886
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
We also started to try.

887
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Now we continue to learn to do it.

888
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This is the first thing.

889
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Then it is just mentioned.

890
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
EHOMEDIC CHROMETER.

891
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This.

892
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You can see that it is in.

893
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It shines here.

894
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Then it is the same.

895
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
After the gamma ray hits in.

896
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It will be decomposed.

897
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This is a CSI crystallization.

898
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
CSI crystallization.

899
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Then the decomposition will shine.

900
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Of course.

901
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It is impossible that only one will shine.

902
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
This is BELL VR.

903
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Everyone is interested.

904
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You can download it.

905
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The download is here.

906
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
VR.

907
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It has VR.

908
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
For example.

909
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
A gamma ray runs in.

910
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Then it will.

911
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It will decompose a lot of things.

912
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Run out.

913
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Of course it decomposes a lot of things.

914
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It can not only be in one ECL.

915
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
It is distributed in several ECLs.

916
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
This VR is really interesting.

917
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
That.

918
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yes.

919
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
You can download it.

920
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Then.

921
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
For example.

922
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
A gamma ray runs in.

923
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It will decompose.

924
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Then decompose into other things.

925
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Then.

926
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
This is CSI.

927
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It is our luminous body.

928
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Then it will be divided.

929
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Then here.

930
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Because.

931
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
This luminous body will shine.

932
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It actually supports the structure.

933
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
For example, like steel.

934
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Aluminum plate.

935
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Then it will not shine.

936
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So you can't measure it here.

937
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Because it may be outside.

938
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Lack of energy.

939
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It is anyway.

940
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Electrolytes in matter.

941
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Loss of energy.

942
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
This is called CSI leakage.

943
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Then it may leak to the back.

944
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
In fact, there will be a leak.

945
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
What is it actually?

946
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
For example, like this.

947
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The simulation is actually like this.

948
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
A gamma ray comes in from the right.

949
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Then there will be a lot at the back.

950
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Leakage.

951
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Leakage out.

952
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The structure will also have some.

953
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Leakage.

954
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What will this cause?

955
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
For example, there is a mode.

956
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It is called B plus to low plus.

957
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I do not know.

958
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Anyway, the back will become.

959
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
A lot of gamma rays.

960
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Then there is a pi plus.

961
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Anyway, I remember a lot of gamma rays.

962
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Then we are from this.

963
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
A lot of gamma rays and pi plus.

964
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Then we combine it into B plus.

965
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Of course, our B plus.

966
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The energy of its low mass.

967
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Is from this pi plus.

968
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Combined with a lot of gamma rays.

969
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Then we.

970
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
If there is a leakage.

971
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You will find that OK.

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
B plus energy.

973
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It will not be a good one.

974
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
That is.

975
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
For example, like the standard.

976
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Standard distribution is not.

977
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It will be like this.

978
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
This curve is like this.

979
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It will have a tail here.

980
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It has a lot of low energy places.

981
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Event here.

982
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Because it is inaccurate.

983
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It will have leakage there.

984
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That.

985
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
This problem appears.

986
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Let's take a look.

987
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What is ECL?

988
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
ECL is like this.

989
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Eight thousand.

990
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Arranged mess.

991
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I think it's hard to do.

992
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So let's do something simple at the beginning.

993
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Do something simple at the beginning.

994
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
30x30.

995
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Crystal array.

996
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
30x30.

997
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Because this is my special.

998
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It is done by PyCon.

999
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Then this simulation.

1000
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
If you are interested, you can take a look.

1001
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Here.

1002
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
For everyone.

1003
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
If we measure the energy.

1004
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
In fact, it is the energy of each individual crystal.

1005
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Then put it together.

1006
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Just add it up like this.

1007
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Is that OK?

1008
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This is the traditional way we measure energy.

1009
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
OK.

1010
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
After the gamma ray hits.

1011
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It has energy for each crystal.

1012
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Measure the energy.

1013
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Then we measure the energy of each crystal.

1014
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
All add up.

1015
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
This is the way we measure energy.

1016
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Like this.

1017
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But it will leak.

1018
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
For example, like this.

1019
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
The gamma ray hits in.

1020
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Hit here.

1021
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Some leaked.

1022
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It will become OK.

1023
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Energy is gone.

1024
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
For example, we hit.

1025
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Gamma ray energy.

1026
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Is 200mEV.

1027
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Then we hit 10,000 times.

1028
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Then we measure the energy.

1029
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
How is the energy of the gamma ray?

1030
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Its distribution will be like this.

1031
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yes.

1032
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Of course, there are also 200.

1033
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Most of the words.

1034
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Will not reach 200.

1035
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Even some words.

1036
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
150, 125.

1037
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It will not be able to measure all.

1038
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Measure the energy.

1039
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Is not accurate.

1040
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Measure the energy is not accurate.

1041
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
How to do it?

1042
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Just add it up.

1043
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Not good enough.

1044
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Then we.

1045
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
This question.

1046
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Is a return question.

1047
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Your true energy is 200.

1048
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Then your prediction.

1049
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Is.

1050
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Your prediction.

1051
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You want to measure now.

1052
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
How much is the energy?

1053
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Is a return question.

1054
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yes.

1055
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But now you have total.

1056
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Other crystal patterns.

1057
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
In fact, I thought later.

1058
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
A method is.

1059
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
For example, you go to see alone.

1060
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The energy distribution of the crystal.

1061
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Then this is.

1062
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Gamma ray energy.

1063
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Is a crystal.

1064
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Slightly to the right.

1065
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Its energy distribution.

1066
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's a little different.

1067
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Then we suspect.

1068
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Is not hit in the middle.

1069
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The energy distribution.

1070
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Will be different from the middle.

1071
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Then he measured.

1072
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The degree of leakage.

1073
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Should be different.

1074
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This is.

1075
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Our energy distribution.

1076
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Pattern.

1077
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is a picture.

1078
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
The picture inside.

1079
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The picture inside is different.

1080
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
For example, people are different.

1081
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Animals are different.

1082
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
If the distribution is different.

1083
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That means.

1084
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Energy will be different.

1085
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That's simple.

1086
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That's OK.

1087
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Then we.

1088
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
There should be.

1089
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
There should be a way to do this.

1090
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Then we think of.

1091
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
CNN.

1092
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
If you have time.

1093
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You can go to see.

1094
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Course.

1095
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
CNN.

1096
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I think.

1097
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
The most detailed should be him.

1098
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
CNN.

1099
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Different patterns on the map.

1100
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Find some characteristics.

1101
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Then use the machine learning method.

1102
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Find the characteristics of the machine.

1103
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Then do it.

1104
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
This is the actual simulation.

1105
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Result.

1106
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Hit the energy here.

1107
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
There is a pattern here.

1108
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
If you have learned.

1109
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Machine learning.

1110
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Our target is.

1111
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Y2.

1112
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Usually use this.

1113
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Y2.

1114
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
What we want to do.

1115
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
We want to predict.

1116
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
How much is the real energy?

1117
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We use.

1118
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
This energy.

1119
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Put it at the bottom.

1120
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Total energy.

1121
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
We just.

1122
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Put it on top of the energy.

1123
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Y2 is like this.

1124
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The advantage of doing this is.

1125
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
If you look at the front.

1126
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Because it is less than 200.

1127
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Between 0 and 1.

1128
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Between 0 and 1.

1129
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Our prediction.

1130
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Prediction is the result of our CNN.

1131
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Then we put the prediction.

1132
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Divided by our Dtotal.

1133
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You can get our.

1134
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The energy predicted by CNN.

1135
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The loss function.

1136
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Prediction minus Y2.

1137
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
If you know.

1138
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What is CNN?

1139
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
If you want to know what CNN is.

1140
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
You can also ask me in person.

1141
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Our neural network.

1142
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The structure is like this.

1143
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm sorry.

1144
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Because I put it directly.

1145
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Production neural network.

1146
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Put it in the simulation.

1147
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It's a bit too complicated.

1148
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
After the image.

1149
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We use.

1150
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I want to.

1151
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
My idea is to use that.

1152
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Google has one.

1153
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
There is a competition called Imagine.

1154
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
There is a.

1155
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The method of Inception.

1156
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
He used.

1157
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
He used parallel.

1158
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Then use three different sizes.

1159
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
3x3, 5x5, 7x7.

1160
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Then start to layer by layer.

1161
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I only use one layer.

1162
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Inception, I only use one layer.

1163
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Use this method.

1164
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Find characteristics.

1165
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Is different.

1166
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Size of things.

1167
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Why do I.

1168
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
This 30x30 also uses this method.

1169
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Because this method is actually.

1170
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Use real ECL method.

1171
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm sorry.

1172
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Use it directly.

1173
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Then at the end.

1174
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Then pull it.

1175
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Then convolution.

1176
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Below.

1177
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Then pull it flat.

1178
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Then get it at the end.

1179
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Use Sigma function.

1180
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
My target function.

1181
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
My target is limited to 0 to 1.

1182
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Then do it at the end.

1183
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
If you go.

1184
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm going to hit 4000.

1185
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm going to hit 10,000.

1186
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
10,000.

1187
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
4G EV.

1188
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
4000 EV Gamma Ray.

1189
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I originally got.

1190
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The energy distribution should be like this.

1191
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Red like this.

1192
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Very ugly with a big tail.

1193
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Now it's green.

1194
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I feel.

1195
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
You see the middle is back to 4000.

1196
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It seems a little bigger.

1197
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Although the tail is still there.

1198
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But there are tails on both sides.

1199
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Not so long.

1200
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Then the last result here.

1201
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Although a little bad.

1202
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Because I didn't go all the way.

1203
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
OK.

1204
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
This is.

1205
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The picture on the left is.

1206
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
How much is the real energy?

1207
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
From 500 to 5000.

1208
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Then.

1209
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The axis is your real.

1210
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Total energy minus your true energy.

1211
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Then divided by your true energy.

1212
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The more absolute value.

1213
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It means that you make more mistakes.

1214
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Absolute value means that you make more mistakes.

1215
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Then we are in high energy.

1216
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Not bad.

1217
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You can see.

1218
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Up to 2000.

1219
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's almost the same as the original method.

1220
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Low energy is a little worse.

1221
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Sorry.

1222
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I didn't finish persuading.

1223
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Really want to persuade.

1224
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
More than a week.

1225
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Then you can persuade it.

1226
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I didn't optimize it.

1227
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I didn't optimize it.

1228
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I didn't optimize it.

1229
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Low energy is not very good.

1230
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Then on the right.

1231
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
If you look at it.

1232
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It will have that.

1233
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
This peak will have an rns.

1234
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Mean square root.

1235
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
nse or nse.

1236
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Sorry, rns.

1237
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Assuming you are normal distribution.

1238
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Then look at it.

1239
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Uh.

1240
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Sigma is its rns.

1241
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Then look at rns.

1242
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Then look at rns.

1243
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Red is the original method.

1244
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Green is my method.

1245
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Green is OK.

1246
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
High energy is better than them.

1247
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Low energy is not very good.

1248
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
This is my temporary persuasion.

1249
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Sorry.

1250
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Simple CNN is still not good enough.

1251
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So.

1252
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
We are.

1253
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I did a lot of modifications in private.

1254
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
For example, the target function has been modified.

1255
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
When there are some patterns.

1256
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
We split it into several.

1257
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Neural network to train separately.

1258
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Then put it together at the end.

1259
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
This is another way.

1260
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
We hope to use this method.

1261
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
To solve the real.

1262
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Fail2 problem.

1263
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Of course, there are other problems.

1264
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
For example, every csi crystal.

1265
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Assuming.

1266
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
This simulation is the same.

1267
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But in fact.

1268
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Fail's csi crystal.

1269
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
There are more than 100.

1270
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Although 8000.

1271
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
There are more than 100.

1272
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
There are more than 100.

1273
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Then there is.

1274
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
The shape is not like 2D.

1275
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Weird distribution.

1276
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It is 3D.

1277
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It is also 2D.

1278
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It is also 2D.

1279
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
But it is a cylinder distribution.

1280
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Then there are some.

1281
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
There are some.

1282
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
For example.

1283
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Or.

1284
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
There are some.

1285
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Weird gamma rays.

1286
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That thing.

1287
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Need to overcome.

1288
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So we have a long way to go.

1289
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Thank you for your participation today.

1290
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
If you use neural network.

1291
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
If you use neural network.

1292
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Google DeepGin.

1293
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Can put the wolf.

1294
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Can put the wolf.

1295
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Or put the little flower.

1296
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
There are some references today.

1297
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
There are some references today.

1298
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You can take a look.

1299
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
If it's just Bell.

1300
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Bell 2's predecessor.

1301
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It also has open data.

1302
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You can play if you are interested.

1303
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Bell 2 is also planning.

1304
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Open data.

1305
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
It's a pity.

1306
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
There is not so much open data.

1307
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That's it.

1308
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Thank you Kun Xian.

1309
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Thank you Kun Xian.

1310
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Thank you Kun Xian.

1311
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1312
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Does anyone have any questions?

1313
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
What is that?

1314
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
More than 100 kinds of CSI.

1315
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
More than 100 kinds of CSI.

1316
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Is it different in ratio.

1317
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And there are impurities and so on.

1318
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Is it different in ratio.

1319
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Is it different in ratio.

1320
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Is it different in ratio.

1321
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It's a little different.

1322
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So what is it with him.

1323
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The ratio of CSMI is different.

1324
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
The ratio of CSMI is different.

1325
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's all the same.

1326
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's all the same.

1327
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But it's a little different.

1328
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
But it's a little different.

1329
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But it's a little different.

1330
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But it's a little different.

1331
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Hello.

1332
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Hello.

1333
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I want to ask a question.

1334
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I just saw you write.

1335
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
When you are in TransCNN.

1336
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Your loss function is used.

1337
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That is.

1338
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That is the ratio.

1339
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
MSE.

1340
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Is there any special reason?

1341
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Is there any special reason?

1342
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Because intuitively.

1343
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I think you want energy.

1344
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I think you want energy.

1345
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Not the ratio.

1346
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Not the ratio.

1347
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Not the ratio.

1348
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It's a good idea.

1349
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's a good idea.

1350
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It's a good idea.

1351
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Thank you.

1352
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000

Sorry. Are there are other?

1424
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,240
I heard that you will have the

1425
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Ooooo.

1426
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
Ooooo.

1427
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,880
Ooooo.

1428
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
Ooooo.

1429
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,880
Ooooo..

1437
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,380
Like the middle finger and keon.

1438
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,380
Like the middle finger and keon.

1439
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,380
Like the middle finger and keon.

1440
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,380
No, no. They are similar.

1441
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,380
Middle finger and electron.

1442
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,380
They are obviously different in pose shapes.

1443
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,380
Or gamma ray.

1444
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,380
Middle finger and gamma ray have different pose shapes.

1445
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,380
They can be divided by pose shapes.

1446
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,380
Because one is fully battery.

1447
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,380
Because one is fully battery.

1448
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,380
And the other is

1449
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,380
Hedronic shower.

1450
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,380
I'm sorry for those who

1451
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,380
don't have time to make examples.

1452
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,380
One is Hedronic shower and the other is Hedronic shower.

1453
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,380
I've heard of it.

1454
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,380
So that's how they can be divided.

1455
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,380
So that's how they can be divided.

1456
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,380
If both are gamma ray

1457
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,380
and you say this is backlight gamma ray

1458
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,380
and this is signal gamma ray.

1459
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,380
Of course, if it's Hedronic shower,

1460
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,380
it can be divided.

1461
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,380
Just look at it and you'll know.

1462
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,380
Just look at it and you'll know.

1463
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,380
Just look at it and you'll know.

1464
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,380
Anyone else have questions?

1465
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,380
Anyone else have questions?

1466
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,380
Let me talk about it again.

1467
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,380
We'll post this video

1468
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,380
