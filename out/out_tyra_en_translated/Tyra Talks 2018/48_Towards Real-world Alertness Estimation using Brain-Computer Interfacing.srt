1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am today's host, I am Hong Shaoming, I am now working in California as a postdoctoral researcher.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Without further ado, let's introduce today's speaker, Dr. Wei Qunshu.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Dr. Qunshu graduated from the College of Electrical Engineering, and stayed in California to study electrical engineering.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
After graduating, he went to UCSD to study biotechnology, and his professor is Professor Zong Ziping.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He is mainly interested in using the perspective of engineering to use brain-to-brain meetings to study human behavior.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Over the past few years, he has published nearly 10 conference papers and two journal papers.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Without further ado, let's listen to his presentation.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The title is Towards Real-World Awareness Estimation Using Brain-Computer Interface.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's welcome him.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you Shaoming for the introduction.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Today, I will introduce how we measure brain activity and monitor our alertness using a brain-computer interface.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We can easily have a discussion.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
First, I will briefly introduce the brain.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Our brain is a tube of about 3 pounds, about 1,000 grams.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The outermost part of the brain has many folds.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
These folds are composed of many neurons in the brain.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There are about 8.6 billion neurons.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We know that the brain has very strong computing power.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
However, compared to our most powerful computers, its performance is very good.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In terms of energy consumption, it is 100,000 times more efficient than a normal CPU.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Therefore, the brain can only operate at 12 to 25 watts.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This wattage is equivalent to the wattage of a light bulb.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So you can imagine that in some comics, when the character thinks of a point, he will draw a light bulb.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's actually pretty close.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because the brain's power consumption is the power of a light bulb.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The structure of the neural network is composed of cells.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are many vectors.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The vector part collects information from other neural networks around it.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After the information is compiled into the neural network, it will decide whether to power up.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you want to power up, you can use the axis.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Then you can power up to other neural networks.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In this way, complex networks can be used to control the whole person.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Here is a brain signal that I use more often.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's called a brain wave.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's EEG.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Many people have been exposed to EEG.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Especially when a newborn is born, we often do a brain test to see if his vision or hearing is normal.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How does EEG occur?

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There are many neural networks in our brain.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Especially the skin.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Many neural networks are arranged.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There are some rules in the structure.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The arrangement of the rules allows the neural network to have an additional effect when it is powering up.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The change in the electrical field can be so great that you can feel the change in the electrical field outside the scalp.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The change in the electrical field becomes our brain wave signal after some processing.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt me.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Our brain wave signal is...

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have a question.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There is a line below.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
BlueJeans meeting is sharing your screen with bluejeans.com.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You have to press the hide button.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, okay.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Or you can block it a little bit.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can continue.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's continue.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is the brain wave signal.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It is a real-time signal.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can see that it is like a time series.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It is a time series.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In order to measure the whole brain, we will try to arrange electrical fields outside the scalp.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So we will have a lot of brain waves on both sides at the same time.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We will analyze the energy of brain waves in terms of frequency.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The frequency depends on whether the signal is fast or slow.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The high frequency is the fast part.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The low frequency is the slow part.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So we will divide delta.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It is a low frequency activity of less than 3.5 Hz.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is a very slow vibration.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you go higher, it will be divided into theta wave, alpha wave, or beta wave.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The higher the frequency, the faster the vibration.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Our brain can be divided into different bands.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
By observing the energy of the band, we can get a lot of information.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let me introduce the location of the channel of the brain.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It has a standard way of dividing.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The name of the channel is divided into points.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Frontal is the channel at the beginning of F.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Central is the channel at the beginning of C.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Central parietal is the channel at the beginning of O.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Occipital is the channel at the beginning of O.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We can do this frequency analysis for each channel.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We can combine the change of time with the change of frequency.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We can see the energy of different bands over time.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This can tell us a lot of information about the state of this person.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We can design experiments to see if the brain changes.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We can find some characteristics in different states.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Reflect the brain in different states.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The brain interface is where we read the signals of the brain.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then we go through some signal processing, including frequency analysis.

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Or you can use a lot of other different signal processing methods to get different characteristics.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then we use the processed signals to make it recognizable.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then we can convert it into some commands to control.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For example, a mechanical arm or a wheel or a mouse cursor.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or to input text or some messages.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We call this the brain computer interface.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In short, it's BCI.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What can BCI do?

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
As I just said, it can convert into commands.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So when we play video games, we can use it to control the movement of your character.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Of course, including the wheel and the mechanical arm.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course, it can also be used to monitor a person's cognitive state.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Including whether you want to sleep.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This extends to my main area of expertise.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Monitoring the level of awareness.

108
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The level of awareness is related to drowsy driving.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A lot of people fall asleep while driving.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This news happened on July 18th.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It was recently that a drowsy driving incident happened.

112
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It was recently that a drowsy driving incident happened.

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Did you turn on the sound in the group chat?

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Or we don't need to hear the sound?

115
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, so we can't hear the sound?

116
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I didn't hear it.

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's see what to do.

118
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What to do?

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't do it.

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Can you play it on your computer?

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Can you hear me?

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Can you hear me?

125
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes.

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Can you hear me?

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes.

128
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can hear you.

129
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can hear you.

130
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Can you hear me now?

131
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Max.

133
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And then after 11 hours a day, we have to shut down and have 10 hours of sleep.

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We now have to carry electronic recording devices on our vehicles.

135
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Rio says his students learn to make driving plans to avoid getting fatigued,

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and they're encouraged to stop to power nap or just stretch their legs.

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It does give you more stamina.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're more alert.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Because when you're not alert, you know, you can't make good decisions.

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And that's what truckers like Rudy live by.

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I start closing, you got to pull over and take a nap.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
GoMana, 8 News Now.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says drowsy driving

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
causes up to 1.2 million crashes every year in this country,

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.

146
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's nearly twice as many as distracted driving.

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And that's two deaths and three injuries.

148
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And drowsy driving can cause up to 1.2 million crashes every year,

149
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.

150
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So if we can avoid drowsy driving,

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
if we can effectively monitor drowsy driving,

152
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and then manage it,

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
maybe we can avoid some of the deaths and injuries caused by this.

154
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And then there was a comment in the news

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that if you find that your eyes are closing,

156
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
then you should stop driving.

157
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But with drowsy driving,

158
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I discussed with Shaoming last time

159
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
if you can monitor drowsy driving

160
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
with your eyes or blinkers.

161
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But there's a problem.

162
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is there a way to catch it before it closes its eyes

163
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that it's actually unable to pay attention to driving?

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This part may want to use brainwaves to break through this problem.

165
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If we use the brain-machine interface to do this alertness monitoring,

166
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
we will first, of course,

167
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
measure its brainwaves from the driver.

168
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
After we get this EEG signal,

169
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
after some processing,

170
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
we use machine learning to build a model

171
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that can convert EEG data into alertness.

172
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
After we know its alertness,

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
we can try to give it some feedback.

174
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
For example, we can wake it up,

175
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
or we can make the car stop driving,

176
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
stop on the side of the road,

177
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
or force it to rest.

178
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
There are some ways to intervene.

179
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
My research is mainly about how we deal with this signal,

180
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
how we build a machine learning model

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
that can monitor alertness very well.

182
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We can accurately determine whether to make some interventions.

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I have a question.

184
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I want to clarify a little bit.

185
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Are you saying that your research is about

186
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the state of mental relaxation,

187
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or the state of actually falling asleep?

188
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's the state of waking up to almost falling asleep.

189
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's not really asleep yet.

190
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I haven't studied the state of the brain after falling asleep.

191
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I want to capture the state of the brain before falling asleep.

192
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I have experience in driving,

193
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and I know that my eyes were open at that time,

194
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but the image was blurred and black,

195
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and I wasn't looking at the road anymore.

196
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was a little out of my mind,

197
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and then I suddenly woke up,

198
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and I felt a little shaky.

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I started to shake a little.

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So it's about getting into the time point.

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It depends on when you can't support the alertness,

202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and then you fall asleep.

203
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have another question.

204
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You want to identify a signal,

205
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and then you think you want to identify this signal

206
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
is the state you're talking about now.

207
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes.

208
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you have a contrast group?

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
For example, you track his eyes,

210
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and then you say,

211
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I define that the behavior of the eyes

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is the state of mind to fall asleep.

213
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then I look for the corresponding brain wave.

214
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Or I tell the victim to write,

215
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
yes, I feel like I'm going to fall asleep now.

216
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What is your calibration?

217
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This question is very good.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
How do we define our so-called alertness?

219
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to talk about it next.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because we think alertness is related to your reaction time.

221
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So we use reaction time

222
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
to give us an objective way of measuring.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Just like you said,

224
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
using the eyes or the way of subject return.

225
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The part of the eyes is that

226
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
the movement of the eyes is also a physiological signal.

227
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So whether he can react directly to this behavior

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
is another experiment.

229
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
His role is the same as the brain wave.

230
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It just depends on which physiological signal

231
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
can make it easier for us to be more accurate

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
to determine whether it is alert or not.

233
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Subject report is a subjective assessment.

234
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Subjective assessment will have some deviations.

235
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That is to say, the word that the subject reported

236
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
is not very objective

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to express the state he just experienced.

238
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Many researchers think

239
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
a more objective way of judging

240
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
is to look at his reaction time.

241
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Next, I will talk about

242
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
how we measure brain waves

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and at the same time measure his reaction time.

244
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And how to define it.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Finally, I will talk about

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
how to define alertness.

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Does this answer your question?

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, thank you.

249
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Thank you.

250
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I will talk about our experiment

251
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and how to get the data we want.

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We put the subject in a simulated driving car.

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The car has a 360-degree projection screen.

254
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The car is on a dynamic platform.

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We drive inside

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to simulate the real driving situation.

257
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This is a device in the brain center

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
of the University of Transportation,

259
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the brain science center.

260
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
In this experiment,

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
we do a task to maintain the lane.

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
To maintain the lane,

263
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the subject must maintain the car

264
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
on the lane.

265
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The car will automatically make him turn left.

266
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We force the subject to adjust

267
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the direction of the car on a regular basis.

268
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The scene is on a straight highway.

269
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But the car will turn to the left

270
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
or to the right.

271
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Not necessarily.

272
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It will turn once every 6 to 10 seconds.

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We see that the subject

274
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
feels that the car is turning to the left.

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He moves the steering wheel

276
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
to guide the car.

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We see when the subject

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
moves the steering wheel.

279
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This is the reaction time.

280
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Every 6 to 10 seconds,

281
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
we can measure the reaction time.

282
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We hope that

283
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
from the brain wave before the lane,

284
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
we can predict

285
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
the reaction time.

286
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This is the role of prediction.

287
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Next, I will talk about

288
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
how to deal with the reaction time

289
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and how to get

290
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
the alertness estimate.

291
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
As mentioned,

292
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
every 6 to 10 seconds,

293
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
we will have a response time sample.

294
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
On the y-axis,

295
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I draw the response time.

296
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I choose log.

297
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
On the horizontal axis,

298
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I draw the time.

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The unit is divided.

300
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This is the length of the whole experiment.

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The length of the experiment is not certain.

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is shorter.

303
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It is only 45 minutes.

304
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Most of the experiments

305
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
took more than an hour.

306
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
About an hour and a half.

307
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We sometimes ask the same subject

308
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
to come back and do it.

309
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We finally collected

310
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let me see.

311
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There is nothing here.

312
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We finally collected

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
more than 30 subjects.

314
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There are 50 to 60 car experiments.

315
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's talk about

316
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
every point here.

317
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
These are the RTs we just measured.

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
10 to the power of 0 is about 1 second.

319
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When it wakes up,

320
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
in less than 1 second,

321
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
we can get the car back.

322
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
After a while,

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
the car is not in a good condition.

324
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
After the alertness starts to decline,

325
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
we will see some

326
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
longer reaction times.

327
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
In fact, the reaction is that

328
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
its alertness becomes worse.

329
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
We need to process this RT data.

330
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Because RT is not a range.

331
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Only one side has a range.

332
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The other side has no range.

333
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's make a regularization of it first.

334
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Turn it into a value of 0 to 1.

335
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The way to regularize it

336
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
is to use its cumulative distribution function.

337
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Then map it to a value with a range.

338
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Let's do a smoothing here.

339
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
For smoothing,

340
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I use a 90-second moving window

341
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
to turn this

342
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
jumpy value

343
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
into a smoother value.

344
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
This is because

345
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
we only sample RT once every 6 to 10 seconds.

346
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If you look at this data

347
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
with too high frequency,

348
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
it is more meaningless.

349
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If we use a smoothing,

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
we can get rid of

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
some misanalysis of this data.

352
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So we use this

353
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
alertness deficit index

354
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
as a ground truth

355
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
in our behavior.

356
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Does anyone have any questions?

357
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Let's assume that

358
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
RT directly reflects

359
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the level of alertness of this person.

360
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If RT is longer,

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
alertness should be one of the factors.

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes.

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So it depends on the design of the experiment.

364
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Let's also assume that

365
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
the experiment design

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
only affects RT.

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We try to eliminate

368
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
other factors that may affect RT.

369
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because similar experiments

370
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
will also be used

371
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
to study

372
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
mind-wandering.

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Mind-wandering and alertness

374
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
are related,

375
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but not exactly the same.

376
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
For example,

377
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
when your subject drives,

378
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
he starts to think about other things.

379
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
His RT becomes longer.

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
In your definition,

381
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
this is a lack of alertness.

382
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yes.

383
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But for you,

384
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
it is acceptable.

385
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So our alertness

386
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
is based on

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the alertness defined by RT.

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If the subject doesn't react,

389
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
like you said,

390
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
he may be thinking about other things.

391
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes.

392
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Of course,

393
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
the instruction of our experiment

394
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
is to teach them to focus.

395
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes.

396
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What we can do is only up to here.

397
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Because I think this may affect

398
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
your EEG data in the future.

399
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Imagine that

400
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
there are three reasons for his RT to become longer.

401
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yes.

402
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Do you actually catch three patterns?

403
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The three patterns are different.

404
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
For example,

405
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
when you train your data,

406
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
your accuracy will be lower.

407
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Because your data

408
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
is not high enough.

409
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Sometimes it may be because of A,

410
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
sometimes because of B,

411
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
sometimes because of C.

412
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yes.

413
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So it's impossible to be completely accurate.

414
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And like you just said,

415
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
mind-wandering,

416
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
we can't control it.

417
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But for us,

418
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
when his RT becomes longer,

419
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
it's actually quite long.

420
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
For example, 5 seconds.

421
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
If he really thinks about other things for 5 seconds

422
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and doesn't follow our instructions

423
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
to guide him,

424
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know what to do.

425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
OK.

426
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
In terms of concept,

427
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
if you have a test...

428
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But what we see is

429
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that he really feels like he is dead.

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yes.

431
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
There may be some trials.

432
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Like you said,

433
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
there may be other factors.

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And then there are some

435
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
miscommunications on it.

436
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This part can't be ruled out.

437
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yes.

438
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
OK.

439
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In terms of concept,

440
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
if your test can separate

441
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
things that affect RT

442
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
from each other,

443
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
then you deal with these...

444
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
When you deal with this information,

445
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
you deal with it separately.

446
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Your model will be cleaner.

447
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Ideal situation.

448
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Ideal situation.

449
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But of course,

450
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
you can't cover so many different factors

451
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
at the same time.

452
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes.

453
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes.

454
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In terms of brain science,

455
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
we often have this problem.

456
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You can't control what the subject is thinking.

457
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
That's right.

458
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes.

459
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
OK.

460
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's a bit awkward.

461
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Actually, I have a different idea about this.

462
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes.

463
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If you want to throw this data

464
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
into machine learning,

465
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
if there are three reasons,

466
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
whether he wants to sleep

467
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
or he's thinking about something crazy,

468
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the pattern recognition of your algorithm

469
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
may be persuaded to

470
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
identify three different reasons.

471
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But for whatever reason,

472
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it will indicate that

473
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
this person is now

474
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
lying and not paying attention.

475
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Isn't that good?

476
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's possible.

477
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So in the end,

478
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
in the end,

479
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
his algorithm can

480
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
be oriented for whatever reason.

481
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It can prevent your RT from getting longer.

482
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
No, I think this time

483
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
we have to go back to the original question.

484
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What do you want to detect?

485
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes.

486
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
For example,

487
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
let's say you want to promote a policy.

488
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
What you want to know is

489
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that in this case,

490
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
you want to avoid drowsy driving.

491
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yes, this whole thing

492
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
is set for drowsy driving.

493
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But you later found that

494
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the other important factor

495
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
that affects their driving

496
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
or the traffic situation

497
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
is mind wandering.

498
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Even if you can

499
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
detect mind wandering at the same time,

500
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
but when you are making a policy,

501
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
these two are completely different things.

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
How do you avoid A and avoid B?

503
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Completely different.

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So in the end,

505
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
if it is from the point of view of brain science,

506
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
what we want to know is

507
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
what happened

508
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
during that period of time.

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
The reason I ask this question is like this.

510
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yes, but there may be

511
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I think what you said is possible.

512
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
When machine learning is done,

513
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
it may be able to identify

514
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
all the patterns

515
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
as a lack of awareness.

516
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This is also possible.

517
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes.

518
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So,

519
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
like what Yan-Yong mentioned,

520
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
if I use machine learning,

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
it will learn

522
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
the relationship between data.

523
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Then you get

524
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
a whole thing

525
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that affects RT.

526
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know what it is.

527
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes.

528
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then,

529
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
in addition,

530
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
we have

531
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
just discussed

532
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
assuming that

533
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
some different cognitive phenomena

534
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
can be disassembled.

535
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It can be seen independently.

536
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Or there is some interaction between them.

537
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
If we want to

538
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
use our data

539
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
to disassemble

540
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
different cognitive states

541
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and the impact on RT,

542
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
in fact,

543
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
there is no way to do it

544
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
with just one experiment.

545
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It may still be necessary

546
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to do different experiments

547
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
to estimate

548
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
which cognitive state

549
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
will affect RT.

550
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Here,

551
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
our experiment

552
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
tries to say

553
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that there is only one effect.

554
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Try,

555
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
but can't guarantee.

556
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
If we say

557
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
in this trial,

558
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
for example,

559
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
90% of it

560
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
is as we imagined

561
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
because of

562
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Drowsy.

563
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Because we let him do it

564
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
after lunch.

565
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Then we asked him to drive

566
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that highway

567
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
in a full-time lab.

568
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So we hope

569
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
to let him

570
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
take a nap in this way.

571
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So at least

572
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
in this process,

573
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it may be

574
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
closer to

575
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
what we hope

576
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
to trigger.

577
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Is that OK?

578
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
OK.

579
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
My question has been answered.

580
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
OK.

581
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Because this part is

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I will talk about it later.

583
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
In fact, this is very troublesome.

584
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Because many cognitive states

585
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
do not have

586
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
a good objective definition.

587
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
In the future,

588
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I think

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
there are some

590
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
whether it is

591
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
brain interface

592
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
or cognitive science

593
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
to move forward.

594
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
In fact, this is a big problem.

595
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
OK.

596
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Then I will continue to talk about my research.

597
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
OK.

598
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Then,

599
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
just mentioned that

600
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
our brain waves

601
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
can be divided into

602
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
some features of different platforms.

603
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So here is

604
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
some of my

605
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
processing

606
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
process

607
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
list it out.

608
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Then EEG,

609
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
we will

610
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
do a

611
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
re-referencing

612
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
for different channels.

613
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That is to say,

614
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
we will

615
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
we are taking

616
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
that

617
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
all channels

618
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
EEG of all channels

619
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
to reduce

620
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
their overall average.

621
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
This part

622
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
can remove

623
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
some impurities.

624
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Then we do

625
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
bandpass filtering.

626
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because the brain wave

627
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
can measure to

628
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
EEG

629
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
is actually limited.

630
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It is probably

631
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
energy below 50 Hz.

632
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But there are some

633
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
low frequency fluctuations

634
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
may come from

635
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
some

636
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
moving around

637
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
or

638
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
it

639
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
device itself

640
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
caused noise.

641
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So we will

642
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
use a

643
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
usually use 1 to 50 Hz

644
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
or almost this band

645
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
to put this

646
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
brain wave filter.

647
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Then we get

648
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
something that

649
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
really like brain wave.

650
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But there are still

651
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
a lot of artifacts.

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Then we will

653
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
downsampling

654
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is to reduce

655
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
our computing time.

656
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then we do

657
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
subbandpass filtering.

658
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That is to say,

659
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
we divide the brain wave

660
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
into

661
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
brain waves of different platforms.

662
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Just like the one

663
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
in front of you

664
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
is faster

665
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and slower.

666
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then they are

667
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
from delta,

668
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
zeta, alpha

669
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
to beta brain waves.

670
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Then we go

671
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
to its energy

672
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and then

673
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
do

674
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the same as we do

675
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
a smoothing.

676
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That is,

677
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
corresponding to

678
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
the smoothing we just did,

679
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
we are now using

680
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
90-second

681
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
moving window

682
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to make a

683
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
brain wave energy

684
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
characteristic

685
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
to do smoothing.

686
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then get our

687
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
data.

688
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So we have

689
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
brain wave energy now.

690
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Then we just

691
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
have an

692
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
alertness index.

693
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So we

694
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
now take

695
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
these two things

696
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
to make a comparison.

697
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Then this

698
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
every small picture

699
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
its Y

700
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
means

701
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the energy of

702
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
EEG.

703
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Then X

704
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
means

705
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the alertness

706
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
index

707
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
just now.

708
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So

709
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
X

710
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
to the right

711
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
is that

712
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
it

713
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
reacts slower and slower.

714
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Then

715
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Y

716
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
up

717
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
is that

718
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
EEG

719
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the energy of that platform

720
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
is getting stronger and stronger.

721
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So here are

722
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
delta, zeta, alpha, beta

723
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
different platforms.

724
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Then we

725
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
then I put

726
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
a few channels

727
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
out.

728
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
There is a frontal

729
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
front

730
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and then central.

731
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Then

732
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Z is the

733
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
midline part

734
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
is the middle

735
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
is the middle of the front

736
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
and then the middle of the

737
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
middle

738
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
parietal

739
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
middle

740
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
and then

741
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the

742
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
back

743
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
the back

744
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
middle.

745
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Then in

746
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
its own position

747
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
it

748
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
different platforms

749
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and then

750
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
its

751
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
EEG energy

752
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
changes

753
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
with

754
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
some

755
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
relationships.

756
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Like the delta part

757
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
it is a positive

758
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
like this 0.77

759
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
is a

760
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000

761
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes,

762
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
like alpha

763
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
here we can see

764
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it is a

765
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
negative

766
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
it is

767
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
negative

768
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
0.28

769
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that is

770
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
become

771
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
when you

772
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
alertness

773
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
down

774
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
after

775
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the

776
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
alpha

777
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
platform

778
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000

779
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
decrease

780
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and then

781
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
this part

782
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
first

783
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
the

784
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000

785
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000

786
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
different.

787
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So we

788
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
here I

789
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
use a

790
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000

791
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000

793
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000

795
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that

796
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
a certain

797
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000

799
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
with

800
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
the

801
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000

802
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000

803
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
alertness.

804
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Here is

805
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
to show

806
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
its

807
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000

808
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000

810
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Red is

811
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
positive

812
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000

813
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
green is

814
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
negative.

815
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So this

816
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
picture

817
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
this experiment

819
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
we got

820
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
the result of

821
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000

823
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This

824
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
picture

825
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000

841
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
is

842
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000

849
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Or

850
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
