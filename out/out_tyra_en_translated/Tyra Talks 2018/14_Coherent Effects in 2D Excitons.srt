00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
First of all, I would like to welcome everyone to our Chira Talk on August 4th.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We are honored to have Jason Hong, a student from Hong Shi An University, to give a speech on his latest research.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Before we start, let me briefly introduce Jason.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Jason graduated from the University of Taiwan in the Department of Physics.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He did his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He is currently working as a postdoc in Michigan.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
His current field of expertise is the application of super fast light in solid matter.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
His main research topics include graphene optical sensors,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:01,000
coherent exotonic effects in 2D materials, and cavity exotonic polaroids.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In today's talk, he will introduce some basic principles and applications of super fast light.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He will use super fast light and light-matter interactions to understand the dynamics of electrons in solid state physics.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He will also discuss related research in super fast light and exotonic effects.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If there are no further questions, let's welcome Jason to start his talk.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hello everyone.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am very happy to be invited to Chira Talk.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is today's outline.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the beginning, I will talk about what super fast light is, the history of super fast light, and a very important technique called pump probe measurement.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:44,000
On the other hand, I will briefly explain what is special about the acetone in the coherent exotonic materials.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Finally, I will talk about my recent research.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In the coherent exotonic materials, there are not only acetone, but also biacetone effects.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will start with super fast light.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The so-called super fast light is actually a super fast phenomenon that uses light to study the extremity of time.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Generally speaking, the definition of a super fast phenomenon is the phenomenon between a femtosecond and a picosecond.

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We call it a super fast phenomenon, but there is no clear definition.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Femtosecond is 10 to the power of negative 50 square seconds, and picosecond is 10 to the power of negative 20 square seconds.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
However, we will briefly introduce the extent of time later.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The main reason why we use light to study these super fast phenomena is that there are many super fast phenomena that cannot be observed in other ways.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
For example, the general method of electrolysis.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Everyone knows that electrolysis is basically to charge.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The charging time is actually around nanoseconds.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:16,000
For example, the switch speed of these computers is about gigahertz, and gigahertz is about nanoseconds.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Even if the electrolysis is done well, the time you can observe is only about nanoseconds.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There is no way to do better.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you want to observe these super fast phenomena with a shorter time period, you have to use light.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
At this time, we have a technique called pump-up technique, and we can use it to observe these super fast phenomena.

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Basically, in my own concept, light is basically photography, which is the art of capturing light.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For example, when we usually shoot small objects, this is called micro light.

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
When we turn a black and white camera into a color camera, what we are actually doing is photography.

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We can study the reaction of a object to a different amount of light with different energy.

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is called photography.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The meaning of super fast photography is actually high-speed photography.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For example, when we watch TV, when a baseball player throws a ball, he basically uses high-speed photography to do these things.

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Super fast photography basically uses high-speed photography to the extreme.

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What is photography?

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There is a picture here.

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Basically, photography is that you have a light source, and the light source shines on your object, on your model.

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The model will reflect light or penetrate light.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
People don't penetrate light, so this is reflected light.

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
In the end, the reflected light is taken down by the photographer with these cameras.

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is called photography.

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sometimes you need something else.

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
For example, you need another assistant to remind your model to remember to smile.

56
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
When you add all these things together, this is called photography.

57
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When it comes to super fast photography, I have to talk about the interesting history.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A long time ago, people had a question.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When a horse is running, is it possible that when the horse is running, the four legs will float in the air for a moment?

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It may not seem like a problem now, but you may think it's not useful at all.

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This was in the 1870s.

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
These people were very passionate about racing horses.

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This was a very interesting question at the time.

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
People wanted to know how the horse ran.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But you can't see it with your eyes.

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You can't record it and tell everyone how the horse ran.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
At that time, there was a man named Leland Stanford.

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He was the governor of California.

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He thought that when the horse was running, the four legs might float in the air for a moment.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But no one believed him.

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Leland Stanford was very rich.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He asked Edwin Muybridge, who was a photographer, to research how to capture these fast things.

73
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He gave him a $25,000 research fund.

74
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think it was a huge amount of money at the time.

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
After several years of hard work, Muybridge invented the shutter.

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The picture on the left is the shutter he invented.

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Basically, it's a few boards.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He used a mechanical method to make the board fall.

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
When the board falls, it blocks the light.

80
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When the light does not pass, it means that the camera will not continue to expose the light.

81
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The shutter speed can be up to 500 microseconds.

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is where he did the experiment.

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Basically, it's a racecourse.

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The horse will run from here to here.

85
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There are 24 cameras.

86
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Each camera has a shutter.

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When the horse runs like this, it will take pictures like this.

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then he got a picture like this.

89
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Basically, you can see that there are 12 pictures here.

90
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is the continuous process of the horse running.

91
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can see that these two pictures clearly show that the horse's four legs are in the air.

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But it's definitely not like the picture above.

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is a very wrong concept.

94
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When the horse is in the air, it's definitely not the state of the legs.

95
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's probably the situation where the legs are shrunk.

96
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is an interesting story.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,000
In that era of super fast light, the method was to take a light source and take a picture of the object you wanted to take.

98
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
How do we choose which time to take a picture?

99
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Use a mechanical shutter.

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The shutter switch is very fast.

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
At this time, we can take a picture that is short in time.

102
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But everyone found that the mechanical shutter has a limit.

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Basically, you can't do it faster than microseconds.

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The next time is nanosecond.

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How to enter this nanosecond?

106
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
An important invention is the light bulb.

107
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The light bulb was invented in 1880.

108
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So it was before Moonbridge.

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is a light bulb?

110
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Light is produced by electricity.

111
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Of course, ordinary light bulbs can't do this.

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But the next invention is this.

113
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We can use electricity to produce light.

114
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So we can adjust this electricity.

115
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The light we produce is a form of pulse.

116
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You can turn on this light at a certain time and turn off this light at another time.

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can use this pulse to hit your object.

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When the object is reflected back to the camera,

119
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you just need to turn off the shutter when the pulse stops.

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In this way, you can measure the time it takes for the pulse to stop.

121
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This method is called frequency-shift observation.

122
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The main concept is that we can't quickly adjust the shutter of the camera.

123
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So we change it to adjust the light source.

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Here are some photos of stroboscopes.

125
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is basically what you see in many photo studios.

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
On the left is a woman waving a golf club.

127
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This speed is also very fast.

128
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Basically, every frame is your flashlight hitting the woman.

129
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Then it reflects back and you take a picture.

130
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
At the next moment, the next pulse hits the woman and you take another picture.

131
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This inventor is a professor at MIT named Edgerton.

132
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He has a nickname called Papa Flash.

133
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Basically, Flash is Flashlight.

134
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's the light source you need for frequency-shift observation.

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This method was invented in 1931.

136
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The picture on the right is an example.

137
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You can use this method to take a picture of the state of the bullet in the air.

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We use frequency-shift observation to reach the level of nanoseconds.

139
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How do we get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds?

140
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The first thing is why we are particularly interested in picoseconds and femtoseconds.

141
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's because there are many physical phenomena that occur at this time.

142
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
For example, phonon vibration.

143
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The vibration of the metal in this material is actually at the level of picoseconds.

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There are also a lot of electrons in this material.

145
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The events of activation and relaxation are actually at the level of femtoseconds.

146
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is why we want to get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds.

147
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The main discovery that can break through nanoseconds is the discovery of magnetic laser.

148
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Laser is basically a game media.

149
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
When the light passes through the game media, the light becomes stronger because of the feedback of the game media.

150
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you put the light in an optical cavity,

151
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The optical cavity is basically made up of two high-reflection mirrors.

152
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
At this time, it becomes a laser.

153
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Of course, we want the laser to output, so we use a semi-transparent mirror on one side to let the laser pass through.

154
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
At this time, you have a laser.

155
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Another interesting thing is that when you have a cavity,

156
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What frequency of light can become a laser?

157
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The important thing is that when the light passes through the cavity,

158
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How to make it a coherent line?

159
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The condition is that when the light passes through the cavity, the light-returned phase is the same.

160
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is the condition.

161
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We can convert it to frequency.

162
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
At this time, you can see that the allowed optical mode is actually a positive integer.

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Multiply by c divided by 2L, where L is the length of the optical cavity.

164
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I have a question.

165
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What kind of material is the game media?

166
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There are many kinds of game media.

167
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We can see all kinds of lasers on the market.

168
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
For example, there are semi-transparent lasers, CO2 lasers, and hydrogen peroxide lasers.

169
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
These are the game media.

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Semi-transparent lasers are used as game media.

171
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
CO2 lasers are used as game media.

172
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There are all kinds of game media.

173
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
As long as there are four lasers, there are two conditions.

174
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The first condition is that there should be game media.

175
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The second condition is that there should be an optical cavity.

176
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
All lasers are indispensable.

177
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There are many ways to do it.

178
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can you give more details about the output coupler?

179
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What is its main function?

180
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Does it allow light to pass through?

181
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The output coupler is actually a mirror.

182
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's just a semi-transparent mirror.

183
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The first thing is that when the light travels through the cavity,

184
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the gain should be greater than the loss.

185
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The reflection rate should not be too low.

186
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If the reflection rate is too low, the loss will be too high.

187
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The gain should be greater than the loss.

188
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The output coupler can also leak some light.

189
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This creates a laser that can be used.

190
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It means that half of the light can pass through the cavity.

191
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This is the basic structure of a laser.

192
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The current laser looks completely different from this one.

193
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can still point out what is game media, what is mirror, and what is its cavity.

194
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The frequency of light that can be allowed is the frequency mode of the equality space.

195
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Let's see what happens.

196
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The picture above is a simulation of an optical mode in the cavity.

197
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is the output of the laser.

198
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
There is only one mode now.

199
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The difference between the two modes is c divided by 2L.

200
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You can see that the frequency of red and green are slightly different.

201
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If we add these two modes together,

202
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
you can see that there is a beating effect.

203
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can see that there is something that looks like a pulse.

204
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When there are four modes, this is more obvious.

205
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
These four modes are c divided by 2L.

206
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can see that the pulse of the output of the laser is more obvious.

207
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Now we can keep adding until there are 30 modes.

208
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You can see that there is a very obvious pulse here.

209
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The general ultrafast laser has hundreds or thousands of modes.

210
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This will make the pulse very obvious.

211
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Another thing is why this thing is called a lock mode laser.

212
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is because when you add a lot of modes,

213
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
there is a condition that their phase must be fixed.

214
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Then these pulses will be formed.

215
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This blue line above

216
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
means that when the phase of these modes is locked,

217
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
you will see that there is a pulse.

218
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
However, when each optical mode has a different phase,

219
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
when they have a random phase,

220
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
you will see that this is probably a general CW laser.

221
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The invention of lock mode laser is surprising.

222
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The invention of lock mode laser was in the 1960s.

223
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was Charles Townes.

224
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They made Mesa or something.

225
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The first invention of lock mode laser was in 1965.

226
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Five years after the invention of lock mode laser,

227
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
everyone has already discovered this lock mode laser.

228
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
After a period of time,

229
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
everyone tried to shorten the pulse of the laser.

230
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
In 1980,

231
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
a method called CPA was invented.

232
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's called True Pulse Amplification.

233
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Basically, it stretches the laser pulse,

234
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
amplifies it, and compresses it.

235
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
At that time,

236
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
it took about 6 femtoseconds to make a die laser.

237
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It was in 1985.

238
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Another technology was invented.

239
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's called Tie Sapphire.

240
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It just changes the laser gain media.

241
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There are many reasons why Tie Sapphire is good.

242
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Basically, it is a semiconductor laser.

243
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
At that time,

244
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
the technology of Tie Sapphire made rapid progress.

245
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
In 2000,

246
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it took about 4 femtoseconds.

247
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This is equivalent to a light oscillation.

248
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
A light in a visible oscillation.

249
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
This is a limit.

250
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
There is no way to continue.

251
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The application of lock mode laser is very wide.

252
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The first application is to use the laser's pulse.

253
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It can be used for a short time.

254
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Basically, it uses rapid pulses

255
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
to study atomic physics, solid physics,

256
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
chemical reactions, and so on.

257
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It can also be used for light communication

258
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and higher harmonic generation.

259
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Another direction is

260
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
because the pulse laser

261
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
collects energy that does not have a pulse time

262
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
in the time that there is a pulse.

263
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
This means that in the pulse time,

264
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the laser beam will be very strong.

265
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Generally, you can get the power

266
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
to 10 to the power of 8 or 10 to the power of 4.

267
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
This can be used to do a lot of interesting things.

268
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If you have super strong light sources,

269
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you can use it to do non-linear light studies.

270
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Recently, some people want to do nuclear fusion.

271
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There are also laser cutting or cosmetic surgery.

272
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You can see that the picture on the right

273
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
is basically the laser's peak power.

274
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It is the laser beam within the pulse time.

275
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It is also a very fast-growing laser.

276
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It can now reach the power of 1 terawatt.

277
00:26:47,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Of course, you can use the laser as a light source.

278
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Because the pulse time is very short,

279
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
you should be able to take very short pictures.

280
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But there is a problem here.

281
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The time is too short to figure out

282
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
how to trigger an event.

283
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
How do you know when the event will happen?

284
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
If you don't know when it will happen,

285
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
you can't take pictures at all.

286
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So the next question is

287
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
how to find the event you want.

288
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The general approach is like this.

289
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The picture on the right.

290
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We are using a pulse laser.

291
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It will emit a pulse.

292
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The red dot is a pulse.

293
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When the red dot reaches the beam splitter,

294
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the pulse will be divided into two parts.

295
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
One part will go through the pump beam.

296
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The other part will go through the pull beam.

297
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The pump beam will hit the sample first.

298
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The pump beam will hit the sample first.

299
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
After the pump beam hits the sample,

300
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
the pull beam will pass the sample

301
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and reach the detector.

302
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
What is the purpose of doing this?

303
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We use pump beam to trigger the sample,

304
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
such as electrons or electrons.

305
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Anyway, no matter what we do,

306
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
we generate an event.

307
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
After a while,

308
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
we use pull beam to observe the event.

309
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Another thing you can do is

310
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to adjust the time difference

311
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
between the pull beam and pump beam.

312
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You can adjust the time difference

313
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
between the pull beam and pump beam.

314
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You will put the pull beam on a delay stage.

315
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
When you adjust the delay stage,

316
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
the pull beam will start to change.

317
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Then you can see

318
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
the evolution of the event over time.

319
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
For example,

320
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
this is a pump probe measurement on a pull beam.

321
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
This is how it works.

322
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Basically,

323
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
a pull beam with a wavelength of 800 nm

324
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
hits the sample.

325
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Then you use a wavelength of 100 nm

326
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
as a probe.

327
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When the probe passes the sample,

328
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
you use the detector to observe the pull beam.

329
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
To simplify it into a dynamic picture,

330
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
it looks like this.

331
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
First, you use the pump beam

332
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
to stimulate the electron.

333
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
When the electron decays for a while,

334
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
you use the pull beam

335
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
to observe the graphene absorption

336
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
under the current situation.

337
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The experimental picture looks like this.

338
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When the time is zero,

339
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
the pump beam and the pull beam

340
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
are in synch.

341
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
This is when you get the biggest reaction.

342
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
As time goes by,

343
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the electron slowly relaxes

344
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
and decays back to its original state.

345
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I have a question.

346
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Sorry.

347
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Why does the curve

348
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
have a different direction?

349
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
This is the experimental detail.

350
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay.

351
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This is not what I want to talk about.

352
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But this is an interesting thing.

353
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
This is what the paper discusses.

354
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
The blue line is graphene in charge neutral,

355
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
which means it is not doping.

356
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You can see this.

357
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
This should be the absorption increase.

358
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I can tell you that

359
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
this line represents the absorption increase.

360
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It means that when you hit an optical beam

361
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
to stimulate the electron,

362
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
you will produce more carriers,

363
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
resulting in a higher conductivity of graphene.

364
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
When the conductivity increases,

365
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
the absorption increases.

366
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The red line is graphene in doping state.

367
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Why is it negative?

368
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It means that the absorption is decreasing.

369
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The reason is that

370
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
when you hit an optical beam,

371
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
you will increase the temperature of the electron.

372
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
When the temperature of the electron increases,

373
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
the conductivity will decrease.

374
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Because it has more scattering.

375
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
When the conductivity decreases,

376
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
the absorption decreases.

377
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Do you mean that it will produce photons?

378
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yes.

379
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay. Thank you.

380
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Basically,

381
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
this means that

382
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
there are a lot of things to study

383
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
in the super fast speed.

384
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Very interesting.

385
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Thank you. Please go on.

386
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
On the other hand,

387
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I want to talk about

388
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the two-dimensional semiconductor.

389
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The first two-dimensional material discovered is graphene.

390
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
As you know,

391
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
graphene is made by the method of exfoliation.

392
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Basically, you take a tape

393
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and put the graphite on it.

394
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then you stick the tape on the substrate

395
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and tear it up.

396
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Then you will find that

397
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
there is a layer of graphene on the substrate.

398
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It looks like this.

399
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Then you look under the microscope

400
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and you can find these

401
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
only one-dimensional flakes.

402
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
This is the band structure of graphene.

403
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Another thing is

404
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
this is the band structure of graphene.

405
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
There are two Dirac cones.

406
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
There are two different Dirac cones.

407
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The reason for these two cones

408
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
is that

409
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
graphene has inversion symmetry

410
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and time reversal symmetry.

411
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
As a result,

412
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
this conduction band

413
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and valence band

414
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
will always have

415
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
a intersection point.

416
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Basically,

417
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
this thing

418
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
means that

419
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
graphene is always a metal.

420
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It is always a metal.

421
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Metal is often bad

422
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and can't do what we want to do.

423
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Another thing is

424
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
because it has two different values,

425
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
there is another degree of freedom

426
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
called pseudo-spin degree of freedom.

427
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
This means that

428
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
you can put these messages

429
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
on these two different values.

430
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If you can manipulate this value,

431
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
you can treat it as 0 and 1.

432
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
For example, 0 is the k-value

433
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and 1 is the negative k-value.

434
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The advantage of this thing is that

435
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
we used to use

436
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Electron's degree of freedom

437
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
to make computers.

438
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Basically,

439
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
the current computer

440
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
uses charge.

441
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
When you turn on the transistor,

442
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the charge will flow.

443
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
When you turn off the transistor,

444
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
the charge will not flow.

445
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
One of the things

446
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
we want to do in the future

447
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
is to use spin.

448
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
When you turn on a switch,

449
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
the spin-up electrons can pass

450
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and the spin-down electrons

451
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
cannot pass.

452
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There is a proposal

453
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that we can also use

454
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Electron's degree of freedom

455
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
in the k-value

456
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
or negative k-value

457
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
as 0 or 1.

458
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
However,

459
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the first thing is

460
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that metal cannot do anything.

461
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We have to find a way

462
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
to open a gap.

463
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
This is a saying.

464
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We want to find a semiconductor.

465
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
One of the semiconductors

466
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
is called

467
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Transition Metal Dichotronate.

468
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Basically,

469
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
its lattice

470
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
is similar to graphene.

471
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
One of its atoms

472
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
is transition metal,

473
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
which is probably

474
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Mo or tungsten.

475
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The other

476
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
atom site

477
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
is sulfur

478
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
or selenium.

479
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
At this time,

480
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
you will find

481
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that this lattice structure

482
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
does not have

483
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
inversion symmetry.

484
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You can't find a point

485
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
where the inversion symmetry

486
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
returns to its original state.

487
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
This means

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
that it will open a gap.

489
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It turns out that

490
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the basic structure

491
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
of this lattice structure

492
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
looks like this.

493
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It has a gap.

494
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There is no state

495
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
in the middle.

496
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This is a gap.

497
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
However, it still has

498
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
k and negative k-value.

499
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You can still

500
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
use it

501
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
to make valetronics.

502
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
However,

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
you still have a semiconductor.

504
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Because you have a semiconductor,

505
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
you can still

506
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
study electrons.

507
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Sometimes,

508
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
you can study electrons.

509
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Sometimes,

510
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
you can reduce

511
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Fermi energy.

512
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Fermi energy

513
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
is in the middle.

514
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
At the same time,

515
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
electrons and holes

516
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
form acetone.

517
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Acetone is a particle

518
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
where electrons and holes

519
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
form.

520
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
These properties

521
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
lead to

522
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Transition Metal Dichotomy.

523
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Transition Metal Dichotomy

524
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is one of the popular

525
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
research topics.

526
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We hope

527
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to use it

528
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to make valetronics

529
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
or other

530
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
optoelectronics.

531
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Our question is

532
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that we are

533
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
using valetronics

534
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
to make valetronics.

535
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Another interesting thing

536
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
about valetronics is

537
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
that

538
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we mentioned acetone.

539
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Acetone is an electron and a hole.

540
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You can imagine

541
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
that an electron and a hole

542
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
have coolant in them.

543
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
They are heterogeneous.

544
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That's why they are heterogeneous.

545
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
When they are bound together,

546
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
they release their energy.

547
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That's why their energy

548
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is a little bit low.

549
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
How much energy do they release?

550
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It depends on

551
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
how strong

552
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the electric field between them is.

553
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
In the three-dimensional

554
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
semiconductor,

555
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
there is a hole

556
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and an electron.

557
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because of this,

558
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the electric field

559
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
goes through

560
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
many other backgrounds.

561
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
These backgrounds

562
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
cause the electric field to go down.

563
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The coolant interaction

564
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
between them is not very strong.

565
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The binding energy goes down.

566
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
In the two-dimensional material,

567
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you will find that

568
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the electric field

569
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
between them is in the air.

570
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
In the air,

571
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the electric field

572
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
is not screened.

573
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
After the electron and hole

574
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
are bound together,

575
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
a very good

576
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
acetone is formed.

577
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is one of the reasons

578
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
why people want to study acetone.

579
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Acetone is

580
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
similar to

581
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
the concept of

582
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
hydrogen.

583
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You may have

584
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
found acetone

585
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
in Galileo Arsenal.

586
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Basically,

587
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
this is

588
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
basically

589
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
an electron

590
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and a hole.

591
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
They are not bound together.

592
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
They have a continuum.

593
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The continuum is here.

594
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Under this continuum,

595
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
you will have

596
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
the electron and hole's

597
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
bound state.

598
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
They have 1s, 2s, 3s,

599
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
just like the hydrogen atom.

600
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Under this spectrum,

601
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
you will see

602
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the spectrum of 1s, 2s, 3s.

603
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
In the

604
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Transition Metal Dichotomy,

605
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
there is the same thing.

606
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
However,

607
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
the effect is very strong.

608
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
You can see

609
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the energy scale

610
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
in the left picture.

611
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The binding energy

612
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
is about

613
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
3-4 MeV.

614
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In the Transition Metal Dichotomy,

615
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
we can't even see

616
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the continuum.

617
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The reasonable

618
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
prediction is

619
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that the binding energy

620
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
is about 300 MeV.

621
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You can only see

622
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the first state

623
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and the second state.

624
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
The next question is

625
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
that you have these values

626
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and these acetones.

627
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What is the question?

628
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
The question we want to ask is

629
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
whether we can

630
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
break the value degeneracy

631
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We just mentioned

632
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
the value degeneracy.

633
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
We just mentioned the value.

634
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
However, the energy of

635
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
these two values is exactly the same.

636
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So,

637
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
the question is

638
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that if you store

639
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
the information in the value,

640
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but you don't

641
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
touch

642
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the energy of the value,

643
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
the information

644
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
will not change.

645
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The final result is the same information.

646
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This is basically

647
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
meaningless.

648
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What we want to do now is

649
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that if you have a way

650
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
to store the information

651
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
in these values,

652
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
if you use

653
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
some methods

654
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
to change

655
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
the energy of the acetone,

656
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
then

657
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
you can read

658
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the final result.

659
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The final result will be changed.

660
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Depending on

661
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the energy of the value,

662
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the information will change.

663
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
This is called manipulation.

664
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
One of the ways

665
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
is to use the magnetic field.

666
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Using the magnetic field,

667
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
you can pull

668
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
the energy of the value

669
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
on one side up

670
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
and the energy on the other side down.

671
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Then you will see

672
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that the red line

673
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and the blue line

674
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
represent two values.

675
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
When the magnetic field is zero,

676
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the two values are exactly the same.

677
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
When you add a strong magnetic field,

678
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
the energy of the two values

679
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
will be slightly separated.

680
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
At this time,

681
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
you can use

682
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
the magnetic field

683
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
to do valetronics.

684
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Another thing is that

685
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
we want to ask

686
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
whether light

687
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
can do valetronics.

688
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Another thing is that

689
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
in the valetronics,

690
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the acetone has

691
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
very strong valence.

692
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Will the valence

693
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
affect the behavior of the machine?

694
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The reason

695
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
why I ask this question

696
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
is that

697
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
we have found similar things

698
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
in Galen-Arsenal.

699
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
In Galen-Arsenal,

700
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
you will have

701
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
various free electrons

702
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and holes.

703
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It is called plasma.

704
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Then you will have some acetone.

705
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
When the density of acetone

706
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
is high enough,

707
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
biacetone will appear.

708
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Biacetone is

709
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
two acetone bonds

710
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
together.

711
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It is a bit like a hydrogen atom.

712
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
When you have more

713
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
density,

714
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
it will form a droplet atom.

715
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
There are many acetone bonds.

716
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
These

717
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
biacetone

718
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
quasiparticles

719
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
also have

720
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
some applications.

721
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
In Galen-Arsenal's

722
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
quantum darts,

723
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
you can use these biacetones

724
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
to make entangled photons.

725
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You can also

726
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
use optical control

727
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
to change

728
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
the behavior

729
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
of acetone.

730
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Next,

731
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I want to answer

732
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
two questions.

733
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The first question

734
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
is...

735
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Sorry, I have a question.

736
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Can we go back to the last page?

737
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You just said

738
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
that

739
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
if you want to break

740
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
the valley degeneracy,

741
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
let's say

742
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
your sample is

743
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
molybdenum sulfide.

744
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
If you want to break

745
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the degeneracy,

746
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
if I am an alloy

747
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
or some doping,

748
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
will it break the degeneracy?

749
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
If the material is not...

750
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
OK.

751
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
If you want to break

752
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
the valley degeneracy,

753
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
there is a

754
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
symmetry condition.

755
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The symmetry condition

756
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
for the valley degeneracy

757
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
is time-reversal symmetry.

758
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
If your material

759
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
has time-reversal symmetry,

760
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it will have valley degeneracy.

761
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Then,

762
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
time-reversal symmetry

763
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
will break the time-reversal symmetry.

764
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
For doping,

765
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
it is not exactly break.

766
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Doping is not.

767
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Doping is not.

768
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So, apart from the magnetic field,

769
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
do you know any other factors?

770
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Light.

771
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Is that all?

772
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
If so...

773
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I don't think so.

774
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And the current.

775
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
The current is...

776
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
If the current is long,

777
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it will break the time-reversal symmetry.

778
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So, if it has a lot of charge,

779
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the current...

780
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
The current is...

781
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The current is flowing.

782
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So, for example,

783
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
when you are measuring,

784
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
if you apply a bias to it,

785
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it may...

786
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
This will slightly break.

787
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
This is the valley hole effect.

788
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
OK.

789
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Thank you.

790
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
You can continue.

791
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
OK.

792
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The answer to the first question

793
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is yes.

794
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But this thing

795
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
is about optical stock effect.

796
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Now,

797
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
let's look at a very simple model.

798
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You have a...

799
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
a...

800
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
a material.

801
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It has a state.

802
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It has a black state called state A.

803
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It has a red state called state B.

804
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
At this time,

805
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
if you apply a light,

806
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it is non-resonant.

807
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Then we

808
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
control the light's

809
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
frequency

810
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
under the

811
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
AB resonance.

812
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Its energy will be under this.

813
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
At this time,

814
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
state A will produce a

815
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
virtual state under state B.

816
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
state B

817
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
will also produce a virtual state

818
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
above state A.

819
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
If you

820
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
consider these

821
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
dipole interactions,

822
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
if you

823
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
consider the two corresponding states,

824
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
these two states

825
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
will repel each other.

826
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Usually, if you

827
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
write a matrix,

828
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you add...

829
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The matrix's

830
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
cross-section represents two energies.

831
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
The off-diagonal

832
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
represents

833
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
two...

834
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
represents their interactions.

835
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
If you turn on the interactions,

836
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
these two energies will be separated.

837
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The following

838
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
is the same.

839
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
At this time, you will find that the red state

840
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
will move up and the black state will move down.

841
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
When

842
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
you apply light,

843
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the transition

844
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
from black to red

845
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
will increase

846
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
its energy.

847
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It will blue shift.

848
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The quantity

849
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
of

850
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
the

851
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
blue shift

852
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
will

853
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
be determined

854
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
by this formula.

855
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Basically, this formula

856
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
tells you that

857
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
it is equal to

858
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
how strong the light

859
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
is.

860
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It is equal to

861
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
detuning.

862
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Detuning is the energy difference

863
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
between the AB resonance

864
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and the light.

865
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
This is called detuning.

866
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
However,

867
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
there is one thing.

868
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
If you take these things

869
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
into numbers,

870
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
you will find that

871
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
this change is very small.

872
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Therefore,

873
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
it is true that you can use light

874
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
to change the energy of the machine,

875
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
to change the energy of the acetone.

876
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
However,

877
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
because this change is too small,

878
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
you need to adjust the intensity

879
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
very, very strongly.

880
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
The intensity of light is very, very strong.

881
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Therefore, at this time, you need to sell

882
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the laser to do this thing.

883
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Of course,

884
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
someone has done this before.

885
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You can see

886
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
that this paper

887
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
was published in 1986.

888
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
This is

889
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
basically

890
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
demonstrating

891
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
the optical star effect

892
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
on the gallium arsenide.

893
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Basically,

894
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
you take a piece of gallium arsenide

895
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
quantum well.

896
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
The pump is 806 nm.

897
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Its energy is lower

898
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
than

899
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
the energy of acetone.

900
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Then,

901
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
you use another beam of light,

902
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
which is a probe.

903
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Its function is

904
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
to see

905
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
if your spectrum

906
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
is changing

907
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
when the pump is on.

908
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You can see that

909
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
here

910
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
at negative 2 picoseconds,

911
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
negative 2 picoseconds is this line.

912
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Negative 2 picoseconds

913
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
means that

914
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
when you hit the probe,

915
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
your pump hasn't come yet.

916
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Therefore,

917
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
its original spectrum

918
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
is two peaks.

919
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
One is heavy acetone.

920
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
The other is light acetone.

921
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
This is acetone in gallium arsenide.

922
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
When it's 0 picoseconds,

923
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
it means that the pump

924
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and the probe are

925
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
hitting the sample at the same time.

926
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You can see that

927
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
the resonance of acetone

928
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
is getting smaller.

929
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
The resonance of acetone

930
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
is getting smaller.

931
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It means that its energy

932
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
is getting bigger.

933
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
When you turn off

934
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
the pump,

935
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
when the pump

936
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
is at 1.2 picoseconds,

937
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
the resonance

938
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
of acetone

939
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
moves back.

940
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
This is an interesting effect.

941
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
When you hit the pump,

942
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
when you hit the pump,

943
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
the resonance of acetone

944
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
moves slightly.

945
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
When you turn off the pump,

946
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
the resonance of acetone

947
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
moves back.

948
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
What's the situation

949
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
in Transition Metal Dichotomy?

950
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The interesting thing is that

951
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
in Transition Metal Dichotomy,

952
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
the two values

953
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
correspond to

954
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
different helicity.

955
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
We can use

956
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the left and right

957
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
to distinguish the two values.

958
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
What we can do

959
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
is this.

960
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We choose

961
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
the left light.

962
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It only

963
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
couples to K-value.

964
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Of course, we need

965
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
a light which is

966
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
less than the resonance of acetone.

967
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
When there is light,

968
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
the resonance of acetone

969
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
will slightly blue-shift.

970
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
If we send

971
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
a probe

972
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
of the left light,

973
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
we will see

974
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
a blue-shift.

975
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If we send a probe of the right light,

976
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
the resonance of acetone

977
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
will slightly blue-shift.

978
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
By using this method,

979
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
we can break

980
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
the VAD degeneracy.

981
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Let's try

982
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
to see if it's right.

983
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This is our sample.

984
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
We choose

985
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
to use Moebillion Dicillinide

986
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
as our sample.

987
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We have

988
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
encapsulated

989
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Moebillion Dicillinide

990
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
in these two H-BNs.

991
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It's in boron nitride.

992
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
The reason why we do this

993
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
is that

994
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
there is a study

995
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
that says

996
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
in boron nitride,

997
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
the quality

998
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
of Moebillion Dicillinide

999
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
is very good.

1000
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This is the reason

1001
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
why we do this.

1002
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Do we need

1003
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
low temperature

1004
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
in this kind of measurement?

1005
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Or can we use

1006
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
room temperature?

1007
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
You mean

1008
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
in this kind of measurement?

1009
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yes, in room temperature.

1010
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
We can see

1011
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
this kind of phenomenon

1012
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
in room temperature.

1013
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But some of them

1014
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
are invisible.

1015
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Some of the things we want to see

1016
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
are invisible.

1017
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But

1018
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
if it's Moebillion Dicillinide,

1019
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
we can see it

1020
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in room temperature.

1021
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yes.

1022
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I don't know much about this.

1023
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I don't know much about this.

1024
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't know much about this.

1025
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I don't know much about this.

1026
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I don't know much about this.

1027
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
There is an important thing here.

1028
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
The light we emit

1029
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
is always lower than the energy of acetone.

1030
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So

1031
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
the light

1032
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
won't be absorbed

1033
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
by the material.

1034
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It will pass through the material.

1035
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So

1036
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
there will be no phonon.

1037
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
This is a very important

1038
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
question.

1039
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Thank you.

1040
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
This is

1041
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
the reflectivity

1042
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
of this sample.

1043
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Basically,

1044
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the reflectivity is the absorption.

1045
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
This is Moebillion Dicillinide

1046
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
in room temperature.

1047
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
When we

1048
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
lower it to low temperature,

1049
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
the peak

1050
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
becomes narrower.

1051
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The intensity of the peak becomes larger.

1052
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
The width

1053
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
of the peak

1054
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
is about 5 MeV.

1055
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Compared to

1056
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
before,

1057
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
we didn't

1058
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
use boronitride encapsulation

1059
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
or CVD sample.

1060
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
CVD sample

1061
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
has a line width of

1062
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
about 30 MeV.

1063
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
The sample without

1064
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
encapsulation is about 10 MeV.

1065
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
We

1066
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
only have 5 MeV

1067
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
in this sample.

1068
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
This means that the quality of the sample

1069
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
is very good.

1070
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Another interesting thing

1071
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
is that we can see

1072
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
the absorption

1073
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
from 30 MeV

1074
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
to

1075
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
very large.

1076
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We can even make it

1077
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
100% absorption.

1078
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
There are

1079
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
other interesting questions.

1080
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But I won't

1081
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
talk about it today.

1082
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You can discuss it if you are interested.

1083
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I have a question.

1084
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Have you compared

1085
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
CVD sample

1086
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
with

1087
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
exfoliated sample?

1088
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Have you measured the result?

1089
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
The quality?

1090
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yes.

1091
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We have compared.

1092
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Is exfoliated sample better?

1093
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Yes.

1094
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Much better.

1095
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Much better means

1096
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
if we measure

1097
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
absorption or PL,

1098
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the line width of

1099
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
CVD sample is

1100
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
about 5-10 MeV.

1101
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But CVD sample

1102
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
is about 30 MeV.

1103
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Is it because of defects?

1104
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yes.

1105
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The reason is that

1106
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
in CVD sample,

1107
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
there are many

1108
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
inhomogeneous broadening.

1109
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
The source of inhomogeneous broadening

1110
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
is the defects.

1111
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yes.

1112
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Thank you.

1113
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
This is

1114
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
pump probe setup.

1115
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
This is a sample.

1116
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
On the left,

1117
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
there is a laser.

1118
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
We divide it into two parts.

1119
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
One part is called pump.

1120
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Pump

1121
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Because the laser

1122
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
has a wide bandwidth,

1123
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
we use a spectrometer

1124
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
to divide the light.

1125
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We only take

1126
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
about 2 MeV

1127
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and put the pump

1128
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
on the sample.

1129
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The other half of the light is called probe.

1130
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
We run it to a delay stage

1131
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and put it on a

1132
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
sapphire.

1133
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
The function of sapphire

1134
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
is to make the probe light

1135
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
produce nonlinear effect.

1136
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It will become

1137
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
basically

1138
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
the color of the light

1139
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
will change.

1140
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It will become

1141
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
the light of broadband.

1142
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
The light of broadband

1143
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
can be put on the sample

1144
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
and used to study the sample.

1145
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Finally,

1146
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
we put the probe light

1147
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
into a spectrometer

1148
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
to divide the light

1149
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and put it on the detector.

1150
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Basically,

1151
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
on the right,

1152
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
we use a picosecond

1153
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
laser light.

1154
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It has a very sharp

1155
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
light,

1156
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and we put it on the sample.

1157
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
At the same time,

1158
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
we send a probe

1159
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
with many colors.

1160
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
The probe is very short,

1161
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and we put it on the sample

1162
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
to study what we want to study.

1163
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The result is

1164
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
like this.

1165
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
First,

1166
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
look at the middle picture.

1167
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
In the middle picture,

1168
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
the x-axis is the delay,

1169
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
which is the time

1170
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
between the probe and the pump.

1171
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Then,

1172
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
the y-axis is the delay,

1173
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
and the x-axis is the energy,

1174
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
which is the energy

1175
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
of the probe light.

1176
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Then,

1177
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
we see

1178
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
the difference

1179
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
between the pump

1180
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and the non-pump.

1181
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Let me explain

1182
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
the meaning of this picture.

1183
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The first thing is

1184
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
that all the effects

1185
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
occur within

1186
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
negative 1 to 1 picosecond.

1187
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This means that

1188
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
only the pump light

1189
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
has this effect,

1190
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and only the non-pump light

1191
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
has this effect.

1192
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
This means that

1193
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
it is a coherent effect,

1194
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
which is basically

1195
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
what we want to see.

1196
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
If you draw a line

1197
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
within 0 picosecond,

1198
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
you will get this.

1199
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Basically,

1200
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
when the pump and the pump probe

1201
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
are combined,

1202
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
the reflectivity

1203
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
changes.

1204
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
We also have

1205
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the normal reflectivity

1206
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
of the sample.

1207
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
We can measure

1208
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
the reflectivity

1209
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
of the sample

1210
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
when there is no pump.

1211
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Basically,

1212
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
when there is a pump,

1213
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
the reflectivity

1214
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
increases in the red part,

1215
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and the reflectivity

1216
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
decreases in the blue part.

1217
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Basically,

1218
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
it is a shift.

1219
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
In the red part,

1220
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
the reflectivity increases,

1221
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and in the blue part,

1222
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
the reflectivity decreases.

1223
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
This means that

1224
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
the peak is a blue shift.

1225
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
To draw a picture,

1226
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
we use a

1227
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
ready-tuner light,

1228
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
a sigma plus light,

1229
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and we probe

1230
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
the k-value.

1231
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
At this time,

1232
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
the energy of the k-value

1233
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
is blue shifted.

1234
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
This is what the picture

1235
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
tells us.

1236
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
The other thing is

1237
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
that

1238
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
we have done this

1239
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
before.

1240
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
This is our group

1241
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
in Berkeley.

1242
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
There is another group

1243
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
in MIT.

1244
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
They have actually

1245
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
done this before.

1246
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
This measurement

1247
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
shows that

1248
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
when the intensity

1249
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
of the pump

1250
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
is very high,

1251
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
the blue shift

1252
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
is about 3 MeV.

1253
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
This means that

1254
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
this 3 MeV

1255
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
is already...

1256
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We talked about

1257
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
using magnetic field

1258
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
to break the value degeneracy.

1259
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
If you want

1260
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
the energy

1261
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
to change 3 MeV,

1262
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
you need to add 60 Tesla's

1263
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
magnetic field.

1264
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
This is basically impossible.

1265
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
In the world,

1266
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it is impossible

1267
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
to do 60 Tesla's.

1268
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
However,

1269
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
we can

1270
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
find that

1271
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
we can indeed

1272
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
break the value

1273
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
degeneracy

1274
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and make the energy

1275
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
shift very large.

1276
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
However,

1277
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
the previous research

1278
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
showed that

1279
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
the k' value

1280
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
is not a couple.

1281
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Therefore,

1282
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
it has no effect.

1283
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
However,

1284
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
we found that

1285
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
the k' value

1286
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
has some strange effects.

1287
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
The k' value

1288
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
curve

1289
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
is the opposite

1290
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
of the k' value curve.

1291
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
This means that

1292
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
this is a redshift.

1293
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
When we add

1294
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
the k' value,

1295
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
the k' value is redshifted.

1296
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The next thing

1297
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
we want to know

1298
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
is what happened.

1299
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
What happened?

1300
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
OK.

1301
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
In addition to

1302
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
this,

1303
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
we can also

1304
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
do one more thing.

1305
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
We can change the energy

1306
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
of the reflected light.

1307
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Just now,

1308
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
we showed that

1309
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
the detuning value

1310
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
is about 50.

1311
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It is like this.

1312
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The omega x

1313
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
is about 50 Mv.

1314
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We can see a redshift.

1315
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
However,

1316
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
when we increase

1317
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
the photon energy

1318
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
of the pump light,

1319
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the detuning value

1320
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
will decrease.

1321
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
We can see that

1322
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
the peak becomes splitting.

1323
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
If we

1324
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
adjust the photon energy

1325
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
very close to

1326
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
the resonance of acetone,

1327
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
we will find that

1328
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
the curve is completely reversed.

1329
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It is a blueshift.

1330
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
What does this mean?

1331
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
In fact,

1332
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
when you see

1333
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
a blueshift from a redshift,

1334
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
the first thought is

1335
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
is this a new resonance?

1336
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Next,

1337
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
we will ask

1338
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
how to explain

1339
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
this phenomenon.

1340
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Let's go back

1341
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
to the beginning.

1342
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
At the beginning,

1343
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
we said that

1344
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you have a light state

1345
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
k' acetone.

1346
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
When you add

1347
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
a sigma plus light,

1348
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
you will change

1349
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
k' acetone

1350
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
to redshift.

1351
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
k' acetone

1352
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
to blueshift.

1353
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Therefore,

1354
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
when you send

1355
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
a sigma plus light,

1356
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
it will be a blueshift.

1357
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
However,

1358
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
there is a problem.

1359
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Why?

1360
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
In theory,

1361
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
your light state

1362
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
will also be a blueshift.

1363
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This means that

1364
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
your k' acetone

1365
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
will also be a blueshift.

1366
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Why didn't

1367
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
anyone notice this?

1368
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
This is actually

1369
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
a wrong picture.

1370
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
In fact,

1371
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
when we are

1372
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
considering the Arpio Stark effect,

1373
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
in addition to

1374
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
considering the light state

1375
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and the k' acetone,

1376
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
we also need to consider

1377
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
more states.

1378
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
For example,

1379
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
this is a two-acetone state.

1380
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Basically,

1381
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
after you excite an acetone,

1382
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
you can still

1383
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
excite another acetone.

1384
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
If you

1385
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
add a sigma plus light,

1386
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
you will have a k' acetone.

1387
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You will have an acetone in k' value.

1388
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
However, if you add

1389
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
a sigma plus light,

1390
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
you can have two acetones

1391
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
in k' value.

1392
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You can also

1393
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
add a sigma plus light

1394
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and a sigma minus light.

1395
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
You will have an acetone in k' value.

1396
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You will also have an acetone in k' value.

1397
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You can also have

1398
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
an acetone in k' value

1399
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and k' value.

1400
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
These states

1401
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
are actually

1402
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
in your

1403
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
transition.

1404
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They all need to be considered.

1405
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
If you consider

1406
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
this way,

1407
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
you will find that

1408
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
the energy of k' acetone

1409
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
does not change.

1410
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Because you have a ground state

1411
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that affects it.

1412
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
However, you have

1413
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
a two-acetone state

1414
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
that pushes it down.

1415
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It will actually

1416
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
stay at a fixed energy.

1417
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
However, your ground state

1418
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
will move down

1419
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
if you have a two-acetone state.

1420
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
At this time, you will find that

1421
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
if you add a sigma minus light,

1422
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
the degree of downshift

1423
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
is the same.

1424
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Therefore, you will get

1425
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
a sigma that should not change.

1426
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
The next question is that

1427
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
in addition to these states,

1428
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
we know that there is another state

1429
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
called biacetone.

1430
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
As I just explained,

1431
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
biacetone is the interaction

1432
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
between two acetones

1433
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
to generate a bounding energy.

1434
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
This bounding energy

1435
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
will push the energy

1436
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
of the state down.

1437
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
This state will also affect

1438
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
the k' value.

1439
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
We claim that

1440
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
the experimental results we see

1441
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
are from these biacetones.

1442
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
How do we explain this?

1443
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Let's go back to the

1444
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
experimental data.

1445
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We can see that

1446
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
this is the dependence of detuning.

1447
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
From left to right,

1448
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
it is redshift to blueshift.

1449
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
In redshift,

1450
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
the photon energy is very small.

1451
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
The photon energy is relatively small.

1452
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Therefore,

1453
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
the pump

1454
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
will have this effect

1455
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
in addition to this effect.

1456
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
This effect

1457
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
will cause a virtual state

1458
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
above the k' value.

1459
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
This will push

1460
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
the energy of the k' value down.

1461
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
This will cause

1462
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
a redshift

1463
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
in the probe value.

1464
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
When you

1465
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
move the photon energy

1466
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
of the pump

1467
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
very close to the acetone,

1468
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
the virtual state

1469
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
generated by

1470
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
the biacetone

1471
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
will be

1472
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
below the k' value.

1473
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
If it is below the k' value,

1474
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
it will move

1475
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
the acetone state

1476
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
of the k' value

1477
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
up.

1478
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
At this time,

1479
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
we will see a blueshift.

1480
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This is how we explain our data.

1481
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
In the middle,

1482
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
the photon energy

1483
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
matches the transition

1484
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
of the biacetone and acetone.

1485
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
When these two

1486
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
energy matches,

1487
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
the state will split.

1488
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
We can see that

1489
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
this is a split.

1490
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
According to this method,

1491
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
we can determine

1492
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
the difference

1493
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
between the two acetone states

1494
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and the energy

1495
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
of the biacetone state.

1496
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
The energy difference

1497
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
is the binding energy.

1498
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
According to the detuning result,

1499
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
the binding energy

1500
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
of the biacetone state

1501
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
is about 20 MeV.

1502
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
This is similar to

1503
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
the effect of

1504
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
the biacetone

1505
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
on TMDC.

1506
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
These effects

1507
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
are consistent.

1508
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
The last thing we do

1509
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
is to write

1510
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
the theory

1511
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
of effective state.

1512
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
We are experimental scientists,

1513
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
so we can't write the complete theory.

1514
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
However,

1515
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
we try to write

1516
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
the interaction

1517
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
of all these states.

1518
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Basically,

1519
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
we only consider

1520
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
the transition

1521
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
from ground state

1522
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
to k' value.

1523
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
The state related to

1524
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
ground state

1525
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
will change

1526
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
the k' value

1527
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and the ground state.

1528
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
This is a 2x2 prediction.

1529
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
The state related to

1530
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
k' value

1531
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
is related to

1532
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
free acetone

1533
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and

1534
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
biacetone state.

1535
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
This is a

1536
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
3x3 prediction.

1537
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
If you solve this 3x3 prediction,

1538
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
you will get

1539
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
this prediction.

1540
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
The picture on the left

1541
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
is our experiment.

1542
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
As you can see,

1543
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the experiment is very consistent with the theory.

1544
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I want to emphasize

1545
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
that this is an effective theory.

1546
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Many things are fitting.

1547
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
If there is a theory,

1548
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I hope

1549
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
this theory

1550
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
can help us

1551
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
figure out

1552
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
how these parameters

1553
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
come from.

1554
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
This may involve

1555
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
many-body theory.

1556
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
This is the conclusion.

1557
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Today, I talked about

1558
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
the history of super-fast light theory

1559
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
and the technique of

1560
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
pump-off.

1561
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I also showed you

1562
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
the effect of acetone

1563
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
in the two-dimensional

1564
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
semiconductor.

1565
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
The value of

1566
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
valetronics

1567
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
is the

1568
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
value of

1569
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
valetronics.

1570
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
In the end,

1571
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
we demonstrated

1572
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that we can use light

1573
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
to adjust

1574
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
the value of valetronics.

1575
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
We can also use

1576
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
our sample

1577
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
to observe

1578
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
the effect of

1579
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
valetronics.

1580
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
What's left is

1581
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
what we didn't talk about today.

1582
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm currently

1583
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
doing research on

1584
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
ultrafast optics.

1585
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'm still

1586
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
studying

1587
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
2D material.

1588
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I'm doing

1589
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
photon-echo spectroscopy.

1590
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Another interesting thing

1591
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
is the

1592
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
optical star effect.

1593
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
It's a photon-dressed

1594
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
acetone,

1595
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
but it's very weakly dressed.

1596
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
There are other ways

1597
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
to

1598
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
place the

1599
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
semiconductor

1600
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
in a optical chamber.

1601
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
If you make the chamber

1602
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
very small,

1603
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
you can strongly

1604
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
couple the photon

1605
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
with the acetone.

1606
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
This is called acetone-polaroton.

1607
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
This is my

1608
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
recent research in Michigan.

1609
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I hope you can see

1610
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
the effect of acetone-polaroton.

1611
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
We also

1612
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
did some applications.

1613
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
One of the

1614
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
concepts is that we can use

1615
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
graphene.

1616
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Basically,

1617
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
if you add voltage to graphene,

1618
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
the absorption of graphene

1619
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
will change.

1620
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
We can use this method

1621
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
to make optical sensors.

1622
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
One of the things we've been

1623
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
doing recently is

1624
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
placing neuron cells

1625
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
on graphene.

1626
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Neuron cells

1627
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
emit electrical signals.

1628
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Is it using love to emit electricity?

1629
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
What?

1630
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
What does it mean?

1631
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Is it using love to emit electricity?

1632
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's right.

1633
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
In our experiment,

1634
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
we used

1635
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
the heart of a chicken.

1636
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But the heart of a chicken

1637
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
doesn't look good on the picture.

1638
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Basically,

1639
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
we just

1640
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
put some

1641
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
electrical signals

1642
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
on it.

1643
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Basically, you need to study

1644
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
your heart cells or neurons.

1645
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Neurons

1646
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
use electricity

1647
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
to send signals.

1648
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
When these

1649
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
electrical signals

1650
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
send signals,

1651
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
they also change

1652
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
the absorption of

1653
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
graphene.

1654
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
If we turn on the light,

1655
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
we can see

1656
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
if the neuron

1657
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
is emitting electricity.

1658
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Using this method,

1659
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
we can detect

1660
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
the signal

1661
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
of the brain cells.

1662
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
This is

1663
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
an application

1664
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
for biophysics.

1665
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
These are

1666
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
my main collaborators.

1667
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
In Ann Arbor,

1668
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Hui Deng is

1669
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
my boss.

1670
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
In UC Berkeley,

1671
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Wang Feng.

1672
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
We worked together

1673
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
to create

1674
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
the Artifical Star Effect.

1675
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Thank you.

1676
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Thank you,

1677
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Joseph.

1678
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Do you have any questions?

1679
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yes.

1680
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I just asked some questions.

1681
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Wang,

1682
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
do you have any questions?

1683
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I have a question.

1684
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
You can

1685
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
go back to

1686
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
the previous slide

1687
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
with sigma plus

1688
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
and sigma minus

1689
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
of the pump probe.

1690
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
On resonance,

1691
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
you can see the X-split.

1692
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
In the middle graph,

1693
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
the two states

1694
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
of the split-up

1695
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
have a parity difference.

1696
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
In theory,

1697
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
in this quantum

1698
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
optically split state,

1699
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
the parity difference

1700
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
should be different

1701
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
by the selection rule.

1702
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
These two states

1703
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
should not...

1704
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
We wrote

1705
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
effective theory,

1706
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
but

1707
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
according to

1708
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
effective theory,

1709
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
there should be

1710
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
no change.

1711
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
The reason is

1712
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
basically

1713
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
this is

1714
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
sigma plus

1715
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
from here to here.

1716
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
But

1717
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
when you

1718
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
add up the

1719
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
up-do-step effect,

1720
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
the remaining

1721
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
is still sigma plus.

1722
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So basically

1723
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
these two states

1724
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
should not change

1725
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
for this state.

1726
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
This is my understanding.

1727
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
But of course,

1728
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
in reality,

1729
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
we didn't do this experiment.

1730
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
If you probe

1731
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
with sigma plus,

1732
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
you will...

1733
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
This experiment is not easy.

1734
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It's not easy

1735
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
because if you send

1736
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
a probe with sigma plus,

1737
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
the most important effect

1738
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
will be from ground state to k-value.

1739
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
This is just

1740
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
a very small change.

1741
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So of course,

1742
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
it's possible to do this experiment,

1743
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
but

1744
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I'm not sure

1745
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
if I can see the significant effect.

1746
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Thank you.

1747
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Because today's time

1748
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
is a little over.

1749
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So we'll stop here today.

1750
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'll

1751
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
pause the recording for now.

1752
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Thank you, Jason.
