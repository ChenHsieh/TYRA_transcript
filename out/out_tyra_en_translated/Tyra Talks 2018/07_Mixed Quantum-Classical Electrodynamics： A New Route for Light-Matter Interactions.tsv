0	10000	Yes, Project Terra is an international platform for sharing information.
10000	16000	We hope that scholars from all over the world can share with us
16000	20000	the results of our current research and development,
20000	24000	and more importantly, what is the trend of development.
24000	30000	This is not something you can easily find in Taiwan.
30000	36000	Project Terra can also provide people who are doing research
36000	38000	with opportunities to exchange and collaborate.
38000	42000	So we hold a seminar like this every week.
42000	46000	The speakers are basically all members,
46000	51000	and they will share their new ideas and research trends.
51000	57000	Project Terra is a self-releasing organization
57000	60000	that is dedicated to public service.
60000	66000	We have no intention of making any profit.
66000	72000	All of our members are very enthusiastic doctoral students and post-doctoral students.
72000	79000	You can see our website.
79000	83000	If you are interested in Project Terra,
83000	89000	you can take a look at our website.
89000	93000	If you are interested in Project Terra,
93000	98000	and would like to keep in touch with us,
98000	108000	you can join our membership.
108000	112000	If you can find other people to work with,
112000	119000	we will be happy to help you.
119000	124000	If you have any questions,
124000	127000	you can ask us directly.
127000	131000	We are usually very free to talk.
131000	134000	Sure, no problem.
134000	137000	I would like to remind you that
137000	140000	when we have more and more listeners,
140000	143000	we will set the volume to silent.
143000	147000	So if you remember to click on the microphone icon
147000	149000	before speaking,
149000	152000	you can ask questions or
152000	155000	if you have any questions,
155000	159000	you can directly talk to the speaker, Beta.
159000	164000	Okay, Beta, let's get started.
189000	203000	For some reason, I can't share the screen.
203000	206000	Let me re-join.
233000	243000	Okay, thank you, Ted.
243000	246000	My name is Chengxinda.
246000	248000	My Chinese name is Ergongcheng.
248000	250000	My surname is Daoda.
250000	255000	Today, I would like to thank Ted and Terra
255000	257000	for giving me the opportunity to introduce
257000	260000	a method we are developing.
260000	262000	This is a new method.
262000	265000	The main purpose of this method is to deal with
265000	267000	the interaction between light and matter.
267000	269000	We hope to provide a new way
269000	272000	to do this.
272000	275000	The method we propose is called
275000	278000	Mixed Quantum Classical Electrodynamics.
278000	280000	In English, it should be called
280000	284000	Quantum-Fixed Mixed Electrodynamics.
284000	287000	I will introduce to you in detail
287000	290000	what kind of method it is.
291000	295000	Okay, let me introduce myself.
295000	297000	My name is Chengxinda.
297000	301000	My background is that when I was in Taiwan,
301000	305000	I was studying math and physics in college.
305000	307000	I majored in math and physics.
307000	309000	Later, for some reason,
309000	311000	when I applied to go to college,
311000	313000	I saw that there was a program called
313000	314000	Chemical Physics in Columbia.
314000	319000	I thought it was very similar to what I was doing.
319000	321000	It was also something I was interested in.
321000	323000	So I applied to this program.
323000	325000	I was very lucky to apply to this program.
325000	326000	I found out that when I came to the United States,
326000	328000	I became a chemical physicist.
328000	331000	I have been used as a chemical physicist from beginning to end.
331000	333000	Because of this reason,
333000	336000	I am now working as a chemical physicist
336000	339000	at Penn University.
339000	342000	To sum up,
342000	345000	I use the theory of physics
345000	348000	and the computational method developed in physics
348000	351000	to study the problem of chemistry.
351000	353000	My professional field is
353000	356000	studying dynamics,
356000	358000	which is the theory of dynamics
358000	360000	and the computational method of dynamics.
360000	363000	Specifically,
363000	365000	my Ph.D. is in Columbia.
365000	367000	I am doing chemical dynamics,
367000	369000	that is,
369000	373000	electromagnetic dynamics in a chemical environment.
373000	374000	My postdoc,
374000	376000	what I am doing now
376000	378000	is a little different from my Ph.D.
378000	381000	I am doing the interaction of light and matter.
381000	382000	Today,
382000	384000	my talk will focus on
384000	387000	my postdoc work.
387000	389000	OK.
389000	390000	First of all, what is light?
390000	392000	We often say that light is an object.
392000	394000	Basically,
394000	398000	light is a very important thing in everyday life.
398000	400000	Light is basically an electromagnetic wave.
400000	402000	Electromagnetic waves
402000	405000	are basically the source of all our information.
405000	407000	We see things in this world.
407000	409000	From the greatest extent,
409000	411000	how do we know
411000	413000	what happens on other planets
413000	415000	or on Mars, for example?
415000	417000	We can
417000	420000	reflect the light of the sun from Mars
420000	423000	and see from the spectrum of sunlight
423000	426000	what kind of matter there is on Mars.
426000	429000	How much of this matter is there?
429000	431000	Then,
431000	433000	there are more possibilities
433000	436000	in the development of modern science.
436000	438000	These are no longer visible light.
438000	441000	We have different kinds of light
441000	445000	from low energy to high energy.
445000	447000	Then, from the low energy range,
447000	449000	we have NMR
449000	452000	to Raman
452000	454000	or IR spectrum.
454000	455000	These things are
455000	458000	lower than visible light.
458000	461000	Within the range of higher than visible light,
461000	463000	there is UV,
463000	465000	which is ultraviolet,
465000	467000	and
467000	469000	X-ray spectroscopy, which is more powerful.
469000	471000	Basically, our feature is that
471000	473000	basically,
473000	475000	this
475000	477000	spectroscopy
477000	479000	shows that
479000	481000	the stronger the energy,
481000	483000	the deeper we can see.
483000	486000	Just like in the form of X-ray,
486000	488000	we can see that it can
488000	490000	reflect the electrons in the inner layer.
490000	493000	So you can know what the behavior of the electrons in the inner layer is.
493000	495000	This is one of the functions
495000	497000	of light and matter interaction.
500000	501000	In recent years,
501000	504000	because of the development of nanotechnology,
504000	506000	we can make our devices
506000	508000	in a smaller scale.
508000	511000	So we can even use light,
511000	513000	the quality of light,
513000	515000	to manipulate matter,
515000	517000	to change the nature of matter.
517000	519000	For example,
519000	521000	we can put
521000	523000	a chemical reaction
523000	525000	in a cavity,
525000	527000	and the nature of the chemical reaction
527000	529000	may be changed.
529000	531000	Or we can put this chemical reaction
531000	533000	on a crystal.
533000	535000	This chemical reaction may have
535000	537000	different behavior.
537000	539000	There are other
539000	541000	different nanostructures,
541000	543000	nanostructures,
543000	545000	which can have different
545000	547000	effects on light-matter interaction
547000	549000	and change the nature of matter.
549000	551000	Another very important example
551000	553000	is that in recent years,
553000	555000	there is a very popular
555000	557000	study
557000	559000	on how we use
559000	561000	light-matter interaction
561000	563000	to change,
563000	565000	for example,
565000	567000	this paper
567000	569000	is a paper
569000	571000	about
571000	573000	the conductivity
573000	575000	of organic semiconductors.
575000	577000	They put a very thin
577000	579000	membrane structure,
579000	581000	and there is a circle
581000	583000	above it,
583000	585000	and attach it
585000	587000	to the organic semiconductor.
587000	589000	It can change
589000	591000	the conductivity of the semiconductor.
591000	593000	It can change it
593000	595000	from a bad conductor
595000	597000	to a better conductor.
597000	599000	But these
599000	601000	modern developments
601000	603000	all use the nature of light-matter.
603000	605000	When we need
605000	607000	to understand the nature of light-matter,
607000	609000	we need to discuss
609000	611000	what is light
611000	613000	and what is the difference
613000	615000	between classical light and light-matter.
615000	617000	The classical light
617000	619000	is in the left panel.
619000	621000	We regard classical light as an electromagnetic wave,
621000	623000	and the development
623000	625000	of the electromagnetic wave
625000	627000	is based on
627000	629000	the Maxwell's equation,
629000	631000	which is
631000	633000	the Maxwell's equation.
633000	635000	This is a Maxwell's equation
635000	637000	without a source.
637000	639000	This is a
639000	641000	propagate,
641000	643000	a electromagnetic wave moving forward
643000	645000	without any source.
645000	647000	This is the classical view
647000	649000	of light.
649000	651000	In quantum mechanics,
651000	653000	we regard light as a group
653000	655000	of energy.
655000	657000	Its energy
657000	659000	is discretized.
659000	661000	You may have heard of
661000	663000	the Uncertainty Principle,
663000	665000	which is
665000	667000	the Uncertainty Principle.
667000	669000	The Uncertainty Principle
669000	671000	in light
671000	673000	corresponds to
673000	675000	the distribution of energy.
675000	677000	The energy may not be
677000	679000	only one energy,
679000	681000	but a distribution of probability.
681000	683000	How does quantum mechanics
683000	685000	evolve light?
685000	687000	It is based on the Heisenberg equation.
687000	689000	It is based on the Heisenberg equation.
689000	691000	The H is an operator
691000	693000	in quantum mechanics.
693000	695000	The H is an operator
695000	697000	in quantum mechanics.
697000	699000	The H is an operator.
699000	701000	H represents the energy.
701000	703000	This basically
703000	705000	describes how light
705000	707000	evolves
707000	709000	in a space.
711000	713000	What is the difference
713000	715000	between classical
715000	717000	and quantum mechanics?
717000	719000	Let's look at
719000	721000	the matter.
721000	723000	We can see
723000	725000	the difference between
725000	727000	classical and quantum.
727000	729000	Classical matter
729000	731000	is a particle
731000	733000	or many particles.
733000	735000	Many particles
735000	737000	follow
737000	739000	Newton's law
739000	741000	in quantum mechanics.
741000	743000	We all know
743000	745000	classical mechanics.
745000	747000	A particle has a certain speed
747000	749000	and this speed changes over time.
749000	751000	In quantum mechanics,
751000	753000	the energy
753000	755000	is considered
755000	757000	continuous.
757000	759000	the energy
759000	761000	is considered continuous.
763000	765000	In quantum mechanics,
765000	767000	the energy
767000	769000	doesn't
769000	771000	use proofs
771000	773000	to describe matter,
773000	775000	instead we use function
775000	777000	named wave function.
779000	781000	In uncertainty principle
781000	783000	it is a
783000	785000	distribution
785000	787000	frame of reference
787000	789000	for environment
789000	791000	and momentum.
791000	793000	Uncertainty principle
793000	795000	is not a satisfied
795000	797000	you can
797000	799000	you can
799000	801000	you can write down its
801000	803000	spatial distribution and
803000	805000	momentum distribution
805000	807000	of a wave function.
807000	809000	This wave function
809000	811000	follows the following thing called
811000	813000	Schrodinger equation
813000	815000	Schrodinger equation
815000	817000	is written like this.
817000	819000	Since we
819000	821000	now know these
821000	823000	physical
823000	825000	classical and quantum
825000	827000	and quantum of light.
827000	829000	When we want to describe
829000	831000	the reaction of modern light
831000	833000	and the interaction of light and matter
833000	835000	our ideal state
835000	837000	is to use quantum light
837000	839000	and quantum matter.
839000	841000	When I have quantum light and quantum matter
841000	843000	together
843000	845000	we can
845000	847000	this is a set of
847000	849000	quantum electric mechanics
849000	851000	called QED.
851000	853000	In this QED
853000	855000	we can
855000	857000	put the whole
857000	859000	matter and light
859000	861000	in the same wave function
861000	863000	they will have a combined
863000	865000	Hamiltonian
865000	867000	and they can
867000	869000	evolve together.
869000	871000	This can include
871000	873000	all interactions
873000	875000	in quantum mechanics.
875000	877000	But this is a very large
877000	879000	calculation.
879000	881000	It is very difficult
881000	883000	to do a real calculation
883000	885000	except for some basic
885000	887000	model problems.
887000	889000	One of the reasons is
889000	891000	this total wave function
891000	893000	contains a lot of
893000	895000	degrees of freedom
895000	897000	a lot of variables.
897000	899000	This thing
899000	901000	may be in a real situation
901000	903000	for example
903000	905000	I take a real nanoparticle
905000	907000	or a real
907000	909000	particle structure
909000	911000	this thing
911000	913000	can't be done.
913000	915000	So we have
915000	917000	a compromise
917000	919000	approach.
919000	921000	We develop a set
921000	923000	called Mixed Quantum Classical
923000	925000	which is a combination of
925000	927000	classical quantum mechanics.
927000	929000	In this we
929000	931000	put light as classical
931000	933000	as classical
933000	935000	and matter as matter.
935000	937000	Therefore
937000	939000	we don't need to
939000	941000	evolve the light
941000	943000	we just need to know
943000	945000	what is the
945000	947000	behavior of matter.
947000	949000	We put light's behavior
949000	951000	as a time-dependent perturbation
951000	953000	as a
953000	955000	driving force
955000	957000	as if
957000	959000	something is pushing
959000	961000	matter
961000	963000	into evolution.
963000	965000	This is a more
965000	967000	practical approach.
967000	969000	But it has some problems.
969000	971000	As I said
971000	973000	it is OK for some problems.
973000	975000	This is not
975000	977000	our first approach.
977000	979000	Many people have done this.
979000	981000	But it has some problems.
981000	983000	The first problem is
983000	985000	it doesn't have feedback.
985000	987000	Feedback means
987000	989000	we treat the light
989000	991000	as bending
991000	993000	The system
993000	995000	doesn't throw
995000	997000	any energy
997000	999000	or feedback
999000	1001000	into the light.
1001000	1003000	So
1003000	1005000	if you
1005000	1007000	take the whole system
1007000	1009000	and put light and matter
1009000	1011000	together
1011000	1013000	you will find that
1013000	1015000	this theory doesn't
1015000	1017000	conform to energy conservation.
1017000	1019000	The second problem is
1019000	1021000	it has uncertainty principle.
1021000	1023000	In other words
1023000	1025000	I should have
1025000	1027000	a standard difference
1027000	1029000	between light and matter.
1029000	1031000	In other words
1031000	1033000	I don't have
1033000	1035000	only one point
1035000	1037000	so I should have
1037000	1039000	a wide distribution.
1039000	1041000	But we have
1041000	1043000	classical light
1043000	1045000	so there is no
1045000	1047000	fluctuation.
1047000	1049000	Another problem
1049000	1051000	is time dependent perturbation.
1051000	1053000	It is a linear response.
1053000	1055000	It is a linear response.
1055000	1057000	It is a linear response.
1057000	1059000	It is a linear response.
1059000	1061000	Basically
1061000	1063000	it is a linear response.
1063000	1065000	The light pushes
1065000	1067000	the light
1067000	1069000	and it responds.
1069000	1071000	But this
1071000	1073000	is a strong coupling.
1073000	1075000	If the light is very strong
1075000	1077000	and it can change
1077000	1079000	the quality of light
1079000	1081000	this theory
1081000	1083000	cannot be explained.
1083000	1085000	cannot be explained.
1085000	1087000	The most serious problem
1087000	1089000	is that it cannot
1089000	1091000	capture a
1091000	1093000	important physical quality
1093000	1095000	called spontaneous emission.
1095000	1097000	called spontaneous emission.
1097000	1099000	I will explain it later.
1099000	1101000	These problems
1101000	1103000	make
1103000	1105000	classical method
1105000	1107000	cannot explain
1107000	1109000	quantum mechanics.
1109000	1111000	quantum mechanics.
1111000	1113000	quantum mechanics.
1113000	1115000	quantum mechanics.
1115000	1117000	My work
1117000	1119000	is to develop
1119000	1121000	a new
1121000	1123000	mixed quantum classical
1123000	1125000	a new
1125000	1127000	mixed quantum classical
1127000	1129000	a new
1129000	1131000	a new
1131000	1133000	we can
1133000	1135000	recover
1135000	1137000	we can reconstruct
1137000	1139000	spontaneous emission
1139000	1141000	we can
1141000	1143000	enforce
1145000	1147000	influence energy conservation
1147000	1149000	we can
1151000	1153000	we can build habitual light
1153000	1155000	we can build habitual light
1155000	1157000	we can build habitual light
1157000	1159000	how can we do it?
1159000	1161000	sorry, I have a question
1161000	1163000	ok, go ahead
1163000	1165000	I want to ask
1165000	1167000	because
1167000	1169000	using quantum mechanics is a bit difficult
1169000	1171000	can't do
1171000	1173000	analytical solution
1173000	1175000	to what extent
1175000	1177000	for example, molecular
1177000	1179000	or elemental
1179000	1181000	single element
1181000	1183000	or many body
1183000	1185000	yes, usually
1185000	1187000	many body
1187000	1189000	because many body
1189000	1191000	its scale is exponential n
1191000	1193000	so
1193000	1195000	if you add
1195000	1197000	exponential n
1197000	1199000	your computer can't run
1199000	1201000	so
1201000	1203000	what we can do
1203000	1205000	is
1205000	1207000	take some degree of freedom
1207000	1209000	as classical
1209000	1211000	there are many good classical methods
1211000	1213000	to propagate Maxwell's equation
1213000	1215000	but
1215000	1217000	for example, single molecule
1217000	1219000	can be calculated?
1219000	1221000	yes, single molecule can be calculated
1221000	1223000	as a
1223000	1225000	as a
1225000	1227000	chemist
1227000	1229000	I want to do something practical
1229000	1231000	I see
1231000	1233000	because I do high energy
1233000	1235000	I don't know
1235000	1237000	I only do one by one
1237000	1239000	two or three more
1239000	1241000	seems difficult
1241000	1243000	what we want to do
1243000	1245000	for example,
1245000	1247000	put a molecule
1247000	1249000	into a cavity
1249000	1251000	I see
1251000	1253000	ok, thank you
1253000	1255000	I want to ask
1255000	1257000	is this LR
1257000	1259000	same as
1259000	1261000	Lindblad equation operator?
1261000	1263000	thank you
1263000	1265000	open system
1265000	1267000	which one?
1267000	1269000	it's very similar
1269000	1271000	I won't write it down
1271000	1273000	but
1273000	1275000	it's very similar to
1275000	1277000	Lindblad
1277000	1279000	but it can't be written as
1279000	1281000	Lindblad form
1281000	1283000	because it's a non-linear term
1283000	1285000	it's not like Lindblad
1285000	1287000	it's a linear term
1287000	1289000	it's a time-dependent
1289000	1291000	and skewed Lindblad
1291000	1293000	ok
1293000	1295000	keep talking
1295000	1297000	I'm looking forward to it
1297000	1299000	I'll talk about it later
1299000	1301000	ok
1301000	1303000	basically
1303000	1305000	what we want to do
1305000	1307000	because we have a friend who does high energy
1307000	1309000	we have
1309000	1311000	low energy
1311000	1313000	chemical system
1313000	1315000	so we don't consider
1315000	1317000	relative effect
1317000	1319000	ok
1319000	1321000	next
1321000	1323000	let's talk about
1323000	1325000	what is spontaneous emission
1325000	1327000	what is spontaneous emission
1327000	1329000	the quantum theory of spontaneous emission
1329000	1331000	was written by Dirac in 1927
1331000	1333000	Dirac
1333000	1335000	of course
1335000	1337000	Einstein explained it
1337000	1339000	before Dirac
1339000	1341000	but the paper in 1927
1341000	1343000	he used
1343000	1345000	the first principle
1345000	1347000	to introduce
1347000	1349000	spontaneous emission
1349000	1351000	so
1351000	1353000	I see it as
1353000	1355000	a major contribution
1355000	1357000	what is spontaneous emission
1357000	1359000	it's basically
1359000	1361000	a transition
1361000	1363000	from a stimulated state
1363000	1365000	to an excited state
1365000	1367000	simply put
1367000	1369000	I have an electron
1369000	1371000	it's in a stimulated state
1371000	1373000	it's in an excited state
1373000	1375000	it emits the same light
1375000	1377000	it's called spontaneous emission
1377000	1379000	the most important thing about it
1379000	1381000	it's in vacuum
1381000	1383000	a quantum system
1383000	1385000	a two-level system
1385000	1387000	a stimulated state and an excited state
1387000	1389000	in vacuum
1389000	1391000	it still emits
1391000	1393000	this thing
1393000	1395000	because
1395000	1397000	in quantum theory
1397000	1399000	we use
1399000	1401000	zero-point energy
1401000	1403000	it's the
1403000	1405000	light in vacuum
1405000	1407000	the lowest energy
1407000	1409000	some theories
1409000	1411000	it's called vacuum fluctuation
1411000	1413000	although it's vacuum
1413000	1415000	it still
1415000	1417000	interacts with
1417000	1419000	the quantum system
1419000	1421000	to emit spontaneous emission
1423000	1425000	why is spontaneous emission
1425000	1427000	so important
1427000	1429000	because fundamentally
1429000	1431000	it's a quantum process
1431000	1433000	in classical theory
1433000	1435000	it's impossible
1435000	1437000	to get spontaneous emission
1437000	1439000	second
1439000	1441000	it's basically
1441000	1443000	spontaneous emission
1443000	1445000	responsible for
1445000	1447000	almost all light
1447000	1449000	we can see
1449000	1451000	it's because of spontaneous emission
1451000	1453000	zero light, flat light
1453000	1455000	visible light
1455000	1457000	it's because of
1457000	1459000	spontaneous emission
1459000	1461000	next
1461000	1463000	it's a
1463000	1465000	quantum electrodynamics
1465000	1467000	after Dirac
1467000	1469000	in 1927
1469000	1471000	after paper
1471000	1473000	a lot of people
1473000	1475000	like Pauli, Wigner
1475000	1477000	Eisenberg, Fermi
1477000	1479000	Freeman Dyson
1479000	1481000	and Feynman
1481000	1483000	started to do
1483000	1485000	QED research
1487000	1489000	what we want to say
1489000	1491000	if we take
1491000	1493000	mixed quantum classical equation
1493000	1495000	to deal with
1495000	1497000	spontaneous emission
1497000	1499000	what will happen
1499000	1501000	here
1501000	1503000	I want to explain
1503000	1505000	what is
1505000	1507000	mixed quantum classical
1507000	1509000	first
1509000	1511000	we see
1511000	1513000	you can see my mouse
1513000	1515000	oh yes
1515000	1517000	can you see my mouse
1517000	1519000	yes
1519000	1521000	ok
1521000	1523000	it's a little bit lag
1523000	1525000	if you want to stop
1525000	1527000	slow down
1527000	1529000	ok, no problem
1529000	1531000	I will stop here
1531000	1533000	ok, first question
1533000	1535000	we assume a system
1535000	1537000	a two-level system
1537000	1539000	in vacuum
1539000	1541000	this system
1541000	1543000	is completely in
1543000	1545000	spontaneous emission
1545000	1547000	no distribution
1547000	1549000	in
1549000	1551000	mixed quantum classical
1551000	1553000	there is no spontaneous emission
1553000	1555000	which is
1555000	1557000	this line
1557000	1559000	this picture
1559000	1561000	horizontal is time
1561000	1563000	vertical is
1563000	1565000	stimulated
1565000	1567000	stimulated
1567000	1569000	population
1569000	1571000	that
1571000	1573000	red line
1573000	1575000	means no matter
1575000	1577000	how long
1577000	1579000	this system
1579000	1581000	will not emit any light
1581000	1583000	first of all
1583000	1585000	this is wrong
1585000	1587000	qualitatively
1587000	1589000	but we found
1589000	1591000	if
1591000	1593000	I am
1593000	1595000	not in
1595000	1597000	spontaneous emission
1597000	1599000	I have half
1599000	1601000	0.5, 0.5
1601000	1603000	I have half
1603000	1605000	half in
1605000	1607000	I found
1607000	1609000	there is a little bit
1609000	1611000	spontaneous emission
1611000	1613000	real spontaneous emission
1613000	1615000	this black line
1615000	1617000	compared
1617000	1619000	there is a gap
1619000	1621000	another
1621000	1623000	this is
1623000	1625000	we tried
1625000	1627000	a method
1627000	1629000	we tried other methods
1629000	1631000	three methods
1631000	1633000	mixed quantum classical
1633000	1635000	called
1635000	1637000	SQC
1637000	1639000	or
1639000	1641000	CPA
1641000	1643000	mixed quantum classical
1643000	1645000	there is a problem
1645000	1647000	the right picture
1647000	1649000	the middle curve
1649000	1651000	the middle curve
1651000	1653000	real spontaneous emission rate
1653000	1655000	red
1655000	1657000	this is
1657000	1659000	the left picture
1659000	1661000	from there
1661000	1663000	emission rate
1663000	1665000	compare with
1665000	1667000	real spontaneous emission
1667000	1669000	rate
1669000	1671000	sometimes
1671000	1673000	almost all
1673000	1675000	ground state
1675000	1677000	very close
1677000	1679000	very close
1679000	1681000	real spontaneous emission rate
1681000	1683000	but
1683000	1685000	getting worse
1685000	1687000	more and more population
1687000	1689000	in
1689000	1691000	spontaneous emission
1691000	1693000	more and more
1693000	1695000	other methods
1695000	1697000	opposite
1697000	1699000	opposite
1699000	1701000	behavior
1701000	1703000	this is the second problem
1703000	1705000	the last problem
1705000	1707000	basically
1707000	1709000	old problem
1709000	1711000	our factory
1711000	1713000	classical factory
1713000	1715000	no fluctuation
1715000	1717000	anything about
1717000	1719000	fluctuation
1719000	1721000	must be wrong
1721000	1723000	next
1723000	1725000	the method
1725000	1727000	plus R
1727000	1729000	we call
1729000	1731000	the average length
1731000	1733000	we use
1733000	1735000	because it is the simplest
1735000	1737000	average length
1737000	1739000	in the average length
1739000	1741000	plus
1741000	1743000	LR
1743000	1745000	LIMBRA
1745000	1747000	what is the plus R
1747000	1749000	it has 3 functions
1749000	1751000	first
1751000	1753000	I put
1753000	1755000	extra relaxation
1755000	1757000	I put some population
1757000	1759000	from the top
1759000	1761000	to the ground state
1761000	1763000	this additional population
1763000	1765000	we use
1765000	1767000	according to
1767000	1769000	to deduce
1769000	1771000	in every time state
1771000	1773000	how much
1773000	1775000	how much relaxation
1775000	1777000	let it
1777000	1779000	with
1779000	1781000	spontaneous emission rate
1781000	1783000	same
1783000	1785000	this is the first thing
1785000	1787000	second
1787000	1789000	because we
1789000	1791000	took some
1791000	1793000	population
1793000	1795000	from the ground state
1795000	1797000	to the ground state
1797000	1799000	where is the energy
1799000	1801000	should be put
1803000	1805000	to the power plant
1805000	1807000	it should be
1807000	1809000	it should be
1809000	1811000	classical
1811000	1813000	it should be
1813000	1815000	part of the power plant
1815000	1817000	or plant
1817000	1819000	to
1819000	1821000	to ensure
1821000	1823000	the whole system
1823000	1825000	energy conservation
1825000	1827000	so we designed a way
1827000	1829000	the energy
1829000	1831000	can be put to the power plant
1831000	1833000	and
1833000	1835000	we designed
1835000	1837000	stochastic
1837000	1839000	defacing
1839000	1841000	I put
1841000	1843000	I put this system
1843000	1845000	there is a random process
1845000	1847000	it will
1847000	1849000	decide
1849000	1851000	the system phase
1851000	1853000	in every time
1853000	1855000	there is a random process
1855000	1857000	it will decide
1857000	1859000	the system phase
1859000	1861000	this small
1861000	1863000	stochastic defacing
1863000	1865000	introduce
1865000	1867000	classical
1867000	1869000	power plant
1869000	1871000	fluctuation
1871000	1873000	I am not running a single trajectory
1873000	1875000	I am running many trajectories
1875000	1877000	to balance the trajectory
1877000	1879000	so
1879000	1881000	we will have
1881000	1883000	the power plant
1883000	1885000	there will be fluctuation
1885000	1887000	there will be
1887000	1889000	so
1889000	1891000	we can tell

2702840	2704840	What is
2704840	2706840	What is
2707840	2711840	Okay, so let me recap it again
2711840	2715840	What did we learn from Raman Scannering?
2715840	2717840	What we learned is that
2717840	2719840	Raman Fast++R can actually
2719840	2721840	allow us to get
2721840	2723840	multi-state transitions
2723840	2725840	We can do multi-state transitions
2725840	2727840	We just need to put the correct
2727840	2729840	spontaneous emission in
2729840	2731840	We can get multi-state transitions
2731840	2733840	And it's still pretty accurate
2733840	2735840	And
2735840	2737840	Even if we don't have
2737840	2739840	a classical frequency
2739840	2741840	We don't need to put another frequency
2741840	2743840	to make it vibrate
2743840	2745840	We can still
2745840	2747840	We can still get inelastic scattering
2747840	2749840	with Mixed Chromium Classical
2749840	2751840	And lastly, let's talk about
2751840	2753840	Excuse me
2753840	2755840	Did I interrupt you?
2755840	2757840	Did I interrupt you?
2757840	2759840	No, no, no
2759840	2761840	Oh, okay
2761840	2763840	I have a question
2763840	2765840	Because it looks like
2765840	2767840	Raman Fast++R and Quantum
2767840	2769840	are basically the same
2769840	2771840	But my question is
2771840	2773840	For example, if you want to manually
2773840	2775840	add a relaxation
2775840	2777840	and a defacing
2777840	2779840	and a defacing
2779840	2781840	and a defacing
2781840	2783840	You basically have three parameters
2783840	2785840	to add in, right?
2785840	2787840	How do they get it?
2787840	2789840	Oh, they all
2789840	2791840	Oh, they all
2791840	2793840	are based on
2793840	2795840	Fermi's Golden Rule
2797840	2799840	All my transitions
2799840	2801840	are based on Fermi's Golden Rule
2801840	2803840	Just like in Raman
2803840	2805840	What I'm doing is
2805840	2807840	I'm using Fermi's Golden Rule
2807840	2809840	for these two transitions
2809840	2811840	I'm using Fermi's Golden Rule
2811840	2813840	to figure out how much I need
2813840	2815840	to add
2815840	2817840	These three things
2817840	2819840	are related to each other
2819840	2821840	Everything is based on
2821840	2823840	Fermi's Golden Rule
2823840	2825840	So if I'm not wrong
2825840	2827840	If I'm not wrong
2827840	2829840	You add a resonance
2829840	2831840	intermediate state in the middle
2831840	2833840	You add a resonance
2833840	2835840	intermediate state in the middle
2835840	2837840	If it's Fermi's Golden Rule
2837840	2839840	You choose an energy
2839840	2841840	and all your in and out
2841840	2843840	will be resonant with that energy
2843840	2845840	No
2845840	2847840	But
2847840	2849840	What I'm doing is
2849840	2851840	What I'm doing is
2851840	2853840	I know
2853840	2855840	For example, I know
2855840	2857840	every transition 2-1
2857840	2859840	2-1 and 2-0
2859840	2861840	are based on different Fermi's Golden Rule
2861840	2863840	Fermi's Golden Rule is a rate
2863840	2865840	There's a transition rate
2865840	2867840	There's a transition rate
2867840	2869840	In my theory
2869840	2871840	I can deduce
2871840	2873840	How much is the difference
2873840	2875840	between Errandfest and Fermi's Golden Rule
2876840	2878840	Then I'll use those three things
2878840	2880840	to add up
2884840	2886840	Let me ask
2887840	2888840	Sorry
2888840	2891840	You can move to the next slide
2891840	2893840	Yes
2893840	2895840	To the next one
2895840	2897840	The first one on the right
2897840	2899840	So
2899840	2900840	Sorry
2900840	2901840	To the one before
2901840	2903840	On the right
2903840	2908840	So the input frequency
2908840	2910840	and
2910840	2912840	in these ranges
2912840	2914840	Do you need to calculate
2914840	2916840	how to add up
2916840	2918840	the other parameters?
2918840	2921840	Or these are already
2921840	2924840	The omega i
2924840	2926840	There are ten
2926840	2928840	Do you need to add up
2928840	2930840	the other parameters
2930840	2932840	ten times?
2932840	2934840	That might be easy
2934840	2936840	I don't know
2936840	2938840	I'm just asking
2938840	2940840	It's okay
2940840	2942840	We don't need to
2942840	2944840	Every trajectory
2944840	2946840	is the same
2946840	2948840	Just change one parameter
2948840	2950840	Just omega i
2950840	2952840	Yes, I just need to change omega i
2952840	2954840	I didn't change anything
2954840	2956840	I didn't change anything
2956840	2958840	in the calculation
2958840	2960840	So I don't need to calculate again
2962840	2964840	Can I ask a question?
2964840	2966840	You are calculating
2966840	2968840	Whether it's Rayleigh or Raman
2968840	2970840	You said you want to use Fermi's Golden Rule
2970840	2972840	But in general
2972840	2974840	Your state 2 is a virtual state
2974840	2976840	So
2976840	2978840	In reality
2978840	2980840	You can't get the real coupling constant
2980840	2982840	So how do you solve this problem?
2984840	2986840	Can't get the real coupling constant
2988840	2990840	In practice
2990840	2992840	You can measure Rayleigh scattering cross-section
2992840	2994840	Or Raman scattering cross-section
2996840	2998840	But you can't get
3000840	3002840	Real state and virtual state
3002840	3004840	How much is the coupling
3004840	3006840	Yes
3008840	3010840	It's like this
3010840	3012840	I don't have virtual state
3012840	3014840	and real state coupling
3014840	3016840	The coupling I use is
3016840	3018840	Resonant
3018840	3020840	I should not say resonant
3020840	3022840	The coupling I use is
3022840	3024840	Actually 1 and 2 coupling
3028840	3030840	So
3030840	3032840	If you look back from the lab
3034840	3036840	Because my idea is
3036840	3038840	more from
3038840	3040840	Initial
3040840	3042840	The first principle
3042840	3044840	If I want to calculate
3044840	3046840	If I want to calculate
3046840	3048840	The actual molecule
3048840	3050840	To calculate this
3050840	3052840	I will use
3052840	3054840	Electronic Structure
3054840	3056840	To calculate
3056840	3058840	The real coupling
3058840	3060840	This coupling
3060840	3062840	Not the real coupling
3062840	3064840	In electronic structure
3064840	3066840	How big is the coupling
3066840	3068840	This coupling
3068840	3070840	This coupling
3070840	3072840	Can be calculated
3072840	3074840	Transition dipole moment
3074840	3076840	1 and 2 state transition dipole moment
3076840	3078840	The light I hit
3078840	3080840	Whether there is resonance
3080840	3082840	I use the transition dipole moment
3086840	3088840	So you mean
3088840	3090840	You are in the molecule
3090840	3092840	You all have real state
3092840	3094840	You use real state transition dipole moment
3094840	3096840	You sum up all these real states
3098840	3100840	Yes
3100840	3102840	Because
3102840	3104840	In this
3104840	3106840	I don't have any
3106840	3108840	virtual state
3108840	3110840	It's not like
3110840	3112840	Sum of state
3112840	3114840	I have a lot of virtual state
3114840	3116840	Here is real state
3116840	3118840	Different frequency
3118840	3120840	Thank you
3122840	3124840	It is
3124840	3126840	A bit like a driving system
3126840	3128840	It is a dynamical system
3128840	3130840	Hope to answer your question
3132840	3134840	Any other questions
3136840	3138840	No, I will continue
3138840	3140840	Where did I just talk about
3140840	3142840	In the end, we want to say
3142840	3144840	In the end, we want to say
3144840	3146840	The problem we want to deal with
3146840	3148840	Is a strong problem
3148840	3150840	What about this strong problem
3150840	3152840	Model triplet
3152840	3154840	It is a two-level system
3154840	3156840	Back to a very simple two-level system
3156840	3158840	There is a very strong
3158840	3160840	Classical field
3162840	3164840	The biggest feature of this model triplet
3166840	3168840	I think the coolest thing is that it is classical
3168840	3170840	Classical in quantum now
3170840	3172840	It's a bit like laser
3172840	3174840	It is a coherent state
3174840	3176840	Very close
3176840	3178840	Classical
3178840	3180840	Classical electric field
3180840	3182840	But it emits
3182840	3184840	The light wave
3184840	3186840	It is a very
3186840	3188840	Not classical
3188840	3190840	Quantum light wave
3190840	3192840	Why is this
3192840	3194840	Because of this field
3194840	3196840	This electric field
3196840	3198840	Because it is very strong
3198840	3200840	Basically, it has exceeded
3200840	3202840	So we can't use it anymore
3202840	3204840	In quantum theory
3204840	3206840	It is a bit like
3206840	3208840	Mixing state
3208840	3210840	A bit like hybridization
3210840	3212840	The picture in the lower right corner
3212840	3214840	In fact, on the left
3214840	3216840	On the left side of this diagonal
3216840	3218840	Is the Bayer state
3218840	3220840	I made
3222840	3224840	Two-level system
3224840	3226840	Generate
3226840	3228840	Sorry
3228840	3230840	Two-level system and light
3230840	3232840	The state generated by the frequency
3232840	3234840	Draw it out
3234840	3236840	After drawing the hybridization
3236840	3238840	You will find that the right side
3238840	3240840	Is the state after hybridization
3240840	3242840	It's a bit like a mix
3242840	3244840	It's a bit like a dress state
3244840	3246840	Hybridization is light
3246840	3248840	With
3248840	3250840	Hybridization of two-level system
3250840	3252840	So its energy level
3252840	3254840	Will be changed
3254840	3256840	Then
3256840	3258840	In the model on the right
3258840	3260840	It has three different
3260840	3262840	Launch
3262840	3264840	Frequency
3264840	3266840	The first one we call T
3266840	3268840	Why is it called T?
3268840	3270840	It's very simple
3270840	3272840	It's called 3 photons
3272840	3274840	You can see it from
3274840	3276840	The highest
3276840	3278840	After 1, 2, 3
3278840	3280840	Three times to the lowest
3280840	3282840	So it's called triple
3282840	3284840	3 photons
3284840	3286840	Then F is called fluorescence
3286840	3288840	Fluorescence is basically the lowest connection
3288840	3290840	The two closest connections
3290840	3292840	Between
3292840	3294840	Launch
3294840	3296840	Then the other two
3296840	3298840	It's called Rayleigh
3298840	3300840	Two Rayleigh
3300840	3302840	It goes through two photons
3302840	3304840	It's called Rayleigh
3304840	3306840	That
3306840	3308840	This
3308840	3310840	The quantum theory
3310840	3312840	Gave us three
3312840	3314840	Different frequency
3314840	3316840	It's three different peaks
3316840	3318840	Then these peaks
3318840	3320840	It will be produced
3320840	3322840	It contains the Rabi frequency
3322840	3324840	This
3324840	3326840	The gentleman on the left is Rabi
3326840	3328840	He used to be in Columbia
3328840	3330840	Very cool
3330840	3332840	Then
3332840	3334840	We can also use this
3334840	3336840	Mixed quantum classical method
3336840	3338840	Let's try
3338840	3340840	We found that if we don't put any
3340840	3342840	If we don't change any plus r
3342840	3344840	We found that this system
3344840	3346840	It's basically classical in classical out
3346840	3348840	It's classical in, it's classical out
3348840	3350840	There won't be much change
3350840	3352840	If you're a kid
3352840	3354840	Or high school
3354840	3356840	There's a physical phenomenon
3356840	3358840	You put
3358840	3360840	A pile of protein
3360840	3362840	Put in a
3362840	3364840	Tie a pile of protein
3364840	3366840	On the same pole
3366840	3368840	The pole has a fixed frequency
3368840	3370840	After a long time, they will be synchronized
3370840	3372840	This phenomenon is basically
3372840	3374840	It's very similar to what we see here
3374840	3376840	Say
3376840	3378840	I
3378840	3380840	But there are a lot of different frequencies
3380840	3382840	Running inside
3382840	3384840	In fact, we're looking at this
3384840	3386840	Mixed quantum classical
3386840	3388840	In a short time, you'll see three peaks
3388840	3390840	We can see three peaks
3390840	3392840	But for a long time, you'll find the two peaks next to it
3392840	3394840	It's slowly disappearing
3394840	3396840	Only the middle peak is left
3396840	3398840	It's basically a
3398840	3400840	Classical driving system
3400840	3402840	Classical in, classical out
3402840	3404840	Nothing else
3404840	3406840	The rest is
3406840	3408840	The same old problem
3408840	3410840	There's no fluctuation here
3412840	3414840	With this
3414840	3416840	We'll find that
3416840	3418840	The blue line is the line after the plus
3418840	3420840	We can see
3420840	3422840	There's a stable
3422840	3424840	Side peak
3424840	3426840	It won't be because of time
3426840	3428840	It won't be because of time
3428840	3430840	It's gone
3430840	3432840	Why is there a stable side peak
3432840	3434840	It's actually a
3434840	3436840	It's attributed to
3436840	3438840	Random perturbation
3438840	3440840	Stochastic defacing
3440840	3442840	It's kind of like
3442840	3444840	In this classical system
3444840	3446840	Push it from time to time
3446840	3448840	Don't let it fall back
3448840	3450840	The huge frequency
3450840	3452840	Don't let it be forever
3452840	3454840	Classical in, classical out
3454840	3456840	There's this little stochastic
3456840	3458840	Defacing is actually very important here
3458840	3460840	It can make
3460840	3462840	The two side peaks
3462840	3464840	All stable
3464840	3466840	We want to know
3466840	3468840	Here we can see
3468840	3470840	These three ratios
3470840	3472840	R, F, T
3472840	3474840	With
3474840	3476840	All classical theory
3476840	3478840	The prediction is consistent
3478840	3480840	We want to know
3480840	3482840	Is there anything else
3482840	3484840	More interesting
3484840	3486840	We can compare with classical theory
3486840	3488840	Here
3488840	3490840	We show
3490840	3492840	This graph
3492840	3494840	It's an experiment
3494840	3496840	2012
3496840	3498840	Nature Phantomics
3498840	3500840	What did it change
3500840	3502840	It's a model triplet
3502840	3504840	Different lines
3504840	3506840	From bottom to top
3506840	3508840	Different
3508840	3510840	Infrared frequency
3510840	3512840	You'll find
3512840	3514840	There are a few
3514840	3516840	Features
3516840	3518840	The middle peak
3518840	3520840	There are some
3520840	3522840	Different
3522840	3524840	Different infrared behavior
3524840	3526840	The first one
3526840	3528840	Peak position
3528840	3530840	You can see the picture on the right
3532840	3534840	The middle line
3534840	3536840	Is
3536840	3538840	Central peak
3538840	3540840	It doesn't change much
3540840	3542840	This
3542840	3544840	Side peak
3544840	3546840	It's with
3546840	3548840	This width
3548840	3550840	Many people call
3550840	3552840	Generalized
3552840	3554840	Rabi frequency
3554840	3556840	It's off resonance
3556840	3558840	It's off resonance
3558840	3560840	Rabi frequency
3560840	3562840	That
3562840	3564840	The experiment and theory
3564840	3566840	Very well
3566840	3568840	This peak
3568840	3570840	Basically
3570840	3572840	Basically
3572840	3574840	This
3574840	3576840	It's not hard to get
3576840	3578840	The experiment and theory
3578840	3580840	It's not too bad
3580840	3582840	We
3582840	3584840	In
3584840	3586840	In urnfest plus r
3586840	3588840	You can see
3588840	3590840	The same behavior
3590840	3592840	Central peak
3592840	3594840	Fixed
3594840	3596840	Side peak
3596840	3598840	Similar
3598840	3600840	Generalized
3600840	3602840	Rabi frequency
3602840	3604840	The picture is a bit
3604840	3606840	I want to be like the left
3606840	3608840	X and y
3608840	3610840	Opposite
3610840	3612840	If you flip it over
3612840	3614840	The color is correct
3614840	3616840	Blue to blue
3616840	3618840	This is
3618840	3620840	Can be
3620840	3622840	A very good point
3622840	3624840	Basically
3624840	3626840	It's not hard
3626840	3628840	Next
3628840	3630840	Here
3630840	3632840	There's another peak
3632840	3634840	Outside
3634840	3636840	Right
3636840	3638840	Left and right
3638840	3640840	Resonance
3640840	3642840	Resonance
3642840	3644840	It may be
3644840	3646840	Higher
3646840	3648840	Higher
3648840	3650840	I'm sure
3650840	3652840	I have an impression
3652840	3654840	Please tell me
3654840	3656840	I remember
3656840	3658840	Model triplet
3658840	3660840	Very strong
3660840	3662840	Equivalent to
3662840	3664840	This connection
3664840	3666840	AC
3666840	3668840	Create another connection
3668840	3670840	My previous understanding
3670840	3672840	Right
3672840	3674840	So the calculation
3674840	3676840	Is
3676840	3678840	2012
3678840	3680840	Method
3680840	3682840	Simulation
3682840	3684840	No use
3684840	3686840	The method
3686840	3688840	The method
3688840	3690840	The method
3690840	3692840	Is
3692840	3694840	Dark shift
3694840	3696840	Electrophonon
3696840	3698840	Hybridization
3698840	3700840	The wind
3700840	3702840	Relationship
3702840	3704840	Calculate
3704840	3706840	OK
3706840	3708840	The earliest
3708840	3710840	Model paper
3710840	3712840	1967
3712840	3714840	The earliest prediction
3714840	3716840	Model triplet
3716840	3718840	Later
3718840	3720840	Many people
3720840	3722840	Explained
3722840	3724840	There is a good resource
3724840	3726840	Corinth
3726840	3728840	Work
3728840	3730840	Right
3730840	3732840	Next
3732840	3734840	More interesting
3734840	3736840	I'm comparing
3736840	3738840	This picture
3738840	3740840	I want to compare
3740840	3742840	Peak position
3742840	3744840	Can i get
3744840	3746840	Correct
3746840	3748840	Coherence emission
3748840	3750840	This one on the left
3750840	3752840	Quotient
3752840	3754840	Quantum mechanics
3754840	3756840	The whole quantum theory
3756840	3758840	Calculated
3758840	3760840	Coherence emission
3760840	3762840	The ratio
3762840	3764840	That
3764840	3766840	This green dot
3766840	3768840	Is a dot
3768840	3770840	We use
3770840	3772840	The first
3772840	3774840	We found
3774840	3776840	Near resonance
3776840	3778840	Delta omega is 0
3778840	3780840	Near resonance
3780840	3782840	Very good
3782840	3784840	Is there a way
3784840	3786840	We have a caveat
3786840	3788840	That is
3788840	3790840	Quantum mechanics
3790840	3792840	Based on
3792840	3794840	Rotating wave approximation
3794840	3796840	Near resonance
3796840	3798840	Near resonance
3798840	3800840	So we don't know
3800840	3802840	Far away
3802840	3804840	Resonance
3804840	3806840	Quantum mechanics
3806840	3808840	This calculation
3808840	3810840	Quantum mechanics
3810840	3812840	Is it accurate?
3812840	3814840	So this place
3814840	3816840	We are not very clear
3816840	3818840	Is this place accurate?
3818840	3820840	We get
3820840	3822840	Quite different
3822840	3824840	Near resonance
3824840	3826840	The result is close
3826840	3828840	That right
3828840	3830840	Is a
3830840	3832840	Can
3832840	3834840	Almost beyond
3834840	3836840	Rotating wave approximation
3836840	3838840	That is
3838840	3840840	If we look at the left
3840840	3842840	Peak
3842840	3844840	For
3844840	3846840	For
3846840	3848840	Different frequency
3848840	3850840	Change
3850840	3852840	The red line
3852840	3854840	Right side
3854840	3856840	The blue line is the left side peak
3856840	3858840	That
3858840	3860840	Is
3860840	3862840	In this
3862840	3864840	This
3864840	3866840	It is a
3866840	3868840	It will not
3868840	3870840	Unpredictable
3870840	3872840	Because
3872840	3874840	It only focuses on
3874840	3876840	One level
3876840	3878840	One level
3878840	3880840	This
3880840	3882840	Approximation
3882840	3884840	So it can get
3884840	3886840	The middle finger is right
3886840	3888840	But it can't get this
3888840	3890840	At this point
3890840	3892840	But our
3892840	3894840	Mixed quantum classical method
3894840	3896840	Because I didn't do anything
3896840	3898840	This
3898840	3900840	Rotating wave
3900840	3902840	So the result I got
3902840	3904840	I can get this
3904840	3906840	Linear crossing
3906840	3908840	This result
3908840	3910840	The result of the experiment is the same
3910840	3912840	On the experiment
3912840	3914840	We can see this
3914840	3916840	It is not a fixed point
3916840	3918840	It is a linear crossing
3918840	3920840	This result
3920840	3922840	Very exciting
3922840	3924840	So
3924840	3926840	We
3926840	3928840	So the last
3928840	3930840	This is the last recap
3930840	3932840	We found this
3932840	3934840	RFS class R dynamics
3934840	3936840	It can
3936840	3938840	Can simulate quantum mixing
3938840	3940840	There is no mixing
3940840	3942840	But only
3942840	3944840	Driving field
3944840	3946840	With a small stochastic
3946840	3948840	I can simulate
3948840	3950840	Quantum mixing
3950840	3952840	That we can
3952840	3954840	Very clear
3954840	3956840	Coherence emission and incoherence emission
3956840	3958840	That
3958840	3960840	I hope
3960840	3962840	These advantages
3962840	3964840	Tell everyone that we are developing
3964840	3966840	This set of theory
3966840	3968840	Very reliable
3968840	3970840	Method to deal with
3970840	3972840	Quantum interaction
3972840	3974840	But this method
3974840	3976840	There are many problems
3976840	3978840	This method
3978840	3980840	We haven't thought about it yet
3980840	3982840	This
3982840	3984840	Quantum motion
3984840	3986840	Our current material
3986840	3988840	Very simple material
3988840	3990840	Very simple
3990840	3992840	From the perspective of a chemist
3992840	3994840	We are
3994840	3996840	We hope
3996840	3998840	At least
3998840	4000840	Chemistry
4000840	4002840	Potential energy
4002840	4004840	Put in
4004840	4006840	Put in
4006840	4008840	Non-adiabatic dynamics
4008840	4010840	Different behaviors
4010840	4012840	This is a
4012840	4014840	Suitable direction
4014840	4016840	Another question mark
4016840	4018840	Can we get
4018840	4020840	Photon content detection
4020840	4022840	Because there are
4022840	4024840	The second point and the third point
4024840	4026840	Very similar
4026840	4028840	Anti-function
4028840	4030840	Because
4030840	4032840	There is another big feature
4032840	4034840	I haven't covered yet
4034840	4036840	Three-wind
4036840	4038840	Photon content detection is different
4038840	4040840	Because
4040840	4042840	It releases light
4042840	4044840	Order of relationship
4044840	4046840	Every light
4046840	4048840	For example, it
4048840	4050840	It releases the first
4050840	4052840	The next one may be very close to it
4052840	4054840	That
4054840	4056840	The first one
4056840	4058840	It must be very far away
4058840	4060840	It can't release a light right away
4060840	4062840	So when you measure
4062840	4064840	The statistical value of light
4064840	4066840	You will find
4066840	4068840	F light may be
4068840	4070840	In line with
4070840	4072840	Poisson distribution
4072840	4074840	Then T light
4074840	4076840	It is in line with sub-Poisson distribution
4076840	4078840	So they
4078840	4080840	The statistical value of light will be different
4080840	4082840	Here
4082840	4084840	We haven't tried it yet
4084840	4086840	Of course
4086840	4088840	There is no light inside
4088840	4090840	Can we get similar
4090840	4092840	Finally
4092840	4094840	There is a
4094840	4096840	If our light is not
4096840	4098840	Not
4098840	4100840	Not at zero
4100840	4102840	There is a thermal distribution
4102840	4104840	Then we
4104840	4106840	Can we
4106840	4108840	In Mixed quantum classical
4108840	4110840	Get detail balance
4110840	4112840	Or we may
4112840	4114840	Violate detail balance
4114840	4116840	The last question
4116840	4118840	It's actually a very important question
4118840	4120840	In many systems
4120840	4122840	For example, you put a two-level system in the cavity
4122840	4124840	Its spontaneous emission rate
4124840	4126840	May be changed
4126840	4128840	It may no longer be in line with
4128840	4130840	Freemius golden rule rate
4130840	4132840	Its spontaneous emission rate
4132840	4134840	Because of the cavity
4134840	4136840	Strong interaction
4136840	4138840	Caused
4138840	4140840	It
4140840	4142840	The emission frequency will change
4142840	4144840	What about our method now
4144840	4146840	Based on Freemius golden rule rate
4146840	4148840	So it may not be in line with
4148840	4150840	So this is also a
4150840	4152840	It may be necessary to consider
4152840	4154840	Then
4154840	4156840	Then we do
4156840	4158840	Method
4158840	4160840	Method development
4160840	4162840	Method development
4162840	4164840	For people
4164840	4166840	The most common thing we do
4166840	4168840	We have created a new toy
4168840	4170840	It's
4170840	4172840	We want to use it in many places
4172840	4174840	Many people hope to use it
4174840	4176840	In many places
4176840	4178840	For us
4178840	4180840	A very important question
4180840	4182840	When will it break down
4182840	4184840	This is the most important thing we want to know
4184840	4186840	The most important thing we want to know
4186840	4188840	When does it not work
4188840	4190840	That
4190840	4192840	Of course there are many
4192840	4194840	Application
4194840	4196840	These things are all
4196840	4198840	We hope to push it to
4198840	4200840	Other
4200840	4202840	Light or
4202840	4204840	Spectroscopy group
4204840	4206840	Let them try
4206840	4208840	Can we
4208840	4210840	Use the same method
4210840	4212840	Look at
4212840	4214840	We put
4214840	4216840	Chemical reaction into a cavity
4216840	4218840	It may be because of the interaction with light
4218840	4220840	To change
4220840	4222840	Its vibrational
4222840	4224840	Energy level
4224840	4226840	Because of the change in the vibrational energy level
4226840	4228840	It may have different
4228840	4230840	Reaction pathway
4230840	4232840	So it will have different chemical reactions
4232840	4234840	This is also
4234840	4236840	This is a thing we can do
4236840	4238840	A direction
4238840	4240840	Another application in the middle
4240840	4242840	Is a new theory
4242840	4244840	It's called
4244840	4246840	Model spectroscopy
4246840	4248840	Then
4248840	4250840	In this model spectroscopy
4250840	4252840	I use
4252840	4254840	Classical source
4254840	4256840	Generate quantum light
4256840	4258840	Then use this quantum light
4258840	4260840	Different light statistical properties
4260840	4262840	To
4262840	4264840	Hit the target
4264840	4266840	Then
4266840	4268840	I can see
4268840	4270840	This
4270840	4272840	Target for different
4272840	4274840	Photon statistics
4274840	4276840	Behavior
4276840	4278840	This is a
4278840	4280840	New thing
4280840	4282840	But this thing
4282840	4284840	There is no implementation
4284840	4286840	But in theory
4286840	4288840	Many people
4288840	4290840	Pursue this direction
4290840	4292840	Finally
4292840	4294840	A very
4294840	4296840	In device and material science
4296840	4298840	A very useful application
4298840	4300840	Conductance enhancement
4300840	4302840	Application
4302840	4304840	This
4304840	4306840	Conductance enhancement
4306840	4308840	Can use
4308840	4310840	Cavity
4310840	4312840	Can use
4312840	4314840	This method
4316840	4318840	We hope to use this method
4318840	4320840	To
4320840	4322840	Understand why
4322840	4324840	Conductance enhancement
4324840	4326840	Will happen
4326840	4328840	Finally, I would like to thank
4328840	4330840	My
4330840	4332840	Professor
4332840	4334840	This
4334840	4336840	Old man
4336840	4338840	Not old
4338840	4340840	My
4340840	4342840	Advisor
4342840	4344840	And
4344840	4346840	I've been
4346840	4348840	Half year
4348840	4350840	Visiting scholar
4350840	4352840	Half year
4352840	4354840	Visiting scholar
4354840	4356840	Maxine
4356840	4358840	A professor
4358840	4360840	Now
4360840	4362840	This method
4362840	4364840	Generate
4364840	4366840	Three dimension
4366840	4368840	This method
4368840	4370840	I have a
4370840	4372840	Electronic system
4372840	4374840	There is a
4374840	4376840	Classic electronic system
4376840	4378840	Maxine is a classic electronic system
4378840	4380840	Expert
4380840	4382840	This theory
4382840	4384840	With
4384840	4386840	Very
4386840	4388840	Mature
4388840	4390840	Combination
4390840	4392840	Tao Li
4392840	4394840	A researcher
4394840	4396840	He is
4396840	4398840	We did a lot of work together
4398840	4400840	Finally, I want to thank
4400840	4402840	Ted
4402840	4404840	Organize
4404840	4406840	Let me have a chance
4406840	4408840	Share with you
4408840	4410840	Thank you
4410840	4412840	Thank you
4412840	4414840	Thank you
4414840	4416840	Any other questions
4416840	4418840	No
4418840	4420840	Hey everyone
4420840	4422840	No one has a special question
4430840	4432840	Hey
4432840	4434840	Let me ask
4434840	4436840	One is what we are looking at
4436840	4438840	The problem is good
4438840	4440840	When we look at it recently
4440840	4442840	I
4442840	4444840	What are you doing
4444840	4446840	Light
4446840	4448840	This kind of
4448840	4450840	Interaction
4450840	4452840	In the semiconductor
4452840	4454840	In the semiconductor
4454840	4456840	This kind of
4456840	4458840	We are looking at
4458840	4460840	In addition to
4460840	4462840	Like you now
4462840	4464840	Are concerned
4464840	4466840	Light in classical way
4466840	4468840	Electromagnetic wave
4468840	4470840	If
4470840	4472840	So we do
4472840	4474840	We do more
4474840	4476840	That
4476840	4478840	So
4478840	4480840	It depends on
4480840	4482840	Light itself
4482840	4484840	Characteristics
4484840	4486840	One we are looking at recently
4486840	4488840	I
4488840	4490840	Just
4490840	4492840	Is
4492840	4494840	This kind of thing
4494840	4496840	I'm thinking
4496840	4498840	If there is
4498840	4500840	Although at the beginning
4500840	4502840	But
4502840	4504840	Light
4504840	4506840	Is recently
4506840	4508840	I think it's a hot topic
4508840	4510840	One
4510840	4512840	Have you ever thought about it
4512840	4514840	His whole disease
4514840	4516840	He is also a
4516840	4518840	That one
4518840	4520840	Border
4520840	4522840	One of the conditions
4522840	4524840	Square
4524840	4526840	Light
4526840	4528840	This slope
4528840	4530840	It's different from the circle
4530840	4532840	Not the same
4532840	4534840	In addition to the disease
4534840	4536840	There is a good moment
4536840	4538840	That you
4538840	4540840	This may be
4540840	4542840	Maybe you are now
4542840	4544840	It may not be the same
4544840	4546840	But I want to say
4546840	4548840	You can analyze it
4548840	4550840	Light
4550840	4552840	For
4552840	4554840	Maybe
4554840	4556840	Interaction between molecules
4556840	4558840	Interaction with any
4558840	4560840	Interaction
4560840	4562840	How does it react
4562840	4564840	I think
4564840	4566840	This
4566840	4568840	I am not a scholar
4568840	4570840	These things are a bit difficult
4570840	4572840	I
4572840	4574840	I am now
4574840	4576840	I am now
4576840	4578840	What they are doing
4578840	4580840	Very confident
4580840	4582840	I have
4582840	4584840	FDTD
4584840	4586840	These good
4586840	4588840	Classical electromagnetic
4588840	4590840	That
4590840	4592840	Basically
4592840	4594840	What he does now
4594840	4596840	For
4596840	4598840	Different polarization
4598840	4600840	Can be done
4600840	4602840	I think
4602840	4604840	If he does this
4604840	4606840	I think it should be
4606840	4608840	The problem you are thinking about is helpful
4608840	4610840	Great
4610840	4612840	Let's pay attention to this
4612840	4614840	Professor
4624840	4626840	I have a question
4626840	4628840	Ok
4628840	4630840	This is
4630840	4632840	This is my long-standing question
4632840	4634840	I want to know when it will happen
4634840	4636840	Melo
4636840	4638840	When will it happen
4638840	4640840	Outer tongue splitting
4640840	4642840	Then
4642840	4644840	What is your second
4644840	4646840	Outer tongue splitting
4646840	4648840	Oh
4648840	4650840	Then
4650840	4652840	I know it's probably
4652840	4654840	Only in molecules or
4654840	4656840	Molecular system
4656840	4658840	But in
4658840	4660840	Acetone system
4660840	4662840	Outer tongue splitting
4662840	4664840	Then
4664840	4666840	Do you know the specific reason
4666840	4668840	I don't know the specific reason
4668840	4670840	What is it
4670840	4672840	Because my understanding of it is the same as yours
4672840	4674840	It's in
4674840	4676840	Molecule
4676840	4678840	In the molecular system
4678840	4680840	It will be
4680840	4682840	The other one is in
4682840	4684840	Yeah
4684840	4686840	I still have to learn these things
4686840	4688840	I haven't
4688840	4690840	I probably do this
4690840	4692840	About a year and a half
4692840	4694840	Ok
4694840	4696840	I still have a lot to learn
4696840	4698840	Ok
4698840	4700840	The other thing is
4700840	4702840	Outer tongues and
4702840	4704840	What is it
4704840	4706840	It's called
4706840	4708840	EIT
4708840	4710840	Electronic
4710840	4712840	Transparency
4712840	4714840	What's the difference between these two
4714840	4716840	Transparency
4716840	4718840	I really don't know
4718840	4720840	Ok
4720840	4722840	Out of my
4722840	4724840	You may ask
4724840	4726840	Ted may not know
4726840	4728840	I remember EIT
4728840	4730840	I remember EIT and
4730840	4732840	It seems to be different
4732840	4734840	EIT seems to be more in atoms
4734840	4736840	But I actually don't remember
4736840	4738840	Ah
4738840	4740840	EIT
4740840	4742840	EIT and
4742840	4744840	The effect of outer tongues looks the same
4744840	4746840	But it's completely different from molecular splitting
4746840	4748840	Molecular splitting you will see
4748840	4750840	There are three states
4750840	4752840	You see two states in outer tongues
4756840	4758840	I forgot
4758840	4760840	Sorry
4760840	4762840	It's okay
4762840	4764840	But I think this is a pretty interesting question
4764840	4766840	I think I should
4766840	4768840	I should use
4768840	4770840	Because EIT is basically
4770840	4772840	The first thing we try
4772840	4774840	Let's try to break down
4774840	4776840	This method
4776840	4778840	See if our method will break down here
4778840	4780840	It's actually pretty good
4780840	4782840	So I was thinking
4782840	4784840	Maybe our next project will use EIT
4784840	4786840	Ok
4786840	4788840	Another thing
4788840	4790840	You said you add
4790840	4792840	You add fluctuation in the electric field
4792840	4794840	Then
4794840	4796840	Add fluctuation in the classical field
4796840	4798840	Then let it be
4798840	4800840	Looks like there is
4800840	4802840	Spontaneous emission
4802840	4804840	Which electric field are you in
4804840	4806840	Is it driving force
4806840	4808840	Do you add fluctuation in the emission field
4808840	4810840	No, I'm in the radiation field
4810840	4812840	Add fluctuation
4812840	4814840	What about driving field
4814840	4816840	We still treat it as
4816840	4818840	It's a
4818840	4820840	Electric field running past
4820840	4822840	Just say
4822840	4824840	You can break it down
4824840	4826840	But this
4826840	4828840	If you are in
4828840	4830840	Emission
4830840	4832840	Add fluctuation in radiation
4832840	4834840	Then
4834840	4836840	You said your addition
4836840	4838840	You just assume
4838840	4840840	It's on time
4840840	4842840	Don't run on time
4842840	4844840	Then at a certain random time
4844840	4846840	You just let it change
4846840	4848840	Phase
4848840	4850840	Then
4850840	4852840	This thing seems to be with
4852840	4854840	Is two dimensional
4854840	4856840	Spectroscopy
4856840	4858840	The method they use
4858840	4860840	Very similar
4860840	4862840	Do you say pump probe
4862840	4864840	In two dimensional
4864840	4866840	Spectroscopy
4866840	4868840	They have
4868840	4870840	Another one called
4870840	4872840	Another one called
4872840	4874840	There are two components in
4874840	4876840	One is called
4876840	4878840	Free induction decay
4878840	4880840	The second one is
4880840	4882840	Phonon scattering
4882840	4884840	Or scattering of other things
4884840	4886840	Then
4886840	4888840	The second one
4888840	4890840	Their assumption
4890840	4892840	They brought in
4892840	4894840	Model method
4894840	4896840	In the radiation field
4896840	4898840	Add a random
4898840	4900840	Phase jump
4902840	4904840	So these two things
4904840	4906840	Is it the same
4906840	4908840	Actually different
4908840	4910840	A little different
4910840	4912840	Just say
4912840	4914840	OK
4914840	4916840	I want
4916840	4918840	Just
4918840	4920840	I want to say one thing
4920840	4922840	Because i'm not really
4922840	4924840	I'm not really
4924840	4926840	I'm not really
4926840	4928840	Add a random phase
4928840	4930840	I'm adding a random phase
4930840	4932840	In
4932840	4934840	In
4934840	4936840	Two level system
4936840	4938840	Then this two level system
4938840	4940840	Random phase will react to electric field
4940840	4942840	So i'm not really
4942840	4944840	Add to electric field
4944840	4946840	That way
4946840	4948840	There are two benefits
4948840	4950840	Because
4950840	4952840	My
4952840	4954840	It is natural
4954840	4956840	There are two benefits of this method
4956840	4958840	The first benefit is
4958840	4960840	Because my two level system
4960840	4962840	Also need this defacing
4962840	4964840	It also needs
4964840	4966840	This little defacing
4966840	4968840	Correct
4968840	4970840	Its fluctuation
4970840	4972840	It also needs this thing
4972840	4974840	That
4974840	4976840	From
4976840	4978840	Then the other benefit is
4978840	4980840	Because i'm
4982840	4984840	Put
4984840	4986840	There is actually a
4986840	4988840	Difficulty point is because I put
4988840	4990840	I want to put this
4990840	4992840	Add a little fluctuation
4992840	4994840	I can't just add it
4994840	4996840	Add to a certain place
4996840	4998840	It just caused it
4998840	5000840	Self-interaction will destroy the whole system
5000840	5002840	That
5002840	5004840	So it will have a
5004840	5006840	Specific method
5006840	5008840	Add it to a correct place
5008840	5010840	That
5010840	5012840	This thing
5012840	5014840	Because
5014840	5016840	Because
5016840	5018840	Because this field
5018840	5020840	It's not like it's not just a point
5020840	5022840	It's a whole space
5022840	5024840	And it has to meet some basic
5024840	5026840	For example, it can't go beyond the speed of light
5026840	5028840	I can't put a field
5028840	5030840	Suddenly add to a place beyond the speed of light
5030840	5032840	Right
5032840	5034840	So
5034840	5036840	We try not to add directly
5036840	5038840	On the field
5038840	5040840	So when we design this method
5040840	5042840	We put
5042840	5044840	This fluctuation is added to the two-level system
5044840	5046840	Let the two-level system
5046840	5048840	Naturally generate this fluctuation
5050840	5052840	OK
5056840	5058840	There is a more detailed question
5058840	5060840	I want to know
5060840	5062840	Why
5062840	5064840	Classical
5064840	5066840	Just
5066840	5068840	Quantum matter and classical
5068840	5070840	Field
5070840	5072840	That
5072840	5074840	Inside the model
5074840	5076840	Only when
5076840	5078840	Just when
5078840	5080840	That is
5080840	5082840	Low
5082840	5084840	Low 0
5084840	5086840	Low 1 is
5086840	5088840	There will be no emission
5088840	5090840	I always thought
5090840	5092840	There will be no emission
5092840	5094840	OK
5094840	5096840	Thank you for asking this question
5096840	5098840	Because
5098840	5100840	Because of my time
5100840	5102840	I missed a part
5102840	5104840	That's it
5104840	5106840	Here
5106840	5108840	Here
5108840	5110840	Mixed quantum classical
5110840	5112840	Here
5112840	5114840	It's not pure
5114840	5116840	Pure
5116840	5118840	The most basic
5118840	5120840	Mixed quantum classical
5120840	5122840	There is a
5122840	5124840	Mixed quantum classical
5124840	5126840	I am in this
5126840	5128840	This
5128840	5130840	In this
5132840	5134840	Two-level system
5134840	5136840	Classical
5136840	5138840	Field
5138840	5140840	Will also
5140840	5142840	Self-interact to two-level system
5142840	5144840	Let it decay
5144840	5146840	So
5146840	5148840	This is already a non-linear system
5148840	5150840	So you see these
5150840	5152840	These red lines are not a simple
5152840	5154840	A simple
5154840	5156840	Exponential decay
5156840	5158840	OK
5158840	5160840	It is a
5160840	5162840	I will keep myself
5162840	5164840	Self-interact
5166840	5168840	So
5168840	5170840	There will be some decay
5170840	5172840	Basically
5172840	5174840	Here
5174840	5176840	This is one of our recent papers
5176840	5178840	Its point is
5178840	5180840	This is the most basic
5180840	5182840	Mixed quantum classical
5182840	5184840	Can get some
5184840	5186840	Partially correct
5186840	5188840	Some spontaneous emission
5188840	5190840	But it won't get all
5190840	5192840	Spontaneous emission
5192840	5194840	Sorry, you can go to the front page
5194840	5196840	Let me see what is called
5196840	5198840	Oh
5198840	5200840	You said
5200840	5202840	Its equation
5202840	5204840	I didn't write it out
5204840	5206840	OK
5206840	5208840	I can
5208840	5210840	I can give you
5210840	5212840	Our paper
5212840	5214840	On the paper
5214840	5216840	I can check it myself
5216840	5218840	Because I didn't
5218840	5220840	Write it all out
5220840	5222840	It's a bit complicated
5228840	5230840	Thank you
5230840	5232840	You're welcome
5238840	5240840	OK

5242840	5244840	Want to discuss
5254840	5256840	OK

5276840	5278840	We will put the recording on
5278840	5280840	OK
5280840	5282840	That's all for today
5282840	5284840	That's all for today
5284840	5286840	OK
