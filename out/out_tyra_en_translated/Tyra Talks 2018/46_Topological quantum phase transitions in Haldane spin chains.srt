Q&A

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello, I am today's representative host, Zhang Yanyong, because our host, Zhang Jianyuan, he is actually more suitable, because he is doing Qubits, doing condensed matter, but he is now stuck on the road, he has no time for transportation, so I will represent the host.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me introduce our speaker today. Our speaker today is Dr. Zeng Yuqing. The topic he is going to talk to us today is ... I want to read it right, wait a minute, I suddenly can't find it, wait a minute, wait a minute.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Topological quantum phase transitions in Haldane spin chains. This is a very popular topic, because in 2016 or 2017, Topological Matter won the Nobel Prize, so we have always hoped that we could invite an expert to introduce to us what topological phases are.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then, Zeng Yuqing, in 2005, got a college degree from Donghai University, a physics major, right? Then he went to serve in the military, and then served in the military for 1.5 years, but he served in the military at Donghai University. Why?

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
After I served in the military, I returned to Donghai University as a research assistant.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then there is a published paper in PRB, if you are interested, because I don't have that number, so you can directly ask our speaker for this thing. Then he transferred to Central University and completed his Ph.D. degree. The main function is also condensed matter theory.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:46,000
At present, Zeng Yuqing is at the University of Kent in the UK, and he is now focusing on numerical study on the time-reversal invariant fractional topological insulator. This is a very hot topic, so we don't have much to say, we applaud and welcome today's speaker. Oh, if you want to applaud or ask a question, remember to turn on the microphone.

9
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's get started. Today I prepared some props.

10
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have some props. You can play with some props later.

11
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will talk about some of the things I have done before, which will be more professional. First of all, what is physics?

12
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What we mainly learn in physics is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is like classical mechanics, which is mechanics, or kinetic mechanics of electricity, quantum mechanics, thermal mechanics, and statistical mechanics.

13
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This whole thing is actually studying the interaction between time, space, and matter. The interaction between matter has, for example, strong, weak, electromagnetic, or gravity.

14
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can take the whole world, these substances, as if they were actors on stage. The stage is the background between time and space, and there will be some interaction between the actor and the actor.

15
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The whole thing will form a movie or a stage play.

16
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What about matter? This is from when I was very young, for example, in high school or elementary school, I learned that we can classify matter in this way.

17
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:45,000
First, divide it into solid matter or mixtures. Mixtures, such as beer, milk tea, or air, are mixtures.

18
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
For example, alcohol, water, and many other substances, such as beer, flowers, and so on.

19
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
For example, most of the air is 4 out of 5 gas, and 1 out of 5 oxygen, for example.

20
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Pure matter can be divided into elements and mixtures. For example, the elements in the cycle table, such as gold, iron, oxygen, and O2.

21
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For example, the previously well-known graphene, which is basically carbon.

22
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:45,000
For example, alcohol is a mixture of alcohol and water.

23
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Alcohol has a chemical form, such as CH3CH2OH, which is alcohol.

24
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Chlorine is also a mixture of pure matter.

25
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oxygen is also a mixture of pure matter.

26
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For example, ice is water, which is the solid of water.

27
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ice is also pure matter, which is H2O.

28
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This classification is probably a little bit of preliminary understanding of matter.

29
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
To understand this understanding further, we can see that matter has many states.

30
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This state is called phase.

31
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There is a change between the phase and the phase, which is called phase change.

32
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:01,000
For example, the ice or water we just talked about is under pressure in the horizontal axis and temperature in the vertical axis.

33
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, at the bottom of atmospheric pressure, below 0 Â° C, it is solid.

34
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This side will be liquid and this side will be gas.

35
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The red line is from here, it will pass through a waste point and then become water vapor.

36
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
From here, it will pass through this ice point and solidify into ice.

37
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For example, this picture.

38
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Of course, you can't see the water vapor with your naked eye.

39
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because the water vapor is transparent and colorless.

40
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If it is connected to this water drop on the glass, it will become a liquid.

41
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can see that this is water.

42
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the water we usually see.

43
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ice is solid.

44
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This picture is in our present.

45
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's snowing in the UK recently, and it's cold.

46
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
After the snow, many people want to do an experiment.

47
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Put the liquid nitrogen on the snowman and then destroy it.

48
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
See what the result is.

49
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In short, this picture of water should have been seen in elementary school.

50
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't know if there is any problem.

51
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If not, I want to emphasize that there is a critical point here.

52
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The meaning of this critical point is that if the temperature and pressure are very high from here to the critical point, you will not be able to distinguish whether the water is a liquid or a gas.

53
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After this critical point, there is no red line.

54
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The red line on the left has been extended.

55
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This point stops at this critical point.

56
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So if this side is gas, this side is liquid, this side is solid.

57
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This line completely separates solid and liquid.

58
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But here you can adjust the temperature and pressure appropriately.

59
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then let it slowly go around this critical point from here.

60
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then enter another item.

61
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:25,000
In other words, the phase of the liquid and the phase of the gas are the same phase.

62
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The three-dimensional picture of water here is actually only two phases.

63
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There are only two images like this.

64
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There should be no problem.

65
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is a relaxing video.

66
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:59,000
A few days ago, we put the liquid and gas on the snowman.

67
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Many people came to see.

68
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are about 100 people here.

69
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Other dramas have come to see.

70
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think this is interesting.

71
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You can see that gas is also a pure material.

72
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Pure materials have three-dimensional pictures of water like just now.

73
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now pour out the liquid and gas.

74
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The liquid and gas are about 70K.

75
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's about 100 degrees below zero.

76
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The temperature of the ice is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.

77
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The temperature of the liquid and gas is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.

78
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The temperature is lower.

79
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can see the picture of the liquid and gas.

80
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It is still solid.

81
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's about it.

82
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What is a phase?

83
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What does it mean?

84
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You have an external parameter.

85
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For example, you just saw that there is temperature and pressure.

86
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You have an external parameter.

87
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What is the state of a huge macro of this material?

88
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are the external parameters?

89
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
For example, temperature pressure, magnetic field, or external control.

90
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You can control the outside.

91
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
For example, you add a power plant.

92
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or you use other elements to replace these compounds.

93
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You do some mixing.

94
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This mixing can also be regarded as an external parameter.

95
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Mainly these parameters.

96
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You made these modifications.

97
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Will affect these.

98
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because the matter is composed of those atoms.

99
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It is composed of those particles.

100
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You modified these external parameters.

101
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Will affect the interaction between particles.

102
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What about the interaction between particles?

103
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It will have different phases.

104
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The higher the temperature, the more chaotic the material is.

105
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But if you have an interaction, the material may have a different order.

106
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What is a macro state?

107
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
For example, the three-phase change just now.

108
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The three-phase change is the solid, solid, gas.

109
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But it's not just solid, solid, gas.

110
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a macro state.

111
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
For example, conductivity.

112
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Conductivity is also a macro state.

113
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Magnetic field is also a macro state.

114
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
For example, mercury.

115
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
In 1911, it was discovered by Ernst.

116
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
After the temperature dropped very low, it suddenly became a superconductor.

117
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What about conductivity?

118
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
For example, the angle is the temperature.

119
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
When the temperature is very high.

120
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This temperature is the absolute temperature.

121
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
From this place, you can see that there is a conductor here.

122
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Satisfy the Ohm's law.

123
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
When the temperature drops, the conductor becomes smaller and smaller.

124
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But there is still a conductor.

125
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But when the temperature is about 4K, about 4.2K.

126
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The conductor suddenly disappears.

127
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There is almost nothing.

128
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There is nothing at all.

129
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There is nothing here.

130
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This can be regarded as a phase change.

131
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because this is a very macro state.

132
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The whole change.

133
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because there is a conductor here.

134
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
There is no conductor here at all.

135
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Here is the general conductor.

136
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
On the left side, it suddenly becomes a superconductor.

137
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The superconductor has great application value.

138
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
For example, later we found that mercury is a pure material.

139
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Mercury is an element.

140
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But other compounds may also become superconductors.

141
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like these high-temperature superconductors.

142
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
High-temperature superconductors can become superconductors as long as they are at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen.

143
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
For example, these copper oxides.

144
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You will see that there is an X in these different compounds.

145
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There is an X here, right?

146
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This X is when you synthesize this compound.

147
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How much ratio do you want to put in?

148
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How much ratio do you put in?

149
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Then you go to burn this compound.

150
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then you are equal to saying that this X is your external parameter.

151
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's your temperature with your axis.

152
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Different temperatures and different cross-sections.

153
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The horizontal axis is the cross-section.

154
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The horizontal axis is the cross-section.

155
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Write a P on the right.

156
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You are the cross-sectional electric.

157
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This is the meaning of the X.

158
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Write an N on the left.

159
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Write N on the left.

160
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You are the cross-sectional electric.

161
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Here is the electron dot and the hole dot.

162
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This place is when you are not in the cross-section.

163
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is a counter-iron-magnetic superconductor.

164
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When you cross-section to a certain degree,

165
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
When you drop to a low enough temperature,

166
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It becomes a superconductor.

167
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So this area is a superconductor phase.

168
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This area is a counter-iron-magnetic phase.

169
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What is a counter-iron-magnetic?

170
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Then go on.

171
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Magnetic.

172
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
There are many kinds of magnetic.

173
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The magnet we usually see,

174
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Like this magnet.

175
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
When we were in elementary school,

176
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Take the magnet and sprinkle some magnetic powder.

177
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Look at the magnetic field.

178
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The magnetic nature of this magnet is called magnetism.

179
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That is to say,

180
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There are many magnetic poles inside the magnet.

181
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Many small magnetic poles.

182
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
These magnetic poles are originally,

183
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If it is messy,

184
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If the temperature is very high,

185
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Then these magnetic poles are messy.

186
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
After the mess, the whole is not magnetic.

187
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But if you lower the temperature,

188
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then because of this magnetic pole and the magnetic pole,

189
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There will be some interaction.

190
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
These interactions will make these magnetic poles,

191
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The direction is still in the same direction.

192
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
When everyone is lined up in roughly the same direction,

193
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The overall magnetic nature will be displayed.

194
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You will see that it is a magnet.

195
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It is the overall direction.

196
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
For example, this arrow here is N-level,

197
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is S-level.

198
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If everyone is messy,

199
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The whole thing is offset.

200
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I found a YouTube video.

201
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's probably like this.

202
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Can you see it now?

203
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Should be no problem.

204
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes, I can see it.

205
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There is a piece of iron on the top.

206
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Put a piece of iron.

207
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
After the magnetic iron below is red,

208
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The red magnetic iron is magnetic.

209
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Its magnetic pole is messy.

210
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Messy, then there is no magnetic nature.

211
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But after it slowly cools down,

212
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The temperature is low enough.

213
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because it has an interaction between the magnetic pole and the magnetic pole.

214
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When the temperature is low enough,

215
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It will be aligned with everyone in the same direction.

216
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There is a magnetic pole in the same direction.

217
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If there is a magnetic pole,

218
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It becomes iron magnetic.

219
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Iron magnetic is the meaning of this magnetic iron.

220
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
There should be no problem.

221
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Another one is that it is lined up well.

222
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But it does not have a total magnetic force.

223
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The total magnetic iron.

224
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Although the super island I just talked about.

225
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When you are not mixed, it is iron magnetic.

226
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What does iron magnetic mean?

227
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That is to say, your magnetic pole.

228
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This magnetic pole.

229
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How did this magnetic pole come?

230
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Part of it is the orbital momentum of the electron.

231
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And the other part is the magnetic circle.

232
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If these magnetic poles are interspersed.

233
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
For example, here is up, down, up, down, up, down, up.

234
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Interspersed.

235
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It is also lined up well.

236
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But it does not have the iron magnetic force of the magnet just now.

237
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But it still has order.

238
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This iron magnetic force.

239
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Although there is no total magnetic force.

240
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But it is completely different from the one that was completely messed up just now.

241
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because the magnetic pole of the burning red iron is messy.

242
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This iron magnetic pole.

243
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The magnetic pole is very well arranged.

244
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
After that, I will mainly talk about.

245
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
If these magnetic poles are arranged into a chain.

246
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Of course, this is the intention below.

247
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Because you are not taking a magnet.

248
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Then directly this magnet.

249
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because there are countless magnetic poles in a magnet.

250
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Or there are already a lot of magnetic poles inside.

251
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Then we have to discuss later.

252
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It is said that the magnetic pole is arranged into a circle.

253
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Then the magnetic pole and the magnetic pole next door have some interaction.

254
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Will this cause the whole?

255
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Will there be a state of order?

256
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Or will it be a whole?

257
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What is the order?

258
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Simply put, everything has an order.

259
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
For example, electrons also have an order.

260
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The light also has an order.

261
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The magnet also has an order.

262
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Quark also has an order.

263
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Everything has an order.

264
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Order is a basic physical nature.

265
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Quark also has an order.

266
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Quark's order is 1.

267
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But Quark's order is 1.

268
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Its z-direction can only be positive or negative 1.

269
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So we see that light has a polarizing direction.

270
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
There is a left-handed light and a right-handed light.

271
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Light has an order.

272
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The order of light is 1.

273
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
All orders should be divided into two categories.

274
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:32,000
One is the order of one-half, three-thirds, five-fifths, seven-fifths.

275
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This kind of half-order is called quark.

276
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The other is the order of the whole.

277
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
For example, the order is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

278
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This is called quark.

279
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Light has an order of 1.

280
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So it is quark.

281
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Electrons have an order of one-half.

282
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So it is quark.

283
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like this.

284
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Sorry.

285
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Go on.

286
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's right.

287
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yes.

288
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Is it OK?

289
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes.

290
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
OK.

291
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So the spin-chain discussed later is related to quark.

292
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is it an order or a half-order?

293
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is a big deal.

294
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
These are two very different types.

295
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Before talking about these orders,

296
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
what is symmetry?

297
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
What is asymmetry?

298
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
What is asymmetry?

299
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Asymmetry means that after you have done a certain operation, the result does not change.

300
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
For example, as I just said,

301
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
parallel symmetry, rotation symmetry, mirror symmetry, time parallel, time inverse,

302
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
any kind of operation.

303
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Can you see me now?

304
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes.

305
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
For example, I take this.

306
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:42,000
If you don't look at the pattern on this ball,

307
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
if they are all the same color,

308
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I just turn 360 degrees like this.

309
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll cover it up first.

310
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Then I'll turn a little bit.

311
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Then I'll show you.

312
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Then you don't know.

313
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You will never be able to tell if I'm turning or not.

314
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Right?

315
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So it means that this ball has the symmetry of this rotation.

316
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
There is already a pattern on it.

317
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Of course, this pattern will destroy its rotation.

318
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Because if I turn like this, you will recognize this pattern.

319
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You know I have turned.

320
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But if this is all blue,

321
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I can turn this three-dimensional corner.

322
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
This is a rotation symmetry.

323
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
What about this apple?

324
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
This apple, you have an imagination first.

325
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
There is a meme here.

326
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And then, here,

327
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So if I turn like this,

328
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Then you will find that it is different.

329
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But if I turn like this along this axis,

330
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Assuming its shape is perfect.

331
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Then you will see that it also has this rotation symmetry.

332
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But this rotation symmetry

333
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Only with this Z axis as the rotation axis

334
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You have this symmetry.

335
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I can turn like this.

336
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I can also turn like this.

337
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I can also turn like this.

338
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I can also turn like this.

339
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The symmetry of this apple is less than the symmetry of this ball.

340
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because it only rotates like this.

341
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
This ball can rotate in any way.

342
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
If so, you will see that this and this ring

343
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I made a ring.

344
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
This ring is the same.

345
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I turn like this, the result is unchanged.

346
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
What about this bagel?

347
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
If I turn like this,

348
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You will not know that I have turned.

349
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Of course, if this is the case,

350
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
If I put a sticker on it,

351
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Do you know that I have turned?

352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
For example, I'm hungry now.

353
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm hungry, I take a bite.

354
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Now after being bitten by me

355
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It has lost the symmetry of this rotation.

356
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
This is also the same.

357
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
This bagel is also the same.

358
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
If I don't bite too big

359
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I take a bite first.

360
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I bought a lot today.

361
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I bite a little bit.

362
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't bite this hole.

363
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Then it has no symmetry of this rotation.

364
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
In other words, what does this bite cause?

365
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Causing a defect

366
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Causing a defect

367
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Defects will affect a lot of things.

368
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
What I'm going to talk about later is Torpo.

369
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Torpo

370
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Let's play a little game first.

371
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I have a ring here.

372
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I have a ring here.

373
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
If I use a pen

374
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Many people should know that

375
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
If I go from here

376
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Then follow this ring

377
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Go around like this

378
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Go around and pick it up.

379
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wait for the paper to turn 360 degrees

380
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll go back to the origin.

381
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
These two are not the same.

382
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
One

383
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I do this too.

384
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I am also back to the origin.

385
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But this is not.

386
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
When this is done

387
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
This ring is very different from these two rings.

388
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This ring is just like this one.

389
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
This ring is just like this one.

390
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
These two rings are very different.

391
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
This ring is just like this one.

392
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This ring is just like this one.

393
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
In fact, the same

394
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I twisted it a little bit.

395
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
In fact, this ring is just like this.

396
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
This ring is like this.

397
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So you see, I just painted black here.

398
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If there is

399
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Usually there is an ant walking up

400
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
After going around

401
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You will return to the original place.

402
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
This ring is like this.

403
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This ring is not

404
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This ring is the so-called Mobius ring.

405
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What if

406
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I have an ant here

407
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Walk like this

408
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Walk like this

409
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Go go go

410
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Go go go

411
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Go around

412
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Go

413
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
After going around

414
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He will

415
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He actually

416
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm going around now.

417
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Go around

418
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
As a result, I ran to this path.

419
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Run to the back of this ring

420
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Not the same as this

421
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
After two laps

422
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Will return to the origin

423
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This is a

424
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
It's completely different from a few boxes.

425
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
This thing

426
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And then go back to the video.

427
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That

428
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
What I just said is symmetrical.

429
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
This is symmetrical.

430
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That

431
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This is symmetrical.

432
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Has been destroyed

433
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
That

434
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
With

435
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What does it have to do with the photo?

436
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Because we know

437
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Is

438
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Ah

439
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
If you

440
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
If

441
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Ah

442
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You have one

443
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Energy or free energy

444
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
He

445
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
If he is a certain parameter

446
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
If the function

447
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Then you basically free energy should be like

448
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Energy is like the lower the better

449
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Will be stable

450
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
If your

451
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
At first your function is like this

452
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So

453
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If you have a ball here

454
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
He is of course symmetrical

455
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Because of this symmetry

456
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Symmetry is of course

457
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Is the lowest point of energy

458
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But if your external parameters

459
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Change

460
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
For example, your temperature

461
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Temperature changes

462
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Temperature

463
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Low temperature

464
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Your temperature is getting lower and lower

465
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That causes this function to change

466
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The lowest energy state at this time

467
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Not in this

468
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Symmetrical point

469
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And he might

470
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Will choose to be in

471
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
A certain one

472
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Free energy is lower

473
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That place

474
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Of course, every place

475
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This place or this place

476
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Free energy

477
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Energy is the same

478
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Then he has to choose

479
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
On the left or on the right

480
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know

481
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
He might be him

482
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
He might

483
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
He

484
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He has a little bit

485
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Direction

486
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
A little bit to the left or a little bit to the right

487
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
When

488
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
He is very natural

489
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
He will run to this soon

490
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
To a stable place

491
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's like this place

492
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
In this case

493
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You will find that he is not symmetrical

494
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Originally

495
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Originally

496
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It was left and right

497
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This has a

498
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Symmetrical

499
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That's not symmetrical now

500
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
That's not symmetrical

501
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
It means

502
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There is a order

503
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Happened

504
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That's what happened

505
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's a certain

506
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
An image is produced

507
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
For example, just now

508
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We just saw that

509
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The experiment of the distance temperature

510
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That burning red iron

511
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
No magnetic

512
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Burning red iron

513
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
His

514
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
The magnetic field is messy

515
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That

516
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
When it's messy

517
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Magnetic field

518
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Although he has a magnetic field in every place

519
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He has a lot of this

520
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That order or

521
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Magnetic field

522
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
For example, this magnetic field

523
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That

524
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But the temperature is very high

525
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
He has a magnetic field

526
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
All

527
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Keep doing this

528
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Just keep doing it

529
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Ah

530
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
In the disturbance

531
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
In the transformation

532
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That causes the whole

533
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You look

534
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That moment looks very messy

535
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That magnetic field looks messy

536
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And positive magnetic field and negative magnetic field

537
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Positive and negative, but in different directions

538
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The whole

539
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Put this whole magnetic field

540
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
All offset

541
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's messy

542
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
That messy

543
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
How do you say he is symmetrical?

544
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Just when you have this magnetic field

545
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
When the magnetic field is very messy

546
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You you

547
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Rotate him

548
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You do a certain area to balance

549
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You have a camera

550
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You you you this camera

551
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Observe and then you balance this camera

552
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Then you find that he is still messy

553
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Just as messy as just now

554
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You can't see what it is

555
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You can't tell

556
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Do you have a rotation

557
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I did not

558
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I did a balance or did a rotation

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You can't tell

560
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and so

561
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
He

562
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
In the video just now

563
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
This red iron

564
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
What is the symmetry

565
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Just have

566
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Balance symmetry

567
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Also have

568
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Rotational symmetry

569
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But what happens when the temperature drops?

570
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Because of the magnetic field and the magnetic field

571
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
His interaction

572
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's more

573
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
More strong

574
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
More obvious

575
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
What about the thermal disturbance?

576
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Not enough for him

577
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Let him mess up

578
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So he will be the whole

579
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Causing the overall magnetic field to lean towards one

580
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
One direction

581
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
At this time if everyone

582
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
When everyone is leaning in the same direction

583
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
At this time you will find

584
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I no longer have

585
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
This rotation symmetry

586
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Is my rotation symmetry

587
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Just

588
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I rotate

589
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That direction just now

590
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It was all pointing up

591
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Everyone is pointing up

592
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Then I rotate everyone

593
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Changed direction

594
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You will find that he has changed

595
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That's not symmetrical

596
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
That's called

597
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Automatic symmetry

598
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Symmetry

599
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Symmetry is that he has a sequence

600
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Then you say that he is

601
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Change

602
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
This is us

603
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The most traditional

604
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Ah

605
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
For matter

606
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The most

607
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
The most

608
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ah

609
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
One

610
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
This is the theory of the blue path

611
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It should be

612
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
We have one

613
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Just

614
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
There is one

615
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
This sequence

616
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
What about this sequence

617
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
What if he has it

618
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
He just has a sequence

619
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
That means he happened

620
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
A change

621
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But like just now

622
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Excuse me

623
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Ah

624
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Sorry

625
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
OK

626
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
OK

627
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That

628
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That

629
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Some things are not like this

630
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Just

631
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Ah

632
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Um

633
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Wait a minute

634
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Will continue to talk

635
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That

636
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Later found

637
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
There is a change

638
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Ah

639
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The earliest

640
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
A Russian

641
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
He found out

642
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He is a model

643
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
That later

644
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Because he published

645
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
This story is probably like this

646
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The article he published is

647
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Written in Russian and then

648
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Earlier than Kostelis and Solis

649
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That later

650
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
No one knows that later Kostelis and Solis

651
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They also counted

652
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
One thing and then found out

653
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Ah

654
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
There is actually a change

655
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But this model

656
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
He did not happen

657
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They do

658
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
This model is like this

659
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I just said that one by one

660
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Right?

661
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Each arrow is a word

662
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That seems to be here

663
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
One of this amount

664
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
This amount is

665
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's not like that

666
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's just an amount

667
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That is

668
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It is

669
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I will talk about the amount later

670
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Here

671
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
This amount is

672
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
There is an xy amount

673
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You are on the plane

674
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Then there is an xy amount

675
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Then you are on this

676
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Every one on this scale

677
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
In this square

678
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Square lattice

679
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Each one has a

680
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
The corresponding amount

681
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
All

682
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Do it

683
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Just write a built-in interaction

684
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That

685
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Look at this model

686
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
He did not

687
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Destroy

688
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Rotational symmetry because

689
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I just put it

690
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I am in this

691
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Z axis

692
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
For

693
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
If you turn, I just rotate

694
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
How many degrees

695
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
0 to 2æ

696
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
0 to 360 degrees

697
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I just turn a little bit

698
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Or turn a lot

699
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Just turn a few degrees

700
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Any angle

701
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
This model

702
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This energy is unchanged

703
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This does not change

704
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So he has this

705
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Continuous

706
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
This rotation symmetry

707
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
There was a theorem before

708
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
This theorem is called Mermin-Wagon theorem

709
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
If you only have

710
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Corresponding interaction

711
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Then yours

712
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
If you have continuous symmetry

713
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Continuous symmetry

714
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That

715
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Below 2

716
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Continuous symmetry

717
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Will not occur

718
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This is

719
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
This is his mathematical theorem

720
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But

721
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
They found

722
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Even if there is no

723
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Continuous symmetry

724
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It will not occur

725
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Does not mean

726
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It will not change

727
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And this change

728
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Just

729
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
This kind of change

730
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Later we

731
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's called KT Transition

732
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Or BKT Transition

733
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
How is he

734
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
At high temperature

735
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Because it will not occur

736
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Will not occur

737
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
So

738
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
As long as you have a limit

739
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
He will not

740
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Not that continuous

741
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
For example, you

742
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
This energy is written like this

743
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There is a symbol in front

744
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If j is j is positive

745
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
That

746
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
If you have these two quantities

747
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
How to

748
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Internal

749
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Will

750
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The answer will be lower

751
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Internal is

752
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Did you learn in high school?

753
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Is

754
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
The length of this quantity

755
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Multiply by the length of another quantity

756
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Multiply

757
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Cos theta

758
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
If cos theta is

759
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
If theta is 0

760
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Cos is 1

761
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
If theta is 90 degrees

762
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Positive

763
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That this

764
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Cos is 0

765
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So

766
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
There is a symbol in front

767
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So if the energy is relatively low

768
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Of course every quantity

769
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It's best to

770
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The same

771
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
What if the opposite

772
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
You have the highest energy

773
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The same energy is the lowest

774
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That

775
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So

776
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But if the temperature is 0

777
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That is

778
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It is in

779
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Ground state

780
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The lowest state of energy

781
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Of course it is

782
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But as long as you have a little

783
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Temperature as long as there is a little

784
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Temperature

785
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It won't be

786
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It won't be

787
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
All in the same direction

788
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It is absolutely

789
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Is not

790
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No

791
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Symmetry

792
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Symmetry

793
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That

794
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
No symmetry

795
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But there is a change

796
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What is the situation

797
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That is

798
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
High temperature

799
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That is

800
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
A little

801
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
When there is a little temperature

802
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That

803
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
These will not

804
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
These

805
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
These quantities will not be the same

806
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That won't be the same

807
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That can only be formed

808
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Some called vortex

809
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Is some whirlpool

810
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That way

811
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
At a very high temperature

812
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What about these vortex

813
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No matter what temperature

814
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
These vortex

815
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Because you have to

816
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You must be

817
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You have a vortex

818
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Is

819
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Turn like this

820
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That

821
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
In fact, this

822
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Let's make an example

823
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Is that you have a

824
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
This vortex

825
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
There is another

826
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Reverse vortex

827
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That this

828
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The positive vortex and the reverse vortex

829
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
At low temperature

830
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Is two

831
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Tied together

832
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Is paired together

833
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's like this ship

834
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Two ships are actually tied together

835
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But if it's at high temperature

836
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
This one by one

837
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Is every

838
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Every vortex is free

839
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
This

840
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This quantity

841
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Main configuration

842
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Run around

843
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That way

844
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
This kind of change

845
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's called

846
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
KT transition

847
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It does not destroy any

848
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So there is no contradiction

849
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Sorry

850
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Is there a question?

851
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That is

852
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I remember when I was learning xy model

853
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He said he was different

854
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
One is

855
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
One is

856
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
How to put that thing

857
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Connected to you

858
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
That

859
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Um

860
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Um

861
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That is to say

862
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Um

863
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Um

864
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Um

865
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Um

866
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Correlation

867
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Because

868
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
First of all

869
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
First of all

870
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
If there is no order

871
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Its correlation length must be

872
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Decay to zero

873
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But

874
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But the way to decay to zero

875
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
There are actually two

876
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
One is

877
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Decay to zero very quickly

878
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
The other one is

879
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Is

880
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It's slow

881
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Outflow decay

882
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Um

883
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Um

884
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I think I think this may be

885
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Carefully pushed down to see

886
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Its connection here

887
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I don't think I can do it directly

888
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
In a very intuitive way

889
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
To see

890
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
This configuration

891
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Uh in this place

892
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Is exponential decay

893
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
The other place is power load decay

894
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Um

895
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
If you have this feature

896
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Type pair of voltage

897
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You have to use math to show

898
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
For example, the amount of matter on the left and the right is different

899
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Represents two phases

900
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Is there anything like

901
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Other parameters

902
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
For example

903
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
The method of decay is different

904
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Two different phases

905
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
This place

906
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Because you don't have

907
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
That kind

908
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Order parameter

909
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Um

910
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Um

911
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
My question is

912
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Can you define something

913
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
For example, the left phase is zero

914
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
The right phase is one

915
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So they are different

916
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That's the order parameter

917
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But here

918
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Um

919
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Here you can only count its

920
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Here you should count its

921
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Some decay

922
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Um

923
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
This may

924
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I have to look again to answer you

925
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Ok thank you

926
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
No problem

927
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
You go ahead

928
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I have to review this

929
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Um

930
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
That

931
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Of course he should be able to

932
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Calculate one

933
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Is the so-called

934
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Unchanged

935
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
For example, this is

936
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I forgot what the number is

937
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Or what

938
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
This is the phase

939
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Uh, as far as I know

940
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
The number is

941
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
There is such a

942
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Decay

943
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's a

944
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It's a

945
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It will correspond to

946
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It's the quantity or the effect

947
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Different

948
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That

949
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm just curious about that

950
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Is there anything like this

951
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It's math

952
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You can tell me very clearly

953
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I don't understand this

954
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I remember there is

955
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
But not

956
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Because here is only

957
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
All are

958
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Spin system

959
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Then you go ahead

960
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I will also study it later, thank you

961
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I may

962
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I can check it later

963
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Tell you

964
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That

965
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Just here

966
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Talked about

967
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Uh

968
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Different

969
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
A few boxes and wrong

970
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Different

971
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
If it's a few boxes

972
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Uh

973
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You will find

974
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
After a bite of apple

975
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
That his

976
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
His symmetry

977
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Already

978
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's gone

979
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
His geometric shape has changed

980
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But

981
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
His

982
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Uh

983
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
What about the characteristics

984
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Is unchanged

985
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That's the same as this bagel

986
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Uh

987
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
There is a hole

988
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
As long as

989
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So this

990
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
What about this hole

991
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
If you keep it

992
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Like I just said

993
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Inside the equation

994
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
If that

995
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Your conductance

996
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
With the one you calculated

997
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Torpo

998
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That amount

999
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
If it can correspond to

1000
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
How many holes are you here

1001
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
If there is a hole, two holes, three holes

1002
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Will correspond to you

1003
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Conductance is

1004
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
There is a change in the whole number

1005
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Of course I can't find it

1006
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Two holes

1007
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
If you find this

1008
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
There are many holes in the answer

1009
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
That's it

1010
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Um

1011
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Um

1012
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Um

1013
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Um

1014
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Um

1015
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Okay, I just said

1016
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I think

1017
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Maybe not very good

1018
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Um

1019
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
What I'm going to talk about is

1020
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The anti-iron

1021
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Uh

1022
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Eisenberg model

1023
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
First of all, these equations

1024
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Uh

1025
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
The XY model just now

1026
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Is

1027
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Only

1028
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Which amount

1029
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Only x and y

1030
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And between this amount

1031
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It's just a number

1032
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That now

1033
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
This

1034
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What about the amount of this equation

1035
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's not just a number

1036
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
What about them

1037
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Can't be exchanged

1038
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What about ax and y

1039
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
For example, there is this

1040
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Is

1041
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
xy

1042
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
minus yx

1043
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Will equal

1044
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Is z

1045
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
In this case, this is a

1046
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
The model of quantum mechanics

1047
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That

1048
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
His

1049
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
This side

1050
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Is

1051
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
If the inner machine is also

1052
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
x times x

1053
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
y times y z times z

1054
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
What about this model

1055
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
This if x is equal to

1056
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
One-half

1057
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You can use

1058
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
A mathematical technique called beta ansatz

1059
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Solve it

1060
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
After that

1061
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Of course

1062
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
There is another

1063
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
This mathematical theorem

1064
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Is

1065
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Three people

1066
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That lsm

1067
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Three people's theorem

1068
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
What about this theorem

1069
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
He is using

1070
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Uh

1071
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You define one first

1072
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Another operator

1073
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Then put it in

1074
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Ground state

1075
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Then found

1076
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
He and the original

1077
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Ground state is positive

1078
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Then found

1079
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
This positive state

1080
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So this positive state

1081
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Uh

1082
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
With ground state is positive

1083
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And his energy

1084
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
To

1085
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
When thermodynamics is limited

1086
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
When n is equal to infinity

1087
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
He and ground state

1088
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The energy is

1089
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The difference is equal to zero

1090
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
For example

1091
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Of course here

1092
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Calculate directly with numerical

1093
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Ground state

1094
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
This is the size

1095
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That size

1096
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
What about this

1097
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Is

1098
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
To find his

1099
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Is his

1100
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Parity is equal to

1101
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Positive or negative

1102
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Excited state

1103
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Then these two

1104
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
To thermodynamics

1105
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Why do I say

1106
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Because there are some

1107
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Sometimes

1108
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
When n is equal to

1109
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
If n is equal to 4 times

1110
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That

1111
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
10 is p

1112
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Equal to positive 1

1113
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That excited state is negative 1

1114
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But if

1115
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
n is equal to

1116
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Is

1117
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Two

1118
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
2 times

1119
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But not 4 times

1120
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That is the opposite

1121
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
In short, there is a positive here

1122
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
One is negative

1123
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
One of the two is ground state

1124
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
One is excited state

1125
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's the end

1126
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
When thermodynamics is limited

1127
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
He will focus on this

1128
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This is just

1129
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That solution

1130
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That is to say

1131
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
This theorem tells you

1132
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
As long as you are

1133
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The number of times

1134
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
These are the number of times

1135
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Is the number of times

1136
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Then he has no energy

1137
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That's how it works

1138
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That but

1139
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That

1140
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Correlation

1141
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Correlation is the power of decay

1142
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
That guess

1143
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
That is to say

1144
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
The number of times

1145
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
There is a gap in the system

1146
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
The number of times is different

1147
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And correlation

1148
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Correlation is exponential decay

1149
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You can define

1150
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
One

1151
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The length of the connection

1152
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
that

1153
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
What we know now

1154
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It is said

1155
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
This equation equals to 1

1156
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
What kind of nature does it have?

1157
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
There is another model

1158
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Is spin equal to 1

1159
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
But you add this

1160
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
After adding this

1161
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You S equals 1

1162
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
This model becomes

1163
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Strictly solvable

1164
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Strictly solvable

1165
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
After you solve it, you will find that its ground state

1166
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It looks like this

1167
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
This big circle

1168
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Is a spin 1 thing

1169
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
The two dots in it

1170
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Is two

1171
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You look at it

1172
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
This spin 1 is actually two

1173
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
One-half spin

1174
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
One-half spin

1175
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It can be one-half positive and one-half negative

1176
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So here it can be

1177
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Here it can be

1178
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
One-half positive and one-half negative

1179
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Here it can be one-half positive and one-half negative

1180
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So there are a total of four possibilities

1181
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
These four possibilities

1182
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But spin 1, it has

1183
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
1, 0, negative 1, 3

1184
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Three possibilities

1185
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You find that

1186
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Two spins

1187
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
One-half

1188
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Plus one-half

1189
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
One-half

1190
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Is a spin 0 thing

1191
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
That type

1192
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Is called

1193
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Singlet

1194
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The other three

1195
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Is spin equal to 1

1196
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
That triplet

1197
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
This circle is

1198
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
This big circle is

1199
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
These two spins

1200
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
One-half

1201
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Translated into a

1202
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Spin triplet type

1203
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
That

1204
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The blue stick is

1205
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
This spin and the other spin

1206
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Form

1207
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Singlet

1208
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That way

1209
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
After all this

1210
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
If you are

1211
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
This is the Open Boundary Condition

1212
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
You find the most

1213
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
One-half spin

1214
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
He has no one

1215
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Can match him

1216
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So it will become a

1217
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Free

1218
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
This

1219
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
This state is out

1220
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
You can see it here

1221
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
He has one

1222
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Is the boundary

1223
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
In this case, it will cause this side

1224
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
This side can also

1225
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Up

1226
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Then you can also

1227
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
The whole thing is

1228
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But

1229
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
If you are

1230
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
If you make a circle

1231
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
With this spin

1232
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It will form Singlet again

1233
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
The whole ground state is unique

1234
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
There is no boundary

1235
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
But if OBC, it is

1236
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Four-layer boundary

1237
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
such

1238
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Um

1239
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
What if you are

1240
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
PBC

1241
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You can still calculate

1242
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Another thing

1243
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
You put

1244
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
A circle

1245
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
A circle and then

1246
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Cut into two sides

1247
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
One side is called A

1248
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
The other side is called B

1249
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Then you

1250
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You put this ground state

1251
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Trace off the B part

1252
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Calculate his

1253
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Reduce Density Matrix

1254
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
This Reduce Density Matrix

1255
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Assume it

1256
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
If he is

1257
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
One

1258
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Uh

1259
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Just like

1260
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Density Matrix

1261
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
There is a temperature

1262
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You have one

1263
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Your Density Matrix should be exponential

1264
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Negative beta

1265
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
H

1266
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But you

1267
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
This H is not

1268
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
A part

1269
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
A part of Hamiltonian

1270
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That

1271
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
This H does not know what

1272
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
A part of Hamiltonian

1273
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Generally speaking, you will not just

1274
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
After you finish

1275
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
This is just the A part of Hamiltonian

1276
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So

1277
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The temperature in front

1278
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Beta is meaningless

1279
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Then put this

1280
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
The temperature in front is absorbed

1281
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Absorbed into this Hamiltonian

1282
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Then put this Hamiltonian

1283
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Intangible Hamiltonian

1284
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
What about this Hamiltonian

1285
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
His

1286
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Eigenvalue

1287
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
That is

1288
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That is

1289
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
This is called Intangible

1290
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Spectrum

1291
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Omega i is

1292
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
If the Eigenvalue of rho a

1293
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Then you put it on both sides

1294
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
If you take the log, you will find

1295
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I want to know

1296
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
This Intangible Hamiltonian

1297
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Spectrum

1298
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That is

1299
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Do it like this

1300
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Then

1301
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You can find out

1302
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Because you did this trace

1303
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So if you are a circle

1304
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
If a ring

1305
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You will have two

1306
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You will have two edges

1307
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Two edges

1308
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Two edges

1309
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Is a

1310
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Your density matrix

1311
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Can be written as

1312
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
This kind of product way

1313
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
This kind of product way

1314
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
No matter what rho 0 is

1315
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Then your

1316
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Omega i

1317
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Must be

1318
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
This must be

1319
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
But if

1320
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
If you are

1321
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
What is used

1322
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Infinite chain

1323
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
You don't care about this boundary

1324
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Very far away

1325
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Then

1326
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Then you cut it in the middle

1327
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Then go here

1328
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Then you will find

1329
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
At least every word

1330
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Because you only cut one

1331
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Boundary

1332
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
If

1333
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
The first is another parameter

1334
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Will talk later

1335
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
If

1336
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
AKLT

1337
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
1 out of 3

1338
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
If you make it a parameter

1339
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Then

1340
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
If you make it smaller

1341
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You will find this ground state

1342
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Will be

1343
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Adiabatic

1344
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Will connect

1345
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
To this

1346
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Heisenberg model

1347
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Heisenberg

1348
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Model

1349
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Is probably

1350
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
This kind of

1351
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Configuration

1352
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Then

1353
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Intangible

1354
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Because you have edge state

1355
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So in

1356
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Holden phase

1357
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
If you cut an edge

1358
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
You are

1359
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
If you are

1360
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Periodic boundary condition

1361
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Then you will have

1362
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Four edges

1363
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
If you are in this place

1364
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You didn't add

1365
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Symmetry

1366
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Z2Z this is

1367
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
This is

1368
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The face of the antithesis

1369
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That this is

1370
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You are the same

1371
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
There is no here

1372
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
There is no O, there is no O here

1373
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Here

1374
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Of course there is O

1375
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Here and here

1376
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
No O

1377
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
There is no symmetry

1378
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Destroy any symmetry

1379
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
But

1380
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But you can see here

1381
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Here you can have

1382
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Intangible spectrum

1383
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
At least two-fold

1384
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Here

1385
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
There is no need to

1386
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Two-fold

1387
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
There is no

1388
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
This is a coincidence

1389
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
There will be a

1390
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But at least there is no

1391
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
That this

1392
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Can be regarded as

1393
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
He is

1394
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Topological face

1395
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
One

1396
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
One possibility

1397
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
One possibility

1398
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
One possibility

1399
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Probably like this

1400
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That

1401
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
That

1402
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That

1403
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That

1404
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
That

1405
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
That

1406
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
That

1407
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That

1408
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
That

1409
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
That

1410
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
If you want to use

1411
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Intangible spectrum

1412
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Is it here

1413
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
He has a topological

1414
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
If the face

1415
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That is also a problem

1416
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Because we don't know yet

1417
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
How to define

1418
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Intangible

1419
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
That

1420
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Maybe i'm

1421
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
After that, I'll take a look

1422
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That

1423
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Turn the book over again

1424
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
That

1425
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Of course

1426
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Everyone knows that he took the Nobel Prize

1427
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
He

1428
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Nobel Prize

1429
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Of course, Hoden and Kosterlitz

1430
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
With Solace

1431
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
The three of them got the Nobel Prize together

1432
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That they

1433
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Nobel official

1434
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Give them everyone

1435
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
There is a certificate like this

1436
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
That

1437
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Everyone's picture is different

1438
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Hoden's picture

1439
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Of course, Hoden has another contribution

1440
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Hoden's picture is a

1441
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
This circle

1442
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
This circle

1443
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
This circle

1444
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
This is a spin

1445
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That this stick

1446
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
This stick is

1447
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
A single

1448
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That

1449
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
One like this

1450
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
That aklt

1451
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
One aklt

1452
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
That

1453
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Material

1454
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Uh

1455
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
But Hoden

1456
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Hoden's idea

1457
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
After that

1458
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
That

1459
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Soon that

1460
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Experiment

1461
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
The material is made

1462
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Of course the material is three-dimensional

1463
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But this

1464
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Is that

1465
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It is spin one

1466
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Particle

1467
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
The one next to it is green

1468
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Green particles

1469
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Green words like spin two

1470
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Green words are a

1471
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
A

1472
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
That

1473
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Through this green

1474
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
For example, like spin two

1475
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
This is a spin two

1476
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
This particle

1477
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
That through the middle of this green

1478
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
He

1479
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
His interaction will be through

1480
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Through this green

1481
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
To reach

1482
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That

1483
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Super exchange

1484
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
He might jump in the middle

1485
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Then jump over here

1486
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Then jump back

1487
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That will become

1488
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Like this Hamiltonian

1489
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Like this material

1490
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
This

1491
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Along this c axis

1492
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Is a circle

1493
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
This is also a circle

1494
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So there are a total of four here

1495
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Four circles

1496
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Inside the circle

1497
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Through this green

1498
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
To reach this interaction

1499
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
To reach this super exchange

1500
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Interaction

1501
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
What about the different circles?

1502
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
This one to this one

1503
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
He's going to

1504
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
If you want to form this interaction

1505
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
He

1506
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
At least

1507
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Through the middle of two

1508
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Green

1509
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
To reach this interaction

1510
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
In this case, it means

1511
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Say this J

1512
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
The size of this J

1513
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
This in the circle

1514
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
The size will be much smaller

1515
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Much smaller

1516
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Much smaller

1517
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
As if he did not

1518
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
What about the first word?

1519
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Is called single ion

1520
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Anisotropy

1521
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
This one

1522
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Here

1523
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Basically this one

1524
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
If it's not too big

1525
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
What about this circle?

1526
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Can be regarded as

1527
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Spin one

1528
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
This material is regarded as

1529
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Then later

1530
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
A lot of materials

1531
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Found and did

1532
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Anisotropy

1533
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Then

1534
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It proves that Houghton's guess is right

1535
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Spin two

1536
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
But less

1537
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Then

1538
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
For example, this material

1539
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Should

1540
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
This should still be because

1541
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
It may be difficult to make

1542
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Now

1543
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
There should still be people doing it

1544
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
There seems to be some

1545
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Dispute

1546
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But usually

1547
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
This one

1548
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Is in the material

1549
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Will have

1550
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
The main thing is this single ion

1551
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Anisotropy is like this

1552
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
This is a low orbit

1553
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Five orbits

1554
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
What about the low orbit?

1555
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
dSyS square

1556
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Y square

1557
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
dZ square

1558
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
dSyDyz

1559
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
dDyz

1560
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What about the top here?

1561
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
This side is

1562
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You

1563
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
At this top

1564
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Originally should be

1565
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Have that

1566
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Other

1567
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Other orbit

1568
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Other electrons

1569
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Put these

1570
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Are regarded as a dot

1571
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
If

1572
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
If there are no such dots

1573
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
These five orbits are

1574
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
The energy is the same

1575
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Is the same

1576
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But now you put this top

1577
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
After putting it up

1578
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Then you will find this energy

1579
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
There are two types

1580
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
One type of EG

1581
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Is these three

1582
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
These two

1583
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
The energy is the same

1584
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
These three

1585
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
These three

1586
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
The energy is the same

1587
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Because you see

1588
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The distance is the same

1589
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Just

1590
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Just rotate the angle a little

1591
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
These three energies are the same

1592
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
These three T2G energy are the same

1593
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
These two are the same

1594
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
What if

1595
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You

1596
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
These two above

1597
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You are also in the middle

1598
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Up and down

1599
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Extend or shorten

1600
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Extend and shorten

1601
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You

1602
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
This one

1603
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
This one and this energy

1604
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Will be divided

1605
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It's different

1606
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
This one

1607
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
With

1608
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
These two

1609
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
The energy will be different

1610
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
These two

1611
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
These two energies are still the same

1612
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
If it is up and down

1613
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
This one is different from these two

1614
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So

1615
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
EG will be divided here

1616
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Assuming

1617
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Then these three

1618
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Will be divided

1619
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
These two are the same

1620
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Then dxy

1621
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The energy is divided

1622
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
These two are still short

1623
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
How to

1624
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Let these two not be short

1625
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Is

1626
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
This one

1627
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
This one in the middle

1628
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
This one

1629
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
This one with color

1630
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
This is a square

1631
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
This was originally a square

1632
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
If this square

1633
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You

1634
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You

1635
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Because of some reasons

1636
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Become

1637
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Square or not square

1638
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Then you will further cause

1639
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
These two

1640
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
The energy is divided

1641
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Sorry

1642
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Wait a minute

1643
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Our recording may be

1644
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
End in about ten minutes

1645
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
How many videos do you have

1646
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Almost

1647
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Okay

1648
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Control

1649
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
In the back

1650
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Some new results

1651
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Let's talk about the results first

1652
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
We may not understand the results

1653
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I don't understand

1654
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Actually

1655
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I am still

1656
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Introduction

1657
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Introduce some

1658
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Because I think this is

1659
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Very popular recently

1660
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Not so many people understand

1661
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I think the introduction is very interesting

1662
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
That

1663
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Let everyone know

1664
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I think we have to talk very well

1665
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Some of the previous questions

1666
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I don't understand

1667
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I understand part of it

1668
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Correct

1669
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I understand that I have done it myself

1670
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
This part

1671
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
That

1672
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Then I will speak faster here

1673
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
If you are here

1674
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
What about this distortion

1675
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
This is

1676
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Spin orbital coupling

1677
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
You will become

1678
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Similar

1679
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It will become like this

1680
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Like this

1681
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
That way ax and ay az

1682
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Three parameters

1683
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
These three parameters are with you

1684
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
The size of these three parameters will be with you

1685
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
How to split here

1686
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Will be related

1687
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
What about these three

1688
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
There are actually three parameters

1689
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
In fact, there are only two parameters

1690
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
If it is a square

1691
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It is equal to s times s plus 1

1692
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
That is

1693
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You can push it down

1694
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
This ha can finally be written

1695
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Like this

1696
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
This is a parameter

1697
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
This is also a parameter

1698
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
s times s plus 1

1699
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
s equals 1

1700
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
s equals 1, then 1 times 1 plus 1 equals 2

1701
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So this is a parameter

1702
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Only this sz square

1703
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
With ss square minus sy square

1704
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So this parameter has only two parameters

1705
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
If you throw away those parameters

1706
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That single isomers

1707
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
That you are the source of this parameter

1708
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
You just follow you

1709
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Up and down here

1710
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
If there is distortion

1711
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Then you will

1712
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
If you are all

1713
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Then you will have this d

1714
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
If you are all

1715
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Isotropic

1716
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Then you are here

1717
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
There is no d and 1

1718
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
If you have this square

1719
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Becomes a rectangle or a ring

1720
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
You will have this 1

1721
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
That's it

1722
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
So my previous work

1723
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The previous work is

1724
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Go

1725
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Use the numerical method

1726
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Such

1727
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Face diagram

1728
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
To calculate his face diagram

1729
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Then go to see his

1730
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
The nature of one state

1731
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
The first is s

1732
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
s equals 1

1733
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
This

1734
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
In the early

1735
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Someone has done it

1736
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Then I also

1737
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Teacher Yang

1738
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Some questions

1739
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Then put this place

1740
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
This place is

1741
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
The middle is the face

1742
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
From here to the face

1743
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Nothing happens

1744
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Symmetry

1745
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Symmetry is not broken

1746
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That is to say this whole

1747
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Are all

1748
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That if

1749
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You are here

1750
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
The earliest

1751
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
The earliest classification of the face

1752
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
You put that free energy

1753
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
For external parameters

1754
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
If the division is not continuous

1755
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You are the face

1756
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
If the division is not continuous

1757
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That is the face

1758
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Then later

1759
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
After the symmetry theorem

1760
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
You have those old parameters

1761
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
You divide it into

1762
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
You if

1763
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Your old parameters

1764
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Continuous

1765
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Is not continuous

1766
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
That is not continuous

1767
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Then he is a face

1768
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
If the old parameters are continuous

1769
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Then he is called continuous face

1770
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Then he belongs to the second stage

1771
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
The above face

1772
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Is called continuous face

1773
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Or some people say

1774
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
These are called the second stage face

1775
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But if you want to subdivide

1776
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Still can

1777
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
At zero temperature

1778
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You divide the ground state

1779
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Then you see him

1780
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
A few times

1781
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That

1782
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
This one

1783
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
What if

1784
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
You go to see the first one

1785
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
These two parameters

1786
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Let me talk about this face diagram first

1787
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
This face diagram

1788
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
From this red dot

1789
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
From here to here

1790
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
This red arrow

1791
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Because there is no

1792
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Any

1793
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Symmetry

1794
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Because if it is

1795
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
If it is

1796
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
The value of SZ can be

1797
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
10-1

1798
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
That 10-1

1799
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
His square will become

1800
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
10-1

1801
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
So if D is very big

1802
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
You don't look at the other lines

1803
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That is very big

1804
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
That

1805
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
If the energy wants to be lower

1806
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
That must be SZ equal to zero

1807
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So it becomes

1808
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
This large

1809
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
The limit of D becomes

1810
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
SZ equal to

1811
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Zero

1812
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
That SZ is equal to zero

1813
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Of course there is no

1814
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
No order

1815
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Because you have to see

1816
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
All of you

1817
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
All of you

1818
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
SZ you can't measure

1819
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
You don't have magnetization

1820
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That red dot is not here

1821
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So I

1822
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Actually I didn't say

1823
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I didn't say

1824
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
He actually has a string order

1825
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That you put these materials

1826
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Go find people to do experiments

1827
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
This material

1828
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
It will be very close to here

1829
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It still falls

1830
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Very close to this critical point

1831
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
That critical point

1832
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
What if you have a little bit

1833
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
You will enter another phase

1834
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
That these two phases

1835
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I haven't found it before

1836
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
So we think

1837
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
If it is on this material

1838
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Add a little

1839
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Distortion

1840
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
That is very likely to let

1841
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Enter

1842
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Not enter large

1843
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
But enter

1844
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Y-face or X-face

1845
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
That's it

1846
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Intangible spectrum

1847
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Also said

1848
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Here is

1849
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Self-reduction

1850
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
First of all, here we do

1851
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
A periodic boundary condition

1852
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Just one

1853
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
A closed ring

1854
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
What about this ring

1855
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
This is the energy

1856
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
The energy of the ground state is at the bottom

1857
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Then

1858
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
The energy of the excited state

1859
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
According to your different quantum number

1860
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Divided out

1861
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Of course this paragraph

1862
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Is the magnetization gap

1863
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Then when you add 1

1864
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
This gap

1865
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But here

1866
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Not

1867
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
But there is

1868
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Another kind of gap

1869
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
What about this gap

1870
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
So this place is the ground state

1871
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But it still has a gap

1872
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
If you go here

1873
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
He just

1874
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
There is no reduction

1875
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It becomes

1876
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Sx equals 0

1877
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Product state

1878
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Not Sz equals 0

1879
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Sx equals 0

1880
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Intangible spectrum

1881
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
You will see

1882
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Indeed in this place

1883
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
There are four points here

1884
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
This red

1885
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Then black triangle

1886
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Then black cross green

1887
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
This is a quadruple reduction

1888
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
This is a quadruple reduction

1889
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Here is a symmetry breaking phase

1890
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It is a quadruple reduction

1891
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
The origin of the quadruple reduction is because

1892
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
This ground state is double

1893
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
The ground state itself is double degeneracy

1894
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Then you have quantum number

1895
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Then it becomes

1896
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
The ground state you choose

1897
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
The ground state

1898
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Will be with these quantum numbers

1899
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
That means it is

1900
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
A certain

1901
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Add type

1902
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
For example, it's all up down up down

1903
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Or add up up up

1904
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
That's a bit like

1905
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
That Schrodinger's cat type

1906
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Cat state

1907
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Will cause all

1908
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Intangible spectrum

1909
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Quadruple reduction

1910
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
That can be used like this

1911
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Quadruple reduction here

1912
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Quadruple reduction

1913
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
No reduction

1914
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Here is

1915
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Here is Hodian phase

1916
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Here is

1917
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Symmetry breaking phase

1918
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Here is trivial phase

1919
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Hodian phase is

1920
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Symmetry protected

1921
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Topological phase

1922
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I forgot to say here again

1923
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Correlation

1924
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Correlation

1925
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Correlation

1926
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Correlation is a more traditional way

1927
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Look at those order

1928
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I think the focus should be

1929
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Why

1930
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
What is symmetry protected topological phase

1931
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
What is symmetry protected topological phase

1932
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Should be

1933
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I did not put this powerpoint

1934
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
It's okay

1935
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
That is to say

1936
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
That is to say

1937
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
That is to say

1938
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
You this

1939
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
This middle

1940
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
This Hodian

1941
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
If this phase

1942
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
If you

1943
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
If your Hamiltonian

1944
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
You did not add

1945
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Other items

1946
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
If you add an item

1947
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You keep

1948
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
You keep

1949
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Symmetry

1950
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
For example, this Hodian phase

1951
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
It has three symmetries

1952
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
To protect it

1953
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The first is

1954
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Is parity

1955
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Is mirror

1956
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Is reflection

1957
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Is left and right

1958
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Is left and right

1959
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Symmetry

1960
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
The second is time reversal symmetry

1961
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Is time reversal

1962
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
All spin

1963
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
SxSySy

1964
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
SxSySy

1965
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Take the sub-number

1966
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Two sub-numbers

1967
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Both sub-numbers will be removed

1968
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So

1969
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
It has time reversal symmetry

1970
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
The other is more difficult to see

1971
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Is Z2

1972
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Z2 symmetry

1973
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
As long as you add

1974
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Other perturbation

1975
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
If there is no destruction

1976
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
If there are no three destructions

1977
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Then

1978
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Hodian phase will still exist

1979
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
This is still

1980
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Unless your perturbation is strong enough

1981
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It will be destroyed

1982
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Just like you added this

1983
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
D and 1

1984
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
If you add D and 1

1985
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Did not destroy time reversal symmetry

1986
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Did not destroy parity

1987
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Did not destroy

1988
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Z2 symmetry

1989
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
So

1990
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
So

1991
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
When D is big enough

1992
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
There will be a

1993
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
There will be symmetry

1994
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
That

1995
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That

1996
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Correlation skip first

1997
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That

1998
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
This is

1999
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Monumentality

2000
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Is to set

2001
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I take this amount to set

2002
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Critical point

2003
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But

2004
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
What about the critical point just now?

2005
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
If you are AKLT state

2006
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
You can use

2007
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Twisted boundary condition

2008
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
That twisted boundary condition

2009
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
You will let

2010
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
This side

2011
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
This spin

2012
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
This boundary becomes a triplet

2013
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
If you are

2014
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
If you have multiple spin 1

2015
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
If you are in Hodian phase

2016
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
If you are in Hodian phase

2017
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
There will be multiple singlet

2018
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Every singlet

2019
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Your parity is equal to negative 1

2020
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So you have multiple

2021
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It is equal to 1

2022
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
That will be with large D phase

2023
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Can't tell

2024
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
But if you are twisted boundary condition

2025
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
That

2026
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You have multiple spin

2027
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
You will have multiple singlet

2028
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
This is a triplet

2029
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
This triplet is parity equal to 1

2030
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
This triplet is parity equal to negative 1

2031
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So this parity is equal to negative 1

2032
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
This parity is equal to 1

2033
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You can do this level crossing

2034
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Is to put this 1 and negative 1

2035
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Do cross

2036
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
That cross point

2037
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Just take it as your critical point

2038
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Then under the finite size

2039
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
A critical point

2040
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Do finite size scaling

2041
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Finally you will get a very accurate

2042
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Critical critical point

2043
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
That's it

2044
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Of course you can always use

2045
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Spin 2

2046
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Because spin 2

2047
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
In 1992

2048
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Oshikawa

2049
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
He is

2050
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I think it should

2051
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
After you add this D

2052
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
There may be middle

2053
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Middle phase

2054
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Not only from Hodian phase to large D phase

2055
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
First spin 2

2056
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
His Hodian

2057
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
This isotropic

2058
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Heisenberg point

2059
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
This phase is also here

2060
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
This place is very small

2061
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
That means his

2062
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
He is very close to the critical point

2063
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
His correlation length is actually quite long

2064
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
There are about 60

2065
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
In fact, if you put the whole image

2066
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
If you get it out

2067
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
In fact, this Hodian phase

2068
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
With large D

2069
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
This phase is connected

2070
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
That is to say

2071
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Hodian phase

2072
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Trivial phase

2073
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Not

2074
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Topological phase

2075
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
But you can still

2076
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Find one in the middle

2077
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Similar to

2078
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Intermediate D phase of spin 1

2079
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
This is a topological phase

2080
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Because

2081
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
This frame is mapped to spin

2082
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
1

2083
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
This frame is mapped to spin 2

2084
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
And it is Sz equals 0

2085
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
This is Sz equals 0

2086
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Spin 1

2087
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That looks like

2088
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
AKLT state

2089
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
That

2090
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Of course it is magnified

2091
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It can be seen

2092
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
This

2093
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
This is the way

2094
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
That's the conclusion

2095
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Symmetry is actually

2096
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
In physics

2097
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
It's still a very important role

2098
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Because if you have symmetry

2099
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
One is symmetry

2100
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Protective

2101
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
There is another

2102
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
In fact, you don't need symmetry

2103
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
It has its own

2104
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Topological

2105
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That

2106
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It's not in 1D

2107
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
That 1D

2108
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Can have

2109
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Must have

2110
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Symmetry

2111
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That

2112
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Um

2113
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
1D spin system

2114
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I think there are still a lot of places to do

2115
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Um

2116
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That's about it

2117
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
My speech

2118
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I think I didn't speak well

2119
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
No, I think

2120
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Probably know the important

2121
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Where

2122
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
From introduction

2123
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
To the real result

2124
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Is

2125
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I feel a little bit

2126
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I don't know

2127
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
The link in the middle

2128
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Where is it

2129
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
And you can talk about it

2130
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Half an hour you should be very tired

2131
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Can I ask a question

2132
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Can

2133
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I have a question about that

2134
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That

2135
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
That picture

2136
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
What is your side

2137
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Is it

2138
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Or you later

2139
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
If you want to see it here

2140
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It's a few lines of words

2141
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
A method is

2142
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Ground state

2143
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Just fix a jz

2144
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And then

2145
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
To ground state

2146
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
To d

2147
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Energy

2148
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
To d

2149
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
To this

2150
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
So you're here

2151
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
The group you gave later

2152
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Will also give the same

2153
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Is it

2154
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
In principle

2155
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
But this is a mistake

2156
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The problem

2157
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
But if the three-dimensional change is a five-dimensional change

2158
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
If it's a five-dimensional change

2159
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Not divided

2160
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Three-dimensional and five-dimensional

2161
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Because it can't be counted

2162
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Because

2163
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
The number to be divided

2164
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
In fact, it is to be divided

2165
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
What about your two-dimensional division

2166
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
You have to count three points

2167
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
If you use central

2168
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Difference

2169
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Then you

2170
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
One-dimensional division

2171
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Then you have to count two points

2172
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Do the difference

2173
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
You have to count three points in two-dimensional division

2174
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
You have to do this point in the middle

2175
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Take two more points

2176
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
That three-dimensional point to take five points

2177
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And your error will become

2178
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
The error of your two-dimensional division will become

2179
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
You take the square of the interval

2180
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That you three-dimensional

2181
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Become

2182
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Three-dimensional or four-dimensional

2183
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
That five-dimensional

2184
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
So

2185
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
The three-dimensional and five-dimensional

2186
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Take advantage of

2187
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Critical exponent

2188
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Scaling

2189
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Find it out

2190
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Someone still counts

2191
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
This three-dimensional

2192
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Five-dimensional

2193
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
But that's not divisible

2194
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
We already know

2195
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
It's not divisible

2196
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
But there is no serious

2197
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Three-dimensional and five-dimensional

2198
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I don't think so

2199
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Because I

2200
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I wanted to do this problem

2201
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
But you have to find time

2202
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
The one behind

2203
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
If you don't consider

2204
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
The problem of accuracy

2205
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
You just find a physical quantity

2206
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
For example, quantum energy

2207
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
See if he has

2208
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
You can find out if there is a phase transition

2209
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It doesn't matter

2210
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
For example, you can do that

2211
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
You can also find out the phase transition

2212
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
As long as the physical quantity

2213
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
You can see the phase transition

2214
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
The first one is in the one-dimensional system

2215
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Either there is a gap

2216
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Or there is no gap

2217
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
If there is a gap

2218
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Then your volume

2219
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Entropy

2220
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
There is an area

2221
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
If there is no gap

2222
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
If there is no gap

2223
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Then your entropy will follow

2224
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Size log

2225
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
That's what I wrote below

2226
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
C is central charge

2227
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It is inferred from conformal field theory

2228
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
It has a log

2229
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Here is one-third

2230
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Because I use

2231
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Periodic boundary condition

2232
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
If there is some amount

2233
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
There is no way

2234
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Detected

2235
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
That phase transition

2236
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Before

2237
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Above

2238
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
These

2239
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
These two articles

2240
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Fidelity Susceptibility

2241
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Fidelity Susceptibility

2242
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Basically the concept is like this

2243
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I calculated

2244
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Choose a place

2245
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Then calculate the ground state

2246
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Then a little near

2247
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Calculate a little here

2248
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Then the next door is also a little

2249
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Two ground states

2250
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
These two ground states are internal

2251
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
If these two states

2252
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
On the same phase

2253
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
You will think you will

2254
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Expect

2255
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Its internal volume should be close to 1

2256
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
If it happens

2257
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
If it happens

2258
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
One ground state is here

2259
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
The other ground state is in another phase

2260
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Then you will expect these two

2261
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Ground state

2262
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It should be much worse

2263
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
If it is much worse

2264
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
It is

2265
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Internal volume

2266
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It may be very small

2267
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Use this to detect

2268
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Is there a phase change here?

2269
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
In this case

2270
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
In

2271
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
In this example

2272
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Two-stage phase change and three-stage phase change

2273
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Can be successful

2274
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
But there is no way

2275
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Five-stage phase change

2276
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Especially here

2277
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
The so-called phase change here

2278
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
This is the so-called

2279
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
BKT transition

2280
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
BKT transition is actually

2281
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
You don't have to

2282
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
It will happen

2283
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
That is to say

2284
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
It will not happen

2285
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
In this case

2286
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It is difficult to detect

2287
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
The phase change of this place

2288
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
But if

2289
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
You use

2290
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
You have gaps here

2291
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Then only here is no gap

2292
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Of course there is a gap

2293
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So if you want the whole

2294
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
In this

2295
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
For this phase diagram

2296
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
You have to use monument entropy

2297
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
To set the critical point

2298
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Only here is valid

2299
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Only here is valid

2300
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
If you are here

2301
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
It will be difficult to find

2302
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Because there is an xy1 here

2303
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
There is an xy1 here

2304
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
There is also an xy2 here

2305
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
These two are the gapless phase

2306
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
What is this xy2

2307
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
It is the kind of quadruple order

2308
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I didn't talk about

2309
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It should be like

2310
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Similar to this quadruple

2311
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
This correlation

2312
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
But these two are

2313
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Gapless

2314
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
In monument entropy

2315
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
All happened

2316
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Then you can't see it here

2317
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
This is ferromagnetic

2318
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
This is ferromagnetic

2319
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Ferromagnetic here is

2320
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
One-phase phase change

2321
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
One-phase phase change

2322
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I don't know how to use

2323
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So I don't know

2324
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Scaling here

2325
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
What to do

2326
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Just in this case

2327
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
This model

2328
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Selected

2329
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Actually, it's me

2330
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I calculated it first

2331
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
How is it here

2332
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Then the last show is that picture

2333
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Every phase here

2334
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
There is a gap

2335
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Only at these phase changes

2336
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
These phase changes are gapless

2337
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
In this case

2338
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Monument entropy

2339
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It looks more beautiful

2340
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Then you find this

2341
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Single place

2342
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
This is the peak

2343
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
That's the gap

2344
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Then you can do some finite size scaling

2345
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
This is the finite size scaling

2346
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I don't know

2347
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Is this ok

2348
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Is this ok

2349
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Is this ok

2350
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Ok, thank you

2351
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Ok, today we probably

2352
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
No special questions

2353
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Hello

2354
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Hello

2355
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I'm Ted

2356
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I just joined

2357
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Sorry

2358
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Today's speech is probably

2359
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It's over here

2360
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
OK

2361
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Thank you

2362
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Very good

2363
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Then I'm going to

2364
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I'm going to stop the recording first

2365
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
OK, thank you

2366
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Thank you
