WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Okay, let's get started.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Oh, I hear the recording has started.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today is

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Phylogenetic Components with Meta-Optics.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Because my main research background is

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
the interaction between light and matter,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and then, through this interaction,

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
we can further manipulate light's behavior.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
So the main application we want to do is

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
how to reduce the size of the current

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
phylogenetic components on the market.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
For example, transparency or bias.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
So, what is meta?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll talk about it later.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
The word meta-optics is actually

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
the Greek word for meta.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I'll talk about it later.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.000
Before we get into the topic,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I want to share a picture.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I don't know if you've seen this picture.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
This is from the ancient Roman era.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
The picture on the left is from the ancient Roman era.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
This is a wine cup.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
What's amazing about this is

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
you can see that the colors are different.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But they are actually the same cup.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
The color is different because

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
they found that when they put the light source outside,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
the color of the cup is green.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But if they put the light source inside the cup,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
the cup will turn red.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
That is to say, the material on the cup is very special.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
If you look at the cup from the perspective of reflection,

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
it is green.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
But if you put the light source inside,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
the color you see is transparent.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
So after you put the light source inside the cup,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
the color you see is red.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
At this time, people think this is amazing.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
They also use this kind of material

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
to make church colored glass.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
We all know that

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
churches in Europe

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
have very beautiful colored glass.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Why are there so many different colors?

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
The reason is the same as the cup.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
The principle of its operation is very similar.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Why does this phenomenon occur?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Later, people found that

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
there is a thing called localized surface plasma.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
What does this mean?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Why doesn't it move?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
They found that

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
if we have a colored light source,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
it will interact with a metal nanoparticle.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
After interacting with it,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
it will accumulate some free electrons

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
on the surface of the nanoparticle

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
under the appropriate conditions.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
These free electrons

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
will allow it to produce a similar dipole inside,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
an H-ray dipole or a magnetic dipole.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Let it further produce,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
let it radiate electrons from other dipoles.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Then we will see different colors.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
When will this phenomenon occur?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
It mainly occurs

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
when our nanoparticles

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
are smaller than the dipole of the colored light.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
This thing will only occur.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So the high-angle cup,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
the colored high-angle cup,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
later they did a further study

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
and found that the high-angle cup

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
actually contained a lot of gold particles of different size.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
This is gold particle.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
The size of these metal particles

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
compared with the dipole of the visible light,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
the visible light dipole is about 400 to 700 nanometers.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Compared with it, it is smaller than the size of the dipole.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
So they thought that

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
the reason for the different color

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
may come from this

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
local surface plasmon resonance.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
The result of localized surface plasmon resonance.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
After this resonance,

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
what special phenomenon will we have?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
It actually has a lot of advantages that we can control,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
that is, we can have.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
For example, they found that

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
this resonance has a bias with the dipole of the colored light.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
The bias is the direction in which the electron waves resonate.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
You can see that this picture may be more obvious.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
For example, the color here is very colorful,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
very beautiful,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
there are five or six colors.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Here you can't see any color at all.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
These two pictures are actually the same sample

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
color.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Their only difference is that

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
they changed the direction of the dipole of the colored light.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
This red and white arrow is the direction of its dipole resonance.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
When the direction of the dipole of the colored light

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
is along the y-axis,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
they will see that the chip above

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
will produce different colors.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
In fact, you can imagine that

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
the chip uses some micro-imaging technology

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
to make some metal disks

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
that are smaller than visible wavelengths.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Like this disk.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Then they change its diameter or cycle.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
We can see different colors

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
in the reflected light part.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
But when they turn a bias,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
the colors are all gone.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
So you can use it to do something.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
For example, this thing can be used to make

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
color filters that have a bias control feature.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Another special thing is that

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
we used to know that

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
for example,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
why are we so interested in this thing now?

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
For example, we know that gold is often used to make decorations.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
For example, rings and necklaces.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
But gold,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
as long as we use gold to make a decoration,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
whether I pinch it into a square,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
a circle,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
or a ring,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
its color is yellow.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
But like I just said,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
if we put this gold,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
all the particles here are gold,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
but they are at a very small scale.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
If its scale is smaller than the wavelength,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
we can find that

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
as its size changes,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
the colors we see are different.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
This is very different from the optical phenomenon

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
that we see on the object.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
The main reason for this is because

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
of the localized surface plasma.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
The next feature is that

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
if the two metals are very close together,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
there is a very small nano gap

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
between the two metal particles,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
there will be a very strong near-field coupling.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
The two of them will interweave each other.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
This interweaving will make them

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
a bit like the simple electronics we learned before.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
It's like the feeling of end-to-end power generation.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Because its scale is very small,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
the more end-to-end power it can accumulate,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
the stronger the near-field power generation it produces.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
If it is very close,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
the interweaving between the two

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
will cause it to have a stronger field enhancement.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Finally, this resonance

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
has a lot to do with the surrounding environment.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
It is very sensitive to the environment.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
That is to say,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
if the surrounding environment's resolution changes,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
its resonance wavelength,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
which is the color we saw in the original factory, will change.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
For example, this stick now,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
if it is in the air,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I see blue.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
But if I put it in the water

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
and look at it again,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
it may turn red.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
This feature

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
is also used by some people

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
to say that we can do some sound sensing.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
It is based on the change in color

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
to judge what is the object

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
in the surrounding environment.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
OK.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
After introducing the Localized Surface Plasma,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I will tell you

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
what is Metamaterial.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
As I said,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
the word Meta

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
comes from Greek.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
It means the same in English.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Metamaterial is a kind of material.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It has some features.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
These features are not found in natural materials.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We call it Metamaterial.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Simply put,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
we can use the shape of it

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
or the distance between the particles

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
to change its optical properties.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
These are called Metamaterial.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Why do we have these features?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
It should be said that

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
we need to produce Metamaterial properties.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
What is the strict condition?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
As I said,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
we generally know that natural materials

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
are composed of atoms.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
For example, CO2, H2O.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Because we know that

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
the distance between them is very small.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
If I take the surface plasma as 500 nm,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
which is about the surface plasma of green light,

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
as an example,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
these two

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
have a very, very big difference in their magnitude.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So its optical properties

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
are mainly determined by this molecule or atom.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
For example, gold is AU.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
No matter how I rub it,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
it is yellow.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Metamaterial is what I just said.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
If we now put the distance

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
or size between the particles

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
to be reduced to the original size,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
which is the level of the magnetic field,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
which is about Lambda over 4 to Lambda over 10,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
at this magnitude,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
we can use man-made methods

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
to change the optical properties of the material itself.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Then we can further manipulate

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
some of the behavior of light or electromagnetic waves.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
This can be produced by the resonance

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
at the magnitude of the magnetic field.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
By using this method to manipulate light,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
we call it metamaterial.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It is mainly triangular.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Although my structure is very small,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
its thickness in the z-direction can be very thick.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
My very thick is only compared with the surface plasma of green light.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
For example, it can be one or two microns.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Let me ask you a question.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
10 to 100 microns?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
No, 1 to 10 microns is fine.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It can be several microns.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
So 10 nanometers to 100 micrometers is fine.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
The magnitude I'm talking about here is a bit broad.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Mainly because the example I gave earlier is visible light.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But the advantage of this thing is that

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
my work plasma may not necessarily be visible light.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I can even be a microwave wave.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
So 10 micrometers is Terahertz?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
100 microns.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
If it is 100 microns,

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
it should be 3 Terahertz.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
If I'm not mistaken.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
It's about the range of Terahertz.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
It's far away.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So its work plasma can be very broad.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Here is a very special example.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
The metamaterial I just mentioned.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
When I first saw this phenomenon,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
there was no such word as metamaterial.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
It's called left-hand material.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Why is it called left-hand material?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Because they found that

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
the structure of man-made

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
can control the behavior of light.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
We know that the characteristic of light transmission

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
mainly comes from the refractive index of the ring.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
So they thought,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
is it because of the refractive index?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Metamaterial is used to manipulate

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
the refractive index of the ring.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
That's why it affects the behavior of light.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Here is a schematic diagram.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
We used to study chemistry in high school.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
If a cup is an empty cup,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
the air refractive index is 1.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
If I put a chopstick here, it will be straight.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
If I put a refractive index of 1.3 in it,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
it's probably water.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
We know that because of the refractive index,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
it looks like the chopstick is broken.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
But if we put a negative refractive index in it,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
the chopstick we see at this time will look like this.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
This is actually just an experiment.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
This is not the result of the experiment.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Another interesting thing is that

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
if we have this negative refractive index,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
we usually know that the beam of light will be full.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
In other words, the beam of light is orange here.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
If it is a beam of light,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
it is along N1sinθ1 and N2sinθ2.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
So it keeps refracting.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
But if the material in the middle

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
is a negative refractive material,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
the beam of light and the beam of refractive light

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
will be located on both sides of the beam.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
This makes them very interested.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
That is to say,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
is it true that because of these characteristics,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
we can create some real

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
boundaries that naturally cannot exist,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
and then achieve some

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
light and snow characteristics that we can't imagine at all?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
This kind of negative refractive index,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I am trying to prove it here.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
But in fact, there is already an experiment to prove

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
that this thing is really feasible.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
But I didn't put their experiment results here.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It is to prove that by

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
properly designing the size of this material,

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
or the elements of the material itself,

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
they can achieve the negative refractive index phenomenon.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I think I can skip here.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Next, I will talk about

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
the Metamaterial I just mentioned.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I just said it can be very thick,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
it can be three-dimensional.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
But in fact, our main purpose is to

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
control the light.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Can we further reduce the element?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
They want to say,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
if I make Metamaterial only one layer,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
because I just said that Metamaterial can be many layers,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
it means that it can be very thick.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
If I only have one layer,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
can I achieve the same effect?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
This one-layer Metamaterial,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
they call it Metasurface.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
A surface that is the same as a general surface.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Yes, so it's called Metasurface.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Here is an example.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
For example, I now have a metal stick.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
After I inject a electromagnetic wave into it,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
because this magnitude is much smaller

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
than the injected light wave field,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
so I can directly use the concept of

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
injecting electromagnetic waves to

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
see the result of this resonance.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
So if my injected light wave field

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
vibrates along this direction,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I can theoretically accumulate positive and negative electrons

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
at both ends of the stick.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
This accumulated positive and negative electron

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
can make us equivalent to an electrode.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
After this electrode vibrates,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
another electromagnetic wave will be radiated.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
If we take a closer look at this structure

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
of penetrating light waves and phase light waves,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
under a fixed wavelength,

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
it is obvious that

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
if the length of the stick changes,

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
just like I just said,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
because this material,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
this Metasurface or Metamaterial,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
has a lot to do with its

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
resonance characteristics and size.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So when I make the length longer

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
or shorter,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
we can see that its resonance wave

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
will gradually be flattened.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
At this time,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
if I look at a fixed wavelength,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
its magnitude or phase

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
can be changed.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
A point that everyone is very concerned about

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
is the phase.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Is this a simulation?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yes, this is a simulation.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Both of these are simulations.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
If we can manipulate the phase,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
we can further manipulate

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
which is the characteristics of its transmission.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
For example, if I now have a

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
sample substrate,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
and I record a flat wave,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
if I put some of the

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Metasurface nanostructure on the surface,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
because its size is different,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
the phase deviation they feel

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
will be different.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
The different phase deviations

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
will make the phase delay

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
of the original wave

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
different,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
which means that after the original interference,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
they can reconstruct

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
another wave front.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
And this wave front

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
is completely different from the Metasurface.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Although this magnitude is less than

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
the Metasurface wavelength,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
we can control the electromagnetic wave

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
characteristics

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
with the Metasurface nanostructure.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Here are some examples of applications.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
This is probably

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
to say that

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
we can not only manipulate the electromagnetic wave

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
government and phase,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
in fact, the wavelength and deviation

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
can be manipulated

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
by Metasurface.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
For example, they can

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
do some optical image

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
or do some deviation conversion,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
which I will introduce later.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Here is a very simple image

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
that is, why this thing

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
can be so interesting

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
and help us to design some

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
flat optical components.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I use the simplest one before

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
is our deflection law

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
to explain to you.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
For example, if we used

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Hagen's principle to explain

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
the deflection of this thing,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
that is, if I have two materials

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
in the space now,

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
the deflection rate is N1 and N2 respectively.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
After the deflection wave comes in,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
every point on this interface

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
is reflected by the deflection light,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I can think of it as a

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
two-point light source.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
So here is a little bit gray,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
gray and white dots,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
round dots.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
I just split it

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
into a very small point

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
in each space.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
This small point is reflected by the deflection light

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
and interacts with the deflection light.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I think of it as a two-point light source.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
The deflection wave

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
coming out of the point light source

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
will be a circle.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This circle will eventually

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
reconstruct another deflection wave in the original factory.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Because each of them

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
has the same surface,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
the phase coming out of their radiation

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
has no delay.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
So their

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
original transmission

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
will be as flat as the deflection light,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
which is the tradition.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
How did they explain this thing

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
with Higgins before?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
When I am now in the diagonal direction,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
you can see that the red part

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
is the wave front.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
This wave front

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
touches the time on this interface

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
will be different.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
It will first touch the point on the left.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
So after the point on the left is touched by the light,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
it will be regarded as the first

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
two-point light source

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
to start radiation.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Then this point is touched.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
But because it is slower to be touched,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
it will produce

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
this radiation slower.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
In this way,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
to the end here.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Because the time they were touched

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
is different, we can think of it as

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
their radiation

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
is different.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
So you can see that the shape of the radiation

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
produced by them is different from here.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
The radiation is getting smaller from left to right.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
This will cause

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
the wave front to be oblique.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Bing Jie, Zhang Yang has a question.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
He has a question.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
He said

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Transmittance's light source

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
is mainly a design decision.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
What about Resonance's Q-factor?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
How high and low can it be now?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
This thing?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
How high can the Q-factor be?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
How is it determined?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Q-factor

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
has a lot of things.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
It will be affected by a lot of things.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
First of all, the most intuitive

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
is its loss.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Because the material I designed here

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
is made of metal.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
The metal in the visible light,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
or the part outside the mirror,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
after it has been resonance,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
because of the dipole,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
we can think of it as

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
a movement of free current.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
This part will cause

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
The second thing that will affect it

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
is the loss of the original radiation.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
In theory, we divide it into two categories.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
One is Intrinsic.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
One is Extrinsic.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Intrinsic is the heat radiation

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
that the material itself produces.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
The other is the loss of the original radiation

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
caused by the original radiation.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I classify both of them as the part of the loss.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
This part will reduce my Q-factor.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The other part is whether my cavity

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
is strong enough.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Because my current structure

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
is based on the loss of the original radiation.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
So even if there is a shock

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
on it,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I can think of it as a movement of free current.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But this movement of free current

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
cannot be perfect

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
because this cavity is not very strong.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
If I want a very strong cavity,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
in theory, we should have

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
almost 100% reflectivity on both sides.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
At this time, my Q-factor can be very high.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
But because of my current structure,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
I just wait for it to accumulate

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and let it accumulate radiation on both sides.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
But this cavity is not that strong.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So my Q-factor will be reduced.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
These factors

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
result in the

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Plasmon Resonance

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
produced by this kind of metal.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Its Q-factor will not be too high.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
As far as I know,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
if it is made of metal,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
without considering

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
any cavity,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
that is, without considering any mirror,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
that is, the perfect mirror in this system,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
its Q-factor

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
can only reach a few hundred.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
This is already the highest.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
But usually it is only a few tens.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
He said he understood.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
OK, thank you.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Then,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
if I have the

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
nanoparticle I just talked about,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I am now

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
in the same direction.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
But because of my nanoparticle,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
each nanoparticle has a different size.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
The size is different,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
just like what I just showed in this picture.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Under the same wavelength,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
the phase delay

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
felt by each different size will be different.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
At this time,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
it works as if

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
each particle,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
although they both feel the

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
electromagnetic wave,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
but after their resonance,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
the radiation phase will also be delayed.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
This is very interesting.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It allows us to achieve

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
transparency.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
In theory,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I am transparent.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
But if I design the structure

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
appropriately above,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I can see that it is written out.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I can use

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Momentum's picture to explain it.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I don't think it needs to be explained.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Basically, it is the phase delay.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Here is a simple experiment result.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
If I design a stick

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
of different lengths on the surface,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
you can see that

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Can you go back to the page

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
and explain Momentum? I don't quite understand.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Momentum, in theory,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
we know that its K

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
is 2π除λ.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
If I have

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
different structures here,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
in theory, I can equate it to

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
each structure

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
can provide a

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
horizontal momentum.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
How does this horizontal momentum decide?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
This horizontal momentum is determined by

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
2π除λ.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
What does this λ mean?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
This λ of 2π除λ

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
means that my structure

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
has a phase delay

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
from 0 to

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
the minimum length of 360 degrees.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
That is, I can see it as a

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
pixel of light.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
A pixel of light.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
If a pixel of light is λ,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
we know that its K is 2π除λ.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Because I have a

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
phase change of T,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I can equate it to

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
the horizontal momentum of

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
2π除λ on this

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
surface.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And these two

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Momentum boxes

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
can let us see through the light.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
These two boxes

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
are obviously in this direction.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
This is why we can

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
achieve the phenomenon of

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
paranormal penetration.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
This is a

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
simple experiment result.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
After designing different

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
lengths of sticks on the

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
surface, if my light

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
is perpendicular to the light,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I want to see if it can

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
reflect back in the opposite direction.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
This is the result of the experiment.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
This is the result of the calculation.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The curve of different colors represents

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
different angles of light.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Black is when the light

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
is perpendicular to the light,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
and white is when the light

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
is perpendicular to the light.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
The reflection angle is

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
about 45 degrees.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
This proves that we

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
give it a horizontal momentum

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
in the horizontal direction.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Why don't I see through the light here?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Because the structure of this design

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
has a thick metal at the bottom.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
This thick metal helps

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
us block all the light.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
So we only see the reflected light.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Why do we only see the reflected light here?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You can also see that

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
when the light is perpendicular to the light,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
if you look at the scattering,

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
you can see that the light

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
is perpendicular to the light.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Let me ask you a question.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
What wavelength is the light

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
reflected?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The working wavelength is

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
about 780 nm.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
This is the boundary between

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
the reflected light and the reflected light.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
After doing this demo,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
we also want to demonstrate

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
that its efficiency can be very high.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You can see that the efficiency of the calculation

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
can be more than 90%.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
The experimental beam is also 80%.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I'm talking about the time when the reflection was recorded.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
So why do we have to choose this wavelength?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Because the inter-beam scattering

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
is at 550 nm,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
so if we use gold to make

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
the inter-beam scattering,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
its resonance will never happen before 550 nm.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Because the loss is too big.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
So the farther we work from 550 nm,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
in theory, its efficiency can be better.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Of course, this is just the characteristic of the material itself.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Other factors also affect

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
its efficiency, such as

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
structural design.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
This is the final optimization result.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I want to share with you

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
most of my work.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
The first part is that we want to use aluminum

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
to make a visible Metasurface,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
and then make some

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
flat components.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
The other part is that

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
we want to make a transparent mirror.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Why do we want to make a transparent mirror?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Because what I just said is

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
that the most important thing

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
about Metasurface now

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
is that it can greatly reduce

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
the size of the components

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
we can buy on the market.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
For example,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
the simplest

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
and most impressive

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
is the iPhone

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
or our smartphone

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
camera lens.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
After the iPhone 6,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
you can find that

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
its body is actually very thin,

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
but its lens protrudes a piece.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
This is because

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
when the body becomes thin,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
it has to maintain

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
the resolution of the image

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
it takes

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
This premise

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
will cause it to

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
not be able to greatly reduce

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
the size of the mirror.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
It has to insert a lot of different mirror groups

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
and stack them up,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
so that the image produced after taking pictures

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
will be clearer,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
so that some contrast and color difference can be eliminated.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I will introduce this later.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I don't know if I have enough time,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
so I may be a little faster.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
In fact, if you

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
take a look at the

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
current direction of the

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
battery wave,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
we call it bias.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
In fact, whether it is

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
the linear bias of the y-direction

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
or the linear bias of the x-direction,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
or when it rotates,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
it produces a circular bias.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
No matter what the bias is,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I can split its positive and negative

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
into three components, x, y, and z.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I can easily stack

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
these three components

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
in the same way.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I should say that I can split

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
any bias light into these three components.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
So our future design

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
will be based on this logic.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Bias is actually quite useful

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
in life.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
For example, 3D images are the most common.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
If you go to see a 3D movie,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
it will give you a 3D glasses.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
These 3D glasses are

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
what the left eye sees

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
and what the right eye sees.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Its bias is also perpendicular to each other.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
When it causes this illusion,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
the image you see will look like a 3D.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
So why do you see

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
that the image is foggy when you take off your glasses?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Because your two eyes

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
detect the image of two biases at the same time.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Or

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
we often see that

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
some people who play photography

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
will know that

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
they will put some filters related to bias

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
in front of the lens,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
which can shoot some light

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
on some slower

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
or stronger surface

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
to make

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
them more clear.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Or

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
do some

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
biological or chemical molecules detection.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Because some biological or chemical molecules

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
will take the initiative

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
to bias

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
the bias of the light.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Different molecules

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
have different angles of bias.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Some are big and some are small.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Some people use this thing

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
to make chemical molecules

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
detection.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
What are the

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
most common

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
ways to manipulate

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
bias on the market?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Let me give you three examples.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
The first one is linear bias.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
For example,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
if there is a dirty battery,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
the battery factory is messy.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
If you want to turn it into a pure

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
battery factory,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
for example,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
the battery factory is a

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
horizontal wire.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
If the battery factory is along this wire,

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
it will be absorbed.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
The volume of the battery

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
will be penetrated.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
So it uses this method

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
to filter out the bias it doesn't want.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
This is what I found on the Internet.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
You can buy it on the market.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Because we need to effectively

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
absorb all the light in the x-direction.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
So its thickness must be thick enough.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Usually this thickness is about a millimeter.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
This diameter is one inch.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
This diameter is half an inch.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Another one is that after we produce

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
linear bias, we want to do

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
a rotation of bias light.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
For example, the linear bias of the

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
green light is 45 degrees.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
If I want to rotate it to negative 45 degrees,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
we will use 1 in 2 waves.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
The main thing is that this material

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
itself can provide different

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
phase differences

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
in the x- and y-directions,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
so that when the light penetrates,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
the bias of the x-direction

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
slowly slows down,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
and the y-direction slowly speeds up,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
so that the x- and y-directions

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
of the green light are in the positive direction

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
respectively.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
After coming out, it will become

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
a negative and a positive,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and then use this method to rotate it.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Because it has to accumulate

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
enough bias delay,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
so its thickness must be thick enough.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Or to produce linear bias light.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
This is to give the

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
x- and y-dimensions

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
an additional bias delay,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
so that the angle of the bias delay

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
is large enough that the

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
x- and y-directions of the x- and y-directions

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
are exactly 90 degrees.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Then it can become the original bias light.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
It also has to have enough bias delay,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
so its thickness must also be very thick.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
What are the benefits of using linear bias light?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
We don't need to use the thickness of

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
the minimiter level,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
we can produce any bias light we want.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
For example, we provide a

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
design method called

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Geometry Faced Metasurface,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
which is a superimposed interface that combines

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
the positions of the x- and y-directions.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
What does this mean?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
For example, if I have a stick now,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I record a right-handed light

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and look at the penetration of the left-handed light.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
At this time, because the

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
bias light of the penetrating light

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
is different from the recorded light,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
so I call it conversion efficiency.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
We can see that the conversion efficiency is here.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Then I look at the x- and y-directions of the

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
bias light, and I will see a value.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
At this time, if I rotate it

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
a theta angle, this theta angle is

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
the angle with the y-axis.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
We will find a very magical thing

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
that its efficiency will hardly change,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and its

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
position will change to 2 theta.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Then,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
as long as I let it rotate

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
at the same angle

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
on this surface,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I can make

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
its position change from 0

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
to 2π.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Every time I rotate a theta angle,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
its bias delay will become 2 theta.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Another interesting point is that

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
if the same structure,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
the direction of my rotation is exactly the same,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
but at this time I turn into a left-handed light

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
and look at the penetration of the right-handed light.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
At this time, I will find a

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
more interesting thing,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
its bias delay can reach 360 degrees,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
but it is from 0 to 360 and becomes

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
0 to negative 360.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
This thing can help us design

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
some components that can be manipulated by bias.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
For example, if you look at it with the right-handed light,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
it will become a focal penetration.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
If you look at it with the left-handed light,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
it will become a scattered penetration.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
In other words, I can combine

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
many different optical functions

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
on the same optical component,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
and its

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
magnitude is very thin.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
The thickness of this metal is only

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
50 nanometers,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
so it is much smaller

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
than the previous

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
50 nanometers.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
This is what we are talking about,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
because its magnitude is very small,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
so the concept we propose here is that

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
we can integrate all the different chips

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
on the same sample.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Then after I enter the color light,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I hit different chips

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
and the reflected light can produce a different fragrance.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Compared with the general traditional components,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I want to produce the original light,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
for example, I at least need a

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
linear light,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
a linear polarizer,

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
and a quarter wave,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
to produce the original light.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
But now if I only use our metasurface,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
my thickness only needs about

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
dozens of nanometers to complete

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
this thing.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Let me tell you

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
why we use aluminum,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
because I just mentioned that gold,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
because its intervention coefficient is around 500 to 550 nanometers,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
so it is impossible

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
to work on the entire optical spectrum.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Silver can work on the entire optical spectrum,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
but there is a big disadvantage of silver,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
which is that it is very easy to oxidize,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
so the components cannot last long.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So we choose aluminum here.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Here is a demo for everyone,

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
that is to say,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
we use LISO to pattern

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
some different aluminum sticks

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
of different lengths and sizes,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
and its color will change drastically.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
This is its tradition.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Indeed, its resonance can

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
expand from 400 nanometers of blue light

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to 750 nanometers of red light.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Here is the design of the component.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I won't talk about it.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Simply put, we optimized

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
its structure dimension

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
so that it can produce the highest

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
work efficiency.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Next, I will tell you

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
how to use the same component

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
to achieve the production

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
of any parameter.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
First of all,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
after I design a stick here,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
as I just said,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I make it rotate

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
in the direction of change.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
I can let it produce 0 to 2π

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and I can produce an abnormal reflection.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The interesting thing about this abnormal reflection

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
is that my rotation angle is fixed,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
so if I enter the color light

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
at this time,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
it will produce an abnormal reflection

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
of the right light here.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Conversely, if I enter the color light

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
and it is the right light,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
it will produce an abnormal reflection

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
of the left light,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
but it is on the other side

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and it is already achieved.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
If I enter a linear parameter light,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
which is horizontal,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I mean the x-parameter light.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Because the x-parameter light

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
can be regarded as the addition of

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
the right light and the left light,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
so it can let me produce

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
the left and right parameters at the same time.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
So I use a simple rotation

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
to achieve the adjustment of the original parameter light

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
if I enter the color light as a linear parameter light.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
How do I produce any linear parameter light?

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
We introduce another

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
parameter light that looks exactly the same as it,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
but the rotation direction of the structure is opposite.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
The first group of rotation is clockwise,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and the second group of rotation is counterclockwise.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
In this case,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
when I enter a linear parameter light,

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I can achieve the reflection of

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
the right and left parameters at the same time on the same side.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Then I make a spatial parallelism

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
between the two of them.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
This parallelism will make a difference

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
in the position between the two of them.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
This difference in the position

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
can be determined by this d.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
As mentioned earlier,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
the difference in the position

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
can be equal to 2πd divided by Lx.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Lx is the length.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
So you can see that the difference in the position

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
can be changed by the change in d.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
So after the two of them interfere with each other,

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
they can be multiplied into

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
different linear parameters.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
For example, if d is 0,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
it means that the difference in the position

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
between the two original parameters is 0.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
At this time, their reflection light

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
will also be an x-parameter light.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
It's a bit like a mirror.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
If I let its d

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
be designed to

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
have a difference in the position

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
of π,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
it will become a y-parameter light.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
That is, Lx's reflection light will become y.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
In this way, I can make it

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
a positive 45-degree linear light

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
or a negative 45-degree linear light.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
So it's all reflected.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Now there's no way to do the refraction.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Isn't it just a projection?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
We can do projection here,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
but the efficiency of projection will be very low.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Because I just said that the loss of metal is relatively large.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
So our demo here is mainly reflected.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
The work I will do later will be projected.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
But our material will be converted from metal

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
to electrolyte.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
OK, good, continue.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Then here is its SEM map.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That is, we integrate

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
the six samples together.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Then the optical system.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Here is a test result.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
We usually use

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
this POSCALISphere

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
to show

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
what the

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
refraction of light

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
is.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
In fact, this map is very simple to see.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
If this map is the earth,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
its north pole represents the purest right-axis light.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
The south pole is the purest left-axis light.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
The four points on the equator

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
represent the

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
linear light.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
The four points in the east, west, south and north

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
represent the purest

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
x, y, positive 45

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
and negative 45-degree linear light.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And these three maps are based on

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
the experiment results of these three

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
green light wavelengths.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
The black dots are the theoretical results

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
of ideal prediction.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
And the

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
black dots with colors

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
are the results of our experiment measurement.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It can be said that they are almost very match.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Some may have some miscalculations,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
but they are still quite close to our theoretical prediction results.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Then it proves that we can

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
achieve different equilibrium states

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
based on our experimental results.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
We can use a lot of aperture in our lives.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
We can use a lot of aperture in our lives.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
For example, a microscope or a camera lens.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
We can use a lot of aperture in our lives.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
For example, a microscope or a camera lens.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
At present, there are many problems

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
with the so-called aperture.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
One of them is the differential.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
The difference between the different approaches

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
will be focused in different places.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
There is a great influence

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
when I want to do full-screen images.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
The difference means that

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I use the same aperture,

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
but it will be focused in different places.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
This will also make it impossible

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
for us to do full-screen images.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
So in order to meet this requirement,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
they will stack two apertures

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
to compensate for the difference.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
So that they can be focused

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
at the same point in different places.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
This will make it possible

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
to do full-screen images.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
That's why we can't do full-screen images.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
That's why we can't do full-screen images.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
So that the difference between the different approaches

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
will be focused at the same point in different places.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
In theory, if you add one more aperture,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
you can only do one more compensation.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
For example, if I want to do full-screen images,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
you can imagine that

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I need at least 10 or 20 shots.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
It may not be enough.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Here is a picture of why

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
our smart phone's aperture is so thick.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
It is because there are many different

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
apertures in it.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
In order to meet the compensation

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
of these differences,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
the resulting image will not have distortion.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Or the color will not run away.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
It's the same as what the eyes see.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
That's why we want to use

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
MetaServer as a lens.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
As mentioned earlier,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
we want to do high-efficiency processing.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
If I use metal,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
all the examples I just mentioned are only reflective.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
On the other hand, if I want to do a penetrative,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I have to convert it into an anodized material.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Because the anodized material itself

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
has no distortion,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
no heat loss,

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
it can greatly reduce

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
the efficiency of work.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Here is a history.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
This may also be skipped.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
First of all, we use GetInNitro as a material.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
It has a high reflectivity in visible light.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We want to use anodized metal

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
to do MetaService.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
The prerequisite is that its reflectivity

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
is at least greater than 2.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Because anodized metal is not like metal,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
it has a free electron accumulation.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So its resonance must rely on the membrane current.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
If the membrane current has resonance,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
it means that its reflectivity

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
must be large enough to compare

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
with the surrounding environment.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Only then can it produce a strong enough

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
membrane current to produce fragrance accumulation.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
At least as far as I can see,

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
if compared with air, it is at least 2.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Similarly, we use PPFace,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
which is the MetaService of GeometryFaceFace,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
which is the rotating method I just mentioned,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
to adjust its fragrance.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
This is called focusing.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Focusing means that I am now

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
injecting a flat light into it.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
The light in different positions

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
will feel different fragrance delays

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
before it can reach the same point.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
So this is the fragrance distribution

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
that I have to satisfy in different structures

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
in the space.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
This is the final design result.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
If I inject an experiment,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
this is the experimental electronic microscope photo.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
This is the MetaService lens we designed.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
We call it MetaLens.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
In order to detect its focus,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
when we inject light into it,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
this super photoreceptor will focus

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
on a certain point in a certain space.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
We use a flat platform at the back

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
to detect how well it focuses the light.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
You can see that

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
we just match

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
a very beautiful green light spot

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
on its focusing surface.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I injected green light and laser light.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
If I stay away from it,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
it will not focus.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
In addition to green light,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
we can also do different things.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
How far is the distance?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
How far can it move?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
You mean this stage?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Yes.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
This stage can move up to 7mm.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
What about its step size?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Its step size can reach

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
500nm.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
OK.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Thank you.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Not only green light,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
we can also do red, blue, and green.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Just change its size.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Regularity depends on its size.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Next,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
in addition to doing positive focus,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
we can also do oblique focus

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
on a flat surface.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
But this is very difficult

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
to do in traditional photoreceptors.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Because traditional photoreceptors

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
mainly use manual grinding

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to achieve the surface frequency I want.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
A photoreceptor is a glass with a curve.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Different thicknesses will cause

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
different fragmentation.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
If I want to use traditional photoreceptors

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
you can imagine that

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
this is a curve.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
It becomes a curve on one side.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
This is very difficult

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
in terms of technology.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Our technology is very simple.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I just need to change the distribution of the surface structure

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
so that its center

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
slowly deviates a little to the left

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
or a little to the right.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Then I can do oblique focus.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
For example, this picture.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Here is the experiment result.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You can see that red, blue, and green are focused.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
This refers to the position of the lens.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
The focus is in the upper right corner.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
We designed it in the upper right corner.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
We proposed an application.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
If we integrate all of them

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
on the same chip

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
because it is very small

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
we can easily integrate them all together.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
After I insert a wide-screen light source

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I will see a different color distribution.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I can use it to divide the light.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
For example, this is the photo of our sample.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
If I insert a red light now

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I can see that the focus is in the upper right corner

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
of the same sample.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
If I insert a green light now

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I can see that there is a focus light on the upper left and lower right.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
The blue light is in the lower left.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
If I insert three wavelengths at the same time

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I will see the effect of division of light.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
The biggest application of this thing

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
is on CMOS.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
CMOS is currently

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
an important component

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
in the image sensor.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Traditionally, you have to do a

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
micro lens, which is what I just said.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
You have to focus first

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
and then go through a filter and a detector.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Because the detector can't

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
distinguish colors,

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
that's why it has to put a filter here.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It has to make sure that

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
this filter can only receive blue light.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
So it has to put a blue light filter

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
to filter out the white light, red light, and green light.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
This causes

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
the red light and green light

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
to be wasted

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
and so on.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
But our sample

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
can put all the white light in

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
and divide all the red light here.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
The green light is in the middle, and the blue light is on the other side.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
We can effectively use

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
all the energy of the green light

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
to greatly increase its S-N ratio.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
The other biggest advantage

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
is what I just said.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Our thickness is only 600 nanometers.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Traditionally, it's about 1 to 10 microns.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
So we can shrink down its physical dimension.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
The other thing

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
we want to do

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
is to eliminate

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
the difference in color.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
As I just said, different wavelengths

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
will focus on different positions.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
This is the work of the people in the past.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
But this is our work.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Traditionally,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
different wavelengths of green light

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
would focus on different positions in the space,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
so it's hard to make a full-color image.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
We designed

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
some special designs

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
to provide different flavor compensations

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
in different positions

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
to create a white light focus point.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
This is a demonstration

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
using a metal part as a reflector.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
This is the design principle.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I won't talk about it.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
This is the sample photo.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
This is the measurement result.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
This is the calculation result.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
You can see that my wavelength

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
changes from 1.2 to 1.65 microns.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Basically, its focal length

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
has hardly changed.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
If I do a different

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
lens measurement,

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I can see that

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
the focal length

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
is almost the same.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
If I compare it with

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
a traditional metal lens,

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
the deviation is quite large

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
in the same wavelength.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
This proves that

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
we can completely eliminate the color difference.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
This is another example.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I skipped it.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Another example is

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
that the biggest use of transparency

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
is to make a full-color image.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Transparency is actually very difficult to make a full-color image.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
So our work here is to

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
make a high-efficiency

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
focal length transparency

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
and further apply it to make a full-color image.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
What I just said

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
is why we can use

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
metal materials to

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
adjust the angle.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
The main reason is that

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
there is a big difference in the refraction rate,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
so it can produce a cavity-like resonance.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
So different wavelengths

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
can produce different

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
cavities.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Here is our photo.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
This studio is

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
located in the visible light,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
so the refractive spectrum

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
ranges from 400 to 640.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
We can actually eliminate it to 660,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
but because of the deviation here,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I only fix it to 640.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The last is to make a full-color image.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
After I use a photo to come in,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
we want to be able to

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
make a full-color image

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
through our metalance

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
analysis.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Here is a full-color image

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
made with our lens.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
You can see that

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
even white or yellow

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
have very clear colors.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Compared with the original photo,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
there is not much difference in color.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
It proves that we can

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
eliminate color difference in the entire

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
refractive spectrum and make a full-color image application.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
That's about it.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Sorry, I talked a little too fast,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
because the time is a bit delayed.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
This is my report for today.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Thank you everyone.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
I don't know if there are any questions.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
If I talk too fast later,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I think it's good.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Do you have any questions?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Can you hear me?

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Yes, we can hear you now.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Thank you.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
What is this?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
My question is

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
basically

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
your device

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
is roughly scaled

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
as the working

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
frequency.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Basically.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Yes, it should be smaller than the frequency.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I mean it should have the same effect.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
If you want

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
the working frequency

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
to be doubled,

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
the length,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
the scale should be 2.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
So the area should be 4.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
No,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
it's not a linear scale.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
It's not a linear scale.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
It's not.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Because of the resonance,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
it's different from the material.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
For example,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
this thing is very intuitive.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
For example,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I just talked about this thing.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
For example,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
if we have resonance,

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
we can think that

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
it produces an equivalent

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
resonance here.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
So if you say

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
my working frequency

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
is doubled,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
in theory, the length should be doubled.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
The premise of this thing is

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
that the scale of the structure itself does not change.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Oh.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
In different wavelengths,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
the scale of the material will change.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
So its equivalent wavelength,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
the effective lambda is actually

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
lambda over n.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
This n is also the wavelength function.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Oh, yes.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
So it's not a linear scale.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Now for this kind of material,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
can you do it

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
in

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
millimeter wave

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
or infrared

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
or deep IR

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
devices?

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
You can do it in Terahertz or microwave,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
but most people do it in microwave.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Now there are several companies in the United States

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
that have established this principle of doing it in microwave.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Because microwave is easy to do

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
and the loss is super low.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
military use is the widest.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And its materials are basically

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
aluminum or some

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
silicon base, which are cheaper

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
and easy to make materials.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Yes, that's right.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Although we have been talking about metal for a long time,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
the main reason why

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
there is no commercial product for metal

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
is here.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Because metal is not yet

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
silicon path fabrication compatible.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
These CMOS semiconductor companies

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
are compatible.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
I see.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
So why do we want to do gallium nitride later?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Because gallium nitride is at least

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
a semiconductor company.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
The current manufacturing can be compatible.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Let me talk about

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Maybe you can think about it.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Because we are looking for

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Terahertz absorber,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
but it has to be very, very

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
low radioactivity.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
So we have very, very

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
restrictions on materials.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
We can't use some

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
very fancy elements, you know.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
So if you can do this thing,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
it should be usable.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
And it's quite complicated.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
What do you mean by Terahertz?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
What are the requirements?

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
We need it to be

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
able to adjust its optical quality

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
in Terahertz.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
It's EM wave quality.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
But all the materials it uses

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
have to be very low radioactivity.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
In other words,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
its natural isotope

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
has to be very low.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
So there are not many materials we can use.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
So if you can use some pure elements,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
such as silicon

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
or aluminum,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
not alloy or super heavy metals,

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
or super heavy metals,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
you can do it.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
That's a very good choice.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
For example, can you accept gold and copper?

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Yes, gold and copper.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
But what do you want to use?

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
For example, silver.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
It's weird.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
If it's Terahertz,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
gold and copper

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
can be used.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
These are very common materials.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
On the contrary,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
it's rare to see

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
low radioactivity.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
In Terahertz,

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
it doesn't seem to reach

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
such a high value.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Because usually

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
the radioactivity of

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
natural materials

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
decreases as the wavelength increases.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
So its visible light

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
has the highest radioactivity

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
and decays slowly.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
So in my mind,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I haven't seen anyone

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
use Terahertz materials

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
such as silicon,

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
gallium nitride,

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
or germanium,

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
such as silicon nitride

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
to make Terahertz components.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
But there's a lot of metal.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Like I said, there's a lot of copper and gold.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Okay, thank you.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
You're welcome.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
What kind of radioactivity

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
did you mean

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
when you said

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
radioactivity?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
No, I mean

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
the radioactivity of the material itself.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Like bananas

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
also have beta decay.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Oh, okay.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
So you mean like tin

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
has a higher radioactivity?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Yes, if you want to use

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
something below the

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
elemental cycle,

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
it won't work.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
The reason why it doesn't work is because

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
it naturally has the same value

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
and it's easy to change.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
So if you put in a particle,

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
the particle will affect the quality

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
of the particle detector.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Because it will become noise.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Okay, got it.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Let me ask,

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
I didn't understand

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
what kind of materials

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
are usually used

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
in the microwave range.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Aluminum or gallium nitride?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
No, if it's microwave,

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
the most common thing is copper.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Because copper can print

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
very cheaply.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
So the printed pattern

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
is like the nanostructure

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
you just made?

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Yes, it may not be nanoscale,

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
it may be millimeter scale.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Because the wavelength of microwave

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
may be dozens of millimeters

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
or even centimeters.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So it's actually easier to do.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Yes, so it's very easy to do.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And what they print

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
is a large area.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Maybe you can stick it

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
on the whole wall of your house.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Oh, got it.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
What other materials

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
are also very effective

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
in doing the same thing?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The most common metal

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
we see right now

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
is

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
gold, silver, copper.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
No, not copper.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Gold, silver, aluminum.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
These three are the most common.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Oh, thank you.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Thank you.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
And if it's...

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
No, you go first.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Yes, and if it's

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
electrolyte, it's actually quite a lot.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
There should be more choices.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
For example, as long as the resolution is high enough.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So silicon,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
gallium nitride,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
silicon nitride,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
titanium oxide,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
and gallium phosphate.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But gallium phosphate has

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
absorption, so the effect may not be as good.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You have a video

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
where you hit the light

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
and there's a left and right

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
rotation.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
This one?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Yes.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
This one?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
No, the previous one.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
The one you just mentioned.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
The one you just showed.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Oh,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
so how efficient is it?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
If you hit the light

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and it's linearly polarized,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
it will be left and right

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
rotation.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
In our experiment,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
let me see.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
In our experiment,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
it's about

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
30 to 50%

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
efficient.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Okay,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
so this is its wavelength.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Yes, the next one is wavelength.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Theoretically,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
we expect it to be

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
about 70%.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But after we published this,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
there's one thing

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
we didn't consider.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
In our calculation,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
we know that aluminum oxidizes easily.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
So when it oxidizes, there will be 3 to 5 nanometers of aluminum on the surface.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
This will affect its resonance

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
efficiency.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So this picture is about this.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
This is someone else's work.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
He's talking about the average pure aluminum.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
If I design it,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
its resonance is this high.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And then after the oxidation,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
it will slowly

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
tilt to the right a little bit

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and the efficiency will drop a little bit.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
This is what we saw in our experiment.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Indeed, our simulation hopes that

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
its peak is here,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
but our experiment results

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
show that the peak is

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
a little bit lower.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
So we speculated that

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
the efficiency of this result

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
is not that high

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
because we didn't consider

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
the oxidation rate

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
when optimizing the structure.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
The question I want to ask

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
is,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
assuming that

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
the positive light

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
keeps decreasing

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the energy,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
how many lights

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
will it reflect?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Will there be

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
a state of

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
entanglement

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
when the light

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
is reflected

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
at the same time?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Or you don't care about this?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
We don't care about this.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But what you said

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
is actually

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
what I want to do next.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Because

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
the most common

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
entangled photon source

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
is BBO,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
which is a non-linear crystal

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
to produce entanglement.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
But it is a entanglement.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
So I thought about this

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
at that time.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
If it is an entanglement of

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
both H and V,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I will pass the light

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
through this source.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
What is H plus V?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
H is horizontal, V is vertical.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
This is the entanglement of X and Y.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
If the reflected light

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
is H plus V,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
can I have

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
a special entanglement

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
at the same time?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I'm not sure about this.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But I want to do this.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Because I'm not sure

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
if the reflected light is H or V,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I can't be sure

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
if the reflected light

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
is right or left.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
If the reflected light is H,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
the reflected light is left or right.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
If the reflected light is V,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
the reflected light is left or right.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I think

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
this is possible.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Because this kind of source

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
has already been done.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
We mainly use a bunch of photons

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
to integrate with this structure.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
If I only have a single photon,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
it will also work.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
If a single photon

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
also works,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
it should be possible.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It should be possible.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
We should work together

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
after you finish this.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
What I'm going to do next

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
is to transfer

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
the entanglement photon

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
to the spin of the quantum dot.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
So you're doing quantum mechanics?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yes.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
My next project

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
will be

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
what I just said.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But the entanglement

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
is one is vertical

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
and the other is horizontal.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
But if

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
we can make entanglement

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
of left and right,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
we should

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
make it first

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and think about it

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
after it's confirmed.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Okay.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Is there any question?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Audience?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Audience?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
It seems like no.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Thank you, Bing Jie.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Thank you.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You did a great job.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You have a good grasp of the time.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I talked too fast

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
at the end.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
If you have any questions,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
you can tell me.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Right.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I want to ask

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
if you really made this

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
or you didn't

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
do this in Caltech?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I didn't do this in Caltech.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But...

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Don't ask Cai.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Because if

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
we make this...

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Yes.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
We should...

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We're planning to

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
make this

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
recently.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Yes.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Do you have a good approach?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Or you already have some approaches?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Like you said, BBO.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
But BBO can only generate

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
linear light.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So I said it can only generate

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
linear light.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Yes.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
If it can generate...

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
If you want to generate

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
spin, you need

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
circular polarizer.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Yes.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Yes.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That's what we're thinking.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
No problem. We can talk about it.
