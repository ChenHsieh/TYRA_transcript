1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, so today's speaker is Fang Sichun, MD.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,200
So Fang Sichun is actually one of my friend

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
back to college from entomology department.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,280
And he's doing PhD in University of Texas, Austin.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,760
And he's going to introduce some story about ants to us.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,720
So just give the time to Andy now.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,720
All right.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you, Oscar.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,720
Thanks for the introduction.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,720
So today I have four things that I want to share with you.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,000
The main idea is to show you the embryo development

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,760
of one of the live callers, one of the antennae ants,

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
and we also call it live callers.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
The species name is Ada texana.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,400
And since my childhood,

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,880
I bet everybody watched Lion King before.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,040
And this is one clip from that movie.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,000
That scene was fascinating.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,880
That was actually the first time I knew,

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
oh, there are some ants with a couple leaves

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
and bring them back.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,120
But at that moment, I didn't know what they were doing

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,000
or not even saying what is the social insects.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,240
So I'm going to show you

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,120
what are the typical, like a true social insects around us.

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,160
Termites, honeybees, ants, and wasps.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,920
So the typical pictures for social insects

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,320
is that they have hierarchical level.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,320
For example, they have workers, they have queens.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,120
Sometimes they will have big soldiers,

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,240
like a larger body size.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,560
And also all of the characters I mentioned,

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,640
they're all females.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,360
For those sexual reproductive system social insects,

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,680
they do have males.

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,360
So how do we distinguish the male and the female

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,280
social insects?

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Oh, by the way, termites, it's kind of awkward.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,760
The sexual determination for termites,

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,240
it's different as honeybees, wasps, or ants.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,600
And we're not going to explore too much

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,480
about termites today.

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Okay, so when we talk about the sex determination

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,960
for use of social insects, let's take ants as the example.

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,720
This is the word that people will see.

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,760
We call the haploid diploidy.

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,320
So haploid means one set of chromosome

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,200
and diploid means like two sets of chromosome.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Take us human being as the example,

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,160
we are diploid.

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,480
Okay, that means we have two sets of chromosome.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,640
And the way that human being decides the sex

53
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,960
is based on X or Y chromosome.

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,720
But the story is different in ants world.

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,960
For the males, for the male ants,

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,840
they actually only have one set of chromosome,

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,320
which is haploid.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,240
And for the females, including queens or workers,

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,800
they do have two sets of chromosome.

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,200
So let's say if the egg got fertilized,

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,320
that will become a future queen or future worker,

62
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,880
which is a female, right?

63
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,840
If the egg didn't get fertilized successfully,

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,280
can be a trophic egg or it can be a male, right?

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,280
So as I mentioned that Disney influenced me a lot

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,240
since my childhood,

67
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,000
but actually sometimes they make some mistakes.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So this is the clip from the Bugs Life by Pixar Disney.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,120
The left hand side,

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
that's supposed to be a male worker in that movie,

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,680
his name is Flick.

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,600
And the right hand side is the princess Ada,

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,720
a female version queen that Flick fall in love with.

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,840
One thing, the first thing Pixar made like wrongly

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,280
is Flick can never be a male worker.

76
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,480
There's no male worker, okay?

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,120
And a second, if we consider the real situation

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,080
in the field, talking about Ada,

79
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,120
this genus, Ada Texana,

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,880
the queen, the size of the queen

81
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,560
is way bigger than the worker.

82
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,560
So if we want to correct Pixar in the movie,

83
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,000
it should be like this.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,280
So that's a queen and a worker, okay?

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,120
And what's the real situation?

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,000
Here is the Ada queen and here is the worker, okay?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
So how do you decide?

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,840
How does the egg decide to be a queen or a worker?

89
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,560
Since both of them,

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
they are deployed like a fertilized eggs.

91
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,000
It's still a mystery, okay?

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So here I have a simple cartoon figure to show you.

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,600
Question marks on the slides means

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,880
there's still something like the mechanism

95
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,560
that we don't know.

96
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,560
So back to 1990s, Diana Wither and other groups,

97
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,280
they thought juvenile hormone plays an important role

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,240
at the late level stage to determine

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,120
whether that individual will become a future queen

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,640
or just a worker.

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,440
The more juvenile hormone got expressed,

102
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
the higher possibility that individual

103
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,880
will become a queen, okay?

104
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,640
And till 2015, another group, they figured out,

105
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,320
oh, EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor receptor,

106
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,200
gene, plays another important role

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,040
during late level stage,

108
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,720
may involve in caste determination.

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,560
But the other group from Canada, Ahab's lab,

110
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,520
they published a series of paper back to 2008 and 2010,

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,680
and they brought up really interesting

112
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,400
and important finding as they thought

113
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,000
the caste determination may be determined

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,960
at a very, very early stage during oogenesis, okay?

115
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Oogenesis means before the egg being laid,

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,800
i.e. the egg still in the ovary.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
Due to some gene regulation,

118
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,040
their final character, like either queen or worker,

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,160
will be determined, okay?

120
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,840
And how about the embryo development?

121
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,800
Do people know anything about embryo development?

122
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
The answer is no before I start to have my PhD.

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,160
And that was actually quite surprising

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,200
because people study ants a lot.

125
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
For example, like fire ants, like how to kill them, right?

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,640
But or some interesting ecological concepts

127
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
or behavioral studies,

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,120
like ants are one of the hottest species

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,480
when you study insects

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,560
that people will just use as a material.

131
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
But surprisingly, we don't know too much

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,040
during the egg stage or the larva stage

133
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,680
or the pupa stage, okay?

134
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,840
People apparently care more about the later on stage

135
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
like the adult, like what's their behavior.

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,600
So when I look back to those references,

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,080
we left so many question marks, okay?

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,600
No matter like how many people study ants,

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,360
we still don't know too much about egg stage.

140
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,560
And there was the paper back to 2006

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,800
and they show some footage

142
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
of the embryo development of two ants.

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,320
The left-hand side, this one is Argentine ants,

144
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,760
which is the huge pest.

145
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,480
And this one is the Ferroni ants,

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,800
also a pest and it's quite common.

147
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
We also have that in Taiwan.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,400
In the whole paper, there's only six figures

149
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,640
to show how does the embryo grow,

150
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,640
but to me, it's not informative enough, right?

151
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,080
Because I want to see like the start and the end.

152
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,720
Based on the figure, people thought like,

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,160
maybe the ants embryo development

154
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,160
is similar to Drosophila based on figure D.

155
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,720
Okay, why do people think like that way?

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,760
So there are three types of the embryo,

157
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
the insect embryos, okay?

158
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,320
Based on the size of the germ band,

159
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,480
we call it insect fate map, okay?

160
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Here represents three types of the embryo,

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,120
long, intermediate and short, okay?

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,560
The color part is the germ band,

163
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,520
which will become a future embryo, a future larva, okay?

164
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
For the long germ band species,

165
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,440
you will have the head, thorax and abdomen part, okay?

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,720
If you are not too familiar with insects,

167
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,520
that's one, the three of the majority part of the body

168
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,760
of insects, head, thorax and abdomen,

169
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,360
well, and wings and legs.

170
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,520
For the intermediate germ band species like beetles,

171
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,960
at the beginning, once the egg being laid,

172
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,520
you won't be able to see the abdomen part,

173
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,960
you will see head part and part of the thorax, okay?

174
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,120
So that's the short germ band species like crickets, okay?

175
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,160
So I put a wasp here.

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,280
For social insects, lots of scientists,

177
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,400
they study honeybees and wasps,

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,400
and they compare the Drosophila,

179
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,640
one of the most famous model species

180
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
that people study embryo development.

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
They compare the wasp embryogenesis

182
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,720
and the honeybee embryogenesis with Drosophila,

183
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,400
and they figured out, oh, actually, they're pretty similar.

184
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,600
Those social insects, the wasps and the honeybees,

185
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,840
embryogenesis are pretty similar to Drosophila.

186
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,200
So people didn't pay enough attention to ants

187
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,960
and they just referred to, based on whatever they knew,

188
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,880
and they thought, oh, maybe ants,

189
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,840
it's similar to honeybees or wasps,

190
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,960
because they belong to the same order, okay?

191
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,480
And today, I'm going to show you that's not the truth.

192
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,960
That's not the whole story.

193
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,000
So four things I want to show you as the first,

194
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,440
well, I will talk about the ant embryogenesis,

195
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,720
but I will involve two different species,

196
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
except the Adatexanthum.

197
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,720
I will also include Microsaparus methi,

198
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,480
and I will explain what is the high

199
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,320
and lower agriculture mean later.

200
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,680
That's the first part.

201
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,120
And the second, I want to compare two types of eggs.

202
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,840
One is laid by the foundress,

203
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
one is laid by the mature queen.

204
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,840
Foundress means the new daughter queens

205
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,960
just fly out from the nest and have the mating flight

206
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,800
and start to build their own kingdom, their own colony, okay?

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,760
The fresh queen, okay?

208
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,440
Like the one you saw from the Pixar on the Bug's Life.

209
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,520
That's the foundress.

210
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,040
That's the virgin queen.

211
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,320
And the third part, I'm going to use

212
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,360
two genetic staining evidence to prove

213
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,360
that the ant embryogenesis is not the same

214
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,800
as honeybees or wasps.

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,200
And the last part, that's kind of like a side project

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,680
that I was lucky enough to figure out.

217
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,880
We found out some new story about the trophic egg,

218
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,960
and I will go deeper after.

219
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,680
So here's the first part.

220
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,800
The difference of embryogenesis

221
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,600
between low and high agriculture ants.

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,720
Here are the two species I include.

223
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,120
The Ana texana, the leaf color ants,

224
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,360
is the high level agriculture

225
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,520
based on the phylogeny tree.

226
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,440
And I will show you in the next slide.

227
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,160
And M. smithii is the low agriculture ants, okay?

228
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
And there are several features I want to point out

229
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,920
to show how different these two ants

230
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,440
are in different perspectives,

231
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,360
like the ecology or even the reproductive system.

232
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,120
First, Ana texana is sexual.

233
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,520
They do have the male,

234
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,840
but M. smithii, microcephalus smithii, they're asexual.

235
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,920
People also call them pathogenesis.

236
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,920
And the second feature is if you go to the fields,

237
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,280
you will figure out there are different size

238
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,160
of the workers of Ana texana.

239
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,120
There are some small workers, there are some big workers,

240
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,120
but for M. smithii,

241
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,800
they are no difference between worker size, okay?

242
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,640
They're almost identical.

243
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,960
Well, they're clonal, right?

244
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,840
They're asexual.

245
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,480
And so that's the size.

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,080
It's pretty similar.

247
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,800
So what is the high and low agriculture mean?

248
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,120
It's based on the position of the phylogeny tree, okay?

249
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Here is the low agriculture ants,

250
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,560
the microcephalus smithii,

251
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,600
and Ana texana is the high agriculture.

252
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,680
In the fields, the low agriculture ants

253
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,680
not only use some dead leaf parts

254
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,360
or roses or branches to cultivate their fungus,

255
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,760
but also they collect caterpillar poops

256
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
to grow the fungus.

257
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
And the Ana texana, they basically cut the leaves

258
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,040
and bring the leaves back to the colony,

259
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,400
use those leaves as a nutrient to cultivate the fungus,

260
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,560
grow the fungus, and they eat the fungus.

261
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,520
So overall, we call them Antennae ants, okay?

262
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,240
Antennae ants means the ants will grow the fungus

263
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,720
in no matter what perspectives,

264
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,920
like in different ways,

265
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,200
and they eat the fungus and they live in the fungus.

266
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,120
So they are farmers, okay?

267
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,520
So when we look at the life history

268
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,200
for those two different Antennae ants,

269
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,200
they're on the two sides of the phylogeny tree.

270
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
We may think, oh, they're so different

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
based on their behavior, based on their ecology,

272
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,960
even their morphology, they look so different.

273
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,480
But surprisingly, they spend their egg stage,

274
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,800
it's almost identical.

275
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,280
So what does that mean?

276
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,600
That means they spend most of the,

277
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
I mean, sorry, they spend,

278
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,400
both of them spend about 20 days for hatching.

279
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,080
And how about those details

280
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,680
during the embryogenesis, the features, okay?

281
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
So the next slide shows the complete,

282
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,040
the first complete development table

283
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,760
for the Adatexana, okay?

284
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,800
From day one to day 15,

285
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,600
the eggs were from the foundresses,

286
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,200
from those nude or the queens, okay?

287
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,800
So there are lots of information here,

288
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,720
and I'm going to show you one by one,

289
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
explain one by one.

290
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,800
So the egg is about 300 micrometer,

291
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,720
and day two, you will see lots of nuclei

292
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,800
showed up on the surface of the egg.

293
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,920
We call it blastodon, okay?

294
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,280
Once you see that, the future embryo nuclei

295
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,720
will start to gather to the posterior part

296
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,240
of the egg and form a heart-shaped embryo, okay?

297
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,480
So first stage will be blastodon,

298
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,120
and the second stage will be the heart-shaped embryo.

299
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,960
The third stage will be the elongation stage, okay?

300
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,560
When the heart-shaped embryo, the germ band formed,

301
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,040
the embryo will start to elongate

302
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,320
and form gradually day by day when it gets older.

303
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,280
So the elongation stage

304
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,560
was from day four to day eight, okay?

305
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,640
And insects, they're autopods.

306
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,560
They have axoskeletons, right?

307
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
And they have different segments.

308
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,760
So segmentation is the final step

309
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,960
that's when the embryo grows.

310
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,080
So day nine, you can start to see those lobes forming,

311
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,760
the segments forming,

312
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,880
and till day 12, you can see,

313
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,520
compared with day nine, day 12,

314
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,480
there are more and more lobes adding up.

315
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,240
Day five, it's almost like lava.

316
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,160
And then the next day,

317
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,400
or within the same day, it will hatch, okay?

318
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,520
That's the overall concept of embryo development

319
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,200
of adatexana.

320
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,160
How about microcephalus methi?

321
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,800
It's pretty similar.

322
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,040
Sorry, the footage is,

323
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,640
some of the images are kind of foggy.

324
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,720
That was the image I took almost three years ago,

325
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,800
and we are recollecting the data for M. smethi.

326
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,400
But on day five, you can see the heart shape,

327
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,080
the future embryo formed,

328
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,080
and then the elongation happening,

329
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,200
and then segmentation happening,

330
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,560
just as same as what you saw from adatexana, okay?

331
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,360
So if we look at those four stages of two ants,

332
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,040
of these two Antennae ants,

333
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,640
higher agriculture ants, adatexana,

334
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,120
and lower agriculture ants, microcephalus methi,

335
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,080
those really similar feature, okay?

336
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,240
So the first part, the conclusion is,

337
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,240
even on the ecology, ecological or behavior perspectives,

338
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,200
they're so different,

339
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,040
but when we look at their embryogenesis,

340
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,760
they're actually quite similar.

341
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,480
All right.

342
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,480
The second part is the differences

343
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,480
between the adafoundraces and the mature queen laid eggs.

344
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,920
So why is it interesting to compare this two?

345
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,840
For a long time, people who study ants found out

346
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,640
that for those foundraces laid eggs,

347
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,920
they will usually hatch faster.

348
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,480
Oh, sorry, not hatch faster only.

349
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
For those foundraces,

350
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
usually they will have the first broods of workers

351
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,520
earlier than the mature colony, okay?

352
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,240
But for ants, there are different stages,

353
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,360
egg stage, lava stage, lava stage,

354
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,040
pupa stage, and then worker.

355
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,120
We don't know which stage got speed up,

356
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,840
or every stage got speed up evenly, okay?

357
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,400
For a long time, we just know,

358
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,600
for those new queens,

359
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,720
they will have the first broods of workers faster

360
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,400
than the regular queen,

361
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,240
but we want to know more details.

362
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,240
So since I have the expertise in studying ants' embryogenesis,

363
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,040
the egg development,

364
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,440
I examined the eggs laid by the foundraces the past summer,

365
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,800
and we found out something interesting.

366
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
So I hope you still have the concept

367
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
for the whole developmental series

368
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,840
in your mind of Antitech Center.

369
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,960
If we compare the eggs laid by those foundraces

370
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,480
and the eggs laid by the mature queens on the same day,

371
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,480
we can actually see the segmentation happens

372
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,680
faster in the foundrace-laid eggs, okay?

373
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,000
This is on day nine.

374
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,800
Three mouse part segments, the lobe formed,

375
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,760
and the future thorax segments formed already

376
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,880
on day nine of the adenue.

377
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,560
Adenue means the foundrace-laid eggs, okay?

378
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,480
But nothing happened except the future head lobe formed

379
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,040
in the mature queen-laid eggs.

380
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,120
How about day 12?

381
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So if we compare day 12,

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
we can see actually from the new adenue,

383
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
the foundrace-laid eggs, sorry, the phrase is so long.

384
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,800
The foundrace-laid eggs will form multiple segments

385
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,800
at this stage, but not the mature queen-laid eggs, okay?

386
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,200
But does that mean there's no gene expression

387
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
involved in segmentation at this stage?

388
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
No, that's wrong.

389
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,840
So even there's no obvious morphological lobes formed

390
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,960
from those mature queen-laid eggs embryos at this stage,

391
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,640
there's some conserved genes.

392
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,280
For example, windlass here already has the expression.

393
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,600
And I will go deeper for those gene expression later.

394
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,080
At this moment, I want to point out that

395
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,200
we firstly saw that actually during the egg stage,

396
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,720
the accelerations got speed up already, okay?

397
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,000
How about the larval stage?

398
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,160
How about the pupa stage?

399
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,440
That we don't know yet,

400
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,520
but they are different at the beginning, okay?

401
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,240
That means those foundraces-laid eggs got speed up

402
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,400
when the egg being laid.

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
So those are the four stages,

404
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
blastorym, heart shape, elongation, and segmentation,

405
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,280
and then labeled at which date each stage happened, okay?

406
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,760
And so why do we have to know that?

407
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,800
Actually, that brought some interesting concept

408
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,800
about maybe we should exam some aging genes

409
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,480
involved in elongation or segmentation at this stage.

410
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,160
We want to figure out what's the causation

411
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,720
for that acceleration, for that speed up.

412
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,520
It's quite interesting, and that will be our next step.

413
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,360
All right.

414
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,520
Okay, in the third part,

415
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,520
I want to explain the germbane type of the ants, okay?

416
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,560
Recall what we just discussed.

417
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,960
The honeybees and the wasps,

418
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,280
their germbane type is the same as Drosophila.

419
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
It's pretty similar to Drosophila.

420
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,400
Drosophila is a fruit fly, okay?

421
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
They're a long germbane species.

422
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,240
And I want to know whether ants has the similar germbane,

423
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,080
or actually ants follow different development pattern.

424
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,400
And when people study the germbane,

425
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,720
we use conserved genes, okay?

426
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,800
What does conserved genes means?

427
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,800
So conserved genes means you can see the same genes

428
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,520
showed up for similar purposes in different species.

429
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,640
In the textbook example,

430
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,960
people compare the hawk's genes

431
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,240
by fly, Drosophila, and the mouse, okay?

432
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,680
Both of those two very different species,

433
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,440
they have hawk's genes.

434
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,440
And they have similar principle in embryo development.

435
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,520
Even the outcome is totally different.

436
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,280
So the hawk's genes expression

437
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,280
involved in segmentation formation in insects, in flies,

438
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,920
but in mammals, in mouse,

439
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,920
it involves in the backbones or somites formation,

440
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,240
or somites formation.

441
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,560
Like if you consider backbone,

442
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,440
it's also kind of like segment-like concept, okay?

443
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,880
So the take-home message for the conserved genes

444
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,880
means, okay, no matter how different the species are,

445
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,120
they share the similar genes involved in similar principle.

446
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,680
And how do they utilize those conserved genes

447
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,640
in studying the germ bin?

448
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,120
So here is quite a little bit complicated.

449
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,360
I hope that can recall your high school biology

450
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,640
or college biology.

451
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,480
First, I want to say is from DNA to RNA to protein,

452
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,680
there are different procedures, not procedures, sorry.

453
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,080
So DNA will be transcribed to RNA

454
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,760
and then it will be translated to protein, okay?

455
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,520
That's how it works in the world, right?

456
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,400
For sometimes, not every DNA

457
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,680
will successfully being translated to protein.

458
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Sometimes it will just end at the transcription step,

459
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,240
like they will stop at mRNA

460
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,440
and no more protein will be made, okay?

461
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,640
And sometimes, yes, you will see DNA RNA

462
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,680
and then find a product protein, okay?

463
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,040
For those genes, for those conserved genes,

464
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,680
which will stop at mRNA stage,

465
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,480
we have to use in-situ hybridization.

466
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,600
And for the genes will successfully

467
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,960
being translated to protein,

468
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,800
we use immunohybridization, all right?

469
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,160
So let me explain it slowly.

470
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,520
For in-situ hybridization,

471
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,240
we have to make the RNA probe

472
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
by using a DIC-labeled nucleotide.

473
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,760
So DIC-label is just like a price tag, okay?

474
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,280
Attached to those nucleotides.

475
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,720
Nucleotides are the code for your sequence,

476
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,400
for our DNA or RNA, okay?

477
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,240
What are those codes?

478
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Those are ATCG and for DNA, AUCG for RNA.

479
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,160
So we assemble those RNA probe

480
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,360
with the DIC-labeled nucleotide.

481
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,120
That's the first step.

482
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,440
And the second step,

483
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,440
we treat the sample with anti-DIC antibody.

484
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,240
So that's another concept.

485
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,840
Back to your high school or college biology.

486
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,440
What is the antigen?

487
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,160
What is the antibody?

488
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,680
So during spring, there's lots of pollen, right?

489
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,840
And you will sneeze

490
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,240
and you will have some immunoreaction.

491
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,760
The reason why you will sneeze

492
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,600
is because those pollens you sniff in,

493
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
those are the antigen.

494
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,920
And your body, you have your immunosystem.

495
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,840
Your body will recognize that out here

496
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,240
as a bad thing and start to generate,

497
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,280
start to make antibody.

498
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,480
So when the next time you face the same antigen

499
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,600
like the pollen,

500
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,480
your body will have enough antibody

501
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,880
to make that reaction

502
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,760
so you can sneeze those bad things

503
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,800
which are pollens out, right?

504
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,560
The bad things that is bad to your body.

505
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,920
So this is the same idea.

506
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,800
The DIC-labeled, the DIC,

507
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,480
is the site that the anti-DIC antibody can bind to.

508
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,720
It's like making different layers of sandwiches.

509
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,680
And we also have the alkaline phosphatase

510
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,960
attached to that antibody.

511
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,320
And then we use chemicals, MBT and BCIP,

512
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,160
to make the color.

513
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,360
Okay, that's the reason why we can see

514
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,680
with this successful binding

515
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,840
between the DIC-labeled conjugated probe,

516
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,720
the RNA probe we made with the DIC,

517
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,720
and the successful binding of the anti-DIC antibody

518
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,120
attached to it,

519
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,040
we can, and then the next layer is the MBT-BCIP.

520
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,840
We can successfully see those colors, okay?

521
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,200
I hope I explained it clearly.

522
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,920
So three layers.

523
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,040
The first is the MRA, okay?

524
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,720
The MRA expression exists in the embryo at somewhere,

525
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,360
but how do we see that, right?

526
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
We need to see some color, right?

527
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,680
So we know where does it happen.

528
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,200
And how do we know?

529
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,560
First, we make the probe, the MRA probe,

530
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,400
to anneal with it,

531
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,400
and then we treat them, the antibody,

532
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
the antibody attached to a non-detect,

533
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,040
and we use chemicals to trigger that colorization

534
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,520
so we can see the color.

535
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,680
When we see the color,

536
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,720
we know where does the MRA got expressed.

537
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,520
That's the big story in short.

538
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,600
That's in-situ hybridization.

539
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,800
Immunohybridization, same idea.

540
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,720
We also treat them with different antibody.

541
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,240
First layer is the antigen.

542
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,640
You can consider as a protein.

543
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,840
There are some binding sites on the protein

544
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,600
that the antibody can recognize, okay?

545
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,760
So two layers in this picture.

546
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,760
The first antibody will bind to that protein, right?

547
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,600
And then we treat the sample

548
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,720
with a second layer antibody

549
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,760
which attached to a fluorescent tag

550
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,520
so we can see the color

551
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,520
after the tag got excited by the laser, okay?

552
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,560
Well, same idea, okay?

553
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,040
I hope you don't get confused at this moment.

554
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,040
So for in-situ hybridization,

555
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,040
as for those expression stops at MRA, right?

556
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
Because there's no protein.

557
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,640
So no protein can be reproduced

558
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,680
so there's no way you can use the immunohybridization

559
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,600
to see the colorization.

560
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
But for the immunohybridization,

561
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,840
since you can easily make antibody attached to the protein,

562
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,960
then we don't have to make the probe.

563
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
Right.

564
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,040
And what do I want to see?

565
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,080
There are two conserved genes involved in segmentation

566
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,080
that you can see it in even really different species.

567
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,720
So this is the example

568
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
for grasshopper embryo development.

569
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,440
Witless is the first gene.

570
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,000
Engrailed is the second gene.

571
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
In each segment of the insect's embryo,

572
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,600
witless MRA will be expressed

573
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,480
at the anterior part of each segment.

574
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,400
Engrailed protein will be translated

575
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,080
at the posterior part of each segment.

576
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,280
So in the real sample,

577
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,480
you will see witless, engrailed, witless,

578
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,040
engrailed, witless, engrailed,

579
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,440
just like the cartoon that I showed you, okay?

580
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,280
For the mouse part, for the thorax,

581
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,000
for the abdominal segments.

582
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,360
How about those expression in ants, okay?

583
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,720
And why is it important

584
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,120
to see those two genes involved in ants?

585
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,920
For Drosophila, for fruit fly,

586
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,000
those segmentation gene expression

587
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,920
showed up in the same time.

588
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,720
That's the typical feature for long-germband species.

589
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,040
So people study honeybee embryo development,

590
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,640
they see the same pattern,

591
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,040
those bands showed up in the same time.

592
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,120
Sometimes depends on the species.

593
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,880
Sometimes it's like 14 stripes,

594
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,560
sometimes like 16 stripes.

595
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,680
Depends on whether it's a wasp or honeybees, okay?

596
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,360
But if you see all the bands showed up in the same time,

597
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,960
that's the typical feature for a long-germband species.

598
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
But not for a short or intermediate germband species.

599
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,560
That's the reason why I use those two genes

600
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,760
to see whether ant embryo is similar

601
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,640
to honeybees or not, right?

602
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,720
So with the concept of the whole story

603
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,360
of the ant development pattern, the embryogenesis,

604
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,720
I can, we can easily figure it out

605
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,720
when is the proper time for us to apply those probes,

606
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,000
like the wingless or the engrossed antibody, right?

607
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,080
We definitely don't want to apply those probes

608
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,920
at a very early stage before any segments formed, right?

609
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,440
Like the heart-shaped stage, no matter how hard we try,

610
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,480
there's no way we can see the signal, right?

611
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,440
We got to apply the probes or antibody at the right time.

612
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,520
That's one of the important reason

613
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,520
why we have to know the developmental table first.

614
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,720
So with that idea, with that concept,

615
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,800
we know between day nine to day 12,

616
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000
like when the segments starting to pop out,

617
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,720
are the good timing for us to apply those conserved genes,

618
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,720
probes or antibody, okay, to see the signal expression.

619
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,000
So for wingless on day nine, as you can see,

620
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,120
there's no obvious stripes formed yet,

621
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,480
but started by day 10,

622
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,120
you can see three stripes over here,

623
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,480
the top row and this bottom row,

624
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,640
there are the same data,

625
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
but just use different way

626
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,600
to show the bands to the audience, right?

627
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,400
And when the embryo gets older,

628
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,840
more stripes are adding up, okay?

629
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,400
Those are the stripes number.

630
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
Day nine, you got zero.

631
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,600
Day 10, we see four.

632
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,840
Between day 10 and day 11, we see 10.

633
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,480
And until day 12, we got 12, okay?

634
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,480
So that's the evidence to prove that those segments,

635
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,640
those stripes are actually adding up.

636
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,720
They didn't show up simultaneously.

637
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,400
How about the engraved?

638
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,320
Let me recall that wingless and engraved

639
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,360
will be expressed at the same time.

640
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
One is at the anterior,

641
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,000
one is at the posterior of the segments, right?

642
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,320
So we should be able to see the similar pattern

643
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,480
when we examine the engraved gene expression,

644
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,520
engraved protein.

645
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,240
So the day 10 embryo,

646
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,080
you can see there's only eight stripes, okay?

647
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,000
But when the embryo gets older,

648
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,480
the stripes number get adding up.

649
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,280
So that's the second evidence to show,

650
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,200
all right, actually embryogenesis

651
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,880
follow different development pattern

652
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,160
as other social insects, okay?

653
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,160
So they're actually not long-term band species, okay?

654
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,120
They're more similar to like tribolium,

655
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,640
like the beetles or the crickets.

656
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,160
That's a really interesting and surprising finding.

657
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,120
How about other social insects

658
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,720
that is not similar to honeybees or wasps?

659
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,480
Yes, we do find the evidence.

660
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,320
There's another wasp show a different,

661
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,520
show the similar pattern,

662
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,080
development pattern as the ants,

663
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,720
which is either we can call it a short-term band

664
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,040
or intermediate-term band development.

665
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,680
So the green signals are the engraved protein,

666
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,440
like the one you just showed.

667
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,440
You can see when the embryo grow from A to H,

668
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,200
you start to see the signal adding up.

669
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,200
C, you only see one band, one, yeah.

670
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,640
You see, well, this is the first band got formed.

671
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,440
It's not the actual band yet.

672
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
But D, you see like three stripes,

673
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,560
and E, you got more stripes,

674
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,880
and till H, like before,

675
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,360
you see like 16 stripes, 14 to 16 stripes.

676
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,440
Okay, and the red dots over here,

677
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,000
those are another different gene called VASA.

678
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,240
We're not going to explain too much.

679
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,880
I'm not going to explain VASA today.

680
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,200
So not just in ants, but also other social insects,

681
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,040
different wasps show the short-term

682
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,600
or intermediate-term band embryo development pattern.

683
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,560
All right.

684
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,480
So can we say that the ants

685
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,360
has identical development pattern as crickets,

686
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,080
because they're not the same as flies or honeybees?

687
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,400
No, we can't say that.

688
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,280
I used the embryogenesis figure from two papers.

689
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,600
First, we know, okay,

690
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,880
based on the adding up stripes feature,

691
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,040
ants are not like flies or honeybees.

692
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,040
But the embryo, the germ band formed completely.

693
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,920
Imagine the germ band is the hot dog,

694
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,400
and the yolk, the rest of the embryo is the bone, okay?

695
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,520
The ant embryo formed the hot dog first,

696
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,640
like completely, and then segments formed gradually.

697
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,320
But in the short-term band species like crickets,

698
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
you don't see the full hot dog first.

699
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,920
You see part of the hot dog,

700
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,680
and then more segments adding up.

701
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,600
So when the embryo gets older,

702
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,080
the hot dog, the germ band gets longer and longer, okay?

703
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,080
In ants, you see the germ band formed completely,

704
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
then segmentation.

705
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,440
But in crickets, well,

706
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,440
you don't see that four complete developed germ band.

707
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,480
You see the segments and the germ band elongation,

708
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,960
like it happens in the short-term band.

709
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,880
Germ band, sorry.

710
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,400
You see the segmentation adding up

711
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,520
and the germ band elongation in the same time, okay?

712
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,600
So we think at this moment,

713
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,280
based on our DAPI standing morphological data

714
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,960
of the development table,

715
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
and the two conserved gene expression data,

716
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,960
the ants' embryogenesis is more like a mixture

717
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
of long-term band and short-term band, okay?

718
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,280
And the next part will be the trophic egg.

719
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,120
So trophic egg means the nutrient, okay?

720
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,920
And for a long time,

721
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,000
for those entomologists who study ants,

722
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,720
trophic eggs are considered

723
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,240
as one of the nutrients to those babies, okay?

724
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,120
Here's the picture I took that the workers,

725
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,800
the worker of Adatexana guards those eggs,

726
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,600
her future sisters in the fungus garden.

727
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,120
Usually the workers will chop off the trophic eggs

728
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,120
and feed those larvae when the fungus start to grow,

729
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,600
I mean, in the founding colony, right?

730
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,720
In the founding colony,

731
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,040
the queen only has small piece of fungus,

732
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,800
so there's limited food resource.

733
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,120
Therefore, the queen has to lay some trophic eggs

734
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,360
and use those nutrients, the workers,

735
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,480
either the workers will use the trophic eggs

736
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
to feed those babies,

737
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,560
or before the first broods of workers come out,

738
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,880
the queen will chop off those trophic eggs

739
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,480
and feeds them as a nutrient,

740
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,880
feeds to the first broods of baby as a nutrient, okay?

741
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,080
And the life history trade for a fungus growing ant

742
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,680
is the queen lay eggs,

743
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,400
and also she brought a small patch of the fungus

744
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,480
from the mother colony

745
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,080
and use her feces, poops,

746
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,760
to cultivate the fungus.

747
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,760
Meanwhile, take care of those broods

748
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,360
and make them, help them to grow up successfully,

749
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,120
and those workers, once she has those workers,

750
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,840
enough workers, those workers will take care of her

751
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,920
and also start to make the fungus garden be bigger,

752
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,640
like this, right?

753
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,000
And one interesting thing that I discovered,

754
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,520
like luckily, a few months ago,

755
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,040
is we found a new type of trophic eggs, right?

756
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,080
So when I first look at that,

757
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,000
I just thought, why the eggs,

758
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,200
the morphology of the eggs is so different,

759
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,120
they're so bizarre,

760
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,880
it looks like two eggs attached to each other.

761
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,520
And then I did multiple different sampling.

762
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,400
I figured out, actually, here are the fertilized eggs,

763
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,640
like here,

764
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,000
and those two are the huge, massive trophic eggs

765
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,840
that anneal to each other,

766
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,760
and even deform, okay?

767
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,080
So I sampled, like I got more samples

768
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,600
from those funguses,

769
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,280
and we can clearly see that those funguses,

770
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,040
they do lay trophic eggs,

771
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
like those massive trophic eggs

772
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,440
and the fertilized eggs in the same time, okay?

773
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,120
This is not the same you can see from the mature garden.

774
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,320
For the mature garden,

775
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,120
that we have, like four or five years old garden,

776
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,840
those queens only lay fertilized eggs.

777
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,840
So only during the foundries,

778
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,920
only during the foundry level,

779
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,600
like when they start to establish the fungus garden,

780
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,360
you can see those trophic eggs.

781
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,600
And here is their cartoon figure

782
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,320
to show three types of eggs.

783
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,840
The first one is the fertilized eggs,

784
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,480
like regular egg, the 2N egg,

785
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,000
and the second is, we call it trophic A,

786
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and the third is the trophic B.

787
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,240
Here's the actual figure for fertilized trophic A

788
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,600
and trophic B, okay?

789
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,360
And I'll have more footage to show you

790
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,120
how do I distinguish whether that egg

791
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,280
is a trophic A or trophic B.

792
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,440
So let's focus on trophic B first.

793
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,480
One interesting feature for trophic B is

794
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,840
the egg is just like a water balloon.

795
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,760
It's so massive.

796
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,680
And when you place it on their solid place,

797
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,840
solid surface, it will deform, okay?

798
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,440
And if you place it on the fungus garden,

799
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,360
after 24 hours, it will be liquefied or deliquent.

800
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,520
Okay, what does that mean?

801
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,200
Why is it important to see,

802
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,840
like, why is it interesting?

803
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,040
So trophic eggs, for a long time,

804
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,520
people just think, people think,

805
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,360
or observe that either the new queen

806
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,360
or the new workers will use them to feed the babies.

807
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,120
But this is the first evidence,

808
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,440
first discovery to see that actually

809
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,720
trophic B egg can also be one of the nutrients

810
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,080
for the fungus garden, okay?

811
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,640
The fungus garden started with a small patch,

812
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,240
like a really small piece,

813
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,240
when the new queen fly out from their mother colony.

814
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,600
And the fungus garden ants,

815
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,240
the fungus garden ants, the leaf collar ants,

816
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,960
they cannot live without fungus.

817
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,760
No matter how many workers they got,

818
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,240
once they lost the fungus,

819
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,040
the whole colony will just die, okay?

820
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,560
So it's really important to make sure

821
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,720
that small patch of the fungus

822
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,840
the queen brought out from the mother colony

823
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,600
can successfully be cultivated

824
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,000
during the first or second month, right?

825
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,400
Okay, so we hypothesize that

826
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,360
the trophic B, the egg laid by the queen

827
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,920
has the evolutionary benefits

828
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,120
to make sure the fungus garden

829
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,440
can obtain, receive enough nutrient.

830
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,560
This is another replication that we did the collection,

831
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,800
and you can see after two hours,

832
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,720
in the first footage,

833
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,520
you see three trophic B eggs.

834
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,440
After 24 hours,

835
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,320
we clearly see that the trophic eggs

836
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,360
got deliquid, liquefied, okay?

837
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,840
So would the egg be liquefied

838
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,880
by the fungus only,

839
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,280
or it will be liquefied just by itself?

840
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,760
I mean, without the fungus,

841
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,880
we're really interesting to know that.

842
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,320
The next step we did

843
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,600
is we put the trophic B egg

844
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,880
on the compost slab

845
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,440
in the close to 100% humidity environment.

846
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,840
In the petri dish they've created,

847
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,800
after 24 hours,

848
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,480
the egg will be deliquid by itself, okay?

849
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,600
So it proves that

850
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,880
this is a really nice

851
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,960
co-evolutionary evidence

852
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,680
to help the fungus,

853
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,400
to help the queen,

854
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,080
like on both parties, right?

855
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,040
So the queen needs the fungus,

856
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,360
and she will lay those trophic eggs

857
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,480
to help her to maintain the fungus,

858
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,880
to grow the fungus to be better, okay?

859
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,320
And the egg itself will deliquid,

860
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,680
so it will provide the nutrient

861
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,280
or the water to that small fungus

862
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,280
and help them to grow well at the beginning, right?

863
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,880
We have more image to show the difference

864
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,560
between the fertilized eggs,

865
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,720
trophic A egg,

866
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,320
and trophic B egg.

867
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,720
For the fertilized eggs,

868
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,560
usually the eggs will be guarded by the worker,

869
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,560
and after 20 days,

870
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,680
depends on the temperature,

871
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,240
or 15 days,

872
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,400
it will hatch to larvae,

873
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,240
and will grow up to worker.

874
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,960
And those fungus,

875
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,480
the mycelium cannot intrude to those eggs,

876
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,720
cannot harm those eggs, okay?

877
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,680
On bigger B,

878
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,320
you can see the mycelium grow

879
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,680
on the surface of the egg,

880
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,440
but the egg's still pretty good,

881
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,800
in a good status.

882
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,040
And bigger C,

883
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,200
you can see the egg's still really,

884
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,520
it's not damaged.

885
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,600
But how about the other two trophic eggs,

886
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,800
the trophic A and trophic B, okay?

887
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,440
For the trophic A egg,

888
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,360
the mycelium will start to absorb

889
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,240
the nutrient from inside,

890
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,760
and cause the dent,

891
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,480
and eventually it just sucked up

892
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,280
all the nutrient by days,

893
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,400
like after 13 days.

894
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,400
And the trophic B egg,

895
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,240
it will deliquest by itself, okay?

896
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,200
Just like the way I explained to you,

897
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,600
and why it is important

898
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,320
to help to cultivate the fungus garden.

899
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,120
Okay.

900
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,920
So besides the image evidence,

901
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,240
I also fixed the trophic A egg

902
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,440
to prove that

903
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,160
we have two types of trophic egg.

904
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,160
So for the fertilized egg,

905
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,000
day five,

906
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,960
you can see the embryo start to grow,

907
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,920
like during the elongation.

908
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,360
This is the future head lobe,

909
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,240
here's the future body.

910
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,920
But the trophic A egg,

911
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,080
there's only a single nuclei,

912
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,800
and nothing happens,

913
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,400
and eventually the fungus garden

914
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,280
will absorb the nutrient.

915
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,000
Okay.

916
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,760
The last part of my talk will be,

917
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,880
let's go back to those males, okay?

918
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,920
So I briefly explained

919
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,640
how does the embryo grow in ants,

920
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,080
and the differences between lower

921
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,440
and higher level agriculture ants,

922
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,680
and no matter how different they are,

923
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,600
they show the similar development pattern

924
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,200
of their embryos.

925
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,000
And also, we found out a new type of trophic eggs

926
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,040
that people never discovered before,

927
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,920
and we had the hypothesis that

928
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,160
trophic eggs can also be the nutrient resource

929
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,120
for the fungus garden,

930
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,760
not just for the babies, the larvae.

931
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,360
And one interesting we found out is,

932
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,880
do you remember that I mentioned

933
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,000
the haploid diploid of the insects?

934
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,200
Some haploid eggs laid by the foundresses

935
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,040
will become a male, okay?

936
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,200
But usually that won't happen

937
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,720
when the foundresses started

938
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,240
to establish the colony, right?

939
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,200
Because only female workers are useful

940
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,120
that can help her to maintain everything.

941
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,480
The male individual is totally useless

942
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,840
at that stage.

943
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,040
They do nothing.

944
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,320
They basically just waste the energy,

945
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,320
and also they are not helpful, okay?

946
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,880
Ideally, that won't happen,

947
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,880
but we did find a weird nanotech male

948
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,800
from those founding colony, okay?

949
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,120
And those males are really small.

950
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,200
We call it nanotech.

951
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,440
Nanotech means like lack of nutrient

952
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,840
and body size is really small.

953
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,280
We found out that they have weird,

954
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,720
like fairy wings.

955
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,480
The wings are not well-developed,

956
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,960
and they were just crawling around

957
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,840
in the fungus garden.

958
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Once the pupa occlusion happened,

959
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,440
like became an adult,

960
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,760
the queen will kill that within 48 hours, okay?

961
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,360
Oops, yeah.

962
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,440
So here's the complete vision

963
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,600
for the nanotech male of Eta texana.

964
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,080
The morphology is totally different

965
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,040
as the regular female workers.

966
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,600
We don't know the queen can recognize

967
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,920
the weird nanotech male by vision

968
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,360
or by the smell.

969
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,120
More studies we have to do,

970
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,120
but at least one thing we can assure is

971
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,080
during this stage,

972
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,640
the egg, the larvae, or the pupa stage,

973
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,840
here's the nanotech, future nanotech male.

974
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,560
Before pupa stage,

975
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,360
the queen will still take care of them

976
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,880
as the way the queen takes care of the workers.

977
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,440
But once they become the weird,

978
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,320
crawling around male,

979
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,280
they'll be killed,

980
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,800
like literally ripped off by the queen.

981
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,960
So that's also a new finding

982
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,880
that we're excited to publish

983
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,320
on Insect Social

984
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,920
of the behavior

985
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,400
so the queen knows

986
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,800
those are not actual helpful workers

987
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,640
and they will just kill them.

988
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,280
But the stories behind them

989
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,560
is like how does she receive the signal,

990
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,120
how does she know by vision

991
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,000
or by other smell cues

992
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,840
are really interesting to do more research.

993
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,320
All right.

994
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,040
I hope you guys don't fall asleep.

995
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,280
It's a long talk.

996
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,960
And overall,

997
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,520
I finished the four parts.

998
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,880
And thanks for your listening.

999
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,960
And please ask me if you have any question.

1000
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,320
Thank you.

1001
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,960
Okay.

1002
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,560
Thanks for Andy's talk.

1003
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,320
Let's give him a applause first.

1004
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Thank you.

1005
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,680
Don't look at me.

1006
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,520
All right.

1007
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,560
So if you have any questions,

1008
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,360
please just go ahead and ask Andy.

1009
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,560
How many people we have?

1010
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,880
Now we have six, including you.

1011
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,040
Okay.

1012
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,280
Sorry, the talk was like too long.

1013
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,960
I was starving.

1014
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,080
No, I think you're fine.

1015
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,200
But your talk is pretty kind of professional.

1016
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,840
And even I don't understand,

1017
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,840
I would say half of the sites

1018
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,240
because I don't study embryo genesis.

1019
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,920
Anyway, the development of embryos, right?

1020
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,760
Yeah.

1021
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,600
But actually I do have one question.

1022
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,520
Why do we care about?

1023
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,160
So that question,

1024
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,120
so first let me ask,

1025
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,640
what is the germ band though?

1026
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,760
Oh, so the germ band means the embryo.

1027
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,720
The embryo itself.

1028
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,560
Okay.

1029
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,160
So the embryo has the yolk and the future larva.

1030
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,920
And the germ band is just like the hotdog.

1031
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,040
And the yolk is like the bond.

1032
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,320
The overall, the two things,

1033
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,320
we call it an egg, right?

1034
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,160
Yeah.

1035
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,160
So the future larva grow from the germ band.

1036
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,280
Okay, start with the small heart

1037
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,280
and then start to grow bigger and bigger

1038
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,360
and then segments and then form the future larva.

1039
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,400
That's the germ band.

1040
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,480
And why do we need to care the difference

1041
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,680
between long and short germ bands?

1042
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,760
We actually don't have to care about that.

1043
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,560
So, no, that's not true.

1044
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,000
So that doesn't matter.

1045
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,200
That actually doesn't matter.

1046
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,720
Like, okay, yeah, it's long or short.

1047
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,760
But the reason why I want to study this

1048
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,560
is because the very first few slides

1049
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,720
I mentioned cast determination.

1050
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,040
So actually at the beginning,

1051
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,400
I really want to know what are the genes

1052
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,240
involved in cast determination in ants

1053
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,400
if that actually happens during early stage.

1054
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,400
But without knowing the complete development table,

1055
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,280
I can barely can do anything, right?

1056
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,360
I don't have the tool.

1057
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,640
For example, for like flies,

1058
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,320
people know how the embryo grows.

1059
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,600
So I can see different gene expression

1060
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,920
at different stage.

1061
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,000
With that knowledge, I can do some prediction, right?

1062
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:46,720
So if Ahab's theory is not saying it's wrong.

1063
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,400
I mean, if his theory is correct,

1064
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,160
we should be able to see some gene expression

1065
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,520
during the early embryo development.

1066
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,520
But how do I apply those probes?

1067
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,880
How do I apply those genes

1068
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,240
without knowing the development table?

1069
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,680
We can do nothing, right?

1070
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,320
So I got to study like how does the embryo grow first.

1071
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,440
And surprisingly, we figured out,

1072
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,560
oh, okay, so actually they have different pattern

1073
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,040
like other social insects.

1074
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,440
So we divide them into different categories.

1075
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,240
So my finding just like to point out,

1076
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,840
oh, ants, they are more like grasshoppers,

1077
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,960
like crickets, not like honeybees or wasps.

1078
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,520
Okay, so that's just a step

1079
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,320
before you can move on to your further research.

1080
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,440
Exactly, that's the foundation.

1081
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,480
Yes, yes.

1082
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,720
But if you ask like why does long or short matter?

1083
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,680
No, that doesn't matter.

1084
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,240
It's just like a prescription, right?

1085
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,520
Okay, okay, okay.

1086
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,400
Got it.

1087
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,720
All right, are there any other questions?

1088
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,320
Hi, I have two questions.

1089
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,600
So I'm Jason.

1090
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,000
I'm from, I'm Jason Hong.

1091
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,680
I'm like a physics postdoc.

1092
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,360
So, you know, I have no prior knowledge about the ant

1093
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,320
and like I have no limited knowledge about biology.

1094
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,080
So I have like one pretty simple question.

1095
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,400
So you mentioned that for male ant,

1096
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,360
it only has like one set of chromosome

1097
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,200
and for female, there are two, right?

1098
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,360
So like what determines that?

1099
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,480
So for human, we know that it's,

1100
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,520
so you have two kind of sperm.

1101
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,560
So one is with X and one is Y.

1102
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:54,280
And like that determines the sex of your like birth.

1103
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,920
So like what determines that in the ant colony?

1104
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:04,600
Right, so the egg has a single set of chromosome.

1105
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,960
And if the egg got fertilized,

1106
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,960
the sperm will bring another set of chromosome

1107
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,560
into that egg, right?

1108
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,080
So if the egg got fertilized,

1109
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,880
it will be a two ant individual.

1110
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Like it has two sets of chromosome.

1111
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,120
If the egg didn't get fertilized,

1112
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,960
it will be a male supposedly from a mature colony.

1113
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,000
Okay, I see.

1114
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,120
Yeah.

1115
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:38,360
So even not fertilized egg can be hatched in ant egg?

1116
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,000
Theoretically, yes.

1117
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,760
But there's some, like you don't see that,

1118
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,680
you don't see male ants come out from the founding colony.

1119
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,240
Founding colony means the colony just started to grow.

1120
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:58,800
You only see the male ants come out from the mature colony.

1121
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,960
Yeah, so that's also a topic like people want to study

1122
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,480
the reason why.

1123
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,200
Okay, so we don't know why yet?

1124
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:07,840
We don't know.

1125
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,040
We don't know why yet.

1126
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,560
Okay, so I have another question.

1127
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,640
So you mentioned that for the foundress ant

1128
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,840
and the mature queen egg,

1129
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,120
they have a different hatch time.

1130
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,000
Right.

1131
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,520
Right, so also like I guess you show the data,

1132
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:31,600
but I don't remember you explain why that is the case.

1133
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,680
And is there any method we can understand why?

1134
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:42,600
So is it due to chemicals or due to some biological processes?

1135
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,920
Okay, so we don't know the real key factors

1136
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,480
involved in that acceleration.

1137
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,000
And for now, we guess it's because of methylation.

1138
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,760
So, all right, let's put it in the easy way.

1139
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,200
So when, think about you're the new mom

1140
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,480
and you have to start your colony

1141
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,160
and there's so many birds or frogs trying to eat you

1142
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,320
and you got to face those pressures in the field

1143
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,240
and start like also having babies

1144
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,080
and start to build your nest.

1145
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,080
So you want to do that ASAP, right?

1146
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,160
You want to do that as soon as possible.

1147
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,240
Yeah, and that's the reason why we think that makes sense

1148
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:32,040
that those foundresses broods will grow faster.

1149
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,960
Okay.

1150
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,080
Right, but what's the mechanism behind this?

1151
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,680
What's the reason for causing that speeding up process?

1152
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,880
We don't know.

1153
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,960
Okay.

1154
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,360
Oh, I also...

1155
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,400
Oh, sorry.

1156
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,960
Oh, maybe it's okay.

1157
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,200
So I also heard that in humans,

1158
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,360
it's actually like the first birth song,

1159
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,600
you will have a higher probability for like early birth.

1160
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,160
Is that the...

1161
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:07,320
I mean, that might be like a very far away,

1162
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,040
but is that something also similar?

1163
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,600
Oh, I have no idea.

1164
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,800
Really?

1165
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,480
I actually don't know.

1166
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,520
Okay, yeah.

1167
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,920
So I guess you can check.

1168
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,600
I don't know what it is.

1169
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,120
It's a legend.

1170
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,120
It's a rumor kind of thing.

1171
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,800
Okay, okay, cool.

1172
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,120
I will check it.

1173
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,760
Wait, doesn't it mean the first born

1174
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,680
will be larger than the others?

1175
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,720
It will be faster.

1176
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,160
The pregnancy period is shorter.

1177
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,160
Oh.

1178
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,720
In what animal?

1179
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,840
It's more like the rate for early birth is higher.

1180
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,920
Interesting.

1181
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,040
Yeah, I would check it.

1182
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,040
Okay.

1183
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,040
I haven't heard about that as well.

1184
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,240
I'm not very sure.

1185
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,320
So you should double check.

1186
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1187
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
But that's interesting.

1188
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,200
All right.

1189
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
So are there any other questions

1190
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,200
or other concerns or suggestions for Andy?

1191
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
All right, if not,

1192
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,200
I'm going to stop recording this talk.
