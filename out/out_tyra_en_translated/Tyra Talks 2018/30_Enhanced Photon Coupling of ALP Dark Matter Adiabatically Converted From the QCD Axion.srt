00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TAR Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I am very grateful to my good friend, He Shuyu, for being willing to give us this speech on the upcoming New Year's holiday.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First of all, let me introduce He Shuyu. He is currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at Tohoku University in Japan.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
His field of study is mainly in the field of particle cosmology, and he is exploring how to understand the evolution of early universes from the perspective of particle interaction.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Most of his work is related to dark matter, and he did not mention it in the introduction he gave me.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But before he came, he was doing physics with Mr. He Xiaogang at NTU, so it is actually very related to his current research.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have also had a few years of overlap with him in Caltech, where I am now, so we are very good friends.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
His main research recently is Exxon. They think this is one of the most popular candidates for dark matter.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The topic he is going to talk to us about today is also related to Exxon.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,000
His topic is Enhanced Photon Coupling of APL. APL is Exxon-like Particle, Dark Matter Adiabatically Converted from QCD Exxon.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A little reminder, if you want to applaud, remember to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's applaud and welcome He Shuyu to give us today's speech.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
OK, you can start now.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is there a full screen now?

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you mean by full screen?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I am recording a video here, so I have to press the full screen, right?

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is this OK?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, I think this is OK.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
OK, then I will start right away.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Zhang Yiyang has already introduced it to me, so I will talk about it directly.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The topic I want to talk about today is Exxon.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Exxon itself interacts with light.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The interaction between light and Exxon is very small.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In other words, we can't really detect it in the current experiment.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The main purpose of this work is to enhance the coupling with photons from a phenomenal point of view.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Our main method is to match the effect with the so-called MaxMixing of ALP.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will talk about the rest of the details in the following slides.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Before that, I have to give you some preparation knowledge.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Maybe not everyone is familiar with Exxon.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Some people may not even know what DocuMator is.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I will do some basic introduction in the front.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then we will start directly.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The first thing you see now is the so-called example physical standard model.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then we generally call it Standard Model.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or SM, take the first English letter.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Basically, the standard model is very simple.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It is divided into two categories.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
One is the so-called material.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The left side is the so-called material.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The right side is the so-called basic interaction.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The material is actually divided into two categories.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
One is called quark.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The other is called hydrogen.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
For example, everyone is more familiar with Electron.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It belongs to the category of hydrogen.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The other one may not be familiar to everyone.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But in fact, everyone is more familiar with it.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It is the so-called magnet.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like a magnet, there is a so-called

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can see this U quark on the picture.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This up quark is composed of this down quark.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The same is true for neutrons.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So these are the more familiar particles.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course, there are other quarks.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is a new example found later.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In addition to the material,

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Of course, there is also the so-called interaction.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The interaction is basically divided into these categories.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The first one, everyone sees this G.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We call it Grouon.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It is a so-called strong interaction particle.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What about strong interaction?

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We generally call it QCD.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That is, quantum quark dynamic.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We will see this word later.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because this is related to the so-called CP problem we will discuss later.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The second one is the so-called electromagnetic effect.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This should be the most familiar to everyone.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Maybe from high school,

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Even in everyday life, you can know

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This interaction.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What about the electromagnetic effect of this magnet?

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We use light to transmit.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The electromagnetic effect in our field

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We like to call it QED.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That is, quantum electrodynamic.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
In addition to these two effects, there is also the so-called weak effect.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The weak effect is generally used to describe

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The so-called beta decay phenomenon.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Have you noticed that in addition to these interactions,

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There is also an interaction

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not written on this table

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The so-called gravitational effect

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But because of the current standard model

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I didn't include this gravity.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because I didn't find the so-called gravity.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The so-called graviton is the gravity value.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is not included in the standard model.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That may be something else that everyone may be familiar with.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
but

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is the so-called Higgs particle.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What about this Higgs particle?

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It should be 2012.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I remember when I was a substitute

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Found this Higgs particle

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Higgs particle is generally

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The origin of this mass

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is the source of the value

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What about my research today?

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It has something to do with Higgs, but it doesn't have much to do with it.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I mainly focus on the so-called

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This part of the skeleton

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Because this skeleton will lead to

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The so-called action problem

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
it is good

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Of course, although

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Although the quantum mechanics model is currently

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It is very tested by the experiment.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I can't say it's perfect.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But at least most of the current

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Some of the phenomena we see can be used

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Use the particle physics standard model to explain

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Of course, there are some shortcomings.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because there are some problems

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The standard model is incomprehensible

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
For example, the first so-called dark matter

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I will introduce it later.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There is also the so-called strong CP problem.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This is what I translated directly.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Generally, we call it a strong CP problem.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There is also the so-called

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There is also the so-called medium quality

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
For example, just inside this table

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you see this green one?

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The bottom three particles

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is the so-called neutrino

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because in neutrino

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because neutrino is in the standard model

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It has no quality

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But because through

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We see this neutrino oscillation

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This implies that neutrino must have quality

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But the standard model

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Our neutrino can't have quality

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So this is also a standard model

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There is also the so-called dark energy

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Generally, this may be possible

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Use the so-called cosmology constant to explain

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There is also the so-called current gravity

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Today my

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The study is more related to the first

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The so-called dark matter and this

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This strong CP problem

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's introduce the so-called dark matter first.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How do you know that there is a dark matter?

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We can start with this

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This so-called star rotation curve

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look at

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This star rotation curve, I remember

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It should be Rubin

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Rubin said

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He is a female scientist

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But it seems to have passed away a few years ago

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If I remember correctly

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This star rotation is very simple

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That is to say

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We may have learned this Newton's law

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So we can predict that a object

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Just a planet

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do this to the solar system

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If the shape

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What about the speed of this shape?

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It should be with the sun

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Or the center of the star

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What about this distance?

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes, when it's far away

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You should see this star

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The speed changes with the distance

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It should be this red picture on the picture

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That is to say

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If it's far away, it's the distance

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If the center is far away, the speed should be going down

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But what we see is not like this

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What we see is this

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The white part is

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He is at speed

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When it's far away, it's a constant

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is a mystery

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is the Newton's law

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The gravity law to explain

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course there are many

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ideas to deal with this problem

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's easier to say

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Maybe there are some objects

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We can't see it, but it will provide gravity

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you have additional gravity

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can explain this speed

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why is it still a constant far away?

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of course there are other theories

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like the so-called modified gravity

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That is to say, Newton's law

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's not what we usually see

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
For example, FMA may have some corrections

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That can also explain this

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Star curve

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So why is it that the object value

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's a little bit bigger

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because we have a lot of this

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Astronomical evidence

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I just looked at this picture and said that the upper left corner

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is the star curve you just talked about

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In addition, there is also the so-called gravity

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And this mirror seems to be wrong

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That is to say

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If there is a

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Invisible object

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Then it will provide gravity

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If there is a

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
For example, the star is behind this

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Invisible object

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Because you know

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
According to the relativity theory

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The light passes through a place where gravity is very strong

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So this light

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
From behind this star

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It will bend

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Then let us see

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It will be a circle

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Instead of a point

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is the so-called gravitational effect

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In addition, there is the so-called CMB spectrum

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
CMB is the so-called cosmic microwave background

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
radiation

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is a microcosmic microwave background

226
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That is to say

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If we assume that dark matter exists

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
At the same time, there is dark energy

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We can

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Use the cosmological model

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
To fit this so-called Park spectrum

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can see this picture

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
This black dot is a good fit

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Of course, there are some parameters to adjust

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But it is roughly

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The cosmological model

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Can also explain this Park spectrum

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then this

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Must assume the existence of dark matter

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The last more famous is the so-called

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bury cluster

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The so-called Bury cluster is

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When we find that the two clusters are contrasting

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We can see this x-ray

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That signal

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Simply put, I found that in fact

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
In addition to

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This visible part is what you just saw on the picture

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The red and purple part we see

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Part of it is that it goes straight through each other

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And then there is no interaction

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In fact, that can explain

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It may be an evidence of dark matter

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This phenomenon seems to be general

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This correctional gravity seems to be

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's better to explain

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So the last thing is dark matter

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So we have a lot of evidence

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Show the existence of dark matter

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But I still believe that many people

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To challenge the idea of ​​dark matter

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
At present, the mainstream still thinks

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Dark matter is a more feasible

266
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A way

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
it is good

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This is the so-called Cosmic Pi

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It is based on the so-called

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The standard model of cosmology

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We can measure this

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Dark energy, dark matter

273
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And the so-called Baryon, which is the so-called

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like the standard model just now

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The table of particles

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
In this

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The purple part is probably

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If its effect can form a bond state

279
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then we can call this bond state

280
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This Baryon

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That is to say, we are currently

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Except

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
For example, I currently see these stars in the universe

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Most of them are

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
This Baryon and some

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Electrons, some leptons

287
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This one takes up only 5% of the universe's energy

288
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Just very little

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
On the contrary, dark energy and dark matter

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It takes up a very high proportion

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Like this dark matter

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It takes up about a quarter of the universe

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Energy

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Of course, today I will focus on

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
On this dark matter

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What about dark energy

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Generally, of course

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Some people often use this

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Cosmic parameter or some

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The so-called quintessence

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It seems to be called the fifth element

302
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
To explain

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why does dark energy exist?

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That is to say, we have observed

305
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This universe is accelerating expansion

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If we assume this dark energy

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can explain this phenomenon very well

308
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It seems to have won the Nobel Prize

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A few years ago because someone observed

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The accelerating expansion of the universe

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And won the Nobel Prize

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Of course we are familiar with this Baryon

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are some problems

314
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Maybe you have heard of the so-called antimatter

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The universe has so-called positive matter and antimatter

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why is there more positive matter in the universe?

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Antimatter is less, this is also a problem

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
For example, why did I just leave this 5% positive matter?

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This theoretical chemist

320
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Still studying it

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Anyway, today I will focus on

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
On this dark matter

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Since we are studying dark matter

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Of course we have to understand its nature

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It has a few simple

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Simple nature

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The first one is because it is

328
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It is invisible

329
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That is, we just talked about

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Neurotransmitter

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Before we do this prediction

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We did not realize that this dark matter exists

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So it means that it is with our general battery

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Batteries do not interact

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It means that the dark matter

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It is electromagnetic

337
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
In addition

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Since it exists

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It has existed until now

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It means it is

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Its lifespan is longer than that of the universe

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So it has to be very stable

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It is very easy to change

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But it's not that it won't change

345
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It changes very slowly

346
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because in fact, some astronomical phenomena

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Can also be explained by dark matter

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
For example, dark matter can

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Change into light

350
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To explain

351
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Unidentified signals

352
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
According to what I just said

353
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This CMB and the so-called universe

354
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Early nuclear fusion

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Observation prediction

356
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That is, it will not be like what we just said

357
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Some

358
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The substance composed of nucleus or neutrinos

359
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It is a baryon

360
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Matter

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What about the last

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If it is formed from a star structure

363
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Its movement speed is probably moving

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But its movement speed is not very fast

365
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is mainly because we observe this star structure

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Formation to judge

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That is, if

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because dark matter itself has quality

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Its quality is very large

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Of course it will be in the universe

371
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Will have its own distribution

372
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
In other words, if it is dark matter

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If it is in a place

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If it moves very fast today

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then it is more dispersed

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
On the contrary, if it moves very slowly today

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It is easier to gather in a certain place

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If

379
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If there is a lot of dark matter in a certain place

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It means it will provide more gravity

381
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's the general so-called

382
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
These heavy materials are easier

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Slightly attracted

384
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Gathered in dark matter

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This density is relatively high

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then gradually form stars

387
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Then we currently see the universe

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are relatively close to the star structure

389
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This implies that this

390
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Dark matter

391
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Its speed is much less than the speed of light

392
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course there is also the so-called

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Borrowing light

394
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Just

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Just

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Very close to the speed of light

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Of course there is a borrowing in the middle

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Borrowing dark matter

399
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't know how to say it in Chinese

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Maybe it's called cold dark matter

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
In general, we study dark matter that is less than the speed of light

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We call it cold dark matter

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Is cold dark matter

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What's next

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's talk about a few possible dark matter candidates

406
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We just talked about

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Just introduce the nature of dark matter

408
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course, if you think about it

409
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What kind of particle is it

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of course there are a lot of models

411
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can only use English here

412
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The first one is more popular

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is this so-called

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Massive particle

415
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The first one I just talked about is dark matter

416
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Because it has to be with this

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
General matter interaction is very weak

418
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Otherwise we should be able to measure it easily

419
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The other one is that it must provide

420
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Very strong gravity

421
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So it probably has to be a very heavy particle

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So this so-called

423
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Massive particle

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Is more popular

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Generally we call it WIMP

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
WIMP

427
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
WIMP also has a lot of options

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It may be

429
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A kind of Sushi particle

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Sushi is translated into Chinese as super symmetry

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It may be

432
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The latest super symmetry

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Super symmetry example

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like the so-called neutrino

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It may also be the so-called

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The latest one is called KK particles

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
KK this thing

438
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Is related to this

439
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Extra-dimensional model

440
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But my topic today is not to discuss

441
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The so-called WIMP

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What I'm going to discuss today is the other candidates below

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The first one, the so-called action

444
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That Chinese

445
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Maybe just turn it into the axis

446
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It seems that there is no

447
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
May not be

448
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Someone said that in the file

449
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But I just turned it into an axis

450
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Of course there are other candidates

451
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Like the so-called standard neutrinos

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Or the so-called SIMP

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
SIMP is the topic I studied a few years ago

454
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This S is actually strongly

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It is

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It is different from this weakly

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It is a strong massive particle

458
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The work I did a few years ago

459
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is to combine this SIMP with neutrinos

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I gave this speech at TERA last year

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Today I will give another

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Different theme is related to action

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How about this WIMP

464
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How to detect it? I think this

465
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Maybe Zhang Yong is more familiar

466
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He may have a few speeches before

467
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Related to this WIMP

468
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Experiment

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Today I will focus on this WIMP experiment

470
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I will mention a little later

471
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How do we use experiments to detect this action

472
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it is good

473
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Then

474
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Enter the topic behind me

475
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because I was probably in the first 20 pages

476
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Is to do some basic introduction

477
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What about the back?

478
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's basically what I said before

479
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So basically it's more difficult

480
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
More mathematical

481
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's hard to understand

482
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is my last slide

483
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
To explain the so-called strong CP problem

484
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Before

485
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Some

486
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Terminology

487
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So

488
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What I'm talking about here is the so-called symmetry

489
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The first P

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We call it parity

491
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So-called mirror symmetry

492
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Everyone may be familiar with this

493
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you look at it from a mathematical point of view

494
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
For example, put x into negative x

495
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Put a negative sign

496
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Then we call it mirror symmetry

497
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
In fact, for a long time, physicists believe

498
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
All physical laws should be mirror symmetry

499
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Of course, this law

500
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Of course, it should be known

501
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yang and Li

502
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Found that our universe is

503
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Irregular

504
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Mirror symmetry is not a good symmetry

505
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Should not

506
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Not a good symmetry

507
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not a symmetry in our nature

508
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
For example, I just talked about this

509
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
In our standard model, this has a negative effect

510
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The negative effect itself

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This interaction is valid

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This parity symmetry

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay, the second one is the so-called

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Charge conjugation

515
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We use C to represent that it is

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The Chinese text should be translated directly

517
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The reason is quite simple

518
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It is so-called the opposite of this electric

519
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But the quality does not change

520
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So just inside the table, for example, electron

521
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We know that electron itself also has an antimatter

522
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's called positron

523
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The charge itself

524
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The same direction but the opposite

525
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So we can simply say we can do

526
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Charge conjugation

527
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Did you hear it?

528
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Did you hear it?

529
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
My head didn't jump out, sorry

530
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then we can do a power equation

531
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Change its electric

532
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
In fact, we found that

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
C is not a good symmetry

534
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then there is the so-called time reversal

535
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's actually very similar to this

536
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Basically, you change the direction of time

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Theoretically, it is to change T to T

538
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Then I just talked about

539
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
P is not symmetrical, C is not symmetrical

540
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Then you will think about some strange symmetries

541
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So someone considers whether C and P are symmetrical

542
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Even a theory

543
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't just do P conversion

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You also do C conversion, then we call C and P symmetrical

545
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's the same for a while

546
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
After Yang Zhengning found that P is not symmetrical

547
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We think that C and P are very good symmetries

548
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes, then later

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In this so-called

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The decay

551
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We found that C and P are not symmetrical

552
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This is also a Nobel Prize

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So our conclusion is that

554
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
C and P and T and C and P

555
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
C and P are not symmetrical

556
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then we can go further

557
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
For example, C and P and T are not symmetrical

558
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So far

559
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The answer is

560
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because I have not found that C and P are symmetrical

561
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Destroy this phenomenon

562
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Unless we measure this

563
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The quality of antimatter and real matter is different

564
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Otherwise our current

565
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The conclusion is that C and P are very good

566
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This symmetry

567
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Anyway

568
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
My conclusion here is that

569
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
C and P are not symmetrical

570
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
OK, so far there is no problem

571
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Can ask first

572
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Have it

573
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Or do you understand

574
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
If you have a question

575
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Remember to turn on the microphone

576
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Otherwise you may talk for a long time

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I found that I did not turn on the microphone

578
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It seems that everyone understands

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
OK

580
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I want to ask

581
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So here

582
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Can mention a little bit

583
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Verify it separately

584
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Symmetry and asymmetry

585
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What is it

586
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's it

587
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I am not

588
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
For example, you can go to this

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Wu Dayou is doing this

590
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
He should be doing

591
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Wu Jianxiong

592
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Wu Jianxiong

593
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He is a female scientist

594
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Measure this

595
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This is the beta decay phenomenon

596
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes

597
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Found that this is not asymmetric

598
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you look up this in Wikipedia

599
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Asymmetry should mention this experiment

600
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What about C and P

601
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
C and P

602
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You can take the so-called C and P

603
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You can also find it online

604
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Their experiment

605
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
He found this

606
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Kaon

607
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Charge Kaon

608
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
There are several types of Kaon

609
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Long Life

610
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Long Life

611
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Joe Life

612
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Because there are some asymmetry

613
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Long Life and Joe Life

614
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Maybe two lights or three lights

615
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I am two lights and three lights

616
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This

617
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Final state

618
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Wu Jianxiong should be

619
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
C and P

620
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Final state C and P

621
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
C and P are different

622
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If your final state is two lights or three lights

623
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I found that this KL

624
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I forgot if it was KL

625
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It should be KL

626
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Long Life

627
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
If you wait long enough

628
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It will actually decay

629
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
One final state

630
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I forgot if it was two lights or three lights

631
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Check this detail

632
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Zhang Yong, do you remember

633
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I don't remember

634
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
When I was doing

635
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We are doing B behind me

636
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I know you are doing B

637
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Anyway, this has nothing to do with Kaon

638
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Anyway, this has nothing to do with Kaon

639
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I've seen the story before

640
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But I didn't prepare this story today

641
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Sorry

642
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Is there any other questions?

643
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If not, let's go straight to my research topic

644
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Of course, the next step is more

645
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
English

646
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
More mathematical

647
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it is good

648
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Then I will directly cut the topic and talk about this so-called action

649
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Especially

650
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
QCD action

651
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So why

652
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
This idea

653
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
In other words, it comes from this

654
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In QCD, we have this so-called strong CP problem

655
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
In other words, in QCD, we have this so-called strong CP problem

656
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In other words, I just said

657
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
In the natural world, CP is not very symmetrical

658
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In the natural world, CP is not very symmetrical

659
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So mathematicians can write some

660
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Destroy CP symmetry

661
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The theory of interaction

662
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
There is a very complicated mathematical formula on the screen

663
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
There is a very complicated mathematical formula on the screen

664
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's called Lagrangian

665
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's called Lagrangian

666
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
In other words

667
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Because CP is not symmetrical

668
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because CP is not symmetrical

669
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So we can write this

670
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In this strong effect

671
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So we can write this

672
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
In our theory

673
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It represents

674
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This strong effect

675
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
This strong effect

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Of course you can write this

677
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There is no problem

678
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But we found

679
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
If you go from here

680
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This so-called Neutron EDM

681
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
EDM is called Electrodipole Moment

682
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
EDM is called Electrodipole Moment

683
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It's a kind of

684
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's a kind of

685
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We found from the experiment

686
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We found from the experiment

687
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
We found from the experiment

688
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
This interaction

689
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
There is a factor called strong CP phase

690
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
This theta must be less than 10

691
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
This theta must be less than 10

692
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Of course this number

693
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
To some physics

694
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's very uncomfortable

695
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We naturally have this

696
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It's called

697
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's called Neutron

698
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's called Neutron

699
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It may be 0.1 or

700
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It may be 0.1 or

701
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It may be 0.1 or

702
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
10 to the negative 10 is a little bit small

703
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
10 to the negative 10 or negative 10

704
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Is a little bit

705
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Is a little bit

706
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Of course you can't say

707
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The natural world

708
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You can choose such a small number

709
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Who knows

710
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You don't know how the natural world works

711
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But from the view of the theoretical student

712
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This theta term has two

713
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Of course I won't

714
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I won't introduce this contribution

715
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Basically it has two

716
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Physics

717
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's made up of completely different physics

718
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Then this is a problem

719
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That is to say, if you look at this theta

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Equals theta 0 plus this

721
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
What is this determining thing

722
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Because the two of them are different physics

723
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Then ask why these two

724
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Different physics

725
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
They will be so good

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Cancel to each other

727
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's a very

728
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's a problem

729
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Basically it's a reaction

730
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That is to say, why is this theta so small

731
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Then give everyone a little feeling

732
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
For example, you can imagine that this

733
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This theta is

734
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The simple mathematician on the right side of the screen

735
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It may be this 10 to the negative 11

736
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Then it will be equal to

737
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
For example, if this theta is set to 1

738
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Then the second one behind this

739
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It may be 0.999999

740
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Then you become

741
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
This

742
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Just this two different physics

743
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's just a little bit

744
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's a fine-tuning

745
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Then this is in our physics

746
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't like it

747
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So we don't need to solve this problem

748
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Then this is the so-called strong CP problem

749
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That

750
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Of course, there are many theories to explain this strong CP problem

751
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Then the most popular at the moment

752
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The so-called introduction

753
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The so-called action

754
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Then this general mechanism is called

755
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Perseverance mechanism

756
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Or abbreviated as PQ mechanism

757
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Then in this mechanism

758
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The so-called strong CP phase

759
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It's not a simple

760
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Parameter

761
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It is a dynamic parameter

762
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Then I don't do too much here

763
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This

764
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This action theory introduction

765
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I just introduced it directly

766
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
For example, in the mathematical world just now

767
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We only have a theta term

768
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I added another one

769
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
There is a second one in this box

770
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Then there is a big A divided by a FA

771
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Then this A is the so-called action

772
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
A constant

773
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It has something to do with this

774
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
A symmetry destruction

775
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Maybe you don't need to know this

776
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This detail you know this is a

777
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
A constant that is very important

778
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because it will be with us later

779
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
This photon has something to do with this action

780
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Good

781
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What about the introduction of this action?

782
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
When we do the calculation, we will find that it is at a very high temperature

783
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Just look at this picture

784
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The picture below

785
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
When you are at a very high temperature

786
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
This T represents this temperature

787
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The temperature is far greater than this

788
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
QCD

789
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
When this QCD action

790
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
This QCD action

791
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Its potential

792
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Its potential is very flat

793
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
When its temperature is very low

794
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Through this QCD

795
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What is called non-circulation

796
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Non-circulation effect

797
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Its potential will be raised

798
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So it means that at the beginning

799
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It may be sitting well

800
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This red part

801
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
After it is raised, it starts to fall

802
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Falling in this blue part

803
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This potential

804
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The smallest part

805
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Potential minima

806
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Just in this position

807
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Just put this theta

808
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Cancel it

809
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Theta plus A

810
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Define it as theta effective

811
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Just in this minima

812
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Theta effective will be equal to zero

813
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This theta will be

814
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
This action

815
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Generally called vacuum expectation value

816
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Will cancel it

817
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So this theta effective

818
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Is a very small number

819
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That can explain why

820
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We observe that this theta

821
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Is the negative ten of the original value

822
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
That is, it is almost equal to zero

823
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yes, so action

824
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It actually

825
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The appearance is to explain this

826
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Strong C problem

827
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
This is the so-called

828
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This part

829
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Is there any problem with this?

830
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Still OK

831
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Understand

832
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Anyway, it is to introduce some things

833
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Then cancel some things

834
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's it

835
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The first one is canceled, so we don't see it in practice

836
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then I will talk about

837
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Some action properties

838
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We just said why

839
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That

840
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The same as I just said

841
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It will pass through this QCD

842
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Non-circulation

843
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Non-circulation is called non-perturbative

844
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The effect can be calculated

845
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Just look at the formula

846
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
This T is the temperature

847
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
If the temperature is very high

848
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
This ma represents

849
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The mass of the action

850
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It will go to zero when the temperature is very high

851
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
When the temperature is very low

852
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It will approach a constant

853
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
This constant is called zero temperature mass of QCD action

854
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It can also be calculated

855
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
As long as you know

856
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
As long as you know that QCD is at a very high temperature

857
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It is non-circulation

858
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And when it is at a very low temperature

859
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It is a mass

860
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Its mass relationship is at a very low temperature

861
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It has this relation

862
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It can be connected to the constant I just mentioned

863
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
No connection

864
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There is a unit on the picture here

865
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't know if you are familiar with this

866
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There should be

867
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This is the so-called electron volt

868
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We are talking about 1.6 times 10

869
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Minus 19

870
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yes

871
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Why this is the mass

872
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Then you can use energy to represent

873
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That's because we're in high energy

874
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We are used to making this light speed into 1

875
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In other words, you can say that energy is actually the mass

876
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
OK

877
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So we use this unit to represent the mass

878
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's called EV

879
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This GV is convenient

880
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's 10 to the power of 9

881
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But there are other abbreviations

882
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Such as NEV or KEV

883
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
If you do experiments

884
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You should be familiar with this

885
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
This abbreviation

886
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
G or

887
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
KEV or GV

888
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Anyway, QCD action

889
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Its mass

890
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It has something to do with the constant

891
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It has something to do with the constant

892
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Let me tell you in advance

893
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We will mention a kind of action light particle

894
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's a kind of light particle

895
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It is not satisfied with the above relationship

896
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So that means

897
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Its quality and its

898
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Its decay constant

899
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It has nothing to do with

900
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They are two free parameters

901
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes

902
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Then there will be some

903
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
There are some operations

904
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Because it is after all two free parameters

905
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Anyway

906
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
What's more special

907
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
We found that this QCD action

908
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It can not only solve

909
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Strong C problem

910
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It is also a good dark matter candidate

911
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That is to say, I just said

912
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
QCD action

913
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
When it is very low temperature, it will form a potential

914
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It just happens to be echoing the potential

915
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And just this phenomenon

916
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What about this model

917
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We can

918
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
See it as a dark matter

919
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
A model

920
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes

921
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Then we can

922
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Can I ask a question

923
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Please ask

924
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You just said the temperature in the front page

925
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Is it the temperature of the universe

926
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
After the particle

927
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's Proxima

928
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It's the radiation temperature

929
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Then when is it in the universe

930
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Will

931
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Will reach the TQCD

932
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Hello

933
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
How much will the universe temperature reach

934
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That's the TQCD

935
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You mean Lambda QCD

936
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Lambda QCD

937
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
TQCD is the same as Lambda QCD

938
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's almost the same

939
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Maybe a few times

940
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
TQCD

941
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Let me see if I remember correctly

942
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
More than 100 MeV

943
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Because QCD

944
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The scale of QCD is probably

945
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Hundreds of MeV

946
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's probably a value

947
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yes

948
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So TQCD

949
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Is it before inflation

950
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
After

951
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
When it's low temperature

952
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Is inflation high

953
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Is it before CMB

954
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
CMB

955
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Should be earlier

956
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
CMB

957
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You have to have CMB

958
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Let me see

959
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What is the temperature of CMB

960
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It should be

961
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Are you doing astronomy

962
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Do you remember

963
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I want to think about it

964
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
What is the temperature

965
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
CMB temperature

966
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't remember

967
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It should be a little later

968
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Should

969
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If you want to type EGV

970
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Corresponds to how much temperature

971
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I should check this

972
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
OK

973
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Thank you

974
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Ok

975
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The formula above

976
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Of course you don't have to remember it

977
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
This is us

978
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Since we theorize that this action

979
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It can form this atocometer when it vibrates

980
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Then we can estimate this

981
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Its energy density

982
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What is the energy density

983
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Then you can use this formula to represent

984
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
As long as you know

985
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Omega A in this equation

986
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's this Omega A again

987
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It represents the energy density of action

988
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So far we have observed that the energy density

989
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's about 0.1

990
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Or 0.12

991
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So that means this FA

992
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This formula is FA

993
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Roughly it's about

994
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
10 to the 12th square

995
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
GEV

996
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Basically it can't change

997
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
OK

998
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This formula

999
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Is the position of this action

1000
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So of course you can

1001
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You can adjust this formula

1002
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And then you change this FA

1003
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But that's more fine-tuning

1004
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
For example, you can assume that if

1005
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The universe

1006
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
This action

1007
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
At the beginning of the vibration

1008
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's very close to this

1009
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Top of this

1010
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Does that mean it will slide slower

1011
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
If number 5 slides slower

1012
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Its energy density will be higher

1013
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So this theory

1014
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
If theta is close to pi

1015
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
This will contribute a lot

1016
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Very big

1017
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
In this case, this FA

1018
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You can make it smaller

1019
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yes, that's a little bit more fine-tuning

1020
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But we don't like it

1021
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So generally this theta initial

1022
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We won't assume it's that big

1023
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Generally speaking, this FA

1024
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's close to 10 to the 12th square

1025
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
GEV

1026
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Then it can explain this wind speed

1027
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
About 0.1

1028
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
OK

1029
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Then let's talk about this action

1030
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Why can't we see photons

1031
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Generally the same is through this interaction

1032
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
To describe

1033
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Just put this on

1034
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It should be the left index of the first line

1035
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's LA Gamma Gamma

1036
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yes, this F is represented by light

1037
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yes, you don't have to remember this

1038
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
If it's not a theory

1039
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You just need to know that this represents

1040
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Action and two

1041
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The interaction of light

1042
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What about the intensity of this interaction

1043
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We can use this

1044
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
GA Gamma Gamma

1045
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
We call this GA Gamma Gamma

1046
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Action Photon Coupling

1047
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Then we can find out

1048
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This coupling will be with Gamma

1049
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
This decay constant

1050
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's a contrast

1051
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That is to say, if the decay constant is bigger

1052
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This coupling is smaller

1053
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
OK

1054
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The one on the bottom right is the so-called

1055
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's used to describe this action

1056
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
How to interact with the light

1057
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's usually through this

1058
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Loop of loop

1059
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Induce out

1060
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Of course you don't need to know this detail

1061
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Sorry

1062
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If you want to

1063
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That is to say, I just said

1064
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
QCD action

1065
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Can be done

1066
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So if you want to meet this

1067
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We observe this

1068
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What about the energy density

1069
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
This FA

1070
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
12 square GV

1071
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then you bring it into this formula

1072
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You will find this A Gamma Gamma

1073
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It should be about

1074
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
10 to the negative 10th square

1075
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
GV inverse

1076
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That's great

1077
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Because this coupling is small

1078
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
QCD action

1079
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It won't be easy to change into light

1080
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So it's not stable

1081
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So it's in line with what we just said

1082
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
One of the properties of dark matter

1083
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That's because

1084
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
This A Gamma Gamma is very small

1085
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So in practice

1086
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's not easy to measure it

1087
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Of course we can do it again

1088
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We can introduce this experiment in the future

1089
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Of course there is a chance

1090
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
it is good

1091
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So let me show you this experiment

1092
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's a few

1093
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Measurement action

1094
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This experiment

1095
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This picture was made by my boss

1096
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Because it's too beautiful

1097
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There are several types

1098
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
There are indirect and non-indirect

1099
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
My research

1100
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What about my theory

1101
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I will focus on this

1102
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Direct part

1103
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You can see it on the picture

1104
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Related words

1105
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like the middle

1106
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The one on the second row in the middle

1107
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This solar action

1108
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
This solar action

1109
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Because action will work with light

1110
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So we can predict

1111
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It may be from this solar system

1112
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Then we can use

1113
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Maybe it's a telescope

1114
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
There is a so-called

1115
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Or the second one

1116
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Or these experiments

1117
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then there is the so-called

1118
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Cosmic

1119
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Cosmological action

1120
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Cosmic action is what we just said

1121
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It may be from the early universe

1122
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
These actions

1123
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Then we can use

1124
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
To measure WIMP

1125
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Let's say

1126
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It can work with these nuclear principles

1127
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Then we will measure these

1128
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
For example

1129
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Because

1130
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
If the nuclear principle works with this action

1131
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It may rebound

1132
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
There will be some signals

1133
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Then we can measure

1134
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Related to these experiments

1135
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Like the so-called

1136
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Or the Casper

1137
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
On the table

1138
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Directly listed

1139
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This is the experimental picture

1140
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Of course it's a bit complicated

1141
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You can see this

1142
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This gray band

1143
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It is the so-called QCD action

1144
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If you want to satisfy it as a document

1145
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Then it has to be painted

1146
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This red point

1147
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So you can see it

1148
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Quite close to the so-called

1149
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
ADMS sensitivity

1150
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So there is a chance in the future

1151
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ADMS

1152
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Perspective

1153
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
If they can

1154
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Improve this sensitivity

1155
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Maybe you can measure this

1156
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Document

1157
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Of course there are other experiments

1158
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Like the one I just mentioned

1159
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Measure solar action

1160
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Its current upper bound is a bit higher

1161
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So in the future

1162
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
They can lower the upper bound

1163
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Also have the opportunity

1164
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
To measure this QCD action

1165
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You may see

1166
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Another one

1167
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
This brown

1168
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This brown band

1169
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This corresponds to the so-called ELF document

1170
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Let me go back here

1171
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What is ELF document

1172
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The same thing

1173
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You can go back to the previous one

1174
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There is a bunch of

1175
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Constraint

1176
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I gave a talk a while ago

1177
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I can't answer the question

1178
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Is it a problem of experiment?

1179
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
No, it's like this

1180
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Because I am

1181
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Thermorelic

1182
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Then your axiom is not thermorelic

1183
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Then there is a person who does astronomy

1184
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He asked me

1185
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Now this kind of axiom

1186
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Or ELF

1187
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's actually a

1188
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The relationship between the measurement and the photon coupling

1189
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And its mass

1190
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Then it's a bit like a positive relationship

1191
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
A value relationship

1192
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It can be extended indefinitely

1193
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But how heavy can it be

1194
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
If it is a document

1195
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It can be very heavy

1196
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Even the weight of a moon

1197
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Then my idea is

1198
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's just very heavy

1199
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
If it's very heavy, it's very big

1200
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Then we should have seen it earlier

1201
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
But I got an answer

1202
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It seems to be

1203
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Large-scale structure

1204
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
There is a constraint

1205
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Thermorelic can't be light

1206
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Or non-thermal can't be heavy

1207
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This is actually

1208
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I know a little

1209
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You see this in the picture

1210
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The quality of the axiom

1211
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I just drew this range

1212
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
In fact

1213
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You can't be too light

1214
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That is, its current lower bound seems to be

1215
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Negative 22eV

1216
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This will correspond to

1217
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The so-called Fuzzy document

1218
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Fuzzy document

1219
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Fuzzy document

1220
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This seems to be done by some groups in Taiwan University

1221
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
In other words, if you

1222
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
If the document is too light

1223
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
What to do with this

1224
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's not easy, this material wave is too long

1225
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That is, you will become

1226
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The magnitude of the universe

1227
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
These quantum effects came out

1228
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Then they do astronomy

1229
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It seems to see these

1230
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Some small-scale

1231
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Differences

1232
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So if you

1233
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Some constraints

1234
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So this

1235
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Document can't be too light

1236
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Light to negative 22eV

1237
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It has some lower bound

1238
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But I don't really understand

1239
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Where is the upper bound of the axiom

1240
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh, I know, I see

1241
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Basically, as long as it exceeds 10

1242
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Negative 10.5

1243
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Negative 11

1244
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It's all ruled out

1245
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Cache

1246
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
OK, I see

1247
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Of course you can lower

1248
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
This can be very low

1249
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But as I said, it can't be too small

1250
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
it is good

1251
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
This is actually a very good question

1252
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Back to action

1253
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Elp

1254
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Originally from this

1255
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Theoretical theory

1256
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
For example, we are in the theoretical theory

1257
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
They predict a lot of action particles

1258
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Then we call these action particles

1259
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Action light particles

1260
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
That's the same as taking this

1261
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Then I'm in my back pocket

1262
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I'll use this

1263
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
代表

1264
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Its nature is exactly the same as this

1265
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Just say it

1266
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Because it has nothing to do with qcd

1267
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So its quality is not from qcd

1268
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's from another

1269
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Like the so-called hidden qcd

1270
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I don't know how to say it

1271
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Hidden is

1272
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
It's another qcd

1273
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Its quality is not direct from this

1274
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Our general standard model qcd

1275
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That's the same

1276
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It can't see the light

1277
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Then it can also be

1278
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
This dark matter candidate

1279
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The formula is basically

1280
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Very similar to the qcd action

1281
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So basically it's exactly the same

1282
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's exactly the same as qcd

1283
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
The difference is that it

1284
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
This is with this qcd

1285
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The effect has nothing to do with it

1286
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Ok

1287
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So basically I'm q

1288
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Elp's introduction is only one page

1289
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's quite simple

1290
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Then we will calculate this

1291
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
This one

1292
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Action with this photon coupling

1293
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Then I found that his

1294
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It must correspond to this on the map

1295
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This brown

1296
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
This band

1297
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So obviously this brown

1298
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's much smaller than this qcd

1299
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So of course we hope

1300
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
If we don't see qcd action

1301
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Then there are some extra particles

1302
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
We can measure

1303
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Because it has some motivation

1304
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But you have to believe

1305
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You have to believe that this theory is right

1306
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Of course

1307
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Of course it is

1308
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That is to say

1309
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That is to say you can

1310
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Allow this particle to exist

1311
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
OK

1312
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is there a problem here?

1313
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
If not, I will

1314
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
In

1315
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So far, it's basically

1316
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Action's introduction

1317
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That is to say, this thing is basically

1318
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Everyone knows

1319
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Everyone knows

1320
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So i

1321
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I will start my research later

1322
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
How to connect action

1323
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
qcd action with qcd

1324
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
qcd action

1325
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
The relationship between qcd and qcd

1326
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This is what I will talk about later

1327
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Before I finish

1328
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Everyone may have a question

1329
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Why is it called action?

1330
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
This is a very interesting story

1331
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Does anyone know?

1332
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm not familiar with action

1333
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
In fact, I also

1334
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'll check it out later

1335
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Because it's really weird

1336
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Basically, this story is very simple

1337
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Maybe everyone is watching me

1338
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
My friend

1339
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Huang Zhong helped me make a promotional poster

1340
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
He put a poster

1341
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Something like a drink

1342
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's not a drink

1343
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That is a cleaner

1344
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Why is it called action?

1345
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
This has a lot to do with this cleaner

1346
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That is to say the first

1347
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You can see this

1348
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I divided this action into two parts

1349
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
The front is axi

1350
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That is to say

1351
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We just saw this

1352
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
qcd

1353
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Why does it appear?

1354
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Mainly with us in theoretical

1355
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ActionCurrentAnomaly

1356
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Has a relationship

1357
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You just need to know

1358
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Connection with

1359
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
ActionCurrent

1360
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You also know

1361
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Physics likes to put the name of Paracord

1362
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
What is it called?

1363
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Or Positron

1364
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
That's the end of ON, right?

1365
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So this

1366
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
What about the Nobel Prize in 2004?

1367
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
The Wheeljack

1368
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He is because of this so-called

1369
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Progressive Freedom

1370
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This is like

1371
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I just quoted his article

1372
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
He said it directly

1373
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Maybe a few years ago he went to the supermarket

1374
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
He saw this

1375
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Cleaner

1376
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It looks like a washing powder

1377
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
He saw the box

1378
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Many colors of this

1379
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Washing powder

1380
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Then he called this washing powder

1381
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I immediately realized that this may be a good name

1382
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Because the first one

1383
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
It's the end of ON, and then there's AIX

1384
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That has something to do with the axis

1385
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The point is that we just introduced the action

1386
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
The purpose is to put this

1387
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
qcd

1388
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So he wrote here

1389
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
When I notice a new particle that

1390
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Clean up the problem with an action

1391
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So he realized that this is a very good name

1392
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So he took it

1393
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Of course there are other

1394
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Others

1395
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Think of other names

1396
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Like this Weinberg is also a Nobel Prize

1397
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He thought of other names

1398
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But later this Weinberg also agreed that this action

1399
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's closer

1400
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So it's been applied until now

1401
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
He called it action

1402
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Okay, that's just an exaggeration

1403
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Just explain a little bit

1404
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
You will find that physicists

1405
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
There are quite a few stories about particle names

1406
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
For example

1407
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
There is a quark in this table

1408
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Does anyone know how quark is named?

1409
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Quark is also a Nobel Prize

1410
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It's Gilman

1411
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
He came up with an idea

1412
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Then he thought about it for a while

1413
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Later he found that it was like reading a novel

1414
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
This duck in this novel

1415
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It seems to be called quack quack quack

1416
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
He thinks it's good, so he took it

1417
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So this

1418
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
This particle is called quark

1419
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yes, this is very

1420
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Very interesting

1421
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I can only say that physics sometimes

1422
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's quite unexpected

1423
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Then I will put this

1424
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
The basic introduction of action is finished

1425
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
If there is no problem

1426
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I will introduce the research directly

1427
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I will bring the research part very soon

1428
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Because it is more detailed and related to time

1429
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'll just talk about it

1430
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Just say

1431
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It can explain

1432
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Can explain this

1433
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
At the same time

1434
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If you believe

1435
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If you believe

1436
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Then

1437
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Assuming they exist at the same time

1438
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
In our natural world

1439
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We predict what kind of phenomenon it should have

1440
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
OK

1441
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
That

1442
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
If we assume that there is a so-called quality mixing between them

1443
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
What kind of effect will it have

1444
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
This time I will give you

1445
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Give this answer

1446
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
This is called level crossing

1447
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
What is the Chinese translation of level crossing?

1448
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Level crossing

1449
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
This picture is

1450
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Assuming that QC action

1451
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
There is no so-called mixing with this alpha

1452
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Without mixing

1453
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Green and red lines on the picture

1454
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It represents the evolution of their mass

1455
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
You will find that

1456
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
This is the first one

1457
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Green is QC action

1458
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I just said that when it is very low temperature

1459
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It has quality, but there is no quality at very high temperature

1460
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So its quality evolution

1461
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It should be like this green picture

1462
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Then alpha, because it has nothing to do with QC effect

1463
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So its mass

1464
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Let's assume it is constant

1465
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Here I have to assume

1466
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
The mass of alpha must be less than this

1467
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Action

1468
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
At a very low temperature mass

1469
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
The reason is that

1470
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
If there is no maxmixing

1471
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Nothing happens

1472
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
If you turn on this maxmixing today

1473
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You see this picture

1474
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
There are some changes

1475
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You will find that this green line

1476
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It should be going up

1477
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It is at a certain time

1478
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It suddenly turned to the original

1479
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The direction of the alp

1480
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
The same alp

1481
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
This is at a very

1482
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
At a very high temperature

1483
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
This is its original evolution

1484
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But it is still at a certain time

1485
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It will run up

1486
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Run to the action part

1487
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Then we call this phenomenon

1488
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Level crossing between QC action and alp

1489
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Then this phenomenon

1490
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Actually not

1491
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Only appeared in my research

1492
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
If you do

1493
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Neutrino mass physics

1494
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It is very similar to the so-called Neutrino vibration

1495
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It is very similar to the so-called Neutrino vibration

1496
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Neutrino in matter

1497
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
There will also be this level crossing phenomenon

1498
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Then this is the answer

1499
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
If you put this maxmixing today

1500
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
If you turn it on

1501
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Then its

1502
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
There will be a so-called level crossing phenomenon

1503
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So if there is a level crossing

1504
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
We mean

1505
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
This

1506
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
QC action and alp

1507
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
There will be a so-called heat transfer

1508
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
The so-called heat transfer is

1509
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Its particle

1510
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Density

1511
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Is small

1512
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
From A to this

1513
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This

1514
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
This

1515
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Diabetic conversion

1516
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
In Chinese, it may be translated as the heat transfer

1517
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
There are some conditions

1518
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I may need to mention it later

1519
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So if this

1520
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Ok, this is the answer

1521
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So I won't repeat it again

1522
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
If there is this

1523
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
We will predict that

1524
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The energy density of this action

1525
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It will be suppressed

1526
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
By this maxmixing

1527
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Because this

1528
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Its energy density is with this

1529
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Quality and its particle

1530
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
The product is the product

1531
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So if you have this today

1532
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Level crossing

1533
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Your QC action

1534
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It's very low temperature

1535
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It's more like an alp

1536
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
The alp particle is in front of us

1537
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Its energy density is less than this ma

1538
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So you can predict that its quality will be

1539
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Suppressed by this ratio

1540
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Then it's obvious

1541
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You will open up some new space

1542
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
In our research

1543
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
OK, this is the model part

1544
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's the same

1545
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
This

1546
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
On the left of the first line

1547
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
QC action potential

1548
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It's a cosine potential

1549
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
We just saw a few in the front

1550
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's like a positive potential

1551
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Mathematical description

1552
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
On the right, it's like a description

1553
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
How to make this action

1554
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
There is a maxmixing

1555
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
OK, if you have maxmixing

1556
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
This

1557
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
It's not a physical state

1558
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
We have to do a cross-section

1559
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The cross-section process is below

1560
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You can see that it is through a rotation matrix

1561
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Then this is their eigenvalue

1562
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Maybe everyone does

1563
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Maybe you are more familiar with eigenvalue

1564
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
This is the true value

1565
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Although I just saw this on the picture

1566
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The red line and the green line

1567
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The so-called eigenvalue evolution

1568
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Then we have to assume

1569
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
mphi is less than ma

1570
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Because it's obvious if you

1571
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
If this condition is met

1572
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
This green line

1573
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
What about this line

1574
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Or this red line

1575
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Less than this

1576
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Green is

1577
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Green at

1578
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The part of this line

1579
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It will have this level crossing

1580
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
In other words, if the red is far above the green

1581
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Obviously, there will be no level crossing

1582
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Happening

1583
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So this is

1584
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
eigenvalue evolution

1585
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Here I have a special assumption

1586
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
This

1587
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Elp's decay function

1588
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
To be smaller than this

1589
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Qc action

1590
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
A little bit

1591
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
This is some mathematical definition

1592
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Hello

1593
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
it is good

1594
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Let's talk about the assumption

1595
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
If you assume

1596
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
mphi is bigger than ma

1597
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You will find this

1598
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
eigenvalue

1599
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
There will be a big splitting

1600
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
In some sense

1601
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
There is no level crossing

1602
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
it is good

1603
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
The picture on the right is

1604
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Dynamic

1605
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Because of time

1606
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
This is just a mixed angle formula

1607
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You don't have to look at it

1608
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Its evolution

1609
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
This is the evolution of mixed angle

1610
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Obviously, you can see

1611
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Assuming that the conditions we just talked about

1612
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
This mixed angle

1613
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Just at this level crossing

1614
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It will have a big change

1615
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
On the other hand

1616
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
In other cases

1617
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Did not happen

1618
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So we say that the level crossing is in this condition

1619
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
In this f5

1620
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It will have this

1621
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Level crossing

1622
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Hello

1623
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Is there a problem

1624
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Hello

1625
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
No

1626
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This is a mathematical definition of level crossing

1627
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I won't talk about it

1628
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Some noise

1629
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Is it ok

1630
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Ok

1631
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Let's talk about this

1632
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
To meet some of the conditions of absolute conversion

1633
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
This is qcd

1634
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Before that, I will pay attention to qcd

1635
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Some of its dynamics

1636
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
This

1637
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
On the picture, its equation is

1638
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
This qcd

1639
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Its equation of motion

1640
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Its dynamic equation is

1641
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Basically, it is a two-dimensional equation

1642
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Two-dimensional equation

1643
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Ok

1644
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
On the picture

1645
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
This is the so-called Hubble parameter

1646
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Maybe everyone has heard of this

1647
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Hubble constant

1648
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Basically, it has something to do with Hubble parameter

1649
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
This ma

1650
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The same is the qcd

1651
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Its mass

1652
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It has something to do with temperature

1653
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
At very high temperature

1654
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
This Hubble parameter is relatively large

1655
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So you can ignore this third item

1656
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Then you solve it, you will find that it is a

1657
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Over-damping solution

1658
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
That is, at high temperature

1659
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Its mass is almost constant

1660
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
At very low temperature

1661
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You can put this second item

1662
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
This Hubble parameter is ignored

1663
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
If you ignore the second item

1664
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It is a very simple so-called

1665
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Over-damping solution

1666
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Its equation is getting smaller and smaller

1667
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Because the universe is expanding

1668
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That's like this picture

1669
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
For example, when it is very low temperature

1670
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
It will continue to vibrate

1671
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Then its equation is getting smaller and smaller

1672
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
This is what I just said

1673
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
When it is very low temperature

1674
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It will oscillate near the potential mirror

1675
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Roughly speaking, this qc action

1676
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Start oscillating

1677
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
At this Hubble parameter

1678
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Roughly equal to this qc action mass

1679
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yes

1680
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
it is good

1681
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If you want to

1682
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Calculate this

1683
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
qc action energy density

1684
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Generally, we will define this

1685
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So-called actual number

1686
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Then calculate it

1687
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Actual number is conserved

1688
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
If it is conserved, it is very good

1689
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Because you know that mathematicians like to use this energy to calculate

1690
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Anyway

1691
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We can solve the equation of motion

1692
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We can calculate this

1693
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Actual number density

1694
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
We find that it is constant at very low temperature

1695
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That

1696
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The reason it is constant is because

1697
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It is a

1698
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Because this vibration is a decoupling process

1699
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
The condition of the decoupling process is to satisfy

1700
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Its

1701
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
External time scale is bigger than

1702
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Internal time scale

1703
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
In our system

1704
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
External time scale is

1705
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The oscillation rate of the universe

1706
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Or

1707
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Or Hubble time

1708
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The time of the universe

1709
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The time of the universe

1710
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Internal time scale is

1711
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Vibration

1712
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Vibration cycle

1713
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
In other words, if you today

1714
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
What about this oscillation cycle

1715
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
For example, this

1716
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
This

1717
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
What about the expansion speed

1718
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
If it is still slow, it is

1719
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It is a decoupling process

1720
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
In this case, this

1721
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Actual number will be a conserved

1722
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Quantity

1723
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Ok

1724
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
In our system, in our research

1725
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Because we have introduced two particles

1726
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So the decoupling condition will be a little different

1727
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Because

1728
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I just said that in level crossing

1729
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You will have a big

1730
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Big change

1731
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Mixed angle

1732
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So in fact, we will have an additional internal time scale

1733
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We use delta t to represent

1734
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes, you can use this formula

1735
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Write down

1736
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
What about the so-called internal time scale

1737
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
In addition to the single action case

1738
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
We only have one

1739
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
It's just a

1740
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Vibration cycle

1741
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
If you have two particles

1742
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You naturally predict that there will be two oscillation cycles

1743
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
In addition to that, we will find

1744
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
We found that there is a third cycle

1745
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
In other words, if two oscillation cycles today

1746
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
In the same phase

1747
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
We identify this as the third cycle

1748
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Yes, you can calculate

1749
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Is 2π ÷ this mass difference

1750
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Between this mass eigenstates

1751
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Ok

1752
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Then we will require this condition

1753
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That is to say

1754
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
This internal time scale is much larger than this

1755
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Internal time scale

1756
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Then we can find out this condition

1757
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You may not need to remember

1758
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Anyway, we can solve this

1759
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
This in our model

1760
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Action number density

1761
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
This is the result

1762
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So

1763
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Let's read this picture

1764
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Hello

1765
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Can you go back to the first two pages

1766
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Ok, which page

1767
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Go back one page

1768
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Next page

1769
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Next page

1770
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Next page

1771
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Is it forward or backward?

1772
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I think we are talking about different directions

1773
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I want to ask you

1774
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Basically

1775
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Your cycle is

1776
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Contrary to the mass difference

1777
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But the mass scale is already very small

1778
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So the mass difference should be smaller

1779
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So this thing

1780
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Actually

1781
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
The phase of these two states

1782
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
For us humans

1783
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
The time of this experiment

1784
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
This time

1785
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Is about the scale of the ear

1786
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It is constant phase, right?

1787
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You said mass difference?

1788
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You said this mass difference

1789
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
What is the value of this value?

1790
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
This delta t

1791
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
This delta t

1792
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You said this delta t?

1793
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You said this delta t?

1794
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You said this delta t?

1795
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
How small is this delta t?

1796
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
How small is this delta t?

1797
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I said the oscillation cycle

1798
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I said the oscillation cycle

1799
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
This cycle

1800
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
This cycle

1801
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I said this ELP is

1802
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I said this ELP is

1803
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
EEV

1804
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
For example, the current universe

1805
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
For example, 3K

1806
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
This happened at level crossing

1807
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
This happened at level crossing

1808
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Because we want to discuss

1809
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Will there be this so-called absolute conversion at level crossing?

1810
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But isn't it still oscillating now?

1811
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Or did I misunderstand?

1812
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But his mass

1813
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
We use this picture

1814
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
We use this picture

1815
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
For example

1816
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
This one

1817
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
For example, you see this green

1818
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
This is corresponding to

1819
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Light mode

1820
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It's close to ELP mass

1821
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's close to ELP mass

1822
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And this heavy mode is close to QCD mass

1823
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And this heavy mode is close to QCD mass

1824
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So it's still vibrating

1825
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So it's still vibrating

1826
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
But there is still energy density

1827
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
But the vibration is very small

1828
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
But there is still energy density

1829
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So it's basically just a constant

1830
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So you can adjust

1831
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So you can adjust

1832
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
It's smaller than QCD

1833
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's smaller than QCD

1834
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Even if it's QCD axion

1835
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Even if it's QCD axion

1836
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You have to move down

1837
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You have to move down

1838
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Wait for that one

1839
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
The green one

1840
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Is that M5?

1841
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
The horizontal axis is mass

1842
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
The vertical axis is photon coupling

1843
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
The vertical axis is mass

1844
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
The vertical axis is mass

1845
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
The density is lower

1846
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
The density is lower

1847
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
First, density

1848
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You are talking about

1849
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
photon coupling

1850
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
With mass

1851
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
With mass

1852
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'll mentioned it later

1853
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You are talking about

1854
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
how it can enhance

1855
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Because the quality is low

1856
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I will see

1857
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
If you scan out in parameter space

1858
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
If you scan out in parameter space

1859
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
If you scan out in parameter space

1860
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
The decay constant

1861
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Can be smaller

1862
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I'll show the conclusion

1863
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'll show the conclusion

1864
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Is it an hour?

1865
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Is it an hour?

1866
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Is it an hour?

1867
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Anyway, this is

1868
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The two actions

1869
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
The evolution of number density

1870
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
If you have absolute process condition

1871
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I just defined gamma

1872
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
If gamma is greater than 1

1873
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You can have absolute conversion

1874
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
If you

1875
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
If gamma is less than 1

1876
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You will find the green one will suddenly become

1877
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
The red one

1878
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
In this case, the absolute conversion

1879
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Is not perfect

1880
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You can skip it

1881
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Anyway

1882
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
The result is

1883
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
If we impose the density

1884
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
To solve the parameter space

1885
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
We find

1886
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
The decay constant of the ELP

1887
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Divided by the MFA

1888
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
In this graph

1889
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It can be smaller than 1

1890
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The MFA

1891
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Can be smaller than

1892
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The MFA

1893
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
The MFA

1894
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
If the MFA is 10 to the power of 12

1895
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
As I said

1896
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
If you want to satisfy the density of the object

1897
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It should be 10 to the power of 12

1898
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
In this case, the GA gamma gamma

1899
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
The front coupling is 10 to the power of 15

1900
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So today

1901
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
The MFA

1902
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
If the MFA is smaller than 1

1903
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It means we will have an enhancement

1904
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
As we know

1905
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
As we can see

1906
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The coupling is

1907
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
The decay constant is inversely proportional

1908
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So if you can

1909
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Reduce the MFA

1910
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
We expect to have an enhancement

1911
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So basically

1912
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
This is our final result

1913
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
The result is the color contours on the graph

1914
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
We found

1915
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
For example, the red bar

1916
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Corresponds to

1917
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
The MFA is equal to

1918
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
3 times 12 square GEV

1919
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
We can

1920
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Have a bigger MFA

1921
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Because we just talked about

1922
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Mass suppression

1923
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
If you have mass suppression

1924
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
The MFA can be increased

1925
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
At the same time

1926
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The MFA

1927
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The

1928
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Elbow decay constant

1929
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It can be very small

1930
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So it will have an enhancement

1931
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It will be higher than the

1932
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
The middle band

1933
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Enhanced by

1934
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
1000 times or 100 times

1935
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
This is good

1936
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
This mechanism

1937
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Can be

1938
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Measured by

1939
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Solenoid action

1940
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It can be measured

1941
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
This is our model

1942
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Advantage

1943
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
This is the conclusion

1944
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I think

1945
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
This is a more detailed part

1946
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I think

1947
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
That's about it

1948
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Any questions

1949
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Before you ask questions

1950
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
First of all

1951
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Let's applaud

1952
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Thank you for your speech

1953
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Do you have any questions?

1954
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
You can ask questions now

1955
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
This is a theoretical thing

1956
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Can you hear me

1957
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yes

1958
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Then

1959
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Your theory is very interesting

1960
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
We have an experiment

1961
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
About two or three years later

1962
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
There may be some preliminary results

1963
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Which experiment are you doing

1964
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
We have an experiment with LC circuit

1965
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Can you hear me

1966
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Can you hear me

1967
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Can you repeat your question

1968
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Can you hear me

1969
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Can you hear me

1970
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
No

1971
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Just a little bit

1972
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Try again

1973
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Sorry

1974
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Your theory is very interesting

1975
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
We have an experiment

1976
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
At Los Alamos

1977
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Can measure your 10 to 7

1978
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
To 10 to minus 10

1979
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
EV range

1980
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Maybe two or three years later

1981
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yes

1982
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Your value range is also

1983
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Just your range

1984
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
10 to 7

1985
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
10 to minus 10 EV range

1986
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
My question is

1987
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Is your value range the same as the picture?

1988
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Almost

1989
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Almost the same

1990
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
That's not bad

1991
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
You can test your theory

1992
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
But I have a question

1993
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Do you consider

1994
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
If it is two

1995
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Then you will have like

1996
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Neutrino oscillation

1997
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Yes, there will be such a phenomenon

1998
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
This is also a possibility

1999
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I mentioned this to the boss

2000
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But he probably means

2001
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It should be the same phenomenon

2002
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
If you add one more x

2003
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Like particle

2004
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You said it wouldn't change

2005
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Will there be a stronger enhancement

2006
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
There may be a stronger enhancement

2007
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yes

2008
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Our mechanism is

2009
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But we didn't say

2010
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You can consider more complex models

2011
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I agree

2012
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
OK

2013
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Thank you

2014
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Do you have any questions?

2015
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Hello

2016
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I have a simple question

2017
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Just now

2018
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You were talking about

2019
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Axiom can handle CP

2020
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Strong CP problem

2021
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
My network is a bit of a problem

2022
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So I don't seem to hear it clearly

2023
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Can you say it again?

2024
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Sorry

2025
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
You said how to solve strong CP problem

2026
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Go back

2027
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
This is strong CP problem

2028
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
This is

2029
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
In QCD, we can choose this term

2030
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yes, basically

2031
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Just add a particle

2032
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
In this term

2033
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And then

2034
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
When it's very low temperature

2035
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
This

2036
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Axiom will fall to this potential minima

2037
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
This is called

2038
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's also vacuum

2039
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's the vacuum of the axiom

2040
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
This vacuum can just cancel out this CP term

2041
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So this will disappear

2042
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
If this disappears

2043
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's very small

2044
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So it can be explained

2045
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Why the upper bound is so small

2046
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
10-11-2

2047
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So it's very simple

2048
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Just a cancellation

2049
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I see

2050
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I'm from NingTai

2051
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Now there are many

2052
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
People

2053
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
They said they want to be in NingTai

2054
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Find this axiom in the range

2055
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
They mainly do

2056
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
What I want to do is

2057
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Find a normal insulator

2058
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
And a topological insulator

2059
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
On their boundary

2060
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Their

2061
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Maxwell equation

2062
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
There will also be this theta term

2063
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
But

2064
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
On the boundary

2065
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Theta term

2066
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Must be integer or semi-integer

2067
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
This is

2068
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
For this integer semi-integer theta

2069
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Does it make any sense in high energy?

2070
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Or is it actually

2071
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's important

2072
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
How much is this theta

2073
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It doesn't matter at all

2074
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Because this theta is a

2075
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
How to say

2076
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You can't say it's not important

2077
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But some people know this

2078
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You said it's 2π or 2π

2079
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yes, it's integer semi-integer

2080
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Think about it

2081
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Ok

2082
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I can't think of anything special

2083
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Ok

2084
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Let me see

2085
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
But here

2086
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
This is a different theta

2087
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
There is another theta here

2088
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Confused

2089
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
This is a different theta

2090
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Not this

2091
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Different theta

2092
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
This theta is basically

2093
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Is to cancel something

2094
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
In high energy

2095
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Axiom can also be seen as

2096
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Boundary

2097
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Is it related to boundary effect?

2098
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Um

2099
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Wow

2100
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
There is

2101
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Related to boundary

2102
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But it should not be your

2103
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Topological boundary

2104
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Why is this theta term

2105
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Because I just talked about

2106
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Axiom

2107
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
For example, the electrical effect is

2108
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Vector current

2109
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Do you know

2110
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Axiom current

2111
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Passive integral

2112
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Boundary term is

2113
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Non-managed

2114
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Um

2115
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
So it's actually related to boundary

2116
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But not your boundary

2117
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Oh ok

2118
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm sure

2119
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm not familiar with

2120
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Your boundary

2121
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yes

2122
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Actually

2123
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Actually

2124
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
There should be a correspondence

2125
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
There should be a correspondence

2126
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
But I'm not familiar with your boundary

2127
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Anyway, this term is actually

2128
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
From that you

2129
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
That

2130
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Passive integral

2131
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
That

2132
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
EMM

2133
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
EMM

2134
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
What is EMM

2135
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
This is QCD

2136
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
QCD

2137
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That

2138
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Volume

2139
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You can change it to a surface

2140
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Yes

2141
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Ok

2142
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Thank you

2143
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Do you have any questions?

2144
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
That

2145
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That

2146
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Say something

2147
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I used to be with

2148
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Teacher Cui

2149
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
That

2150
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Sorry

2151
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I want to interrupt you

2152
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
You might want

2153
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Do you turn on the sound at the same time

2154
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Then turn on the microphone again

2155
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Because your response is quite big

2156
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
You may have to adjust it to see if you know

2157
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
What's the situation

2158
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
If you are using headphones

2159
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You can turn it into a standard headset or not

2160
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Try using headphones or something

2161
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Otherwise you can't hear it

2162
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Can you try again

2163
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Sorry

2164
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I'm trying

2165
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Ok

2166
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It's almost the same

2167
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
You can only hear it if you speak a little slower

2168
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Sorry

2169
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I mean

2170
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That is

2171
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I am also in Taiwan University

2172
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
That

2173
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So let me add

2174
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
That is about

2175
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
The best quality

2176
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Can you tell me

2177
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Hey

2178
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Actually, I didn't hear it clearly

2179
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
it is good

2180
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Hey

2181
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Hey

2182
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
That response is quite big

2183
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I didn't hear what you said

2184
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Hey

2185
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Hey

2186
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Hey

2187
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Let's give him time to adjust

2188
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Or you can also type

2189
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Does anyone else have a problem

2190
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Of course

2191
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Wait for me to talk a little

2192
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I don't know where it is

2193
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
But this kind of thing

2194
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
This concept has been developed for a long time

2195
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
This is not a new thing

2196
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But in recent years

2197
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Maybe Wimper's experiments

2198
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
May be recorded in the future

2199
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I guess

2200
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Do you have any comments

2201
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Don't say that

2202
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We don't want to lose our jobs

2203
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Isn't your philosophy to explore

2204
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
No

2205
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Just kidding

2206
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I personally have no opinion

2207
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I personally feel

2208
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Things that can be tested should be tested as much as possible

2209
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
This has data

2210
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I think so

2211
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Just now

2212
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Please say

2213
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Hey

2214
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Did someone talk just now

2215
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Let me talk

2216
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Because

2217
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It seems that Action has started to pop up again in recent years

2218
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Experiments seem to be

2219
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Because I remember that there were quite a few experiments at the German conference

2220
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Improving their sensitivity

2221
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Japan has also started to do it recently

2222
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Because the mainstream in Japan

2223
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Is Sucy

2224
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But because of LC

2225
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Can't see

2226
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
So now

2227
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Sucy

2228
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Start to be more visual

2229
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Of course people are still doing it

2230
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
So Action may be

2231
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
In the next few years

2232
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
A public topic

2233
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Just now

2234
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
The previous

2235
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Collaborator

2236
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I may not have heard it clearly

2237
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Hello, can you hear me now

2238
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Try again

2239
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You say

2240
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You just say

2241
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Let's see if we can hear you

2242
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So

2243
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I want to talk about

2244
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Action

2245
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Action

2246
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
OK

2247
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Thank you

2248
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Just say

2249
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Like this

2250
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You can measure

2251
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Your

2252
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Things

2253
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
How many

2254
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
If the mass of Action is too low

2255
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
His

2256
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
His

2257
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Will smooth out

2258
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Smaller

2259
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
So

2260
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
It will be measured

2261
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
It's not the same as the actual measurement

2262
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
So

2263
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The mass

2264
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Is not

2265
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Oh

2266
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
24

2267
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I remember it wrong

2268
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Do you say 10-24 EV

2269
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I heard the speech

2270
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
10-22

2271
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Because

2272
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Because

2273
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Other

2274
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
A little bit

2275
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Alpha

2276
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
You can use

2277
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Galaxy

2278
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Measure his mass

2279
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
This is another observation

2280
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Some other observations

2281
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
The output is like this

2282
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
OK

2283
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
But

2284
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
The

2285
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Low limit is

2286
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
24 or 23

2287
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
24 or 23 OK

2288
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Thank you

2289
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
OK

2290
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Do you have any questions

2291
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You say

2292
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I want to ask the question

2293
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Is with the other

2294
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Do you have any questions

2295
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
You ask

2296
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I heard you ask

2297
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
He just said that

2298
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
What is his material

2299
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
There will be

2300
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
U1

2301
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
The battery

2302
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
That's why

2303
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
High-end words

2304
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Is the battery

2305
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
There is no

2306
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
He is U1

2307
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
U1

2308
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
You can

2309
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
There is no

2310
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Do you have any simple views

2311
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Wait a minute

2312
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
U1

2313
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Is it related to the battery

2314
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Wait a minute

2315
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Battery

2316
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Are you Li Zhaolong

2317
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yes

2318
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I think it should be

2319
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Because this question seems to have been discussed with you before

2320
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
U1 can give

2321
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
What do you say

2322
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
U1 can

2323
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
U1 does not have this

2324
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Only

2325
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I don't know if this is

2326
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Related to others

2327
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
U1

2328
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
U1

2329
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
U1 can take it off

2330
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I can ask

2331
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
The neighbor

2332
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
The question

2333
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Is that student still there

2334
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Is that student still there

2335
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I want to ask

2336
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Hello

2337
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I am

2338
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You just said that

2339
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Is in the material

2340
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
There will be

2341
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
E.B

2342
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Related to Torb

2343
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That object

2344
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Why in that case

2345
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Abelian

2346
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Why is this car still there

2347
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Should be

2348
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I'm not very clear

2349
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But in that

2350
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Topological insulator

2351
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Boundary

2352
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
It is indeed

2353
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Non-Abelian

2354
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
The reason

2355
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I'm not sure

2356
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
You really look at those

2357
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It's the Hamiltonian

2358
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Those

2359
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It is non-Abelian

2360
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
It should be related to this

2361
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
If I remember correctly

2362
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
But

2363
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I'm doing experiments

2364
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm not very clear

2365
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Why is this

2366
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Thank you

2367
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Ok

2368
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
That

2369
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I can trouble

2370
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Can you go back to your first page

2371
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
The first page of the video

2372
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
This

2373
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It's really a cover

2374
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
That

2375
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Because

2376
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Most of what I said today is

2377
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Then there is a framework

2378
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
In fact, the details

2379
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
He has already voted in the archive

2380
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
1806095551

2381
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Of course you can go

2382
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Look at this paper

2383
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You can also find the way to contact He Shuyu

2384
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So if you want to contact He Shuyu

2385
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Is to discuss the details

2386
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Then please contact him in person

2387
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Then our speech today

2388
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Everyone applaud again

2389
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Thank you He Shuyu

2390
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
That Tina

2391
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You can stop recording

2392
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
If you are still there
