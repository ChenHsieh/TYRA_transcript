0	9000	Hello everyone, my name is Wu Mengchang, and I am a student at Mata University.
9000	16000	What I want to talk about today is about 4-way mixing and squeeze light.
16000	22000	If you have any questions at any time, you can ask, just turn on your microphone.
22000	33000	My field is in the field of atomic physics, which is relatively low-energy physics.
33000	44000	Our research unit is JQI, which is the United States Department of State.
44000	52000	It is a rather special institution, which is under the Department of Commerce in the United States.
52000	58000	Although they don't sound like they are doing this kind of specialized research,
58000	63000	they have actually won four Nobel Prizes in atomic physics.
63000	68000	So it's a pretty special national standard.
68000	71000	My instructor is Paul Leitz.
71000	77000	Our main source of research funding is from the Air Force in the United States.
77000	85000	At the beginning, I want to let everyone know what squeezing means.
85000	111000	We want to compress all the information into a better measurement.
112000	116000	After watching the video, let's get down to business.
116000	121000	The experiment we are doing now is using laser light.
121000	126000	The characteristic of laser light is that it is a coherent state.
126000	129000	What is a coherent state?
129000	133000	I don't know if you've heard of it.
133000	136000	I'm sure you've heard of the non-coherent principle.
137000	141000	The non-coherent principle tells us that we can't...
141000	149000	We used to think that the results of delta x and delta t must be greater than h-bar.
149000	158000	We can imagine that our laser light has a so-called non-coherent property.
158000	165000	Non-coherent property means that it has its government amplitude and its horizontal axis.
165000	171000	Both of these can't be measured very accurately in practice.
171000	174000	That is to say, it has its limits.
174000	180000	You can see that when our laser light is in coherent state,
180000	183000	Basically, it's always in coherent state.
183000	187000	When it's in coherent state, you'll see its...
187000	192000	Its FN or phase fluctuation is actually...
192000	194000	Its result is in...
194000	203000	That is to say, the curve on the left represents the line that meets the non-coherent principle.
203000	207000	Mathematically, we know that when your delta...
208000	213000	My y-axis is delta e, and my x-axis is delta phi.
213000	216000	If these two variables are in the minimum value,
216000	222000	When the two are equal, they are actually in their so-called minimum value.
222000	227000	Laser light is when these two values are equal.
227000	231000	Then it presents such a coherent state.
231000	236000	So what is Squeeze state?
236000	239000	Squeeze state means that you can...
239000	245000	That is to say, we don't need to measure all the information of laser light very accurately.
245000	249000	We can say that we just need to measure the phase very accurately.
249000	253000	Or we can measure our government very accurately.
253000	256000	When you see that your phase is measured very accurately,
256000	260000	In fact, it still meets its non-coherent principle.
261000	265000	Then it will lead to the inaccuracy of your government.
265000	267000	It will become very large.
267000	271000	Then your phase can be measured very accurately.
271000	274000	So a while ago, probably the year before last,
274000	277000	Isn't there a gravity wave measurement experiment?
277000	284000	It is to use this Squeeze light to throw away your impurities.
284000	287000	I will talk about quantum impurities.
287000	290000	Because you are in coherent state.
290000	295000	Then go to the limits of quantum mechanics.
295000	300000	Then push it to compress it so that you can measure the phase very accurately.
300000	305000	Then they may have a so-called interferer.
305000	309000	Then the interferer can measure the phase of something.
309000	312000	If the gravity wave passes over the earth,
312000	320000	Then you can measure the phase of this gravity wave.
320000	322000	There will be some changes.
322000	325000	As long as you have a way to enter this Squeeze state,
325000	331000	You can let a certain frequency of the phase be able to measure it very accurately.
331000	335000	Because the gravity wave passes through like this,
335000	337000	So its frequency will be very weak.
337000	340000	If you are very weak, your impurities will be very strong.
340000	344000	You need to have a way to get rid of this impurity.
344000	348000	Then measure to the phase you want.
351000	354000	But what we did in the experiment,
354000	357000	We did another one.
357000	360000	We are so-called Two-Mode Squeezing.
360000	362000	Two-Mode Squeezing is to say,
362000	368000	I'm producing two intangles of light.
368000	373000	That is to say, I now have some special light and non-linear effects.
373000	377000	Then produce two intangles.
377000	379000	What about these two intangles?
379000	383000	Some of their signals are exactly the same.
383000	386000	So if I input a light,
386000	388000	That light is called Probe.
388000	390000	Then it will produce its oscillation.
390000	392000	It uses a Twin Beam.
392000	395000	These two lights have each other.
395000	398000	For example, there is quantum co-relative.
398000	401000	That is, quantum co-relative.
401000	403000	Quantum co-relative.
403000	408000	So when I can put these two lights together,
408000	414000	I can get another one called Intensity Difference.
414000	418000	That is to say, I can let my Intensity Difference,
418000	426000	to measure the noise of this two-mode intensity is the lowest.
426000	429000	This may be a bit abstract.
429000	432000	I'll show you some data later.
432000	436000	If you don't quite understand, you can ask me again.
439000	443000	The preliminary introduction is,
443000	450000	I spent 20 minutes to introduce what happened.
450000	454000	I have introduced the background knowledge needed at the beginning.
454000	458000	If no one has any questions, I will continue.
458000	460000	OK.
460000	463000	How do we make this?
463000	464000	Excuse me.
464000	466000	You just said that the intangles,
466000	470000	How is it produced?
470000	477000	Is it also produced by something?
477000	481000	Is it produced by intangles?
481000	483000	We don't use intangles.
483000	486000	We use Rubidium Vapor.
486000	489000	Rubidium is a 2A group.
489000	493000	The Rubinium Nitrate.
493000	495000	Rubinium Nitrate.
495000	499000	We will hit a very strong laser beam.
499000	505000	This strong laser beam will have a non-linear interaction with a very weak beam.
505000	509000	Then produce another conjugate,
509000	513000	another intangle beam.
513000	516000	How are they produced?
516000	518000	I will introduce a little later.
518000	522000	How do they produce this twin beam?
522000	526000	I want to talk about 4-Way Missing.
526000	528000	4-Way Missing.
528000	532000	Total is 4 beams.
532000	535000	But we only put 2 beams in.
535000	538000	Then 3 beams will be produced.
538000	541000	There will be a more detailed explanation of the pattern later.
541000	543000	How is this produced?
543000	545000	Thank you.
545000	548000	Can I ask a question?
549000	553000	What is 4WM?
553000	555000	4 is 4.
555000	558000	W is 4-Way Missing.
558000	562000	Or translated into Chinese,
562000	565000	it is 4-Way Missing.
565000	567000	4-Way Missing.
567000	571000	I should say that it is the abbreviation of this.
571000	574000	My standard abbreviation.
574000	579000	Does it mean that 4 waves are mixed together?
579000	581000	Yes.
581000	583000	But you only have 2 beams.
583000	588000	I will show you a picture of the conjugate later.
588000	591000	Then everyone will be confused.
591000	595000	Did you just say that these 2 beams are added or subtracted?
595000	598000	Added.
598000	602000	Because they are...
602000	606000	Actually, they said that the intensity of the beam is 1.
606000	609000	Then the intensity of the beam will have a magnification ratio.
609000	613000	The magnification ratio is G.
613000	616000	So the light coming out is G.
616000	620000	Then the other conjugate beam is G-1.
620000	624000	So they even put that...
624000	626000	Originally it was Coherent State.
626000	628000	If it has a magnification effect,
628000	630000	it will become Thermal State.
630000	634000	That is to say, it is no longer the original laser beam.
634000	636000	It is a very messy light.
636000	639000	After the two conjugates are subtracted,
639000	644000	you will see the effect of the twin.
644000	646000	They become very messy together.
646000	648000	But when they are subtracted,
648000	653000	they will see that they are actually very beautiful and become messy together.
653000	655000	OK, thank you.
655000	656000	May I ask a question?
656000	660000	So what is the power of these laser beams?
660000	665000	My pump power is about 750mW.
665000	666000	It's quite big.
666000	670000	Of course, it can't be compared to super fast light.
670000	673000	We are continuous wave.
673000	676000	OK, you also answered my second question.
676000	678000	Sorry, let's continue.
678000	683000	The result we did is...
683000	688000	There is a relatively influential improvement.
688000	693000	Our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.
693000	699000	When you want to look at the magnification compression,
699000	701000	the lower the frequency,
701000	705000	the greater the interference in other environments.
705000	707000	For example, you walk over there.
707000	709000	Or you have a call coming in.
709000	714000	These may have some interference in your system.
714000	719000	Then it will cause you to be unable to see the so-called squeeze light at a very low frequency.
719000	722000	That is, the compression of the magnification.
722000	727000	Even if there is a car driving on the main road,
727000	729000	it will have a great impact.
729000	735000	So our lab is doing experiments in such a deep basement.
735000	738000	Our result is...
738000	742000	Anyway, our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.
742000	749000	In recent years, we have broken through the following three orders.
749000	754000	From Kilohertz down to about 1,000 times to a few Hertz.
754000	758000	You can see the effect of the magnification compression.
758000	764000	Especially like the gravitational wave measurement I introduced at the beginning.
764000	768000	It must be seen at a very low frequency.
768000	775000	Because theoretical mathematicians have calculated the magnitude of the gravitational wave.
775000	780000	So if you can only see the squeeze light of Kilohertz,
780000	785000	you can't use it to do these gravitational wave measurements.
785000	789000	So in the past ten years,
789000	799000	this squeeze light has been developed in such a way that it can still have this effect at a very low frequency.
799000	804000	In the future, it will be possible to measure the gravitational wave.
804000	809000	In the result of our experiment,
809000	813000	there will be some applications in image processing.
813000	818000	Because you want to see if you can pass the image through a very weak light.
818000	822000	Then maybe you can do some biological experiments.
822000	824000	A lot of low light hits your sample.
824000	828000	Then you can get rid of these impurities.
828000	830000	Then you can see the signal very clearly.
830000	835000	So it has some applications in biology.
835000	838000	Then it can even do some correction.
838000	842000	And it's a quantum correction.
842000	845000	Then I will continue to introduce it later.
845000	848000	This is our 4-way missing.
848000	853000	So on the right, we are.
853000	856000	This is our wafer cell.
856000	858000	I drew the picture like this.
858000	861000	The length of this wafer cell is about two centimeters long.
861000	869000	Then the diameter is about an inch.
869000	871000	Anyway, it's a very small cell.
871000	875000	Then you put a very strong pump beam in.
875000	880000	Then the strength of this pump beam is about 450 mW.
880000	887000	Then it will interact with the other very weak beam.
887000	889000	Then you look at the link map on the left.
889000	892000	There are a lot of links in it.
892000	895000	But we only care about the link that we will call.
895000	899000	This lambda type link.
899000	903000	It should be quite common to do quantum computing.
903000	906000	There may be something very famous in quantum computing.
906000	908000	It's called EIT.
908000	911000	Slow light storage technology.
911000	914000	Basically, it's quite similar to that.
914000	917000	For example, you hit a very strong pump beam.
917000	919000	Very strong pump beam.
919000	922000	Then it will interact with your probe beam.
922000	924000	Then this very strong pump beam.
924000	928000	It also interacts with the ground state on the other side.
928000	932000	Then because of energy conservation.
932000	937000	So it releases the fourth conjugate beam.
937000	940000	So you only hit two beams in.
940000	943000	But in a continuous operation.
943000	947000	It actually acts like there are four waves interacting with each other.
947000	950000	Two of the four waves are the same pump beam.
950000	954000	So this pump beam is at the same time as these two ground states.
954000	959000	What you want to see is that.
959000	962000	In addition to energy conservation.
962000	966000	It actually has to meet the other momentum conservation.
966000	970000	Then we usually don't talk about momentum conservation.
970000	972000	We also talk about phase matching.
972000	977000	In other words, this wave pump beam.
977000	980000	In addition to interacting with the probe beam.
980000	981000	The momentum inside.
981000	985000	That is to say, the pump beam and the probe beam have a very small angle.
985000	987000	About 0.3, 0.4 degrees.
987000	991000	Then we have four waves.
991000	995000	So the total momentum of this pump beam.
995000	996000	There will be two.
996000	999000	Then it will produce another conjugate beam.
999000	1001000	So it's in the other direction.
1001000	1002000	Then you see.
1002000	1005000	When you have any phase fluctuation.
1005000	1008000	Or any frequency fluctuation.
1008000	1011000	It has to meet this.
1011000	1014000	Momentum energy conservation rate.
1014000	1019000	So any fluctuation has to make it consistent.
1019000	1022000	So this is a bit.
1022000	1025000	This is a more general way to explain.
1025000	1028000	Because they have to be energy conservative.
1028000	1029000	Momentum conservation.
1029000	1032000	So any fluctuation.
1032000	1035000	The fluctuations must be consistent.
1035000	1037000	In order to meet this condition at the same time.
1037000	1040000	That's how it produces the twin beam.
1040000	1044000	This is some of our experimental conditions.
1044000	1046000	Then you will see this delta.
1046000	1047000	Big delta.
1047000	1050000	This big delta is about 1.3GHz.
1050000	1053000	It's a pretty far detune.
1053000	1056000	Because of our experiment.
1056000	1058000	In fact, our entire group is called.
1058000	1060000	Laser cooling and tracking.
1060000	1063000	Our group is called.
1063000	1069000	Laser cooling and tracking team.
1069000	1070000	Research team is like this.
1070000	1073000	One of us.
1073000	1075000	Our big boss is.
1075000	1076000	We have a big boss.
1076000	1078000	Then there are four teachers below.
1078000	1080000	Then I did this.
1080000	1083000	The only thing is to do it with heat source.
1083000	1086000	This heat source is about 120°C.
1086000	1087000	We have to heat it up.
1087000	1089000	Then let it become a vapor.
1089000	1091000	So at the beginning, someone just asked.
1091000	1093000	Are we using crystal or what?
1093000	1095000	We are not using crystal.
1095000	1096000	If you use crystal.
1096000	1100000	There are other.
1100000	1102000	Also doing.
1102000	1105000	Or doing that kind of twin beam.
1105000	1107000	In fact, they are doing single mode.
1107000	1110000	Anyway, crystal can also be used to do that.
1110000	1111000	Squeeze line.
1111000	1113000	But.
1113000	1116000	Anyway, some principles are still a bit different.
1116000	1118000	We might use.
1118000	1123000	K3 is the third stage.
1123000	1127000	If it is crystal, it may be K2.
1127000	1131000	There are some differences in nature.
1131000	1132000	That's right.
1132000	1133000	Then the next one is.
1133000	1134000	We are several.
1134000	1137000	This one is about ten years ago.
1137000	1139000	Experimental results.
1139000	1141000	That.
1141000	1142000	You will see that.
1142000	1143000	Ten years ago.
1143000	1145000	We actually used TESAFA laser.
1145000	1147000	To do this experiment.
1147000	1148000	That.
1148000	1149000	TESAFA laser is.
1149000	1152000	Its feature is that it is very expensive.
1152000	1154000	That's about.
1154000	1155000	One or two decades ago.
1155000	1156000	We.
1156000	1158000	Buy a TESAFA.
1158000	1159000	About.
1159000	1160000	More than 200,000 dollars.
1160000	1161000	Then now it is more than 200,000.
1161000	1162000	Or its.
1162000	1163000	Power becomes stronger.
1163000	1164000	That's right.
1164000	1165000	You see.
1165000	1166000	The company is doing this experiment.
1166000	1168000	You need to have one.
1168000	1169000	Very expensive.
1169000	1170000	TESAFA laser.
1170000	1171000	More than 200,000 dollars.
1171000	1172000	This.
1172000	1175000	This is not practical at all.
1175000	1176000	So.
1176000	1177000	We started to develop.
1177000	1178000	Cheaper.
1178000	1179000	Then again.
1179000	1180000	It is a dilutable.
1180000	1182000	Laser light source.
1182000	1183000	That's it.
1183000	1186000	What about the TESAFA laser we used at the beginning?
1186000	1187000	Go again.
1187000	1190000	When doing this low-frequency quantization.
1190000	1191000	There is a.
1191000	1192000	Ah.
1193000	1196000	Should I talk about this first?
1196000	1198000	Experimental map.
1198000	1199000	What does it mean?
1199000	1200000	That is.
1200000	1203000	Here you will see the blue line here.
1203000	1206000	The blue line here is the so-called shot noise.
1206000	1207000	Then I just started.
1207000	1208000	Not to say.
1208000	1209000	Laser light.
1209000	1210000	It is coherent state.
1210000	1211000	What about coherent state?
1211000	1212000	In fact.
1212000	1214000	One of its features is that.
1214000	1215000	Its impurities.
1215000	1216000	Will not change.
1216000	1219000	According to the frequency of your measurement.
1219000	1220000	That is to say.
1220000	1221000	You are measuring.
1221000	1223000	You are now inserting a light.
1223000	1224000	This.
1224000	1225000	This picture has pink.
1225000	1226000	This light.
1226000	1227000	Insert.
1227000	1228000	Then you use this photodial.
1228000	1229000	To detect this.
1229000	1231000	Then send it in.
1231000	1233000	Spectrum analyzer.
1233000	1234000	That is.
1234000	1235000	Spectrum.
1235000	1236000	Spectrum analyzer.
1236000	1237000	That.
1237000	1239000	This spectrum analyzer will tell you.
1239000	1240000	This.
1240000	1244000	How much is the impurity of the frequency of this light?
1244000	1246000	If you insert this light.
1246000	1247000	It's a laser.
1247000	1248000	It's a coherent state.
1248000	1249000	Its impurities.
1249000	1250000	Its impurities.
1250000	1251000	Will not change.
1251000	1253000	According to the frequency of your measurement.
1253000	1255000	Just like this blue light.
1255000	1256000	The blue.
1256000	1258000	The curve is like this.
1258000	1260000	We insert a light.
1260000	1262000	Then use a beam splitter.
1262000	1264000	Divide this light into half.
1264000	1266000	Then divide it into half.
1266000	1268000	Then subtract these two.
1268000	1271000	Then do the measurement of this impurity.
1271000	1273000	Then why do these two subtract?
1273000	1274000	Because.
1274000	1275000	You can also.
1275000	1276000	You can only measure one light.
1276000	1277000	That is.
1277000	1279000	You can also get a similar answer.
1279000	1281000	It's just the impurity power.
1281000	1282000	If you measure one light.
1282000	1284000	The impurity power will be halved.
1284000	1286000	If you measure two lights.
1286000	1288000	The impurity power will be doubled.
1288000	1289000	That's it.
1289000	1290000	There is another one.
1290000	1292000	The reason we want to divide it into two lights.
1292000	1293000	That is.
1293000	1295000	In fact, although the laser light is a coherent state.
1295000	1297000	But it's in the low frequency.
1297000	1299000	There are all kinds of impurities.
1299000	1300000	Will come in.
1300000	1302000	If you don't use two lights.
1302000	1303000	If you don't use two lights.
1303000	1305000	You can't put those.
1305000	1307000	The so-called classical impurity.
1307000	1309000	Or the technical impurity.
1309000	1310000	Eliminate it.
1310000	1311000	So you have to use.
1311000	1312000	Use one light.
1312000	1313000	Divide it into two.
1313000	1315000	Then do the subtraction.
1315000	1317000	Then measure the impurity.
1317000	1318000	This is the so-called.
1318000	1319000	I will talk about it later.
1319000	1321000	It is the so-called shot noise.
1321000	1323000	It's called the mega shot.
1323000	1324000	Its frequency.
1324000	1326000	It should always be flat.
1326000	1328000	This is a.
1328000	1330000	Our field is a very.
1330000	1331000	Ah.
1331000	1333000	I didn't know this was a common thing before I came in.
1333000	1334000	Then now.
1334000	1336000	Okay, this is the coherent state.
1336000	1338000	The impurity must be.
1338000	1339000	The so-called.
1339000	1341000	The so-called two-color frequency has changed.
1341000	1343000	So it's the so-called shot noise.
1343000	1345000	What about the red light?
1345000	1347000	This is what I just produced.
1347000	1349000	Glow beam.
1349000	1351000	I am not.
1351000	1352000	I am now.
1352000	1354000	To be more specific.
1354000	1356000	The setting of our experiment is to say.
1356000	1359000	I hit a pump beam.
1359000	1360000	Then.
1360000	1363000	Hit another glow beam.
1363000	1364000	Then these two.
1364000	1366000	Intensity.
1366000	1367000	The pump beam.
1367000	1370000	Its intensity is about 10,000 times as strong as the glow beam.
1370000	1371000	Yes.
1371000	1374000	Then it goes through this non-linear.
1374000	1375000	Element.
1375000	1377000	The element plus.
1377000	1378000	After the effect.
1378000	1380000	It will produce this glow beam.
1380000	1382000	This glow beam is amplified.
1382000	1383000	Yes.
1383000	1385000	Then it will also produce another one.
1385000	1387000	Conjugate beam.
1387000	1388000	So they are a twin.
1388000	1391000	Then after these two lights are cut off.
1392000	1393000	I call it.
1393000	1394000	Intensity.
1394000	1395000	Difference.
1395000	1396000	Squeezing.
1396000	1398000	Or in other words, it is squeeze.
1398000	1400000	In other words, it is squeeze light.
1400000	1401000	Then these two lights.
1401000	1403000	That is to say.
1403000	1404000	We will.
1404000	1406000	To control the light of this input.
1406000	1409000	Then let the power of the output light.
1409000	1411000	With these two lights.
1411000	1414000	The power of these two shot noise lights is exactly the same.
1414000	1415000	Then you will see.
1415000	1416000	When we.
1416000	1418000	If I have the so-called.
1418000	1420000	Squeeze light.
1420000	1421000	Squeeze light.
1421000	1423000	My two intensity.
1423000	1424000	Difference.
1424000	1427000	This is weaker than my shot noise.
1427000	1428000	Sorry.
1428000	1429000	Let me ask.
1429000	1432000	So the frequency of your four lights should be.
1432000	1434000	What is the range?
1434000	1435000	Because.
1435000	1438000	So the frequency below you should be.
1438000	1440000	The frequency of the big noise.
1440000	1441000	Right?
1441000	1442000	Ah.
1442000	1444000	It should not be called big noise.
1444000	1445000	Because these two.
1445000	1447000	The frequency of these two lights is different.
1447000	1448000	Yes.
1448000	1449000	You look at the left picture.
1449000	1450000	Have you seen this cross-section?
1450000	1451000	Yes.
1451000	1453000	So you have two pink lights.
1453000	1456000	Is it a wave of visible light?
1456000	1457000	He.
1457000	1459000	In fact, he is a distant infrared light.
1459000	1461000	Light of 795nm.
1461000	1462000	Ah.
1462000	1463000	Yes.
1463000	1464000	So that.
1464000	1465000	That is also right.
1465000	1467000	A few hundred terahertz.
1467000	1468000	Right?
1468000	1469000	Yes.
1469000	1470000	So you.
1470000	1471000	So you just.
1471000	1474000	The next page.
1474000	1475000	That one.
1475000	1476000	Um.
1476000	1478000	The following frequency is kilohertz.
1478000	1480000	Is it the difference between the two?
1480000	1481000	My.
1481000	1482000	The problem is.
1482000	1483000	Is.
1483000	1484000	The frequency on both sides.
1484000	1485000	You.
1485000	1486000	You want to see.
1486000	1487000	You.
1487000	1488000	You have a side wave now.
1488000	1489000	Correct.
1489000	1491000	Then this side wave has a side wave frequency.
1491000	1492000	Right?
1492000	1493000	But I.
1493000	1494000	I am now.
1494000	1495000	I.
1495000	1496000	I'm talking about.
1496000	1497000	These noise.
1497000	1498000	To do.
1498000	1499000	Negative analysis.
1499000	1500000	Of.
1500000	1502000	Noise frequency.
1502000	1503000	Not to say.
1503000	1505000	My whole side wave.
1505000	1506000	What is the frequency?
1506000	1507000	Not this frequency.
1507000	1508000	But this noise.
1508000	1509000	He has his own frequency.
1509000	1510000	He has.
1510000	1511000	So.
1511000	1512000	So you just.
1512000	1513000	Your next page.
1513000	1514000	The noise.
1514000	1515000	Your next page.
1515000	1516000	Spectrum is.
1516000	1517000	These noise.
1517000	1518000	Spectrum.
1518000	1519000	Not the light itself.
1519000	1520000	Spectrum.
1520000	1521000	Yes.
1521000	1522000	That is.
1522000	1523000	His noise.
1523000	1524000	Just make sure.
1524000	1525000	Um.
1525000	1526000	Good.
1526000	1527000	Thank you.
1527000	1528000	Continue.
1528000	1529000	Because like.
1529000	1530000	Light.
1530000	1531000	Light has his.
1531000	1532000	His distribution.
1532000	1533000	So.
1534000	1535000	Anyway, he.
1535000	1536000	He actually.
1536000	1537000	Anyway, he.
1537000	1538000	He.
1538000	1539000	There will be a.
1539000	1540000	Distribution of noise.
1540000	1541000	That.
1541000	1542000	If it is.
1542000	1543000	His distribution of noise.
1543000	1544000	That is to say.
1544000	1545000	His frequency.
1545000	1546000	The noise.
1546000	1547000	The power should be the same.
1547000	1548000	This.
1548000	1549000	That.
1549000	1550000	Uh.
1550000	1551000	Here.
1551000	1552000	For missing noise.
1552000	1553000	That is.
1553000	1554000	I.
1554000	1555000	I do.
1555000	1556000	Intensity difference.
1556000	1557000	When.
1557000	1558000	The noise.
1558000	1559000	That.
1559000	1560000	Uh.
1590000	1591000	That red.
1591000	1592000	This.
1592000	1593000	The noise of the customer.
1593000	1594000	Only left.
1594000	1595000	The original.
1595000	1596000	Only 17%.
1596000	1597000	His.
1597000	1598000	His noise is.
1598000	1599000	It's actually very weak.
1599000	1600000	That's right.
1600000	1601000	The focus here is to say.
1601000	1602000	You can see.
1602000	1603000	Hey.
1603000	1604000	When it's low.
1604000	1605000	There are some small peaks.
1605000	1606000	In fact.
1606000	1607000	This small peak.
1607000	1608000	That is.
1608000	1609000	This.
1609000	1610000	Very expensive.
1610000	1611000	There are very stupid.
1611000	1612000	The disadvantages of TESLA.
1612000	1613000	Because.
1613000	1614000	There will be cavities in it.
1614000	1615000	That.
1615000	1616000	This.
1616000	1617000	Cavity will.
1617000	1618000	Causing him.
1618000	1619000	Will have these.
1619000	1620000	The noise.
1620000	1621000	Run out.
1621000	1622000	So.
1622000	1623000	When you are in low frequency.
1623000	1624000	Will receive these.
1624000	1625000	Cavity noise.
1625000	1626000	Affect.
1626000	1627000	You can't see it.
1627000	1628000	Very low frequency.
1628000	1629000	Mass noise.
1629000	1630000	Compression.
1630000	1631000	Right.
1631000	1632000	That.
1632000	1633000	Assuming that.
1633000	1634000	Uh.
1634000	1635000	We are.
1635000	1636000	When doing experiments.
1636000	1637000	Sometimes put the laser.
1637000	1638000	Will lock the laser.
1638000	1640000	What does it mean to lock the laser?
1640000	1641000	Just let.
1641000	1642000	Its frequency is fixed.
1642000	1644000	It won't float around.
1644000	1645000	Or let.
1645000	1646000	Its width.
1646000	1647000	Narrow.
1647000	1648000	That.
1648000	1649000	The meaning of the line width narrowing.
1649000	1650000	That is to say.
1650000	1651000	I have a sine now.
1651000	1652000	That.
1652000	1653000	Your.
1653000	1654000	Is your sine a very simple sine?
1654000	1655000	Or.
1655000	1656000	Your sine.
1656000	1657000	Sine.
1657000	1658000	Or.
1658000	1659000	There is a plane.
1659000	1660000	The sine.
1660000	1661000	That is to say.
1661000	1662000	This plane.
1662000	1663000	That is to say.
1663000	1664000	I'm talking about.
1664000	1665000	Right.
1665000	1666000	This plane.
1666000	1667000	Right.
1667000	1668000	That.
1668000	1669000	Okay.
1669000	1670000	That's about it.
1670000	1671000	So.
1671000	1672000	So.
1672000	1673000	There is a picture here.
1673000	1674000	That is to say.
1674000	1675000	Let's measure.
1675000	1676000	TESLA.
1676000	1677000	This.
1677000	1678000	When we lock the laser.
1678000	1679000	You will find that.
1679000	1680000	This.
1680000	1681000	The blue dash 9.
1681000	1682000	Is.
1682000	1683000	That is.
1683000	1684000	When we do time.
1684000	1685000	We just.
1685000	1686000	Anyway, just hit the light.
1686000	1687000	Hit in.
1687000	1688000	Fiber.
1688000	1689000	Then go.
1689000	1690000	To measure its.
1690000	1691000	Line width.
1691000	1692000	Right.
1692000	1693000	You will see that it is probably.
1693000	1694000	Maybe a few.
1694000	1695000	A few hundred.
1695000	1696000	Or a few dozen.
1696000	1697000	Kilohertz.
1697000	1698000	The blue dash 9.
1698000	1699000	Its width is probably.
1699000	1700000	Maybe a few dozen.
1700000	1701000	Kilohertz.
1701000	1702000	So.
1702000	1703000	So.
1703000	1704000	Narrow.
1704000	1705000	It's pretty beautiful.
1705000	1706000	But.
1707000	1709000	It's getting worse.
1710000	1711000	This is.
1711000	1712000	The disadvantage of TESLA laser.
1712000	1713000	That is to say.
1713000	1714000	You lock up.
1714000	1715000	In fact.
1715000	1716000	Your frequency is fixed.
1716000	1717000	But.
1717000	1718000	The quality of your laser.
1718000	1720000	It's getting worse.
1720000	1721000	Right.
1721000	1722000	Then you have to.
1722000	1723000	Put it.
1723000	1724000	Line width becomes narrower.
1724000	1725000	In fact.
1725000	1727000	It will be quite complicated.
1727000	1728000	Then we look at another.
1728000	1730000	Red curve.
1730000	1731000	This red curve.
1731000	1732000	Is.
1732000	1733000	2D laser.
1733000	1734000	Then.
1734000	1735000	When you haven't locked up.
1735000	1736000	It's like this.
1736000	1737000	It's dash 9.
1737000	1738000	Red dash 9.
1738000	1739000	It's.
1739000	1740000	About a few.
1740000	1741000	Megahertz.
1741000	1742000	So wide.
1742000	1743000	But when we lock up.
1743000	1744000	After.
1744000	1745000	This red line.
1745000	1747000	It becomes very narrow.
1747000	1748000	It's probably a few.
1748000	1749000	Probably.
1749000	1750000	Even less than.
1750000	1751000	A kilohertz.
1751000	1752000	So narrow.
1752000	1753000	Line width.
1753000	1754000	So.
1754000	1755000	For 2D laser.
1755000	1756000	It may.
1756000	1757000	Our laser.
1757000	1758000	2D laser.
1758000	1759000	About.
1759000	1760000	Only 20,000 to 30,000 dollars.
1760000	1761000	So.
1761000	1762000	So it is also.
1762000	1763000	Relative to.
1763000	1764000	It's a lot cheaper than.
1764000	1765000	TESLA.
1765000	1766000	About.
1766000	1767000	One TESLA.
1767000	1768000	You can buy.
1768000	1769000	About nine.
1769000	1770000	2D laser.
1770000	1771000	Like this.
1771000	1772000	But.
1772000	1773000	2D laser.
1773000	1774000	It's actually.
1774000	1775000	Its.
1775000	1776000	Light is weaker.
1776000	1777000	Correct.
1777000	1778000	Then this is another team.
1778000	1779000	In.
1779000	1780000	Australian.
1780000	1781000	Experimental research.
1781000	1782000	Then he is.
1782000	1783000	I just forgot.
1783000	1784000	Who asked.
1784000	1785000	That is.
1785000	1786000	They are using.
1786000	1787000	Crystal to do.
1787000	1788000	Then their method.
1788000	1789000	It's not called.
1789000	1790000	4-way missing.
1790000	1791000	Then their method.
1791000	1792000	It's called.
1792000	1793000	What is OPO?
1793000	1794000	Ah.
1794000	1795000	Important.
1795000	1796000	Correct.
1796000	1797000	This is.
1797000	1798000	This is another kind of use.
1798000	1799000	Ah.
1799000	1800000	In the way of opening.
1800000	1801000	To do.
1801000	1802000	Squeeze line.
1802000	1803000	Then they.
1803000	1804000	This.
1804000	1805000	This picture on the left.
1805000	1806000	You will see this black.
1806000	1807000	This.
1807000	1808000	This straight line.
1808000	1809000	Is the so-called.
1809000	1810000	Shot noise.
1810000	1811000	Shot noise.
1811000	1812000	I just said.
1812000	1813000	Laser light noise.
1813000	1814000	Then you will see.
1814000	1815000	There are other.
1815000	1816000	Very messy line.
1816000	1817000	There are red lines.
1817000	1818000	Blue line.
1818000	1819000	Red line.
1819000	1820000	Black line.
1820000	1821000	Blue line.
1821000	1822000	Then you will see.
1822000	1823000	There is a power here.
1823000	1824000	That is to say.
1824000	1825000	His power.
1825000	1826000	From 6.
1826000	1827000	From 6.
1827000	1828000	Microwave.
1828000	1829000	Down to.
1829000	1830000	0.7.
1830000	1831000	Microwave.
1831000	1832000	Down to a few.
1832000	1833000	Power.
1833000	1834000	When.
1834000	1835000	You will see.
1835000	1836000	His.
1836000	1837000	Miscellaneous.
1837000	1838000	Low frequency.
1838000	1839000	When.
1839000	1840000	Getting weaker and weaker.
1840000	1841000	Correct.
1841000	1842000	That.
1842000	1843000	In fact, this piece of paper.
1843000	1844000	He.
1844000	1845000	I don't know.
1845000	1846000	Why.
1846000	1847000	Will be like this.
1847000	1848000	Anyway, they are.
1848000	1849000	They are a record.
1849000	1850000	That is to say.
1850000	1851000	It's at 280 Hz.
1851000	1852000	That.
1852000	1853000	That.
1853000	1854000	In fact, we already know.
1854000	1855000	Why.
1855000	1856000	That.
1856000	1857000	He.
1857000	1858000	Because.
1858000	1859000	It's his own problem.
1859000	1860000	So there will be some.
1860000	1861000	Some.
1861000	1862000	Peak.
1862000	1863000	Noise.
1863000	1864000	Is particularly strong.
1864000	1865000	But.
1865000	1866000	These are not important.
1866000	1867000	The point is.
1867000	1868000	He can be very low.
1868000	1869000	Very low frequency.
1869000	1870000	More than 200 Hz.
1870000	1871000	Can still.
1871000	1872000	See.
1872000	1873000	The effect of the noise reduction.
1873000	1874000	As long as it is below zero.
1874000	1875000	Is.
1875000	1876000	The effect of the reduction.
1876000	1877000	That.
1877000	1878000	Blue line.
1878000	1879000	With black line.
1879000	1880000	Oh, no.
1880000	1881000	The red line and the black line.
1881000	1882000	Is.
1882000	1883000	At low frequency.
1883000	1884000	There are a lot of.
1884000	1885000	Classic noise.
1885000	1886000	Basic noise.
1886000	1887000	It's hard to see.
1887000	1888000	Noise reduction.
1888000	1889000	Effect.
1889000	1890000	Especially when.
1890000	1891000	It's very powerful.
1891000	1892000	When.
1892000	1893000	That.
1893000	1894000	This.
1894000	1895000	Next.
1895000	1896000	These are.
1896000	1897000	That.
1897000	1898000	Is.
