00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, I'm Yen-Yung Chang, the host of Tera.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We are going to have the second lecture of Tera this year.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today's speaker is...

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Wait a minute, I have to scroll up first.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today's speaker is Bi-Yao Zhuang.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
She is from DC's George Washington University.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
She is a fourth-year doctor of mechanical engineering.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She specializes in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She is going to talk about...

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Flux Reconstruction Correlation Procedure via Reconstruction in Computational Fluid Dynamics.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's welcome her.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi, I'm Bi-Yao Zhuang.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm a fourth-year doctor of George Washington University.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I specialize in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I specialize in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I specialize in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I recently learned about a new numerical method called Flux Reconstruction.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oops, I accidentally typed the wrong title.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Never mind.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's called...

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It doesn't have a Chinese name.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was first proposed in 2007.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The second paper was published in 2009.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Other groups joined the field in 2012 and 2013.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, it doesn't have a Chinese name.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's called Flux Reconstruction.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
As you can see, there is a typo in the title.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a reconstruction.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Some groups thought the name was bad.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, they renamed it to Correction Procedure via Reconstruction.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's basically the same.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There are two groups in the UK.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There are three groups.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
One group is in NASA.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
One group is in Stanford.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
One group is in the UK.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In the UK and Stanford, they are called FR, Flux Reconstruction.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In NASA, they are called CPR, Correction Procedure via Reconstruction.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I recently learned about this.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think it can be used for my doctoral research.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It just started in computational physics.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There is still a lot of room for development.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I just finished learning this.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I read a lot of papers and learned a lot.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, I have some insights.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm here to make a progress report.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm here to share with you what this numerical method is doing.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What I'm going to talk about today is...

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
First, let me introduce some basic concepts of numerical methods.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not sure what your background is.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, there will be some basic introduction of numerical methods.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To avoid some people who are not doing numerical simulation and don't understand.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Next, I will introduce how to introduce Flux Reconstruction.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Basically, the first part is like a math class.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's a mathematical introduction.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The last part is how I want to apply it to incompressible flow.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Because my main research is to do incompressible flow.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The group that proposed Flux Reconstruction, like Stanford or the UK.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They are all doing compressible flow.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, at least so far, if you look for Literature Review.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I haven't seen any group using this method in incompressible flow.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, I plan to do my research in this direction.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So, I will briefly talk about my future plan.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
First, I want to introduce a very important concept in numerical methods.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's called the Full-Weight Fragmentation Method.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It can infer all kinds of different numerical methods.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's the foundation of the foundation.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, I'm going to introduce it.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Today, there is a Full-Weight Fragmentation Method.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
At present, many phenomena in the natural world are unified by the Full-Weight Fragmentation Method.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We call it the unified method.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I use a symbol like L to represent the operator of the Full-Weight Fragmentation.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's the Full-Weight Fragmentation symbol.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
An example of L is the so-called heat expansion method.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the operator of the Full-Weight Fragmentation.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
U is an unknown function that we want to solve.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In the Full-Weight Fragmentation, it may be a temperature field.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The temperature field changes with time and space.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In the fluid, U may be a velocity field.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
F is an unknown function on the right side of the equation.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It may be related to your physical phenomenon.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
For example, in fluid mechanics, F may be a gravity field.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In the Full-Weight Fragmentation, F may be a heat source.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It is a thing that generates heat without realizing it.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If today's Full-Weight Fragmentation is the exact solution,

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The real solution of the real world is called U-exact.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Although we want to know what U-exact is,

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because it is the real solution.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In fact, in real life, we can't get it at all.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because in the Full-Weight Fragmentation, I'm not sure what it is.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But in theory, it should not be guaranteed that there is a real solution.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So we can't get the real solution today.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then we think of another way.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's assume a solution.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
For example, if today's U represents temperature,

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's assume that the temperature in this space may look like what it looks like.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After we assume what it looks like,

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There will be some unknowns in it.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's solve it again.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
For example, today we assume that the temperature field will be a function series.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like Fourier series or Laplace series.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you can write it as a sigma c i phi i.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
c i is an unknown constant.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then phi i is what we assume it looks like.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
For example, I have a very simple example here.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If phi i is defined as x i,

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If phi 0 is a constant,

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then phi 1 is x, phi 2 is x², phi 3 is x³.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's assume that the temperature field today is C0 plus C1 times x, plus C2 times x², plus C3 times x³.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Today we have assumed that the temperature field looks like this.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The rest we need to decide is how much C0, C1, and C2 are.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So the whole numerical method, numerical simulation, numerical partial differential,

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
All these things are actually discussing two questions.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What is it? What should we assume this U looks like?

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What is this phi i?

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It can be sine or cosine.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It can also be like the example I just mentioned, x, x², x³.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So what kind of assumption is the best?

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is a question.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The second question is, how do we find out how much C0, C1, and C2 are?

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So the whole numerical method, numerical analysis,

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In fact, when you take these classes,

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's all about these two questions.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When we talk about how to determine C, C0, C1, and C2,

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We're going to talk about how to determine C.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We hope that we can find a set of C0, C1, and C2.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We hope that we can find a set of C0, C1, and C2.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The definition of C0, C1, and C2 is that

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
When you take the assumption back to PDE,

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a perfect zero error.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No matter where you are,

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Assume that the function is always perfect.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There will be no imperfection in it.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But the problem is, it's impossible.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because if you bring in the assumption function today,

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a perfect zero error.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's like you're guessing the function today.

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just the exact solution.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then it's not called the assumption function.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We don't need to guess.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So it's almost impossible.

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Only some toy problems in textbooks.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're just guessing a function.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Guess it's C0 plus C1x.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just the exact solution.

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But in real life, it's unrealistic.

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So we, for example,

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then the second question is,

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you use this method today to find C1, C2,

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How many of these are there?

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You'll find that you have several unknowns,

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But you only have one square.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
For example, if I guess today,

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This function is C0 plus C1x plus C2x squared plus C3x squared.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then I'm going to solve a Poisson equation today.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then you put this assumption function

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
After bringing in the original Poisson equation,

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a two-step equation.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The remaining two-step equation of U is 2C2 plus 6C3x.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And then you bring it in.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Your product will look like this.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What you see on the screen is 2C2 plus 6C3x minus 3pi x.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You only have one square.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But you have four unknowns from C0 to C3 today.

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can't solve it.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So these questions mean that

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We can't use this method to find the unknown.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So today we're going to use the numerical method to

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
To broaden our understanding of the function.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So today we're going to use the numerical method to

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
To broaden our understanding of the function.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We don't want it to be perfect today.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We want it to have some flaws.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But as long as some conditions are met, it's good.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is called the weight multiplication.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You see the first point on this list.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This point means that

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
R is still the same as the multiplication of any point in space.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But today I'm going to multiply it by a weight.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This weight means that

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This weight means that

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
In space, the value of some places is more important.

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The value of some places is more important.

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
For example, x is equal to 2.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This place is very important.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I want its value to be multiplied by 10.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then in x is equal to 3,

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't care so much about its value.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't care if my assumption is correct.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So its weight may only be 0.1.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then the requirement that I broadened today is that

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Multiplying by the weight of the entire space will be zero.

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
multiply by the weight of the entire space will be zero.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is good.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I no longer require that there are all points have negative parts.

196
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So this is a broadened condition.

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So this is a broadened condition.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Then we're looking at this weight...

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hey

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is a little problem.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your weight is

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
a function of x.

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Then in your entire

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
range of interest in x

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Is this w going to be positive?

206
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because negative will have

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
a strange meaning.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No, it's negative.

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Negative can also

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Even later

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
may be mentioned a little bit.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Even it will have infinite

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like the delta function at a certain point

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It will have an infinite weight.

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Then all the other places are zero.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ok

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Then you need to put this whole

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You are now the first

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The points above the points

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Remove

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
w itself

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
dx and then the entire range of points

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's a bit like renormalize.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is it total probability?

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is it total weight?

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Or do you not need it?

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You said

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You are now the point

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This equation

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Its denominator

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is the same equation

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But there is no r.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
w itself dx

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No need

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We didn't do this.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Because theoretically

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It is

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Theoretically it is zero.

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
In fact, if you subtract something else

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If your method

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If it's perfect, you subtract something else

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's still zero.

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We just divide it directly.

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Ok, I understand.

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Then we today

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then we continue to talk about this weight.

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You see I have a j here.

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In fact, it means that I am not only a set of weight today.

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I just gave an example

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
For example, x1, the weight of this place is 10.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
x3, the weight of the place is negative 0.1.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
0.1

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is a set of weight.

254
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But when I design the method today

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I will not only design a set of weight.

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I usually design

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Enough weight to let me

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Solve my unknown number

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
For example, the example I just gave

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There are four unknowns from c0 to c3.

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Then I have to design four groups of different weight today.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Then I will have four groups.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That linear equation

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will get that linear equation.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I can solve four

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That c0 to c3

267
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
These four unknowns

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That constant

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So we are equal to simplify

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I just said that the numerical method is around two problems.

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
One is how we should assume

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What does it look like?

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The second is how to calculate

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The constant c0 to c

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The second question is how to calculate c

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This constant

277
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We can change it

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In other words, it becomes another question.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
How do we define our weight?

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is our question now.

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The question we just asked

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We will remember to go back to this question later.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then we just talked about it before.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is the standard that has been relaxed

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
As long as the weight of the weight

287
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
After the weight is multiplied by the weight

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The residual value of the weight is zero.

289
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Then in the numerical method

290
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We will be further relaxed

291
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Is that we often hear

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You may hear some elements

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then grid

294
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Or some more

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
May be more formal

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Will be called piecewise solution

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That is to say

298
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Today this space is interesting

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I wrote it in the first video called space

300
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I cut it into a smaller area in space.

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
For example

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Subdomain 1, Subdomain 2

303
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This kind of subdomain is called element.

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is what you often hear

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The so-called element in the finite element

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Or you hear that grid

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
A grid inside

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then I use a 1 today.

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
To represent this kind of subdomain

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then k under the label means different

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Subdomain

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Then let it go today.

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I

314
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Inside each element

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Have their own guesses

316
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
For example, U0 means the 0th subdomain.

317
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It has its own assumption function

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That U1 inside

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is the 1st element

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It also has its own guess function

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Then

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So the whole global

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The guess function is actually a lot of different

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Small elements are combined

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If X is in the 0th element today

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then we use the 0th guess function

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If X is in the 1st element today

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We use the 1st guess function

329
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why do you say

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is a kind of relaxation

331
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why is it a kind of relaxation

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because it means

333
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Today if the real world

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Exact solution

335
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Is a very high-level function

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
For example, a high-level polynomial

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Or a sine, sine wave or cosine wave

338
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Its fluctuation is very large

339
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You see, like this example

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The black line in this example is the exact solution

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It has three fluctuations

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It is equal to at least three or more

343
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Its solution is three or more polynomials

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Even sine or cosine

345
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But if I take the whole domain today

346
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Divided into many small elements

347
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Like this example, I split it into six small elements

348
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I mean I have each element

349
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Just use a straight line

350
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then add six elements

351
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can see my real world

352
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So this is a kind of relaxation

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It means I'm guessing

354
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What does this function look like

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I use the simplest straight line

356
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I can be my assumption

357
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can guess what this function looks like

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So we will say this

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Divide it into subdomain

360
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Elements or cells

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Is a kind of relaxation

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A more relaxed condition

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's what this video is about

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This kind of relaxation

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
As I just said, its advantage is

366
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Even if your real function

367
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Is a very high-level function

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Or a very vibrant, very fluctuating

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
If it's a big thing

370
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I can also use a very low-level guess

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
To look at this exact solution

372
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is its advantage

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The disadvantage is

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We split this domain today

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Into many small subdomains

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What is the relationship between the subdomain and the subdomain

377
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What is the relationship between the subdomain and the subdomain

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is a new problem

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
A new problem

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
For example, what is the relationship between element 1 and element 0

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
For example, what is the relationship between element 1 and element 0

382
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's impossible to have nothing to do with it

383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because they are all describing

384
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Different sections of the same real node

385
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So they still have a relationship

386
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So you have to make some assumptions

387
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What we use the most in our numerical method today

388
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What we use the most in our numerical method today

389
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The so-called continuous function we call C0

390
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That is to say

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Today, if there are two elements connected together

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Today, if there are two elements connected together

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like on the picture, if you see this blue element

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And yellow element

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
C0 is that they just have to

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The point where the interface is connected

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The point where the interface is connected

398
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's just continuous

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's the easiest

400
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So today you can see this blue line

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And the orange line are connected

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And the orange line and the orange line are connected

403
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
As for the number of points, is it connected

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In this C0 condition

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We don't care

406
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We don't care

407
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So if we talk again

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So if we talk again

409
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
To refresh

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Today's modern numerical method

411
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Today's modern numerical method

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We just talked about the surrounding two issues

413
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We just talked about the surrounding two issues

414
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So now you can add one more question

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So now you can add one more question

416
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is to first

417
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So first

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
is the assumption function

419
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What does it look like

420
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Then the second is what this whole function should look like

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Then the third is when we split the domain into many small elements

422
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
When we split the domain into many small elements

423
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What are the relationships between elements and elements

424
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The combination of different answers to these three questions

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Will give you different

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The so-called numerical method

427
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The so-called numerical method

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have a question

429
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I have a question

430
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
My question may be very basic

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
People who understand

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
My question is like this

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
For example, the thing you just described

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
For example, the thing you just described

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Is a coordinate field

436
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But if you care about the nature

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But if you care about the nature

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If it's speed or acceleration

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But if it's speed or acceleration

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you

441
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you

442
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Right

443
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Right

444
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Right

445
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So you will know

446
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So you will know

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because if your conditions today are very simple

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because if your conditions today are very simple

449
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But if you are

450
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But if you are

451
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But if you are

452
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You can find a number on the right

453
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And limit them to be equal

454
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You are equal to saying that the conditions

455
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It will be tougher and harder to meet

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But this is every

457
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
How strong is the boundary condition of the small element

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
How strong is the boundary condition of the small element

459
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So the actual operation will be with

460
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What kind of problem do you want to solve?

461
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's about your actual problem

462
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's about your actual problem

463
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I see

464
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is why different areas

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Will use different numerical methods

466
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So maybe the most common thing we hear is

467
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Limit difference, limit element, limit volume

468
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
These are the three most common

469
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Then you will find out why

470
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
People who calculate mechanics use limited elements

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then why

472
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Fluid mechanics uses limited volume

473
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Then other people use limited difference

474
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's because they are likely to be

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
C0 or C1

476
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This kind of requirement is different

477
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then

478
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So back to the three questions here

479
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Then there are some examples here

480
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Different answers to these three questions

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What kind of different

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Numerical methods

483
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The first

484
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Its formal name is pseudospectral

485
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or that positive

486
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't know the Chinese name

487
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Orthogonal collocation

488
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Then why mention this

489
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because we hear the most

490
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Limited difference, finite difference

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is a special case

492
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Then this numerical method

493
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That is to say, its weight is a delta function

494
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's what I just said

495
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It will be infinite at this point

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Delta function

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This thing is very interesting

499
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It will become

500
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't know

501
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
After it is accumulated

502
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I should be able to go back to that video

503
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Delta function

504
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
After the accumulation becomes

505
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Only this point has value

506
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
A little slow

507
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's like this

508
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Like this point

509
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If wj is a delta function

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That delta function

511
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If the point is in xj

512
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Then this point will become

513
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The right-hand side is equal to

514
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
R of xj

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's it

516
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So this is why you are in a finite difference

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't see any weight at all

518
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't see it

519
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It is

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The finite difference is defined at the point

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you are

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Then

523
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The finite difference is this

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So-called pseudo-spectral

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
A special case

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Except that the weight is a delta function

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Its

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The diameter is also very low

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It is a straight line

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Its so-called phi is a straight line

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Just guess

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You can see

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The solution of the assumption

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It only has phi0 and phi1

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Two things

536
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So today you are doing

537
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
When there is a finite difference

538
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
In fact, you are solving

539
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's just C0 and C1

540
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Then the finite difference

541
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The continuous condition of C0

542
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The finite volume

543
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's like fluid mechanics

544
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Its weight is

545
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
As long as it is

546
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This one

547
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I define it in ej today

548
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Inside this element

549
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Its weight is all 1

550
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Outside this element

551
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Its weight is all 0

552
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is the definition of its weight

553
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Then

554
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The solution of the assumption

555
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
This is what we guess

556
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's simpler than the finite difference

557
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's just a parameter

558
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Today in an element

559
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
In a subdomain

560
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
For example, the temperature field

561
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The temperature field in this subdomain

562
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's just a parameter

563
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It won't change anything

564
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It will be very complicated

565
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It will use the so-called

566
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Riemann jump condition

567
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's complicated

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I just want to say

569
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not a C0 condition

570
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What is it

571
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's beyond today's scope

572
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So I didn't say

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's just an example

574
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
How do we answer those three questions

575
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Will define a different value

576
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The third is

577
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The so-called continuous Galerkin method

578
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We often hear that finite elements

579
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This is a special case

580
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
In this case

581
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Its weight

582
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Will be equal to

583
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The function we guess

584
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Is phi j

585
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Phi j is what we just guessed

586
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Assuming that function

587
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Its weight is this

588
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
As long as you use this weight

589
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's all called Galerkin method

590
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The finite element

591
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's more advanced

592
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It also uses C0

593
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Continuous condition

594
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But as for this phi i

595
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What is it

596
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Is it sine, cosine, polynomial

597
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Or exponential

598
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
In fact, in the traditional Galerkin method

599
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It didn't say

600
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's just in the finite element

601
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The traditional phi i

602
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Use a straight line to define

603
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's a straight line polynomial

604
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This video

605
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Just to introduce to you

606
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Our numerical method

607
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What is it all about

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's the three questions

609
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm going to introduce this today

610
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The weighting method

611
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Because the flux reconstruction

612
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Will use the weighting method to push down

613
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I didn't mention it in the video

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The so-called low-order method

615
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Or high-order numerical method

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So I want to be here today

617
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Also want to introduce

618
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Not everyone has a numerical method

619
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Background

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I want to introduce this order first

621
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What is it

622
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We just had a projection

623
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
There is an example

624
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If there is one today

625
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The physical field of the real world

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
For example, this black line is its real field

627
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We don't know

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The field we can't guess

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Then we use six elements to define it

630
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Then in each element

631
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We guess it's a straight line distribution

632
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That's what it looks like

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
If we want today

634
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You can clearly see that

635
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Although at some points

636
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The function we guess is very

637
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Basically close to the physical field of the real world

638
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But other parts

639
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You see, like this blue straight line

640
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
With that black curve

641
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
There is a big, obvious error in the middle

642
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So if we want to improve this error today

643
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
What can we do

644
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The first thing we can do

645
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Is to use more elements

646
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Just make it finer

647
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So in each element

648
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Still use a straight line

649
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But the straight line may be because it is smaller

650
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It will be closer to the black line

651
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Is the real physical field

652
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The next projection

653
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The next projection is an example

654
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like this projection

655
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I added six elements today

656
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Let the total number of elements become 12

657
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But in each element

658
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Still use a straight line

659
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
That guess

660
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Then we will find that I just added six elements

661
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Now the whole guess

662
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The solution will become very close to the real solution

663
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This method

664
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is a kind of increase

665
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Reduce error

666
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Then increase the accuracy

667
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A way

668
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Why did you mention this?

669
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Because when we define the so-called order

670
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's related to this

671
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Order means when I add today

672
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
When the number of my elements

673
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
How to reduce

674
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
When we define the speed

675
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Is defined by the index

676
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
For example, I

677
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The number of my elements has increased by m times

678
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Then my error

679
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The speed of the decree

680
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Is the square of m

681
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That square is the so-called order

682
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is when we define the numerical method

683
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
A definition of order

684
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Then this order

685
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Or this so-called rate

686
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It is also called the convergence rate

687
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Is the speed of convergence

688
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Then like some examples

689
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
For example, today if my

690
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The number of elements from n1

691
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Changes to twice n1

692
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Then my error from epsilon

693
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Reduce to one-second epsilon

694
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Then this method is called first order method

695
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Because

696
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I mentioned this m today

697
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Is 2

698
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Then my error today becomes one-second

699
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then it is the square of 2

700
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So it is the first order method

701
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Then my error from n1

702
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Increases to twice n1

703
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But my error from the original epsilon

704
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Reduce to one-eighth epsilon

705
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then this is the third order method

706
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Because 8 is the square of 2

707
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
3 times

708
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Then this is our so-called order

709
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So the so-called low order

710
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We are talking about low order method

711
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Usually refers to first order or second order method

712
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
In other words, you double your number of elements

713
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
As a result, your error value

714
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Only reduced by half

715
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Error value becomes one-fourth

716
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Then high order is usually three steps

717
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We usually call high order

718
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Then here is a

719
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Is

720
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
High degree expansion

721
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Is to be distinguished from high order

722
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We just assumed

723
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The function is the u, there is a hat above

724
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
We use a sigma

725
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Then ci times phi i

726
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The more i i use today

727
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
For example, I use from c0 to c10

728
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The more we use

729
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We will say this is a higher degree

730
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Expansion

731
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
For example, c0

732
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If your guess today is c0 plus c1 phi 1

733
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's it

734
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Maybe you can say it is degree of two

735
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Degree of one

736
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Then if you use c0 today

737
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
c1 c2 c3

738
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Then it is degree of three

739
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
What a coincidence today

740
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
If I am building my assumption

741
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
When that function

742
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Is also high degree expansion

743
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Is my

744
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
There are more in the series

745
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If there are more phi

746
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It will usually be a high order method

747
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That is to say, the speed of error collection

748
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Will be faster

749
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
For example, if you use

750
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
There are a total of ten phi

751
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You may only multiply the number of elements by two

752
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Its error may be

753
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Collection is

754
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's just one percent

755
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The speed of error reduction is very fast

756
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
At the same time

757
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
In addition to the speed of error collection

758
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The so-called high degree expansion

759
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It can usually give us a more accurate solution

760
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like the following picture

761
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Is an example

762
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I still use six elements

763
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But in each element today

764
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I no longer assume it is just a straight line

765
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I assume it is a quadratic equation

766
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I just added one more

767
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
x square

768
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I still use six elements

769
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But you can clearly see

770
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's very, very close to the real world

771
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I just made such an assumption

772
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
So you can see

773
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
If you are in the element today

774
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
The higher the degree

775
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The accuracy it gives you

776
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Will be better

777
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
This is actually

778
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I want to emphasize a little

779
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Can't mess up

780
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The so-called convergence rate

781
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is the so-called order

782
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Can't mix it up with accuracy

783
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because order is just a definition

784
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's just how fast it gets smaller

785
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But it doesn't mean that the error it gives you is very small

786
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Accuracy is

787
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The error I gave you today is very, very small

788
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But it doesn't mean that after I double the number of elements

789
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Its error

790
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It really gets smaller

791
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Even if you have ten elements

792
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Give you such an error

793
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
After you double it into twenty elements

794
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Your error makes it bigger

795
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So accuracy and the so-called order

796
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Can't mix

797
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I have a question

798
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
My question is

799
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm not sure

800
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But I assume your black line

801
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
When you were writing code

802
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You are using a

803
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Three-time polynomial

804
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Just c0 plus c1x plus c2

805
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Plus c3x three times

806
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If you want to use

807
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This uj

808
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You also get its degree

809
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Is up to 3

810
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
In fact, you use

811
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

812
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There will be no more

813
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Improvement because of its critical

814
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It has perfectly described

815
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Is this a problem?

816
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Because all the coefficients after you

817
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Will be zero

818
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But isn't this the case?

819
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Isn't it just case by case?

820
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes so

821
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's not wrong to say that

822
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But

823
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We can't know the truth

824
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Because

825
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Because

826
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is an example

827
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So I use a three-time polynomial

828
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
To draw it

829
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But in the real world, you don't know

830
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's a three-time polynomial

831
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So you can only use

832
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
More and more order

833
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
To see what it looks like

834
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You mean

835
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The real signal in the natural world

836
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Maybe you get five squares

837
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Can describe some

838
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Then maybe you get

839
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
After ten squares, it can start to describe

840
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
For example, another kind of perturbation

841
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Then fifteen squares can describe

842
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Some kind of noise

843
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It will keep describing

844
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Smaller signal

845
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Not what I'm talking about

846
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
What I want to say is

847
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm building this uj today

848
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What should it be used for

849
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
When

850
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It is indeed case by case because

851
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know the real solution

852
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What does it look like

853
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So I can't tell

854
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What should I use

855
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
What I can do is

856
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
For example, the same six elements I just did

857
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I assume it is c0 plus c1x

858
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's just like this

859
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Then see how much it is

860
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
When I do the second calculation today

861
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I add one more

862
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Plus c2x square

863
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Then see how much it is

864
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Then see if it is

865
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Is the difference getting smaller and smaller

866
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
For example, if I use three elements today

867
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like now

868
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If there are three elements in my projection

869
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
If the error is 10 times 10

870
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
1 times 10 times 10

871
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Then today if I add another

872
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
c3x3 square and calculate it again

873
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The result is c3x

874
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The assumption of four elements and three assumptions

875
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The error is only

876
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
For example, only 1 times 12

877
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That is to say that you are adding another

878
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
When c3x

879
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It doesn't help

880
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So that is to say

881
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
That is to say

882
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
In fact, we don't know what to do

883
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
We can only use this method to guess

884
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
A bit confusing

885
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
A bit difficult to describe

886
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I can understand what you want to say

887
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But what you are talking about now is basically

888
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Assuming a perfect

889
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Mathematical discussion

890
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But in fact, when you are writing code

891
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
If you keep increasing your degree

892
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You may keep reducing

893
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Your

894
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Uncertainty or inaccuracy

895
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But to a certain extent

896
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You no longer have so many advantages

897
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
To reduce the difference between the model and the actual

898
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But you start to magnify

899
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Your own computation

900
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Will it?

901
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Will

902
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So that's probably what you don't want to do

903
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
More

904
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
At that time

905
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You may not need to

906
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Put more

907
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Elements into your uj

908
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I see

909
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Thank you

910
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Then

911
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The next page

912
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So like I just said

913
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The previous video

914
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
In addition to using more

915
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Elements in your

916
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Assuming function

917
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
In addition to giving you

918
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A very precise answer

919
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
At the same time

920
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Its convergence rate is also very high

921
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So it is equivalent to the speed of its chain

922
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Its error reduction speed is also fast

923
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
At the same time, the error it gives you is also very small

924
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Then it is a very

925
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's a very attractive way

926
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
In fact

927
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Starting with a computer

928
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Starting with a numerical method

929
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
The so-called high degree

930
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Everyone wants to use

931
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But why is everyone still using

932
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Limit element and limit volume

933
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
The bottom line is that it has a lot of

934
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The disadvantage is that if I

935
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Today's physical field is a

936
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Time dependent

937
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Unsteady problem

938
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
There is a countdown for time in the unified square

939
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That usually

940
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This kind of thing is very unstable

941
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Because there will be errors in the computer

942
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The computer can't use it

943
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
To show all the numbers

944
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So it has some numbers

945
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Can't express

946
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Errors in the calculation process

947
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If today

948
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
T is equal to 0

949
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
0.1 seconds

950
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
A very small error

951
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The so-called unstable is that it is very possible

952
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
At 0.2 seconds

953
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The error in the first second

954
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
In this second

955
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Let your calculation explode

956
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
For example, it becomes infinitely large

957
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Or infinitely small

958
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
This will happen

959
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This situation is called unstable

960
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That high degree element

961
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It is particularly easy to be unstable

962
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The reason is obvious

963
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Like you just saw

964
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
If we use 10 today

965
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There is a c10x10 square

966
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If I have a small error today

967
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
There is a small error in this step

968
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Is 1

969
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
1 square

970
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
1 square

971
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You bring this error to x10

972
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The whole error becomes

973
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
1 square

974
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
This will make your computer

975
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Let your calculation explode

976
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So this kind of thing

977
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It becomes so-called very unstable

978
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The second is that it is more involved

979
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The concept of linear代数

980
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It is Eocondition

981
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If I am today

982
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We just said that we must have a linear equation

983
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
To solve those c, those functions

984
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
For example, four

985
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Four linear equations to solve

986
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
The so-called condition number

987
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
There is a thing called condition number

988
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The higher the condition number

989
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It means that this linear equation is more difficult to solve

990
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
The lower the condition number

991
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It means that this linear equation is easier to solve

992
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Usually you use the higher

993
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The assumption function

994
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
For example, when using x4 to 8, x5 to 8, x6 to 8

995
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We will

996
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It will become the so-called Eocondition

997
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's a sick

998
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Its linear equation will be very difficult to solve

999
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You may need

1000
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Very, very long time

1001
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Those c0, c1, c2, c3

1002
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That is

1003
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The so-called high degree and high order method

1004
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The second

1005
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Then the third

1006
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The more you use it, the more complicated it is

1007
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
When you write a computer program

1008
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The more difficult it is

1009
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Even if it's not easy to write

1010
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There may be more bugs in it

1011
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It will be more difficult to debug

1012
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then the fourth is like now

1013
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Everyone's program is parallel

1014
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Run on multiple boxes

1015
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Even our computers are at least four cores

1016
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Then when this high-level method

1017
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You want to design it

1018
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Can be at the same time on eight cores

1019
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
When you go to solve together

1020
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It will also become very difficult

1021
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So this is the most obvious high-level method

1022
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Four disadvantages

1023
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's why

1024
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So far everyone is familiar with the numerical method

1025
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's still the kind of first order

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Or second order

1027
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Limit difference or limit element

1028
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But everyone is still working hard

1029
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Is the so-called high-level method

1030
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because he is very appealing

1031
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
He just gives you a very small error

1032
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Then his error is very slow

1033
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So everyone is still studying

1034
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So everyone will find a way to say

1035
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
From the three questions we just said

1036
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The three questions around the numerical method

1037
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
If we can find a combination

1038
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
A combination of three answers

1039
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Can give us a better high-level method

1040
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Everyone has been trying in this area

1041
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That is indeed possible

1042
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Maybe everyone has heard of

1043
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The so-called discontinuous Galerkin

1044
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Is a continuous Galerkin method

1045
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
He is probably

1046
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
A major breakthrough after 2000

1047
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Then he can be very high-level

1048
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Then his

1049
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Also relatively stable

1050
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Then his conditions are relatively low

1051
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So after 2000

1052
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You will hear very often

1053
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
The so-called discontinuous Galerkin

1054
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Because it becomes very popular

1055
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Then I

1056
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Here is an example

1057
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I just said

1058
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Different answers can give you

1059
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Maybe the same high-level

1060
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But relatively stable

1061
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Or conditions are relatively low

1062
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The numerical method

1063
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Like the three lines above me

1064
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Represents three different

1065
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Phi i assumptions

1066
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The steepest straight line

1067
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Is the so-called

1068
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
He should be the moment expansion

1069
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Is the example I just used

1070
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Is c0 plus c1x

1071
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Plus c2x2 plus c3x3

1072
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That is to say

1073
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Phi i is equal to x i

1074
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
This is very obvious

1075
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You can see how many x axes

1076
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I used

1077
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Phi i

1078
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Then y axis is the condition

1079
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You can see him

1080
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The more you use, the more conditions

1081
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Increasing faster

1082
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So it means that you use too much today

1083
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If you use too much

1084
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It will be very difficult to solve

1085
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Then the second

1086
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
This is the connection between the two

1087
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
He uses the so-called

1088
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The so-called

1089
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The so-called

1090
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The so-called

1091
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
The so-called

1092
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The so-called

1093
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The so-called

1094
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The so-called

1095
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The so-called

1096
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The so-called

1097
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The so-called

1098
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The so-called

1099
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And even the third triangle

1100
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This line is a popular one these years

1101
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Which is

1102
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The so-called

1103
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The so-called

1104
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The so-called

1105
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Phi 0 is a

1106
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Phi 1 is

1107
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Phi 1 is

1108
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Let's use this method to

1109
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Assume a function

1110
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You will find that the more you use phi

1111
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Its conditional value does not change

1112
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That is to say

1113
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
The more phi you use today

1114
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The so-called EO condition

1115
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It can be counted as eliminated

1116
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It doesn't exist anymore

1117
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Now show this diagram

1118
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
For everyone to see

1119
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Why different answers

1120
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Can possibly solve

1121
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Those drawbacks of high-level methods

1122
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I have a small question

1123
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So

1124
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
In fact

1125
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Usually condition number

1126
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Is it about equal to

1127
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Calculation time

1128
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because you just count a condition number

1129
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Is it a linear equation?

1130
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes, but I don't really know

1131
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I haven't thought about this question

1132
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's hard to say

1133
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Because you have to see

1134
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What is the method to solve the equation

1135
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
For example, you can use

1136
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You solve a linear equation

1137
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You can use

1138
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Is the most basic Gauss elimination

1139
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Then you can also use some

1140
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Is more

1141
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Faster method

1142
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Is like

1143
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Or like you can use some

1144
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
More fancy method

1145
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Is to first solve its eigenvalue

1146
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then use the eigenvalue

1147
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
To find its characteristic equation

1148
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Then use the characteristic equation to combine

1149
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Its linear equation

1150
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So

1151
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I don't think

1152
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Different ways to solve

1153
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The same linear equation

1154
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Condition number

1155
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Is equal to calculation time

1156
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And it may not be equal

1157
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Because you basically have to put all conditions

1158
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
All together

1159
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
To solve the eigenvalue

1160
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Oh, I see

1161
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But I'm sure

1162
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The more conditions, the worse

1163
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The more it solves, the slower

1164
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
As for the slow ratio

1165
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Is it linear or what?

1166
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I haven't studied this

1167
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So I'm not sure

1168
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So now

1169
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Enter the main topic

1170
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Weighted residual method

1171
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Is used later

1172
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Flux reconstruction method

1173
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Then just explained

1174
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That order is just

1175
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Give you a concept

1176
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
What is low order, what is high order

1177
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Why do we use high order

1178
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
What is good to study

1179
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Here is a hint for everyone

1180
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Just give you a concept

1181
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We just mentioned that there are three ways

1182
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The answer to three questions

1183
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Can define a new

1184
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's why I'm talking now

1185
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Give you a hint

1186
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Flux reconstruction

1187
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
What is the answer to these three questions

1188
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
For the FR method

1189
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Its assumed function

1190
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
This phi i is used

1191
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
You can say it is

1192
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Lagrangian function

1193
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But you can also say it is Lagrangian

1194
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That polynomial is

1195
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Lagrangian

1196
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Interval function

1197
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That's just this interval function

1198
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Interval function needs

1199
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
You need some points

1200
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
To define the interval function

1201
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
In the FR

1202
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
The interval function of phi

1203
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Is defined in

1204
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The so-called quadrature point

1205
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Everyone knows

1206
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It is a special point

1207
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It is not randomly distributed

1208
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It is not evenly distributed

1209
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The distribution of points must meet certain rules

1210
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
This rule is Lagrangian polynomial

1211
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It must meet the Lagrangian rule

1212
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This is its expansion

1213
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Its expansion is phi i

1214
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What is it?

1215
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
What is its weight?

1216
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Its weight is Galerkin method

1217
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So its weight is used

1218
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It's the same as phi i

1219
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
wj is equal to phi j

1220
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That's the same as Galerkin method

1221
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But we'll show you later

1222
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Where is it different from Galerkin method

1223
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It still has some different places

1224
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Then the third question is

1225
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
What is the relationship between different elements

1226
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What is the relationship between different elements

1227
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
What I wrote here today is

1228
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Orthogonal polynomial based blocks reconstruction

1229
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Orthogonal polynomial based blocks reconstruction

1230
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
In fact, it is the same as

1231
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The same as the finite element

1232
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The same as the finite volume

1233
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The so-called Riemann

1234
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Riemann jump blocks

1235
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
If you have

1236
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
If you have learned

1237
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The finite volume, you will probably have an impression

1238
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It doesn't matter

1239
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I will still talk about this

1240
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
What is this

1241
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
What is this

1242
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
This is just a heads up

1243
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
This is just a heads up

1244
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Now let's start the formal introduction

1245
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Now let's start the formal introduction

1246
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Now let's start the formal introduction

1247
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
When this method was proposed in 2007

1248
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
When this method was proposed in 2007

1249
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It is mainly to solve the so-called

1250
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Hyperbolic conservation law

1251
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
This kind of PDE will look like this

1252
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
This kind of PDE will look like this

1253
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
When there are three or five corners

1254
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
There will be an end mark for y and z

1255
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Today we assume

1256
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The effective range

1257
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
From xA to xB

1258
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
If we cut it into

1259
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
N1 elements

1260
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And then we use 1

1261
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
To represent each element

1262
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And then each element

1263
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Your own effective range

1264
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Let's write it as xk to xk plus 1

1265
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Let's write it as xk to xk plus 1

1266
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Todaywe have two guessed functions

1267
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The first is the guessing function on u

1268
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The guessing constructions inside dkget

1269
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And then we write

1270
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It like this

1271
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Sigma u,k,i,psique

1272
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
u,k,i

1273
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:42,000
U,k,i means the value of dk

1274
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
In fact, only u,k,i is unknown

1275
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because f,k,i is defined from u,k,i

1276
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
f,k,i means you bring u,k,i to the f function in your original pd

1277
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You can get u,k,i

1278
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So although we have two guessed functions

1279
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But only u,k,i is unknown and needs to be solved

1280
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Then we go back to the weighting function

1281
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
The weighting function is applied to dk element

1282
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Only in dk element, we don't care about other elements

1283
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So its base range is xk to xk plus 1

1284
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Then weight wj

1285
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Then the right side is our original pd value

1286
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That is r

1287
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Then the second line below, I just split it into two

1288
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Then we are now for the second item

1289
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
The second item is weight wj

1290
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
F is the derivative of this function to x

1291
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Then we use the distribution points today

1292
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Distribution points in the distribution points

1293
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
We can get the equation on the right

1294
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This is the value

1295
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It will become xk plus 1 value

1296
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Then subtract another base function

1297
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
This function is the so-called weak form

1298
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Weak form of dsk

1299
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I only mention it here

1300
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because we don't want to do dsk

1301
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Then if you want to do dsk today

1302
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
After you get this value

1303
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Your next step will jump directly to

1304
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
How do I define f at xk plus 1

1305
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Or how to define f at xk

1306
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Then we are not going to do this today

1307
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So skip this step first

1308
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Let's move on to the next step

1309
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The next step is the one I just

1310
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Wait for the point on the right

1311
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I will go one step further and do it again

1312
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Distribution points

1313
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
After I do the distribution points again

1314
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I will get the original point function again

1315
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Is the derivative of weight wj

1316
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But on my left

1317
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I will have two more

1318
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I will have one more fk at xk plus 1 value

1319
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
This is what I just said to f

1320
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Assuming that the function

1321
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
The derivative function at xk plus 1 value

1322
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Then this fk

1323
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Then xk is the value

1324
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It means that f is the assumption function

1325
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The derivative value at xk

1326
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So the third line is just a reorganization

1327
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You will get an original distribution function

1328
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Then subtract the following two

1329
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Weight wj

1330
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
What does wj mean?

1331
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It means

1332
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
A jump

1333
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I hope xk this place

1334
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The first f

1335
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
If you can see my mouse

1336
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
The first f means

1337
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I hope xk this place

1338
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
What is its value

1339
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Then the second f

1340
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Is the f obtained by the inner product function

1341
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It means that I actually calculate the inner product function today

1342
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
At this point

1343
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
How much is this point at xk?

1344
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So it's called jump

1345
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Is the value I hope

1346
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The difference between the actual inner product value

1347
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This is called jump

1348
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
This kind of thing is in that document

1349
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
They will be called strong form of discontinuous skeleton

1350
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's just

1351
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
No one is trying to solve this equation

1352
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Then

1353
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The last point is to remind everyone

1354
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Pay attention to the definition of two different f

1355
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
One is how much I hope it is

1356
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Then one is the inner product function

1357
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The actual value of the inner product

1358
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Then the next page

1359
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
A little slow

1360
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Then I am today

1361
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
This page is just about

1362
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The so-called strong form

1363
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Of discontinuous skeleton

1364
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Back to the original

1365
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
The points of the entire product function

1366
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Then it will look like this

1367
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You will find that the first one is still the original

1368
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The points of the entire product function

1369
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Then there are two more things related to jump

1370
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Then today

1371
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
In Flux Reconstruction

1372
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
The so-called strong form

1373
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Of discontinuous skeleton is different

1374
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
He used a trick at this time

1375
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
He assumed

1376
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I have a place in front

1377
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
There is xwjxk

1378
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
This one

1379
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
If I can write it in the same way

1380
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
A formula

1381
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Then find a so-called gl function

1382
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Let him say wj

1383
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
The value of the entire product function at xk

1384
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Will be equal to

1385
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
This point

1386
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Then wj at xk

1387
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
The value of this point

1388
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Will be equal to the point defined by gr

1389
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Then I put these two definitions

1390
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Take it back to the original

1391
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
The points of the entire product function

1392
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can write it as a whole

1393
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Everything

1394
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Stuffed into my points

1395
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It will be like this

1396
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Everything will become a point

1397
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Then the entire weight multiplied by everything else

1398
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Why do this

1399
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Because if you do this, you can put

1400
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
If you delete the whole weight, you can delete the points

1401
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Becomes a pure polynomial

1402
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So this is

1403
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Flux Reconstruction

1404
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Is me

1405
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Assuming that wj can become a point

1406
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Then take it back

1407
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I can delete the points and the weight

1408
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Back to restore

1409
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
A primitive polynomial

1410
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This page is just

1411
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Just rewrite it

1412
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I have a small question

1413
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So you

1414
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You this method

1415
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Basically rely on

1416
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Is grgl

1417
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Exist

1418
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That's right

1419
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Will this be a problem

1420
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It is the focus

1421
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It is a focus of fr

1422
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Is

1423
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Its focus is

1424
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What is grl and gr

1425
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Because we assumed first

1426
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
The same grl and gr

1427
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But we didn't mention

1428
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Did you really find it

1429
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So wait

1430
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I may not talk about that today

1431
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Because that will become more

1432
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But I will directly

1433
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
One or two

1434
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Already found function

1435
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Then

1436
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
This page is rewritten

1437
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Flux Reconstruction

1438
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Is what we are looking for

1439
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
This method is looking for

1440
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So you can see

1441
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
The biggest difference between fr and grl

1442
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Is

1443
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Its weight

1444
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
wj this function will disappear in the end

1445
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
But

1446
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
What to pay attention to is that it is not

1447
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
No weight, it's just weight

1448
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Will disappear

1449
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Then

1450
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Then

1451
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
In the end

1452
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
How to use that primitive polynomial

1453
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
To find the real u

1454
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Then we have to go back

1455
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Involve in the so-called

1456
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Time point

1457
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Time point is the simplest

1458
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Euler

1459
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Is a finite polynomial

1460
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Euler's temporal time margin

1461
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Is

1462
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Is the simplest point

1463
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Is equal to

1464
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
t plus delta t

1465
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
minus t

1466
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
The value of this time point

1467
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Is your delta t

1468
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
We put it as partial u partial t

1469
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Is an Euler method

1470
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Then we put it

1471
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Just that

1472
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
The primitive polynomial of fr

1473
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Bring back

1474
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
We can get this

1475
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
A finite polynomial

1476
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Then

1477
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We use t plus delta t

1478
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And t to represent

1479
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
The solution of different time points

1480
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Is

1481
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Is

1482
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Is it missing a page or two?

1483
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Let me see what the next page is

1484
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
it is good

1485
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Then

1486
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
In this function

1487
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We have seen a lot now

1488
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
That variable u

1489
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Then t plus delta t

1490
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Then we have to know

1491
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Which is unknown

1492
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
To know how to solve

1493
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So we have to review

1494
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Is that we just didn't

1495
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Although I didn't mention how to calculate

1496
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I want to be in xk

1497
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
How much is xk plus 1

1498
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But we are here first

1499
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Assuming we already have a way to

1500
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Calculate how much we want

1501
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Then the second is that we also assume

1502
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We have found the right

1503
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
gl and gr

1504
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That

1505
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And what we use is

1506
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Our phi is the so-called Lagrange

1507
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Input function

1508
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
If my uki is defined in xk

1509
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Then my uk this

1510
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Assuming the function

1511
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
When I put xk in

1512
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I can get uki again

1513
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Then the second point is the so-called

1514
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
F to f this assumption function

1515
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It's actually still a

1516
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
That one

1517
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Polynomial series

1518
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's just that

1519
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Its division will be transferred to

1520
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
The division of phi

1521
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Because fki is a constant

1522
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So you can't divide it

1523
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So this is f

1524
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Then fki will remind you again

1525
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
It's just f this function

1526
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Then bring uki in

1527
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So it's not an independent variable

1528
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Then phi

1529
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Or how much gr

1530
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
These are actually you can assume

1531
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It is unknown because these are

1532
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Polynomials defined by yourself

1533
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So of course you define it yourself

1534
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Of course you can get its derivative

1535
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So back to this

1536
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Square

1537
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
We put it all in

1538
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You will find that everything is unknown

1539
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You are at t this time

1540
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
U and then f

1541
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And then phi

1542
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
These are all unknown

1543
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
The only unknown thing is t plus delta t

1544
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So today in this method

1545
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's actually like this

1546
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You use this method to calculate

1547
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
How much is t plus delta t

1548
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So today you divide the square

1549
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
There will be a initial value

1550
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's the value of t equals 0

1551
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That means you have the value of t equals 0 today

1552
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Then your uki is 0

1553
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
So f at 0

1554
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
t equals 0

1555
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Then you can use this formula to calculate

1556
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
How much is 0 plus delta t

1557
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Then you have you know

1558
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
How much is 0 plus delta t

1559
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Then you bring 0 plus delta t to the right

1560
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Then you can get

1561
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
How much is 2 delta t

1562
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Then you step by step like this

1563
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
In the end you can get

1564
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
This u function

1565
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
What is the change in time

1566
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That's a simple summary

1567
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
t equals 0 we have

1568
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So we know uki 0 and f 0

1569
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
How much

1570
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Then we use that method

1571
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Use some of the methods we haven't mentioned

1572
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Calculate f at

1573
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
The interface of each element is xk

1574
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
How much is it

1575
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Then the third step is

1576
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
You can use the formula from the last page

1577
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Calculate the value of u at t plus delta t

1578
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So you can go back

1579
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Step 1 and Step 2

1580
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Then keep repeating

1581
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This is what I just mentioned

1582
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The algorithm

1583
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It's very simple

1584
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So now it's time to say

1585
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
We just kept saying

1586
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
We assume that we already have a way

1587
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
To calculate

1588
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We want f at xk

1589
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
How much

1590
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That's why I mentioned

1591
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
What the hell is this thing

1592
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That's what we want

1593
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
We call it numerical flux

1594
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Then we just follow

1595
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
This kind of thing is in the limited

1596
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
The limited volume and the Galerkin method

1597
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Is a very common concept

1598
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Calculate fluid mechanics

1599
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
The most simple way we use

1600
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Calculate numerical flux

1601
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Is the so-called rose flux

1602
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
ROE rose flux

1603
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It involves a lot of

1604
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It's just some physics

1605
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Physics of flow

1606
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It's going to get complicated

1607
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So I just gave it a formula

1608
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Prove that we really have a way

1609
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
How much is this f

1610
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
If you are interested in this

1611
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You can actually go back and look at some

1612
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Some volume has been developed for 30 or 40 years

1613
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So how to calculate this

1614
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Numerical flux will become

1615
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
It's actually very, very easy to find

1616
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Then we solve f

1617
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Then there is f

1618
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The most important thing in the method is

1619
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
How to find gl and gr

1620
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Then we mentioned that gl and gr

1621
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
These two functions must match

1622
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
These two points

1623
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Then the second one is

1624
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
In fact, gl and gr

1625
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Its meaning is

1626
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Point to the boundary

1627
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
We just said that there is a boundary in the formula

1628
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Jump

1629
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's equal to

1630
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The value we want on the boundary

1631
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The difference in value

1632
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So this function is theoretically

1633
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Only for the boundary

1634
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Then it's inside the element

1635
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It must be almost non-correct

1636
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So we hope this function

1637
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's on the boundary

1638
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
For example, glx

1639
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Its value will be very large

1640
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
For example, 1

1641
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Inside the element

1642
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Then

1643
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It must be higher than

1644
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Its degree must be higher than

1645
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The function we assume

1646
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Because after you do this

1647
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Its degree will be the same

1648
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So the first thing I found today

1649
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Is the so-called rado polynomial

1650
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It looks like this

1651
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You put it into this formula

1652
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This is the most primitive

1653
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
gl and gr

1654
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
There are a lot of gl and gr

1655
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
You can find it in paper

1656
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But I didn't mention it

1657
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Because it becomes very mathematical

1658
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I just want to tell you

1659
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I really found this gl and gr

1660
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
This is an example

1661
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
When using different gl and gr

1662
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You can see it

1663
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
The change of the numerical method

1664
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Like I said just now

1665
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Same

1666
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The same linear equation

1667
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
You use different gl and gr

1668
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Will get a completely different accuracy

1669
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
If you are interested, you can go to paper

1670
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Just play

1671
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Because this is very mathematical

1672
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Just show it to everyone

1673
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Let everyone know that this thing exists

1674
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I just talked about

1675
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
There is only one dimension in space

1676
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
If there are two dimensions in space

1677
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
If you want to use fr

1678
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
The current method can only

1679
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Divide the two dimensions into two dimensions

1680
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
The function

1681
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Then apply fr

1682
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Like I said just now

1683
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But this thing is still under study

1684
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So you probably only have one or two papers

1685
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Have seen

1686
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Let me mention it to everyone

1687
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
This is a difference

1688
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Maybe the time is a bit limited

1689
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I have talked about it before

1690
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
The difference is that it is one

1691
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
One is the default form

1692
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
One is the strong form

1693
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
One is the weak form

1694
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
The time is limited

1695
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So let's skip it first

1696
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Now let's talk about how to use it

1697
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
In computational fluid mechanics

1698
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
If I do it today

1699
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
If it is compressible flow

1700
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
In fact, the same method of compressible flow

1701
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It is a conservation law

1702
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
If you apply fr today

1703
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
There is no problem at all

1704
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
There will be no contradiction

1705
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
But if I am incompressible today

1706
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Incompressible flow

1707
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You will find that the same equation is inside

1708
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
One of the equations

1709
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It lacks the division of time

1710
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So it is no longer a conservation law

1711
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
If you want to use fr today

1712
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It will be very difficult

1713
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You don't know how to apply

1714
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
The fr method we just mentioned

1715
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Then

1716
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Of course, some people today

1717
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
There will be a way to use

1718
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Assuming this incompressible flow

1719
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
There is a false compressibility

1720
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Then we assume that there is a false compressibility

1721
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
We can use it as a compressible flow

1722
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But the question is

1723
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
What is this false compressibility

1724
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It's hard to define

1725
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's very unreasonable

1726
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So I don't want to use this method

1727
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And

1728
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And

1729
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Now the mainstream incompressible flow

1730
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
All use the so-called

1731
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
ProjectionStype method

1732
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Use this very complicated

1733
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
To solve

1734
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So how should I do today

1735
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Bring fr to this

1736
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
The most popular projectionStype

1737
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
To solve

1738
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It will become a very challenging problem

1739
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That's why

1740
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I want to do

1741
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Is to do

1742
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Because

1743
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
There is no one doing this

1744
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Then I want to use fr today

1745
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
In incompressible flow

1746
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
The two basic elements I need

1747
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I have to solve this

1748
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Poisson equation

1749
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So it becomes

1750
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
You have to use implicit method

1751
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You have to solve a very big equation

1752
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You can't be like just now

1753
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
t plus delta t

1754
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Then step by step

1755
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You can't

1756
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You can only solve it once

1757
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And now a lot of people

1758
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
They will assume the same

1759
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This thing is a state

1760
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
This Poisson equation is a state

1761
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Then step by step

1762
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
After the value of t goes to infinity

1763
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Assume it as

1764
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Stable solution

1765
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
This thing is very inefficient

1766
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Because you have a stable solution

1767
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You have to go from t equals 0 to t equals infinity

1768
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I want you to know that it is very inefficient

1769
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So my

1770
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
For my own plan

1771
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I hope I can find a way

1772
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
To be able to solve

1773
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Poisson equation without time

1774
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
This thing is very simple

1775
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You just have to do it

1776
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
But the problem is

1777
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Different gl and different gr

1778
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
There will be different values

1779
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
No one studies

1780
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
How should I choose gl and gr

1781
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
If you want to solve today

1782
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Poisson equation without time

1783
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Then there is the second

1784
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I hope to be able to

1785
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Develop a projection style

1786
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That can't be compressed

1787
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Solver

1788
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
The third is that I hope

1789
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I can put the solver with

1790
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
The so-called Immersed Boundary Method

1791
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Coupled together

1792
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
This is my current plan

1793
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
My research goal

1794
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Talk a little bit

1795
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Just time

1796
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Thank you all

1797
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Good

1798
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I think it's very good

1799
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
At least for me

1800
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's a field

1801
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I think it's very clear

1802
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I think it's too much

1803
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And I think the time is very good

1804
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It's 17 minutes now

1805
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Then

1806
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So the other one is your friend

1807
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Right

1808
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So we're the only ones here

1809
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Then I just asked a lot of questions

1810
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So

1811
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
That's it for today's speech

1812
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
If you have any questions

1813
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You can find it on our website

01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Then we will be late

1816
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Upload the recording of today's speech

Email or I don't know what you left

1823
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Then you can discuss it directly with the speaker

1824
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Then we will thank our speaker again

1825
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Thank you all

1826
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
If you have a look on the Internet

1827
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
That's it for today

1828
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm going to stop recording
