00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
He also analyzed the legal behavior of Taiwanese clients and non-independent individuals in the U.S. and East Germany.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Louis is also very interested in entrepreneurship.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
and regularly holds meetings and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Today's topic is about his background in law and entrepreneurship.

00:51.000 --> 01:01.000
Louis, please turn on your microphone.

01:01.000 --> 01:20.000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.

01:20.000 --> 01:36.000
Last year, I also talked about the topic of streaming, which is the issue of copyright for online streaming videos.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
If you are interested, please go to Tera's website and click on the link.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Today's topic is completely different. It has nothing to do with copyright, but is related to patents.

01:51.000 --> 02:02.000
This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.

02:08.000 --> 02:24.000
As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis was co-written with a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's Administration College.

02:25.000 --> 02:37.000
The main part of my thesis is to study whether the use of bundling in the market,

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
or the use of bundling in the market, or the use of bundling in the market,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
or the use of bundling in the market, and some economic analysis.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
The main details of the content will allow me to talk about it for about 30-40 minutes.

02:54.000 --> 03:04.000
It should not be too long, because this is a bit of a background, so I have to talk about it in detail.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm just curious about which background friends are coming to listen to my speech today.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
I don't know who will respond, so I'll turn off the full screen to see.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
There are those with a deep background, welcome.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Then there are those with physics, mechanical.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
So none of them are from the Academy of Social Sciences.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Okay, very good. Then I will talk about it in detail.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
In fact, the things in the Academy of Social Sciences or the law are not so complicated.

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
Today we will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process of deduction.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
I think there is no need to show off, just to show you what our results are.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I don't have much to say.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
The things I study have some background knowledge that needs to be understood by everyone.

04:05.000 --> 04:15.000
If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I say something wrong.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Its structure looks like this.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
One of them is modern chip.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
What are the benefits of modern chip?

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
The advantage is that after the modern chip is installed in the mobile phone today,

04:44.000 --> 04:55.000
For example, we all know that the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,

05:01.000 --> 05:08.000
The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
In fact, this is very blind.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Another example is that everyone is in the United States.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I assume that everyone is in the United States.

05:31.000 --> 05:41.000
If you take your mobile phone and go to some remote places, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
But you can still make calls and you can still go online.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It's just that it's very slow.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
How is this function done?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
In fact, this is the function of modern chip.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
However, its operating function is limited.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
This is the function of modern chip.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
But the value of a smart phone is to be online.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
Modern chip plays a very important role.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
This is a total of 1.2 years.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.

06:45.000 --> 06:55.000
We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
In fact, Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.

07:11.000 --> 07:18.000
Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since Samsung, Intel, and Huawei.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Huawei has not written here yet.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Huawei started to layout from 4G to 5G.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
This is the current state of the industry.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
From 2012 to now,

07:31.000 --> 07:43.000
we can see that the green part of the patent layout is high-speed communication.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.000
In fact, in various fields, including radio front, modulation, and core networking,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
the patent layout of the modern chip has a very high status.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.000
The inter-digital and blackberry are all gone.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
These are all in the past.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
The former dragon head is no longer in use.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
You can see that there is a lot of high-speed communication in green.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
In fact, the patent layout, especially 5G, is not as good as Qualcomm.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
So we can simply summarize one thing.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.

08:46.000 --> 08:56.000
Because most of the chips are sold due to the patent layout and the maintenance of product quality.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
So the state of maintenance is very good.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
So most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users,

09:06.000 --> 09:20.000
mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, 5, 6, and 7.

09:20.000 --> 09:28.000
But the problem is that these so-called communication standards,

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
as mentioned above, 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
Although there are a lot of patent layout behind these standards,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
and the negotiation process of each party,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
because we always have to decide which standard to use.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
It must be of good quality and easy to promote.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I think everyone can understand this.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
In fact, there are international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
So let's go back to the picture just now.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
I think this picture is very important in the context of my law school.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Why is it important?

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
These three are very important to develop 4G and even 5G technical standard organizations.

10:29.000 --> 10:37.000
These technical standard organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.

10:37.000 --> 10:46.000
The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
to be able to be used by many people.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
It's not that I only let a group of people use it.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
A small group of people using it is not a standard.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
So everyone must be able to recognize that this thing is good for them.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
It's easy to use and has a high rate of measurement.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
But behind it, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
Because it's impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
This is impossible.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
It must be a segment.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It must be cut into many segments.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Some companies focus on that.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Some companies focus on that.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
For example, you can see Radio Front End.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
it also means that there are a lot of things that Qualcomm can't do.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
So today I'm going to talk to you about this.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
This industry is very dense.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
This patent is called SEP.

11:58.000 --> 12:07.000
SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.

12:07.000 --> 12:19.000
The holders of SEP, such as Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
are considered to be these players.

12:22.000 --> 12:31.000
If people all over the world use this standard,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
can they boost the price?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
If people all over the world use this standard,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
can they boost the price?

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
In order to prevent this from happening,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
this is one point.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
Another point is that it can take advantage of the patent status of the market.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Because patents are legal monopolies.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
You can understand it this way.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Most people don't study law.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
If you want to ask me how to understand patents,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
the way to understand it is very simple.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
It is a law that gives you the right to monopolize.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
For your technology, for your patent.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So it is a limited monopoly.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
After these people have patents,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
if these patents or technologies are used as standards,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
it can increase their price infinitely.

13:34.000 --> 13:42.000
Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations I just mentioned?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Because the price is too high, no one can use it.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?

13:48.000 --> 13:56.000
So in this atmosphere, in this concept,

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000
all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
remember that this structural organization in the process of setting standards,

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
it will require all technical standards organizations,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
all SEPs,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
you have to provide an LOA.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
You have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
That is to say, you want to become a 3G standard,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
for example, or 3G or 4G or 5G standards in the future.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
But your patent price must be within a certain range.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
But the condition of this range, we call it FRAMED.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Let me stop for a moment.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Does anyone have any questions now?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Let's take a look.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
It seems that no one has asked me a question.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
If there is no problem, I will continue to speak.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Because I found that there is no social science background,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
I have to speak particularly slowly.

15:03.000 --> 15:13.000
The full name of FRAMED is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.

15:13.000 --> 15:21.000
FRAMED is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
This condition actually includes a lot.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
If you are interested, you can check it.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.000
One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
You can use your technology to become my 5G standard.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
You can provide your patent and submit your patent application.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
But you have to accept FRAMED's restrictions.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Why?

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
If the price is too high, everyone will not use it.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
The other point is the box below.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
The box below is the implementer.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
HTC is not the patent holders we just saw in the picture.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
HTC is simply a person who is authorized to use the technical standards they have.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Then I use it and I adopt the technology.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We call it implementers.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
It is not a person who develops modern chips.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Simply put, HTC is the same as Apple.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Of course, if you pay attention to this industry,

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It also wants to make its own chips.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
If you are interested in the future, you can talk to me.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
In fact, there are still some entry barriers.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
First, you have to accept it.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
You have to accept it in the SEP holders.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
You have to become a technical standard.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
You have to accept Friend.

16:59.000 --> 17:07.000
Second, the condition of Friend will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
It will have a third-party interest.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
We call it a third-party interest contract.

17:15.000 --> 17:26.000
The efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
The meaning of the third person is to include HTC.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
HTC is not an SEP holder.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
HTC is not an SEP holder, but its efficiency will affect the third person.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
So everyone can enjoy the benefits of Friend.

17:43.000 --> 17:51.000
For example, HTC also uses the 3G, 4G, or 5G patents of these technical standard organizations.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
You can't say that I'm not in this technical standard organization.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
Or I didn't participate in the process of designing this technical standard organization.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
So these SEP holders raised my price very high.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
No way.

18:06.000 --> 18:23.000
Basically, these SEP holders join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for the 5G standard.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
You have to accept these two conditions.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
First, the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Second, it will affect the third party.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of Friend.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
I won't give you a discount because you are in a technical standard organization.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
No one else will.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
But I made a signal here.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
My research is in this area.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
The source of all problems is here.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
It's because of the so-called market monopoly.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Why?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Think about it.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
Who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Because who sets the technical standards?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It must be the industry leaders.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
If everyone gathers together in these industry leaders to have a meeting,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
It seems that many manufacturers sit in a row together to eat and discuss things.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
It seems to be very simple and there is no legal problem.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Let me tell you.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
The problem is here.

19:37.000 --> 19:48.000
The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this from occurring.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
This prohibition is actually a so-called joint pricing behavior.

19:53.000 --> 20:00.000
The U.S. Anti-Trust Law has many different review standards.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
The most taboo thing is the so-called joint pricing.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
A bunch of competitors in the same industry.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
For example, Ericsson also has a patent.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Qualcomm is also a member.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Because they all submit their patents and join their members.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
All set standards here.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Are you guys doing something?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Why?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Think from another perspective.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Friend is what we just talked about.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
SEP or not.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I promised you to set the price of Friend.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
But this is for everyone.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
All SEP holders must require this condition.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
What about this technical standard organization?

21:00.000 --> 21:12.000
For example, if I ask for 5%, the price of Friend is 5% for each product.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
5% may be too high.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
1% is called Friend.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Think about it.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
If such a condition appears.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
What is the price of Friend?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
What is the reasonable and non-discriminatory price?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Everyone can only charge 1%.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
In fact, from the perspective of the government, it will feel strange.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Why did you all create this RATE together?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Is there a joint pricing behavior?

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
So this problem is stuck.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
This technical standard organization, I call it SSO.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
It's easy for me to say.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
SSO will worry.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
If everyone is investigating me, everyone is doubting me.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Am I doing joint pricing over there?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Because I said a sentence.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
The price of Friend is 1%.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
Am I not being investigated all day?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
So the problem is here.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Although it is a very important organization.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
It made Friend.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
It requires everyone to accept Friend.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Because of this, what is Friend?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I can report to everyone.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
What is Friend?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
In the legal circle.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Too much.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Because no one really dares to go to court.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
It should be said that the court itself or the government unit.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
He never dared to respond positively to this matter.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Includes his definition.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
He has his calculation method.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
But every court in the United States.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Are using different methods of calculation.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Today.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
So this thing is actually complicated.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
OK.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
In fact, I will introduce this kind of background to everyone today.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
Because I think this thing needs to be explained to everyone.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Then his background state.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Then I can get into what we are studying.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
That is, everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I know what I am studying.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I'm getting into my stuff.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This is easier for everyone to understand.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Before we officially start talking.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
Before this fun case.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Let me ask you first.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
The simple industry I just introduced.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Or some knowledge background.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
Is there any problem with the introduction?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Talk.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
5 seconds.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
3, 5, 4.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
No problem so far.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
OK.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
No problem, very good.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
But if you have any questions, you are welcome.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I also want to train.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Talk to people in the legal field.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
See what you think.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
OK.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
After having such background knowledge.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Then we know that the technical standards have a lot of patents.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
OK.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
He has to authorize him to be restricted by this regulation.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Then he has a third-party regulation.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
So everyone can enjoy the friend.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
OK.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Good.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Then there is that we all know that the modern chip is selling.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Usually there are a lot of patents behind.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
OK.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
So just about summary.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Summary is like this.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
The problem is that we all know.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
I just mentioned that Qualcomm is an industry leader.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
OK.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
The quality of the modern chip is very good.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Then he is also Apple's long-term supplier.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
OK.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
But last year, at the beginning of 2017.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
The US Federal Trade Commission FTC.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And Apple itself.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Apple is his downstream manufacturer.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
OK.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Then he specifically has a lot of this kind of claim.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
That is, he has advocated many things.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
What I want to focus on today is that Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Playing with everyone in a so-called.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Uh, he uses his position in the market.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And then to achieve his goal of making profits.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
So how does he do this?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
First of all.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
This picture is actually public.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
It's not me.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It's not that beautiful.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
He added his.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
This content of the prosecution and his analysis of the picture.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
That is, how Qualcomm.

25:25.000 --> 25:48.000
How does Qualcomm do it and how does he do it?

25:48.000 --> 26:02.000
Basically, Qualcomm's approach is divided into two stages.

26:02.000 --> 26:10.000
Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is that before Qualcomm officially became Apple's supplier in 2007,

26:10.000 --> 26:30.000
Qualcomm already had a contract with Apple's assembly plant.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
If you want to assemble, you will also use Qualcomm's patent.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
In fact, I just gave a simple example.

26:38.000 --> 26:45.000
If you look at it, Qualcomm's patent layout has exceeded the scope of Modern Chip itself.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
It contains the entire technical standard.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
This is what he said.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
I also believe that this is the case.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
If you look at Qualcomm, it was established in 1985.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
Then continue to develop in the communication chip industry.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Then continue to expand the patent layout of his business.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
So in fact, the influence of his business is not just in the Modern Chip itself.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
It also contains the entire technical standard.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
So Qualcomm has been cooperating with Apple's suppliers.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Because Apple's supplier, for example, I just said Fushkang.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Fushkang is not just an Apple product.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
He also does other things, such as HP.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
You do other products.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
HP's, for example, subscriber.

27:32.000 --> 27:38.000
Qualcomm's patent or technology will also be used.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
Also need to do patent authorization.

27:42.000 --> 27:50.000
So it turns out that Qualcomm has been cooperating with Apple's other suppliers.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
So why did I mention Apple's supplier?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
The complexity is here.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Because Qualcomm did a very interesting thing.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Before he became Apple's supplier.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
He told Apple's supplier that I signed a contract with you.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
You want to assemble this Apple product.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Then I will collect this patent with you.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
But the content of this patent, the scope, the content, the specific details.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
How is it NDA?

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
Non-Disclosure Agreement is not open to the public.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
What about other things?

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Because this is a bit complicated.

28:30.000 --> 28:36.000
But simply put, Qualcomm and Apple's assembly plant today.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Then do the patent authorization.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
These assembly plants can actually come back and ask Apple for reimbursement.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
Because the assembly plant feels that there is no need to bear this responsibility anymore.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Because this contract is actually negotiable.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
But in the real world, I can report to everyone.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
In fact, most of the money in Taiwan's assembly plant.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
A lot of money has become Apple to squeeze.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Of course, Apple will say that I did not squeeze them.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
Of course, in this case, Qualcomm is.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Qualcomm claims that I have been working with these assembly plants today.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
Then I asked them to pay me the rights to these patents.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
If you don't want to pay this right, you can go back to Apple.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You don't have to pay this money.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Does Apple pay for you?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But the fun thing is here.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm is SEP.

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
In fact, its SEP is a range.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Its range is the so-called Friend.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
OK, it is fair and reasonable.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
It must be reasonable and non-discriminatory.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
But it signed the NDA with these assembly plants.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Then think about it, if you are Apple.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
Then there is a chip that I want to use Qualcomm.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
As a result, I use Qualcomm chips.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
The assembly plant below me has been asking me for money.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Qualcomm and I have received more money.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Then you have to compensate me.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Then how much compensation?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Then how much according to the contract?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Then Qualcomm asked him why it was this price.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
Apple asked those assembly plants why it was this price.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
As a result, the assembly plant said I can't tell you.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Why? Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I can't tell you.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
OK, so this is amazing.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
The first stage is that Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant for a sum of money.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
Then the source of this sum of money is NDA.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
It is not public.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Then it becomes that Apple can only accept it unilaterally.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Because the account is there.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Qualcomm asked me for so much money.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Then Apple transferred the money to Apple.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Then Apple can only accept it unilaterally.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Apple thinks it's strange.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Is this price reasonable?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
But I asked my assembly plant below me.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
He can't say.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
OK, that's weird.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
OK, so Apple actually wants to get rid of this state.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
How much did I pay Qualcomm?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
I don't know.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I should say that I don't even know my source and my calculation method.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I just kept paying for it.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
He thinks it's unreasonable.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It feels like the price is inside.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Managers or lawyers or lawyers feel that this price may be unreasonable.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Qualcomm wants too much money.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
OK, so this picture is later.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Apple went to talk to Qualcomm.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
After he went to talk, Apple said, OK, I can sign a contract with you.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
This contract is the gray part below.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
It includes BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
These are all the abbreviations of this contract.

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
BCPA, for example, is full name is Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
TA is Transition Agreement, etc.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Anyway, it's an abbreviation.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
In these contracts, Qualcomm and Apple went to talk.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Then Apple felt very uncomfortable.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
You're going through my assembly plant in the middle.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I want to talk to you directly.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
OK, I'll talk to you directly.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Qualcomm agreed.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
After he agreed, he signed these contracts.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
But he added some conditions to these contracts.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
These conditions are fun.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
This is what you see now.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
These two.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
It sounds very simple.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
In fact, the specific content looks like this.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
This is the lawsuit.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
This is mentioned in the Apple lawsuit.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I don't know what the confidential thing is.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
The main thing is these two.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
One is that you have to promise me.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
You want me to provide Qualcomm to provide you chips.

32:57.000 --> 33:05.000
The US Federal Trade Commission uses a word called No License, No Chip, No License.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It's the other way around.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Sorry.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
It's No License, No Chip.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
He said, OK, you want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Yes, but you have to accept this price.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Accept this.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
You have to accept a certain price for my SEP.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
Then he found out inside Apple that the price was a bit higher than the market.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
But Qualcomm said, what can you do?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
If you don't accept this price.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So these two are bundled together.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
The so-called bundle is to say that I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
Yes, but you have to accept an Apple.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
In fact, this case is still running.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
The so-called price is not a friend.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
The so-called price is not a friend.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
It is possible that everyone in the market public thinks that these SEPs are 1%.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
But sorry, I want 5% from you.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
The 5% sales price.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
But because Qualcomm's quality is good.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Then he is a market leader again.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Then there are a lot of patents.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
So Apple has to accept this thing.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Okay, this is the first point.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
His so-called no license, no chip.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
The policy is that I must accept you.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
You have to, you have to, you have to, Apple has to accept his contract terms.

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
In return, it means that you want me to use his, I use Qualcomm's modern chip.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
But I have to accept a higher friend price.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
The second point is.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Okay, you want me to supply this, right?

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel that I did not treat you badly.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
He provides a rebate from the top.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
This rebate is a fixed total price.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
That is to say, because you are my customer for a long time.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
Use my communication chip.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Then I will give you a return.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Let you continue to use.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
But the fun thing is coming again.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Always hurt everyone.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
If I, because everyone is not learning law or business, it is in the mall.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
All the conditions, all the benefits, or the so-called rebate, this kind of return.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
I'll give you a sum of money.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Ah, it's all conditional.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Qualcomm said yes.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Uh, Apple said yes.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Then you give me back.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
You give me a return.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
But Qualcomm said yes.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I'll give you a return.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
But you have to accept the following conditions.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
The following conditions are two.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Ah, this condition includes the following.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Chipset Supply Agreement.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
What does this condition include?

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
First, you have to continue to use my communication chip.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
You can't jump.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
You can't run to use Intel.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
You can't run to use.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Ah, Samsung or whatever.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
You can't run to use my competitor's chip.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Does this sound reasonable?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
OK, it seems like nothing.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
OK, what about the second point?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
It's just fun.

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
You can't go to any government unit to investigate me.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Ah, you can't sue me.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
You can't issue a patent lawsuit.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
You can't use any other government.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
You can't start a lawsuit to investigate me.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
OK, that's actually controversial.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
OK, one is that I provide a return.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Ah, but you have to continue to use my chip.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Ah, this is called the so-called Boundary Bait.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
OK, the second is that you want to use.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You want me to provide a return.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
You can, no problem.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
But you can't sue me.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
OK, so there are two points.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
One is that I let you not investigate me.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
It completely locks you up.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
OK, the other point is that you can't jump.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
You can't jump to another place.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
And then you can't.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
You can't sue me.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
So this makes Apple very upset.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
Because he thinks I can't use other people's.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Ah, I can't use other people's chips.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
And then you use the so-called No License No Chip in front of me.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
And then the price is so high.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
OK, the price is so high.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And then you don't let me start a lawsuit.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
And then I don't know what the hell you're doing.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And then you're the market monopoly.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And then the whole thing comes together.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Ah, that's just the whole case.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The whole thing comes together.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Just let Apple jump.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
And, uh, it triggered a lot of, uh, the EU.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
And that China, Taiwan, Taiwan.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Maybe you've heard of it.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
He's also investigating this.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
And then the United States.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
And then the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating this whole thing.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
What is his legitimacy?

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
OK, so what we're talking about in this paper is.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
Say, uh, one thing we want to study is.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
What is the reason behind what Qualcomm is doing?

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Why does Qualcomm want to provide?

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
Uh, this is the return to Apple.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Because you can think about it.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
If Qualcomm's quality is so good.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Right?

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Right?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Good quality.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Ah, it's the market monopoly again.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
Why does he provide a return to Apple?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Right?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Because I'm lying down.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I'm lying down and Apple's coming.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
You can think about it.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
That's the question.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
I think it's interesting.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
If you're a market monopoly.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
And then basically everyone's products.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Almost all of them will use my modern chip.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
And then.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And then my quality.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
People can't catch up with me.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
For example, he mentioned Intel in it.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Intel doesn't matter to him at all.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
He can't catch up with me at all.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Ah, there's a very high entry barrier.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
You might.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I don't know if you've learned this.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I personally think he's on the entry barrier.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
It's pretty high.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
The cost of this investment is very high.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Ah, so.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
This question has always been this question.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It becomes the core of our paper.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
That is, if Qualcomm.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
He's in a position that's close to a market monopoly.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Or he's in a market leadership position.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
And then?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
The layout of the patent is so wide.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
OK, and then the quality of the product is also very good.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
So why did he provide this rebate to Apple?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Ah, that's what he did in the real world.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
And provide this rebate.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
This one.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I'm going to tell you about this contract.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
This deadline.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
It's not even a year or two.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
It's three to five years.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
During the period.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
So, in fact, he continues to provide this rebate.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
And then.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Provide such a return to this Apple.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
And then the two requirements are that you have to continue to use it.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
And then you can't investigate me.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
And then.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Uh, you have to.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
And then you have to accept my friend.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
You have to accept me.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
This seems to be similar.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
This is not the price of the friend.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
In fact, even the price of the friend is controversial.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm not going to.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Uh, not in today's.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Within the scope of the report.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Because.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Because you say everything.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Apple says you're not a friend.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Qualcomm says I'm a friend.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Because I include the whole.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
This is the patent I authorize you to give.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
It's all about this.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
This know-how.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
And this.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
The so-called technical standards.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Of course.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
The price is so high.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
It's reasonable.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
So, of course, it's not reasonable.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
This is.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Uh, the industry's problem.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
So, today.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
The problem is on this rebate.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
So, today, I'm going to tell you a little bit about it.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
That is to say.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
The point I focused on today.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
It's also this paper.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Me and that.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
The focus of the study with the classmate is.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Why Qualcomm, he will.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
So insistent on providing rebate.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
This thing.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
OK.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Okay.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Uh.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I'll pause it again.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
See if you have any understanding of this case.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Hey.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Do you understand the story I just told you?

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
Because I don't know if you understand this story.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
Content.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Hello.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Do you understand?

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
This story.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
OK.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
All right.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I think if I didn't listen.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Uh, listen.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Does anyone not understand?

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That's what I should say.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I don't understand which link.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
OK.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
If you don't understand.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
Can you tell me which link you don't understand?

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Because he's a little bit complicated about this thing.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Because I.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Uh.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
This thing involves my graduation thesis.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
So, he.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Some small and complex.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
Some of the details of the industry's content.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Let's see if you have any.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Which side I just said a little bit.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
I don't understand.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Is there?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Good.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
54321.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Good.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Just pretend.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Just pretend you understand.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Good.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Good.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
OK.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
Good.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
No one.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
There is a response.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
OK.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Just pretend to understand.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Good.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
On the basis of this posture.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
We know.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
The love-hate relationship between Apple and Qualcomm.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
It's just like this.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It was sued like this last year.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
That.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
This.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
For me.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
At the beginning of this paper.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
First.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Uh.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
He is a.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Uh.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
The cross-section is a cross-domain.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
But the cooperation paper is like this.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
What I'm in charge of is the legal analysis.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Then my partner is.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Responsible for the study.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Game theory model.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
The introduction.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
And then.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
And from a commercial perspective.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
And.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Uh.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
Economic perspective.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
To analyze this whole thing.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
The first is.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Everyone is already curious.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
But from my point of view.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Is there a similar case in the past?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Or in this kind of debate.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
The case.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
How did they judge?

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Or what is the result of their judgment?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Then I will report to you.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Just.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Simply put.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
It's this thing.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
This problem.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Even the court itself.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It's hard to get it done.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
OK.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
That.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Uh.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
The picture.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
What you see on the screen.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
The red part.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Uh.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Represents.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
The court is.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Uh.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
The red part right.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
The page.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
These.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
This red case is the court.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Sentence.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
The defendant is like.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Uh.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
This kind of company like Gaotong is illegal.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
OK.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
The black part is that I don't have a label.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I don't.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
These cases in the black part.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Is.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
The court believes.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Is.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Legally.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
It's like this.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
It's called.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
You have to accept this.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
If you want to use.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
As if Gaotong.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
The state of Gaotong I just talked about.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Is that if you want to use.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Use my.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Things you want.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Uh.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Become my supplier.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Can.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Uh.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Or I'm going to supply you with good stuff.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
But you have to accept my conditions.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Or I.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Uh.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
You can buy it.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
But I.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
You have to buy a certain amount.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Okay.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
After buying a certain amount.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
I'll give you a rebate.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
It's a concept like this.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
It's like this.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
A transaction mode like this.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
That's it.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
These six cases.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
I sorted it out.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
That's because everyone is not legal.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
OK.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
That.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
I won't say it one by one.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Ah.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
That's actually the result.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
His.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
The result is analyzed.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
The reason is also analyzed.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
That.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Three red dots are.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
These are the different courts.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
For.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
These cases.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
The reason for the use.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
So, as you can see.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
A very special phenomenon is.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Hey.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
On the subject of this rebate.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Or say this kind of bundle rebate.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Different courts have different reasons.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
OK.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Also different results.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
OK.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
That.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
I'll talk about it later.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
That is, Qualcomm actually used this point.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Ah.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
It's not a use.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
That is to say, he should.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Maybe he saw this point.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
We infer.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
He saw this point.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
It may also become his.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
This.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
To continue to use.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
His bundle rebate.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
To Apple.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
OK.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
This is a.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Our inference.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I'll mention it later.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
This is my preliminary investigation.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Found that.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Ah.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
If the defendant.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
The black one.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
The red case is illegal.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
The black case is legal.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Then I'll see.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
That red case.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
What is illegal?

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Common features.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
The first.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Those illegal cases.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
The red part.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
I just showed you.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
The red part.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
These defendants.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
In fact, all.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Ah.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Have some.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Market monopoly.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
So.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
If you are a.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Market monopoly.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Easy.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
If you are a monopolist.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
It may be easy to violate.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Antitrust law.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Ah.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
This is in our.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Ah.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
If you learn this in our law school.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Antitrust law.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Basically, this.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
This.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
This is a high probability.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
If you have this market.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
If the monopoly is basically easy.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
This antitrust law.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
This is.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
Ah.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
This is normal.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
OK.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Then in this bundle.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
In the context of the rebate.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
It is also.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
It's not an exception.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
But we have seen.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
The second point is very interesting.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
We see the legal.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We compare these legal cases.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Ah.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
It's the black one.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
In those cases.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
We found that.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
The defendant is actually still possible.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Is legal.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Why?

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Because imagine.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Today.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
He's in front of him.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Uh.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
That's what I just said.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
In these black cases.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
He has some.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Ah.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
These judges.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Why?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
In the same situation.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I think they are legal.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Because they don't have it at all.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Eliminate the effect.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
OK.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
In general.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Let's make it simple.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Is.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Anti-tax law is actually in the regulation.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
Is a law of corporate behavior.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
OK.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
It is the law of market economy and corporate behavior.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
So.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
That.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The market economy must maintain a competitive attitude.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Instead of letting a person.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Independent or say.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Present a state of monopoly.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But imagine.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
If he was originally today.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Although he is a.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Through.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Uh.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
His sales behavior.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
And then his innovative business model.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Achieve his.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
The leadership position of the market.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
But it's not monopoly.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Leadership position.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Then he wants to continue.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
The.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
When increasing his market share.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
He might let.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Some other competitors.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Uh.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Some may have progress barriers.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Or what is the situation.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
His elimination effect.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
He might make some.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
For example, killing competition or something.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
His.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
He might let some other competitors.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
He can't come in.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Or potential competitors.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
For example, like I just mentioned.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Intel.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Intel in the so-called.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
This.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Computer CPU.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Everyone should know.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
It's all done very well.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Ah.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
This kind of patent.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
The patent series are all very strong.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And then with this Microsoft.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
In the late 90s.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
It's almost.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
This is.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It's almost all computers.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
But.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
He's in that communication chip.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
He just can't stand still.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
He just doesn't have the so-called.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
This status.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
That today.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Uh.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
He's coming in today.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
But in fact.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
He's coming in.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
He just needs to invest enough money.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
In fact.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
In fact, he is also doing it.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Just keep doing bad.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
OK.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
But it's not that he can't do it.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Ah.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
There's a difference.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
That is to say.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Let me talk about it again.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
There's a difference.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
It's the so-called can't do it.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
That is to say, I.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
I took advantage of some commercial behavior.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
For example, I.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
I join all the people.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
I don't provide you with the material.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
You can't do it.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
But this doesn't work.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Ah.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
This must be against.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
This antitrust law.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Because this is against this.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
This market competition.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
The situation.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
So now the situation is.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Hey.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
We.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Observe the previous few black cases.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
We found that.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Why are those cases legal?

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Because of those potential intruders.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
He wasn't excluded.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
Enter this market.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
He can still enter this market.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Competition.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
It means that his entry barrier is low.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
If the entry barrier is low.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
The court sees that the entry barrier is low.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
That's just to say.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
You might come in today.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
It's just that you chose not to come in.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Or you.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Maybe you have other commercial considerations.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Instead of coming in.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
So.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Before this.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Before.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Let me go back again.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Before.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Before.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Before.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Before.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Before.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Before.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Before.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Before.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Before.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Before.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Why are these black cases from before legal?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Why are these Bando Rebellion legal?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Because.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Other competitors.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
He.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
It is not excluded.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
It still came in.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
It still joined this industry.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Continuing with.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
These defendants are in competition.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Let's say the defendant is Gaoton.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
It is still.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Still come in this industry to compete.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
That's like what we're talking about today.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
The case of Gaotong is not the only one.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Provide a modern chip.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Samsung also has.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Huawei also has.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
OK, so it becomes.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
It's me.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
To provide a chip.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
So.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Look at my phone.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
You see.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
I have a mobile phone.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
I'm on his mobile phone.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
So.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
It becomes.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
In this case.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
In fact, there is a bit of a swing.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
If you listen to me.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
You know what I mean.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Although Gaotong.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
He is in this market.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Based on monopoly status.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Based on this leadership status.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Then maybe.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
There are some monopolies in sales.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Power.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Because his product quality is good.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
But.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Other people are still in it.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Right.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Other players are also in it.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Other manufacturers are also in it.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
So.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
If you follow this.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
The logic of the black case.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Then he might be illegal.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
But according to the logic of the black case.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Then he might be illegal.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
But according to the logic of the black case.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Then he might be illegal.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Then he might be illegal.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
OK.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
So on this matter.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
In fact.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
why.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Let me tell you.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Why Taiwan.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
I personally think.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Why Taiwan.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Can't judge Gaotong so soon.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Illegal.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
The reason is actually here.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
The reason is actually here.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
I'll share it with you.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
I don't know if it's good to say that.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
I don't know if it's good to say that.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
But I personally think.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
It is worth thinking about.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
OK.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Every country has probably different.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
OK.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Every country has probably different.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
But I personally think.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Whether Gaotong is really illegal.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Whether Gaotong is really illegal.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Then you are like this.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
A.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
A law is going on.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Will you be influenced.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Other manufacturers are against this matter.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Other manufacturers are against this matter.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
I think there are casualties.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
I think there are casualties.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
OK.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
Since there are so many people in this business.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
OK.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Since there are so many people in this industry.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Why is he being punished?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Why is he being punished?

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
You have to give a fair reason.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
You have to give a fair reason.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
The United States is a public debate country.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
The United States is a public debate country.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
So this thing no longer judged.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
So this thing no longer judged.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
So that's it for now.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
So that's it for now.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
So.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
So.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
The conclusion of this paper.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Is here, in this study.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
And then there's a question in the paper.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
That is the question in the paper.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
The question is about why bottled readers continue to act on it.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
The question is about why bottled readers continue to act on it.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Regardless of this green act.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Regardless of this green act.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Regardless of this green act.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
Regardless of this green act which has already fallen.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Regardless of this green act which has already fallen.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
After the model reads off,

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
After the model reads off,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
we see some things in the model that we are spurred on.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
we see some things in the model that we are spurred on.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
We see some things in the model that we are spurred on.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
This is the case this model is one of the things.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
And then from the business perspective.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
and a law perspective

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
This is the case this model is one of the things.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
Watching these things.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Then this is what we're doing.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
One of the steps for how this paper answers the question.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
One of the steps for how this paper answer the question.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Do you have any thoughts or questions?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Do you have any thoughts or questions?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Yes.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
MRI is not in the scope of modem.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.900
MRI is not in the scope of modem.

53:17.660 --> 53:18.600
No blueprint is in the appraiser system

53:18.600 --> 53:20.140
and has the blueprint design in a presupedit

53:20.600 --> 53:21.700
and has the blueprint design in a prespedit

53:27.240 --> 53:28.240
This is a bit complicated,

53:30.740 --> 53:31.740
I believe if you're in engineering school,

53:31.740 --> 53:32.740
I believe if you're in engineering school,

53:32.740 --> 53:34.200
the math will be better than mine.

53:34.200 --> 53:34.940
I just briefly talk about math

53:34.940 --> 53:37.280
I just briefly talk about math

53:37.280 --> 53:38.320
The story that we just heard

53:38.320 --> 53:41.320
The story that we just heard

53:41.320 --> 53:44.320
After hearing our story,

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
let's talk about assuming these mathematical models.

53:45.320 --> 53:47.620
Let's talk about assuming these mathematical models.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.900
First, for the game in the promotion theory,

53:49.900 --> 53:52.140
First, for the game in the promotion theory,

53:52.140 --> 53:53.440
we have three different games we play,

53:53.440 --> 53:56.280
we have three different games we play,

53:56.280 --> 53:58.280
One is One Stage Game

53:58.280 --> 54:00.940
One is One Stage Game

54:00.940 --> 54:03.660
is divided into the Exhaustive and Non-exhaustive.

54:03.660 --> 54:04.940
OK

54:04.940 --> 54:07.080
About Exhaustive, let me explain to you.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.920
Just like the FRIEND I mentioned just now,

54:09.920 --> 54:11.200
Just like the FRIEND I mentioned just now,

54:11.200 --> 54:13.080
there is a so-called price issue.

54:13.080 --> 54:14.760
Then why is there a FRIEND

54:14.780 --> 54:15.620
What do you think is reasonable?

54:15.620 --> 54:18.020
What do I think is unreasonable?

54:18.020 --> 54:22.020
In fact, one of them is the amount

54:22.020 --> 54:25.420
and the scope of authorization.

54:25.420 --> 54:26.740
Apple thinks that

54:26.740 --> 54:29.980
you sell me ModernChip today.

54:29.980 --> 54:31.700
OK, you provide me with ModernChip.

54:31.700 --> 54:36.020
The price of the sales

54:36.020 --> 54:38.860
should include the price of the patent.

54:38.860 --> 54:40.380
OK, this is a bit tricky.

54:40.380 --> 54:41.900
Let me say it again.

54:41.920 --> 54:42.840
Apple will think that

54:42.840 --> 54:45.520
you provide me with ModernChip today.

54:45.520 --> 54:47.440
OK, this is a price.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.440
Let's say it's $100.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.600
But it's not that cheap, $100.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.040
OK, maybe this $100

54:55.040 --> 54:57.240
already includes the price of the patent.

54:57.240 --> 55:00.000
OK, so when you sell it to me,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.600
there is a basic concept in the patent law.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.600
I simply emphasize this.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.880
You don't have to go into detail.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.000
There is a concept in the patent law.

55:06.000 --> 55:11.400
Once my patent is included in my product,

55:11.420 --> 55:13.300
it will be sold together.

55:13.300 --> 55:17.180
If this thing is bought by someone else,

55:17.180 --> 55:21.180
for example, I have already paid once for Apple.

55:21.180 --> 55:23.580
Do I have to pay again?

55:23.580 --> 55:24.700
No.

55:24.700 --> 55:26.140
Because Apple has already paid once.

55:26.140 --> 55:28.700
It has already sold me the patent.

55:28.700 --> 55:32.780
It has already sold me the price of ModernChip.

55:32.780 --> 55:36.860
So why do I have to pay again?

55:36.860 --> 55:37.220
Right?

55:37.220 --> 55:38.220
Of course not.

55:38.220 --> 55:39.500
So of course the core concept is

55:39.520 --> 55:41.760
The core concept of Exaustive is that

55:41.760 --> 55:43.760
there will be such a dispute because

55:43.760 --> 55:47.520
Apple thinks that when Qualcomm provides ModernChip to me,

55:47.520 --> 55:50.200
it already includes the price of all patents.

55:50.200 --> 55:53.320
You shouldn't add another patent price

55:53.320 --> 55:55.000
and raise it so high.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.080
OK.

55:56.080 --> 55:59.320
Qualcomm, of course, thinks no.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.720
I authorize you

56:00.720 --> 56:02.240
or I sell you ModernChip.

56:02.240 --> 56:07.600
The patent I include is only a small part of my patent combination.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.440
There are many patents.

56:09.460 --> 56:10.980
You didn't use it.

56:10.980 --> 56:13.620
So you have to pay extra.

56:13.620 --> 56:14.820
Everyone should understand this.

56:14.820 --> 56:17.860
Why do we design Exaustive and Non-Exaustive?

56:17.860 --> 56:18.900
The reason is here.

56:18.900 --> 56:22.260
Because this involves the business itself.

56:22.260 --> 56:24.140
Now in this industry,

56:24.140 --> 56:26.900
some of its game rules are played like this.

56:26.900 --> 56:27.100
Right?

56:27.100 --> 56:33.620
Because I originally supplied ModernChip to you.

56:33.620 --> 56:36.460
It should include all prices,

56:36.460 --> 56:38.100
including patent prices.

56:38.100 --> 56:39.380
This is Apple's idea.

56:39.400 --> 56:41.080
But Qualcomm doesn't think so.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.960
Qualcomm thinks that I only give you a part.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.760
There are many things you don't know.

56:46.760 --> 56:48.520
So you have to pay more.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.720
This is why I just said

56:50.720 --> 56:54.520
Qualcomm's so-called No License, No Chip is reasonable.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.000
Why does it dare to talk about this condition?

56:57.000 --> 56:58.240
Because it dares to say

56:58.240 --> 57:00.440
even if I supply ModernChip to you today,

57:00.440 --> 57:02.000
I still have other patents that you haven't used.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.280
So you have to pay more.

57:03.280 --> 57:05.360
Otherwise, it's gone.

57:05.360 --> 57:05.640
OK.

57:05.640 --> 57:09.120
This is the so-called One Stage Non-Exhaustive.

57:09.300 --> 57:13.140
Non-exhaustive is like a game.

57:13.140 --> 57:15.660
Exhaustive contract game

57:15.660 --> 57:18.580
is based on Apple's point of view.

57:18.580 --> 57:22.020
Non-exhaustive is based on Qualcomm's point of view.

57:22.020 --> 57:24.620
And then we go to the two-stage game.

57:24.620 --> 57:25.300
This is interesting.

57:25.300 --> 57:28.700
We go to the two-stage step

57:28.700 --> 57:31.020
to run this model,

57:31.020 --> 57:33.420
this Game Theory model.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.260
In Exhaustive Game,

57:35.260 --> 57:36.620
as we just mentioned,

57:36.640 --> 57:37.760
that is to say,

57:37.760 --> 57:40.400
because Apple thinks

57:40.400 --> 57:42.200
you give me ModernChip,

57:42.200 --> 57:46.040
it includes all patents.

57:46.040 --> 57:46.440
OK.

57:46.440 --> 57:47.760
Because it includes all patents.

57:47.760 --> 57:48.920
So

57:48.920 --> 57:50.040
the way it calculates

57:50.040 --> 57:53.240
is the percentage of each chip.

57:53.240 --> 57:53.880
That's it.

57:53.880 --> 57:54.840
Non-exhaustive,

57:54.840 --> 57:59.000
that may be because Qualcomm thinks

57:59.000 --> 58:02.600
the patents in ModernChip are just a part of me.

58:02.600 --> 58:03.320
OK.

58:03.320 --> 58:06.520
So I have many other patents

58:06.540 --> 58:08.460
that haven't been given to you yet.

58:08.460 --> 58:09.980
So the money I added

58:09.980 --> 58:11.900
is for the whole technology.

58:11.900 --> 58:13.020
This is what Qualcomm said.

58:13.020 --> 58:14.620
Qualcomm is very ambitious.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.580
He said that my patent

58:16.580 --> 58:20.220
laid out all the technical standards.

58:20.220 --> 58:21.220
So what does he think?

58:21.220 --> 58:24.260
What does he think Apple has to pay for?

58:24.260 --> 58:26.060
The basis for Apple to pay for money

58:26.060 --> 58:27.740
is the entire market value,

58:27.740 --> 58:29.380
the value of the entire market,

58:29.380 --> 58:31.740
not just the chip.

58:31.740 --> 58:32.020
OK.

58:32.020 --> 58:34.420
So this model

58:34.440 --> 58:36.720
is based on the price.

58:36.720 --> 58:40.640
The basic foundation of the price calculation method

58:40.640 --> 58:41.680
is different.

58:41.680 --> 58:42.200
OK.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.320
In this exhaustive,

58:44.320 --> 58:46.120
Apple's point of view

58:46.120 --> 58:48.520
is that the price of patents

58:48.520 --> 58:52.800
is calculated according to the percentage of each chip I sell.

58:52.800 --> 58:54.880
But Qualcomm thinks it's wrong.

58:54.880 --> 58:58.120
It should be calculated at the price of the entire market.

58:58.120 --> 58:58.640
OK.

58:58.640 --> 58:58.800
OK.

58:58.800 --> 59:02.560
This is the calculation price of our two different games.

59:02.700 --> 59:05.740
The price of the patent is different.

59:05.740 --> 59:09.180
What about the two-stage game?

59:09.180 --> 59:09.940
Intel,

59:09.940 --> 59:10.700
we assume that

59:10.700 --> 59:12.820
because Intel is a...

59:12.820 --> 59:13.940
Although we just mentioned that

59:13.940 --> 59:16.260
Intel is not a very good player

59:16.260 --> 59:18.860
in the modern chip industry.

59:18.860 --> 59:21.740
But it was mentioned in Qualcomm's petition.

59:21.740 --> 59:23.100
It's a funny point.

59:23.100 --> 59:24.140
Qualcomm's petition said

59:24.140 --> 59:25.700
I don't know if you remember

59:25.700 --> 59:27.820
that in 2016 or 2017,

59:27.820 --> 59:30.620
in 2015, 2016, and 2017,

59:30.640 --> 59:33.360
I forgot which year the iPhone 7 was launched.

59:33.360 --> 59:33.560
OK.

59:33.560 --> 59:34.560
In the past few years,

59:34.560 --> 59:38.440
Apple has done so-called recycling in the iPhone 7.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.920
They took the machine back.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.960
One of the reasons is that there are some

59:41.960 --> 59:43.920
problems with the quality of communication.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.400
Then it is said that

59:45.400 --> 59:47.440
this is what Qualcomm wrote in his petition.

59:47.440 --> 59:48.280
It is said that

59:48.280 --> 59:51.920
it is because Apple violated the contract.

59:51.920 --> 59:52.680
It violated the contract.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.920
It went to Intel

59:55.920 --> 59:58.160
to use Intel's modern chip.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.440
As a result, Intel's quality was not as good as Qualcomm's.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.100
So it led to some of these mobile phones,

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.620
not all of them,

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.740
some of the mobile phones with Intel's

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.900
modern chip

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.020
had poor quality of communication.

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.100
It was bad.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:16.300
Then it caused some customers to be unhappy.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.860
So it was required to withdraw.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.300
It was really withdrawn.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:20.580
OK.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.060
So under such a fact,

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.460
let's assume that

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.560
in the future, is it possible for Intel to

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.640
change its modern chip quality?

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.120
Assuming that Intel,

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:33.800
we assume that

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.120
this is an assumption.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.320
Assuming that Intel

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.200
at a certain point in the future,

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.720
its product quality

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.720
becomes very close to Qualcomm.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.200
OK.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.880
Then how will this game play?

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.000
What will happen in the market?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.720
Will Apple accept

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.600
this bundle rebate we just talked about?

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.980
And Qualcomm,

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.020
our most important role,

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.300
does it have a reason to provide this rebate?

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:00.580
OK.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.740
This is our basic game.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.180
Then,

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.220
this

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.300
mathematical model,

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.460
in fact, we have a few assumptions.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.140
In fact, they are all based on the story we just heard.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.060
So in fact,

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.780
they are all quite intuitive.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:14.060
OK.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:17.100
First, we assume that Qualcomm is a

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.060
very

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.820
high-quality in the market.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.900
Provided to

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.460
and higher than Intel

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.180
in the first stage.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.440
Everyone should be able to understand this.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:25.800
OK.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.280
And it has been like this in recent years.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:28.640
OK.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.960
And these manufacturers,

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.160
that is, Apple,

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.880
Apple and Qualcomm,

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.360
are actually a

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.440
measurement standard for their companies.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:41.840
That is to say,

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.320
I want to get the maximum profit.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.160
I think everyone should be able to understand this.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:47.400
OK.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.520
Third,

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.200
that is to say,

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.920
the game we play is a bit like

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:55.260
Apple is a follower.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.740
Because Apple does not produce the so-called modern chip,

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.580
it does not make the modern chip.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:01:59.860
OK.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:02.580
So it's a bit like

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.340
this game is

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.220
the first Qualcomm,

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.420
it provides a contract

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.180
clause,

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.260
which includes the bundle rebate.

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.100
OK.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:10.300
OK.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.260
Then Apple only has two options,

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260
accept or not.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.580
That's it.

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:14.940
OK.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.220
So the game we play is like this.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.660
Apple accepts or not.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:17.860
OK.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.220
If you accept it,

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.460
for Qualcomm,

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.180
what is its profit?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.320
Then what is Apple's profit?

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.400
If you don't accept it,

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.920
how does Qualcomm's profit change?

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.840
How does Apple's profit change?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.160
OK.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.640
So we use this pie

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.400
to denote the entire profit.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.720
Then A, Q, and I are these players.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.000
OK.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.120
A is Apple,

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.520
Q is Qualcomm,

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.720
and I is Intel.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720
OK.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:42.960
OK.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.320
Then a few numbers.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.920
In fact,

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.080
I will simply report to you.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.600
It's a bit boring here.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:50.820
OK.

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.340
That's just an assumption for everyone.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.140
Then this is Q.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.740
Q is this.

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.460
Qualcomm's quality.

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.020
Uh, yes.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:58.940
Qualcomm's

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.860
Qualcomm chip quality.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.300
Then CQ like this.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.860
You can just look at it like this.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:03.780
In fact,

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.180
the main thing is to explain to you that

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.660
we set these functions.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.500
Then it also includes its demand function.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.260
Demand function,

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.780
then its value,

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.100
that is to say,

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.860
we don't want it to be low.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.420
You can know that

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.460
the demand function we set here

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.280
is D equals A minus BP plus Gamma Q.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:22.600
OK.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.840
Then we have to let this

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.160
A must be greater than or equal to zero.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:27.520
OK.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.840
So it's actually its demand function.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.640
Then its price and quality.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:32.880
OK.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.360
Then I set it to avoid this model.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:35.840
It's complicated.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.000
We must be greater than or equal to D.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.360
So A must be greater than or equal to the thing behind it.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.320
It must be A.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.200
Because A minus the back.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:42.680
OK.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.880
A, we set a market size here.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.320
Then you can think about it.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.920
Just be intuitive.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.320
That is to say,

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.140
if A is the market size.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.940
Because you have three players today.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.020
So your market size must be greater than the two behind it.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.900
Apple and Qualcomm.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.460
Apple and Intel.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.180
And Qualcomm and Intel.

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.220
The whole market share.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.260
The market share.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.820
And then what.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.340
OK.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.580
So simply put,

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.140
that is to say,

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.980
we set D to be greater than or equal to zero.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.300
Simply put, that's it.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:16.580
OK.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.100
So you see,

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.720
so that's Maxima.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.720
And then BCQ.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.800
And then minus Gamma.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.080
And then this BC1 minus Q1.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.600
So the front is Qualcomm.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.000
The back is Intel.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:27.560
OK.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.080
So it must be greater than this.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.680
OK.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:35.200
And then we set this contract.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.000
OK.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.200
Then WQ, we set it to be a cheap price.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:39.560
OK.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.600
Then Alpha, we set it to be a royalty percentage.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.000
What's fun about us is that Alpha,

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.980
it's set to this.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.260
Uh, we just said it was the condition of the front.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.540
So it has an interval,

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.220
which means it's between 0 and 1.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:55.060
OK.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:55.580
OK.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.500
So W is his cheap side.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.220
I think this is basically what it is.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.940
So we just denote.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.180
OK.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.380
So we just,

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.180
you might also mention,

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:06.460
that is to say,

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.140
what is that rebate?

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.420
We will provide a rebate.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.340
That rebate is to provide a Gamma.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.380
Because it's a rebate.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.700
Why is it so fast to choose this Gamma?

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.760
Because it's from,

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.680
it's a fixed amount.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:17.960
That is to say,

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.280
it's from the whole sale,

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.560
from this WQ or WI.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.240
WQ is this Qualcomm chip.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.000
WI is Intel's chip.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.360
Because it's from this whole chip,

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.040
the total sales,

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.400
the total sales,

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.680
to be deducted.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.360
So,

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.360
this is also in line with the reality.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.400
Because the reality of this rebate,

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:38.880
uh,

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.120
the situation is also from this overall sales number,

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.840
and then the total,

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.500
and then to,

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.700
to provide you,

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.860
and then deduct a number.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.980
Then this number is deducted from the total.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.780
So we just set it to Gamma.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.780
OK.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.060
Uh,

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:52.860
it should be R.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.340
R.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:53.620
OK.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.500
Set it to R,

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.300
like this.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:55.860
OK.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.060
OK.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:56.660
So,

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:57.460
uh,

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.220
this is my good friend,

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.380
my other partner's conclusion.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:03.340
Then I'll just show you,

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.500
appreciate the beauty of this math.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.580
Because I really can't do this.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.380
OK.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:08.940
OK.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.460
So,

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:11.500
actually, I'll tell you about it.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.080
The result of our run.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:13.320
OK.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.960
Let's stop for a moment.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.920
I think there should be no problem here.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.600
I think everyone should,

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.720
I hope everyone is still awake.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:20.960
OK.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.520
It's just a mathematical model.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:22.840
OK.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.080
That's it.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.800
The main thing is to know how to play our game.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.160
I think everyone knows,

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:29.400
that is,

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.680
how our Game Theory model is set.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.720
OK.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.920
OK.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.240
I think there should be no problem.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.320
OK.

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.660
No problem.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.100
Ah,

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.020
I don't understand Game Theory at all.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:46.740
Crying.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.220
Actually,

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:47.980
no,

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.820
Game Theory is,

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:49.100
you know,

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.340
everyone actually understands Game Theory.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.020
Don't be too complicated.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.140
Game Theory is actually a math.

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.540
So you can actually see it.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.060
In fact,

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.380
it's actually a,

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:56.860
uh,

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.180
application of math.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:06:59.500
OK.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:06:59.700
So,

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.020
in fact,

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.500
it's not that much.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.260
I think it's quite intuitive.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.140
But I just,

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.180
that is to say,

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:06.580
I think,

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.380
I hope I can make it clear to everyone.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.140
Because,

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:10.780
to be honest,

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800
because of this PowerPoint,

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.400
I have to tell other people in the legal department.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.800
The other people in the legal department,

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.200
they are completely less sensitive to math.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.160
So I have to make it extremely simple.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:23.840
OK.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.720
If everyone,

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.240
if it's a little difficult to listen to,

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.920
maybe I have to review it.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.200
OK.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:28.760
Simply put,

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.400
how to play this game?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.280
In fact,

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:31.560
anyway,

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.560
it's Qualcomm.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.000
I provide a contract.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:34.960
OK.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.880
Provide this contract.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.000
Then it has a rebate based on a certain price.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.820
And then this rebate,

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.540
sorry,

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.220
this rebate is a fixed amount.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.540
Like this,

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.340
and then this amount,

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.740
and then see if Apple wants to accept it.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:49.020
Like this,

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.700
and then we look at the response of Intel.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.540
Let's look at the response of Apple.

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.100
And then their profit maximization.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:55.380
And then what is the two-stage?

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.500
Two-stage is good.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.220
Assuming that Intel is at a certain time point in the future.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.860
Its quality has risen to the same as Qualcomm.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:02.100
Okay,

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.500
so let's look at that.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:03.860
Today,

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.980
Apple provides this rebate.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.340
What is the change in its profit?

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.420
What is the change in profit?

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.640
What is the change in Apple's profit?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.400
What is the impact of Intel on this whole thing?

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:12.880
OK,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.680
so the simple game is like this.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.000
OK.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:16.280
Okay,

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.400
so what?

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:17.640
In fact,

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.760
the result we came up with at the end was that we found that it was fun.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.480
It's one-stage game.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.640
It's the so-called one-stage game.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.240
I just said that Qualcomm provides this bundle rebate.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:27.720
Okay,

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.920
Apple accepts it or not.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920
That's it.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.840
And then he set his quality to be much higher than Intel.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.360
Simply put,

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.080
that's it.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:35.240
Okay,

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.680
so you'll find that Qualcomm is actually intuitive.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.820
It's actually very easy to look at.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:39.500
Why?

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.540
Just like I just said,

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.380
Qualcomm is a market monopoly.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.820
No one has a better quality than him.

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.420
Why does he provide rebate?

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.100
It doesn't make sense.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:48.420
Why?

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.500
Because he doesn't allow it at all.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.460
Because what does it mean to provide rebate?

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.780
It means that he can't maximize the profit.

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.020
Right?

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.100
He provides an amount to Apple.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:57.860
What is he doing?

01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:58.380
Right?

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.940
Because I don't provide it anyway.

01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:01.100
Apple has to pay for it.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.020
Yeah,

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.420
so Apple has to pay for it.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.820
So why do I provide rebate to Apple?

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.680
I just maximize the profit.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.520
So at the first stage,

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.640
the results of the model we made showed that

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.920
this is not necessary.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.680
Boundary rebate is not necessary.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.240
Okay,

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:24.080
so non-exhaustive actually didn't change much.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.640
That's just because of this.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.080
Because Alpha is still in this range.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:27.480
So Alpha,

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:27.920
I just said,

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.040
it's the range of this Royalty.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:29.760
It hasn't changed.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:30.960
Okay,

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.200
so no matter what you do today,

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:32.640
this Alpha,

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.640
you calculate the entire market value.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:37.700
It's the entire market value.

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:38.980
It's still just modern chip.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.380
It doesn't actually affect high-speed communication.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:41.660
Why?

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.460
High-speed communication still feels like I'm a market monopoly.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.700
Why do I provide a rebate?

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.660
And then it affects my profit maximization.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.820
So one stage,

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.460
and then non-exhaustive game is the same.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.260
It's from a high-speed point of view.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.460
He doesn't need to provide rebate to Apple at all.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:58.340
But it's fun.

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.380
That's the third one.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:02.860
We found that from two-stage game,

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.180
we found that Intel's quality has risen.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:06.420
Okay,

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.240
but he's starting to have conditions.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:08.880
That is to say,

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.360
it was not necessary before.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.720
Then we went to two-stage game.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.120
We found that this quality.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.000
This quality,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.560
when Intel's quality is close to high-speed communication,

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.160
we found that,

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:19.840
hey,

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.680
high-speed communication to some extent,

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.040
he has to provide rebate to Apple.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:26.840
Oh,

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.280
okay,

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.040
that's it.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:28.800
This is the red line.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.760
This is the condition that we came up with mathematically.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.840
That's the MQ.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.880
That's bigger than this.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:34.400
Okay,

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:38.300
so we found that the appearance of mathematics.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:38.620
That is to say,

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:43.820
he has a condition that he has to provide rebate to Apple.

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:44.180
Otherwise,

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.540
he can't maximize the profit.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:46.700
Okay,

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.660
that's the problem.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:49.900
Okay,

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.060
that's the problem.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.020
Why is there a condition?

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:54.180
Okay,

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.300
what about the business behind this condition?

01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.940
What is the commercial consideration?

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:00.700
Okay,

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.420
so we thought about it.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.320
We thought about it a lot.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:05.960
Okay,

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.680
then we will find that,

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.120
the first.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.680
In the two-stage game,

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.360
we found that,

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:17.080
if we assume that this cost of Intel,

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:17.440
uh,

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.200
not the cost,

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:18.680
wrong,

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.760
this quality,

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.880
the quality of modern chip is very close to high-speed communication.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.240
If he is very close,

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.400
it means that Apple's,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.280
this one plus one is high.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.040
Apple's one plus one is high for high-speed communication.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.160
This should be easy for everyone to think about.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:32.640
Because why?

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.420
Because Apple has a choice.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.540
I said I would choose Intel.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.220
If you still provide that price,

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.060
I don't need your modern chip.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:40.660
So in this case,

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.940
if everyone's quality is very close,

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.260
there will be a so-called price war.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.540
I think this should be easier for everyone to understand.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.620
When the price war occurs,

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.140
it will cause profit loss.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.740
So in this inference,

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:54.340
we,

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.060
we boldly infer that,

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.860
why is there this red condition in front of it?

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.540
Why is this rebate produced?

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.260
This R is produced.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.720
Why is there such a change in the two-stage game?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.840
Because the one-stage does not need it in the front.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.800
Why do you want two-stage?

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.320
The reason is because we infer that,

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.560
high-speed communication,

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.040
because of the game,

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.680
he has an assumption in this game.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.280
Because of this,

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.880
we haven't learned the game theory.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.640
So I'll put it simply.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.240
This game theory,

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.080
he has a lot of,

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.880
he has an assumption.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.640
The premise is that both sides are actually in the case of knowledge or full knowledge.

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.280
For market information,

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.000
and for this information of both sides,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.280
it is a full-knowledge situation.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.360
OK.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.100
The so-called information includes the so-called patent information,

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.060
including price information,

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.100
including the case.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.580
These are all full-knowledge.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.660
Apple, Qualcomm, Intel all know.

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.060
OK.

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.260
In such a full-knowledge situation,

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.540
Apple, he may be,

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.220
not Apple,

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.700
Qualcomm, he may be able to predict that,

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.460
in the future, if,

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.260
and in real society,

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:50.420
I just mentioned that,

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.500
that Apple is really careless,

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.620
or whether it is careless,

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.500
or deliberately,

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.420
jump the bridge,

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.380
secretly use Intel's modern chip,

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.060
but the effect is not good.

01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:01.220
Well, just based on this fact,

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.480
will there be a doubt?

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:02.960
That is to say,

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.040
Hey, Qualcomm will worry that,

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.920
if Intel's modern chip quality rises,

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.640
will it threaten my market,

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.240
market leadership?

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.040
It is possible.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.440
If it really threatens,

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.920
then it will produce our previous,

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.200
this mathematical model,

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.960
will it produce such a result?

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.720
Right?

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.240
If it produces such a result,

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.560
isn't it just to say,

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.440
you can think about it.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.160
Then,

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.320
why did he,

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.240
at the beginning,

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.560
regardless of his state,

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:31.460
regardless of other people's state,

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.380
regardless of Intel's state,

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.100
I will propose a rebate first.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:34.700
What is the reason?

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.900
Because he is worried that,

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:36.300
in the future,

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:37.620
if anyone comes in,

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.740
Intel is just one of them,

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.020
we think of the object,

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:40.780
it may be Samsung,

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.020
it may be Huawei,

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:42.580
or others,

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.220
or Ericsson,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.220
no matter.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.180
These potential investors,

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.940
if his,

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.020
the quality of this modern chip has risen,

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:50.660
then it is possible to produce a price war.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.820
If in our model,

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.860
the situation is like this.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.900
Then, in order to avoid this,

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.380
the loss of the price war,

01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:58.660
then I might as well,

01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:59.700
at one stage,

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:00.560
at the beginning,

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.040
I will receive this rebate from Apple.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.520
In case,

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.000
I am a bit like receiving a security fee,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.680
I am in case,

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.200
in the future,

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.720
if there is a price war,

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.400
at least,

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.160
this,

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.640
this,

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.600
the loss of this profit,

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.360
I can make up for it from the previous rebate.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.440
OK, I provide such a rebate,

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.280
I provide such a rebate to Apple,

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:20.880
in the future,

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.320
Apple will continue to use it,

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:22.600
right?

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.520
Because I provide such a rebate,

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.920
everyone,

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.400
although Apple is very happy,

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.780
is to get one more money,

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.380
but Qualcomm has a little loss,

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.020
but there is no difference,

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:32.340
why?

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.860
My loss today,

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:37.300
I am better than the future big loss.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:40.380
If I have a little loss today,

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.140
but in the future,

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:42.100
if you today,

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.180
suppose we don't say that we can't breach the contract,

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.060
this is because Apple's private breach,

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.180
this is not good.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.140
Tell everyone that private breach is not good.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.500
If Qualcomm,

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.180
if Apple does not violate the contract,

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.200
it will continue to use Qualcomm chips in the future,

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.320
otherwise it will violate the contract,

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:00.920
right?

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.560
In order to allow this thing to continue to occur,

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.920
I will continue to provide rebate to you,

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.320
I provide a little loss to Qualcomm,

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.480
but I can always guard your Apple,

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.560
I don't want Apple to jump to Intel.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.400
At least in the future,

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.520
this price war will not occur,

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.280
right?

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.600
So its logic,

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.840
the overall logic is like this,

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.200
because price war will occur in the future.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.720
In order to avoid

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.900
such a high price war for Apple,

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.540
I might as well be in the first stage,

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.980
when I was in the first stage of the game,

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.340
I would lock you to death,

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:32.420
I would use Bundle Rebate,

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:36.020
I provide this Bundle Rebate Contract to force you to accept,

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:36.900
what are the conditions to accept?

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.500
I just mentioned that you can't jump to Intel,

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.700
then you can't sue me,

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.700
you can't jump to Intel,

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.540
these two conditions,

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:47.140
then you have to pay me such a high power,

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.540
Apple also has a loss,

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.620
in fact, the mathematical model just said,

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.420
that is, it actually has to deduct one,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.800
that is, you have to deduct that Alpha,

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.160
the profit of Apple has to deduct that Alpha,

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.360
OK, then the profit of Qualcomm has to be added to Alpha,

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.200
because that is the Friend Royalty,

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.680
then my Friend Royalty,

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.160
if I charge a higher price,

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.400
conversely,

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.680
first, I charge a higher price,

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.680
I can make up for the future loss,

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.320
second, Qualcomm can also lock your Apple customers,

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.640
so the whole model's implication,

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.240
the core essence is here,

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.420
so to put it simply,

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.660
the essence of this model is here,

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.980
but it's not enough to say that,

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.980
this is just a business perspective,

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:31.780
what other reasons do we think that

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:36.940
Qualcomm can dare to keep doing this Boundary Bait?

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.780
Back to the legal point of view,

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.500
we just talked about this business point of view,

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.420
it is to avoid future losses,

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.380
so I have Boundary Bait here,

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:47.340
I lock Apple,

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:50.540
then collect a very high Friend rate,

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.800
OK, a little higher,

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.600
I don't know how high it is,

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.200
a little higher rate,

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.120
then lock you,

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.400
then for the future loss,

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.280
what about the law?

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.080
In fact, it will be found that the fact,

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.440
the fact of this case,

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.200
that is, the fact of Qualcomm,

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.200
in fact, with the previous six cases,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.960
I will report the conclusion to everyone,

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.880
because I will not talk about the process,

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.560
the conclusion is that

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.640
Qualcomm's case

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.840
is different from the previous six cases,

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.160
OK, they are all different,

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.500
if everyone has some basic common sense

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.740
about American law,

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:27.260
different facts can not be used,

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.260
different facts will be compared,

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.860
compared later found that it is not to be used,

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.700
so that six cases,

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.460
regardless of whether you are legal or illegal,

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.820
can not be used in this case,

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.340
OK, this is a point,

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.060
the second split reasoning create possibility,

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.700
I just said that

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:43.860
there are red and black,

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.500
there are legal and illegal,

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.220
OK, Qualcomm sees this situation,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.760
the court itself has been arguing for a long time,

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.960
you do not know at all,

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.280
you do not know whether it is legal or illegal,

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.800
the legal probability is 50%,

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.600
the illegal probability is also 50%,

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.200
but for business people,

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.280
everyone thinks that

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.560
whether I rush or not,

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.680
of course, rush,

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:02.160
right,

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.320
of course, I care about him,

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.080
anyway, there is a 50% chance that I will win,

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:05.600
right,

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.760
so then plus the previous few cases,

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.400
the facts are different from me,

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.360
then I have to rush,

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.480
because those cases

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.040
may not have anything to do with me,

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.260
OK, so these facts are different,

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:21.460
including the disagreement between the courts,

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.020
resulting in my personal opinion,

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.180
from the point of view of the law,

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:25.940
Qualcomm,

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:28.940
these situations also increased

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:30.740
Qualcomm will continue to execute

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.500
the right-hand man of Fund Rebate,

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.740
from the business,

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:37.340
he said that in order to make up

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.700
or to prevent future losses,

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.780
to the law,

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:45.800
he is not in line with the past cases,

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.120
OK,

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.320
then the reason is not sufficient,

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.440
nor is it consistent,

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.920
so that he has such a

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:51.800
legal right-hand man,

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.840
although there is a legal risk,

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.680
but this risk to him,

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.920
he thinks he can control,

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.880
so we found that

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.680
this problem

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.040
is that there is a business reason,

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.200
there is a legal reason,

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:07.880
OK,

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.740
business is that I have to prepare for the future,

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:12.700
for the future,

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:14.460
the legal reason is that

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.660
those six cases,

01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.620
whether legal or illegal,

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.980
have nothing to do with him,

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.380
because this is my brand new Fund Rebate,

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:20.900
OK,

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.660
then the different point is that

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.820
the first six cases are all

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.220
the combination of products and products,

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.260
what is my product,

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:30.700
what is the combination of patents,

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.300
the first one has nothing to do with me,

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.460
so based on the business and legal reasons,

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.280
they all give me a very strong right-hand man,

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.480
let me continue to execute Fund Rebate,

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.160
even if he may also have a very high

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.360
risk of anti-Thoracic,

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:46.760
OK,

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.160
so this paper is actually basically here,

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.240
of course, when I concluded,

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.040
my paper,

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.680
when we concluded this paper,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.600
I also mentioned one point,

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.240
that is,

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.200
in the end,

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:58.600
this case,

01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.160
because this case,

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.120
if you are interested,

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:00.800
you can check it,

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.040
it is still in progress in the United States,

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.400
there is no conclusion,

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.500
that is,

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.860
this question is actually my graduation,

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.860
the real question of the graduation paper,

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.180
OK,

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.220
if you are interested,

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.820
you can talk to me in private,

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.700
because my graduation paper is from a different point of view,

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.700
then my graduation paper point of view is this question,

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.780
that is,

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.380
the court as such a role,

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.220
if he is judged to be legal,

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.580
his influence on Apple,

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:27.220
what is his influence on the public,

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:31.300
and if it is illegal,

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:31.700
right?

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.700
Then I just mentioned that

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.700
he is a

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.200
law of the jungle,

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.120
he may accidentally go the wrong way,

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.120
it may affect a lot of people,

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:40.240
yes,

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.840
if he is

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.680
very bold in the court,

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.800
what is his influence on the public

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.240
when he is judged to be illegal?

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.760
This is the future study,

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.040
that is,

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:49.640
including my paper,

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.400
I am also doing this thing,

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.360
then this paper is the last stop here,

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:53.880
that is,

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:54.680
if you are interested,

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.560
you are welcome to join in

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.360
and do this kind of research.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:58.640
OK,

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.000
so

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.280
today my

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.240
sharing

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:05.100
is about to end here,

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.460
then

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.940
ah,

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:08.580
OK,

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:09.780
someone asked in the middle of the round,

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.740
so

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:14.340
my sharing is about to end here,

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:15.220
then

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.140
do I have to answer the question first?

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.340
Or

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:20.940
let us

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.420
applaud and thank Louis for today's

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:24.260
in-depth sharing,

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:25.020
thank you,

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.500
do you understand?

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.780
Everyone should understand, right?

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.440
I don't know what everyone's question is,

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.640
I'm very worried,

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.880
I think I want to talk about it,

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.800
you are very lucky,

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.720
because this is my first time talking,

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.960
it should not be the first time,

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.440
it seems a bit too much to say like this,

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.840
my first time sharing something related to my graduate thesis,

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.480
yes,

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.440
the question,

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.840
do I have to answer the question first?

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.120
Or how?

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.280
Louis,

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.040
let me stop recording first,

01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:00.700
then we can start to answer the question,

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:01.500
OK,

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500
no problem,
