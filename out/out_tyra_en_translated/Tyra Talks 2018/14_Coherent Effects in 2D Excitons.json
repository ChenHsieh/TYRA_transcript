{"text": " First of all, I would like to welcome everyone to our Chira Talk on August 4th. We are honored to have Jason Hong, a student from Hong Shi An University, to give a speech on his latest research. Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials. Before we start, let me briefly introduce Jason. Jason graduated from the University of Taiwan in the Department of Physics. He did his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. He is currently working as a postdoc in Michigan. His current field of expertise is the application of super fast light in solid matter. His main research topics include graphene optical sensors, coherent exotonic effects in 2D materials, and cavity exotonic polaroids. In today's talk, he will introduce some basic principles and applications of super fast light. He will use super fast light and light-matter interactions to understand the dynamics of electrons in solid state physics. He will also discuss related research in super fast light and exotonic effects. If there are no further questions, let's welcome Jason to start his talk. Hello everyone. I am very happy to be invited to Chira Talk. Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials. Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials. This is today's outline. In the beginning, I will talk about what super fast light is, the history of super fast light, and a very important technique called pump probe measurement. On the other hand, I will briefly explain what is special about the acetone in the coherent exotonic materials. Finally, I will talk about my recent research. In the coherent exotonic materials, there are not only acetone, but also biacetone effects. I will start with super fast light. The so-called super fast light is actually a super fast phenomenon that uses light to study the extremity of time. Generally speaking, the definition of a super fast phenomenon is the phenomenon between a femtosecond and a picosecond. We call it a super fast phenomenon, but there is no clear definition. Femtosecond is 10 to the power of negative 50 square seconds, and picosecond is 10 to the power of negative 20 square seconds. However, we will briefly introduce the extent of time later. The main reason why we use light to study these super fast phenomena is that there are many super fast phenomena that cannot be observed in other ways. For example, the general method of electrolysis. Everyone knows that electrolysis is basically to charge. The charging time is actually around nanoseconds. For example, the switch speed of these computers is about gigahertz, and gigahertz is about nanoseconds. Even if the electrolysis is done well, the time you can observe is only about nanoseconds. There is no way to do better. If you want to observe these super fast phenomena with a shorter time period, you have to use light. At this time, we have a technique called pump-up technique, and we can use it to observe these super fast phenomena. Basically, in my own concept, light is basically photography, which is the art of capturing light. For example, when we usually shoot small objects, this is called micro light. When we turn a black and white camera into a color camera, what we are actually doing is photography. We can study the reaction of a object to a different amount of light with different energy. This is called photography. The meaning of super fast photography is actually high-speed photography. For example, when we watch TV, when a baseball player throws a ball, he basically uses high-speed photography to do these things. Super fast photography basically uses high-speed photography to the extreme. What is photography? There is a picture here. Basically, photography is that you have a light source, and the light source shines on your object, on your model. The model will reflect light or penetrate light. People don't penetrate light, so this is reflected light. In the end, the reflected light is taken down by the photographer with these cameras. This is called photography. Sometimes you need something else. For example, you need another assistant to remind your model to remember to smile. When you add all these things together, this is called photography. When it comes to super fast photography, I have to talk about the interesting history. A long time ago, people had a question. When a horse is running, is it possible that when the horse is running, the four legs will float in the air for a moment? It may not seem like a problem now, but you may think it's not useful at all. This was in the 1870s. These people were very passionate about racing horses. This was a very interesting question at the time. People wanted to know how the horse ran. But you can't see it with your eyes. You can't record it and tell everyone how the horse ran. At that time, there was a man named Leland Stanford. He was the governor of California. He thought that when the horse was running, the four legs might float in the air for a moment. But no one believed him. Leland Stanford was very rich. He asked Edwin Muybridge, who was a photographer, to research how to capture these fast things. He gave him a $25,000 research fund. I think it was a huge amount of money at the time. After several years of hard work, Muybridge invented the shutter. The picture on the left is the shutter he invented. Basically, it's a few boards. He used a mechanical method to make the board fall. When the board falls, it blocks the light. When the light does not pass, it means that the camera will not continue to expose the light. The shutter speed can be up to 500 microseconds. This is where he did the experiment. Basically, it's a racecourse. The horse will run from here to here. There are 24 cameras. Each camera has a shutter. When the horse runs like this, it will take pictures like this. Then he got a picture like this. Basically, you can see that there are 12 pictures here. This is the continuous process of the horse running. You can see that these two pictures clearly show that the horse's four legs are in the air. But it's definitely not like the picture above. This is a very wrong concept. When the horse is in the air, it's definitely not the state of the legs. It's probably the situation where the legs are shrunk. This is an interesting story. In that era of super fast light, the method was to take a light source and take a picture of the object you wanted to take. How do we choose which time to take a picture? Use a mechanical shutter. The shutter switch is very fast. At this time, we can take a picture that is short in time. But everyone found that the mechanical shutter has a limit. Basically, you can't do it faster than microseconds. The next time is nanosecond. How to enter this nanosecond? An important invention is the light bulb. The light bulb was invented in 1880. So it was before Moonbridge. What is a light bulb? Light is produced by electricity. Of course, ordinary light bulbs can't do this. But the next invention is this. We can use electricity to produce light. So we can adjust this electricity. The light we produce is a form of pulse. You can turn on this light at a certain time and turn off this light at another time. You can use this pulse to hit your object. When the object is reflected back to the camera, you just need to turn off the shutter when the pulse stops. In this way, you can measure the time it takes for the pulse to stop. This method is called frequency-shift observation. The main concept is that we can't quickly adjust the shutter of the camera. So we change it to adjust the light source. Here are some photos of stroboscopes. This is basically what you see in many photo studios. On the left is a woman waving a golf club. This speed is also very fast. Basically, every frame is your flashlight hitting the woman. Then it reflects back and you take a picture. At the next moment, the next pulse hits the woman and you take another picture. This inventor is a professor at MIT named Edgerton. He has a nickname called Papa Flash. Basically, Flash is Flashlight. It's the light source you need for frequency-shift observation. This method was invented in 1931. The picture on the right is an example. You can use this method to take a picture of the state of the bullet in the air. We use frequency-shift observation to reach the level of nanoseconds. How do we get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds? The first thing is why we are particularly interested in picoseconds and femtoseconds. It's because there are many physical phenomena that occur at this time. For example, phonon vibration. The vibration of the metal in this material is actually at the level of picoseconds. There are also a lot of electrons in this material. The events of activation and relaxation are actually at the level of femtoseconds. This is why we want to get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds. The main discovery that can break through nanoseconds is the discovery of magnetic laser. Laser is basically a game media. When the light passes through the game media, the light becomes stronger because of the feedback of the game media. If you put the light in an optical cavity, The optical cavity is basically made up of two high-reflection mirrors. At this time, it becomes a laser. Of course, we want the laser to output, so we use a semi-transparent mirror on one side to let the laser pass through. At this time, you have a laser. Another interesting thing is that when you have a cavity, What frequency of light can become a laser? The important thing is that when the light passes through the cavity, How to make it a coherent line? The condition is that when the light passes through the cavity, the light-returned phase is the same. This is the condition. We can convert it to frequency. At this time, you can see that the allowed optical mode is actually a positive integer. Multiply by c divided by 2L, where L is the length of the optical cavity. I have a question. What kind of material is the game media? There are many kinds of game media. We can see all kinds of lasers on the market. For example, there are semi-transparent lasers, CO2 lasers, and hydrogen peroxide lasers. These are the game media. Semi-transparent lasers are used as game media. CO2 lasers are used as game media. There are all kinds of game media. As long as there are four lasers, there are two conditions. The first condition is that there should be game media. The second condition is that there should be an optical cavity. All lasers are indispensable. There are many ways to do it. Can you give more details about the output coupler? What is its main function? Does it allow light to pass through? The output coupler is actually a mirror. It's just a semi-transparent mirror. The first thing is that when the light travels through the cavity, the gain should be greater than the loss. The reflection rate should not be too low. If the reflection rate is too low, the loss will be too high. The gain should be greater than the loss. The output coupler can also leak some light. This creates a laser that can be used. It means that half of the light can pass through the cavity. This is the basic structure of a laser. The current laser looks completely different from this one. You can still point out what is game media, what is mirror, and what is its cavity. The frequency of light that can be allowed is the frequency mode of the equality space. Let's see what happens. The picture above is a simulation of an optical mode in the cavity. This is the output of the laser. There is only one mode now. The difference between the two modes is c divided by 2L. You can see that the frequency of red and green are slightly different. If we add these two modes together, you can see that there is a beating effect. You can see that there is something that looks like a pulse. When there are four modes, this is more obvious. These four modes are c divided by 2L. You can see that the pulse of the output of the laser is more obvious. Now we can keep adding until there are 30 modes. You can see that there is a very obvious pulse here. The general ultrafast laser has hundreds or thousands of modes. This will make the pulse very obvious. Another thing is why this thing is called a lock mode laser. This is because when you add a lot of modes, there is a condition that their phase must be fixed. Then these pulses will be formed. This blue line above means that when the phase of these modes is locked, you will see that there is a pulse. However, when each optical mode has a different phase, when they have a random phase, you will see that this is probably a general CW laser. The invention of lock mode laser is surprising. The invention of lock mode laser was in the 1960s. It was Charles Townes. They made Mesa or something. The first invention of lock mode laser was in 1965. Five years after the invention of lock mode laser, everyone has already discovered this lock mode laser. After a period of time, everyone tried to shorten the pulse of the laser. In 1980, a method called CPA was invented. It's called True Pulse Amplification. Basically, it stretches the laser pulse, amplifies it, and compresses it. At that time, it took about 6 femtoseconds to make a die laser. It was in 1985. Another technology was invented. It's called Tie Sapphire. It just changes the laser gain media. There are many reasons why Tie Sapphire is good. Basically, it is a semiconductor laser. At that time, the technology of Tie Sapphire made rapid progress. In 2000, it took about 4 femtoseconds. This is equivalent to a light oscillation. A light in a visible oscillation. This is a limit. There is no way to continue. The application of lock mode laser is very wide. The first application is to use the laser's pulse. It can be used for a short time. Basically, it uses rapid pulses to study atomic physics, solid physics, chemical reactions, and so on. It can also be used for light communication and higher harmonic generation. Another direction is because the pulse laser collects energy that does not have a pulse time in the time that there is a pulse. This means that in the pulse time, the laser beam will be very strong. Generally, you can get the power to 10 to the power of 8 or 10 to the power of 4. This can be used to do a lot of interesting things. If you have super strong light sources, you can use it to do non-linear light studies. Recently, some people want to do nuclear fusion. There are also laser cutting or cosmetic surgery. You can see that the picture on the right is basically the laser's peak power. It is the laser beam within the pulse time. It is also a very fast-growing laser. It can now reach the power of 1 terawatt. Of course, you can use the laser as a light source. Because the pulse time is very short, you should be able to take very short pictures. But there is a problem here. The time is too short to figure out how to trigger an event. How do you know when the event will happen? If you don't know when it will happen, you can't take pictures at all. So the next question is how to find the event you want. The general approach is like this. The picture on the right. We are using a pulse laser. It will emit a pulse. The red dot is a pulse. When the red dot reaches the beam splitter, the pulse will be divided into two parts. One part will go through the pump beam. The other part will go through the pull beam. The pump beam will hit the sample first. The pump beam will hit the sample first. After the pump beam hits the sample, the pull beam will pass the sample and reach the detector. What is the purpose of doing this? We use pump beam to trigger the sample, such as electrons or electrons. Anyway, no matter what we do, we generate an event. After a while, we use pull beam to observe the event. Another thing you can do is to adjust the time difference between the pull beam and pump beam. You can adjust the time difference between the pull beam and pump beam. You will put the pull beam on a delay stage. When you adjust the delay stage, the pull beam will start to change. Then you can see the evolution of the event over time. For example, this is a pump probe measurement on a pull beam. This is how it works. Basically, a pull beam with a wavelength of 800 nm hits the sample. Then you use a wavelength of 100 nm as a probe. When the probe passes the sample, you use the detector to observe the pull beam. To simplify it into a dynamic picture, it looks like this. First, you use the pump beam to stimulate the electron. When the electron decays for a while, you use the pull beam to observe the graphene absorption under the current situation. The experimental picture looks like this. When the time is zero, the pump beam and the pull beam are in synch. This is when you get the biggest reaction. As time goes by, the electron slowly relaxes and decays back to its original state. I have a question. Sorry. Why does the curve have a different direction? This is the experimental detail. Okay. This is not what I want to talk about. But this is an interesting thing. This is what the paper discusses. The blue line is graphene in charge neutral, which means it is not doping. You can see this. This should be the absorption increase. I can tell you that this line represents the absorption increase. It means that when you hit an optical beam to stimulate the electron, you will produce more carriers, resulting in a higher conductivity of graphene. When the conductivity increases, the absorption increases. The red line is graphene in doping state. Why is it negative? It means that the absorption is decreasing. The reason is that when you hit an optical beam, you will increase the temperature of the electron. When the temperature of the electron increases, the conductivity will decrease. Because it has more scattering. When the conductivity decreases, the absorption decreases. Do you mean that it will produce photons? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Basically, this means that there are a lot of things to study in the super fast speed. Very interesting. Thank you. Please go on. On the other hand, I want to talk about the two-dimensional semiconductor. The first two-dimensional material discovered is graphene. As you know, graphene is made by the method of exfoliation. Basically, you take a tape and put the graphite on it. Then you stick the tape on the substrate and tear it up. Then you will find that there is a layer of graphene on the substrate. It looks like this. Then you look under the microscope and you can find these only one-dimensional flakes. This is the band structure of graphene. Another thing is this is the band structure of graphene. There are two Dirac cones. There are two different Dirac cones. The reason for these two cones is that graphene has inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry. As a result, this conduction band and valence band will always have a intersection point. Basically, this thing means that graphene is always a metal. It is always a metal. Metal is often bad and can't do what we want to do. Another thing is because it has two different values, there is another degree of freedom called pseudo-spin degree of freedom. This means that you can put these messages on these two different values. If you can manipulate this value, you can treat it as 0 and 1. For example, 0 is the k-value and 1 is the negative k-value. The advantage of this thing is that we used to use Electron's degree of freedom to make computers. Basically, the current computer uses charge. When you turn on the transistor, the charge will flow. When you turn off the transistor, the charge will not flow. One of the things we want to do in the future is to use spin. When you turn on a switch, the spin-up electrons can pass and the spin-down electrons cannot pass. There is a proposal that we can also use Electron's degree of freedom in the k-value or negative k-value as 0 or 1. However, the first thing is that metal cannot do anything. We have to find a way to open a gap. This is a saying. We want to find a semiconductor. One of the semiconductors is called Transition Metal Dichotronate. Basically, its lattice is similar to graphene. One of its atoms is transition metal, which is probably Mo or tungsten. The other atom site is sulfur or selenium. At this time, you will find that this lattice structure does not have inversion symmetry. You can't find a point where the inversion symmetry returns to its original state. This means that it will open a gap. It turns out that the basic structure of this lattice structure looks like this. It has a gap. There is no state in the middle. This is a gap. However, it still has k and negative k-value. You can still use it to make valetronics. However, you still have a semiconductor. Because you have a semiconductor, you can still study electrons. Sometimes, you can study electrons. Sometimes, you can reduce Fermi energy. Fermi energy is in the middle. At the same time, electrons and holes form acetone. Acetone is a particle where electrons and holes form. These properties lead to Transition Metal Dichotomy. Transition Metal Dichotomy is one of the popular research topics. We hope to use it to make valetronics or other optoelectronics. Our question is that we are using valetronics to make valetronics. Another interesting thing about valetronics is that we mentioned acetone. Acetone is an electron and a hole. You can imagine that an electron and a hole have coolant in them. They are heterogeneous. That's why they are heterogeneous. When they are bound together, they release their energy. That's why their energy is a little bit low. How much energy do they release? It depends on how strong the electric field between them is. In the three-dimensional semiconductor, there is a hole and an electron. Because of this, the electric field goes through many other backgrounds. These backgrounds cause the electric field to go down. The coolant interaction between them is not very strong. The binding energy goes down. In the two-dimensional material, you will find that the electric field between them is in the air. In the air, the electric field is not screened. After the electron and hole are bound together, a very good acetone is formed. This is one of the reasons why people want to study acetone. Acetone is similar to the concept of hydrogen. You may have found acetone in Galileo Arsenal. Basically, this is basically an electron and a hole. They are not bound together. They have a continuum. The continuum is here. Under this continuum, you will have the electron and hole's bound state. They have 1s, 2s, 3s, just like the hydrogen atom. Under this spectrum, you will see the spectrum of 1s, 2s, 3s. In the Transition Metal Dichotomy, there is the same thing. However, the effect is very strong. You can see the energy scale in the left picture. The binding energy is about 3-4 MeV. In the Transition Metal Dichotomy, we can't even see the continuum. The reasonable prediction is that the binding energy is about 300 MeV. You can only see the first state and the second state. The next question is that you have these values and these acetones. What is the question? The question we want to ask is whether we can break the value degeneracy We just mentioned the value degeneracy. We just mentioned the value. However, the energy of these two values is exactly the same. So, the question is that if you store the information in the value, but you don't touch the energy of the value, the information will not change. The final result is the same information. This is basically meaningless. What we want to do now is that if you have a way to store the information in these values, if you use some methods to change the energy of the acetone, then you can read the final result. The final result will be changed. Depending on the energy of the value, the information will change. This is called manipulation. One of the ways is to use the magnetic field. Using the magnetic field, you can pull the energy of the value on one side up and the energy on the other side down. Then you will see that the red line and the blue line represent two values. When the magnetic field is zero, the two values are exactly the same. When you add a strong magnetic field, the energy of the two values will be slightly separated. At this time, you can use the magnetic field to do valetronics. Another thing is that we want to ask whether light can do valetronics. Another thing is that in the valetronics, the acetone has very strong valence. Will the valence affect the behavior of the machine? The reason why I ask this question is that we have found similar things in Galen-Arsenal. In Galen-Arsenal, you will have various free electrons and holes. It is called plasma. Then you will have some acetone. When the density of acetone is high enough, biacetone will appear. Biacetone is two acetone bonds together. It is a bit like a hydrogen atom. When you have more density, it will form a droplet atom. There are many acetone bonds. These biacetone quasiparticles also have some applications. In Galen-Arsenal's quantum darts, you can use these biacetones to make entangled photons. You can also use optical control to change the behavior of acetone. Next, I want to answer two questions. The first question is... Sorry, I have a question. Can we go back to the last page? You just said that if you want to break the valley degeneracy, let's say your sample is molybdenum sulfide. If you want to break the degeneracy, if I am an alloy or some doping, will it break the degeneracy? If the material is not... OK. If you want to break the valley degeneracy, there is a symmetry condition. The symmetry condition for the valley degeneracy is time-reversal symmetry. If your material has time-reversal symmetry, it will have valley degeneracy. Then, time-reversal symmetry will break the time-reversal symmetry. For doping, it is not exactly break. Doping is not. Doping is not. So, apart from the magnetic field, do you know any other factors? Light. Is that all? If so... I don't think so. And the current. The current is... If the current is long, it will break the time-reversal symmetry. So, if it has a lot of charge, the current... The current is... The current is flowing. So, for example, when you are measuring, if you apply a bias to it, it may... This will slightly break. This is the valley hole effect. OK. Thank you. You can continue. OK. The answer to the first question is yes. But this thing is about optical stock effect. Now, let's look at a very simple model. You have a... a... a material. It has a state. It has a black state called state A. It has a red state called state B. At this time, if you apply a light, it is non-resonant. Then we control the light's frequency under the AB resonance. Its energy will be under this. At this time, state A will produce a virtual state under state B. state B will also produce a virtual state above state A. If you consider these dipole interactions, if you consider the two corresponding states, these two states will repel each other. Usually, if you write a matrix, you add... The matrix's cross-section represents two energies. The off-diagonal represents two... represents their interactions. If you turn on the interactions, these two energies will be separated. The following is the same. At this time, you will find that the red state will move up and the black state will move down. When you apply light, the transition from black to red will increase its energy. It will blue shift. The quantity of the blue shift will be determined by this formula. Basically, this formula tells you that it is equal to how strong the light is. It is equal to detuning. Detuning is the energy difference between the AB resonance and the light. This is called detuning. However, there is one thing. If you take these things into numbers, you will find that this change is very small. Therefore, it is true that you can use light to change the energy of the machine, to change the energy of the acetone. However, because this change is too small, you need to adjust the intensity very, very strongly. The intensity of light is very, very strong. Therefore, at this time, you need to sell the laser to do this thing. Of course, someone has done this before. You can see that this paper was published in 1986. This is basically demonstrating the optical star effect on the gallium arsenide. Basically, you take a piece of gallium arsenide quantum well. The pump is 806 nm. Its energy is lower than the energy of acetone. Then, you use another beam of light, which is a probe. Its function is to see if your spectrum is changing when the pump is on. You can see that here at negative 2 picoseconds, negative 2 picoseconds is this line. Negative 2 picoseconds means that when you hit the probe, your pump hasn't come yet. Therefore, its original spectrum is two peaks. One is heavy acetone. The other is light acetone. This is acetone in gallium arsenide. When it's 0 picoseconds, it means that the pump and the probe are hitting the sample at the same time. You can see that the resonance of acetone is getting smaller. The resonance of acetone is getting smaller. It means that its energy is getting bigger. When you turn off the pump, when the pump is at 1.2 picoseconds, the resonance of acetone moves back. This is an interesting effect. When you hit the pump, when you hit the pump, the resonance of acetone moves slightly. When you turn off the pump, the resonance of acetone moves back. What's the situation in Transition Metal Dichotomy? The interesting thing is that in Transition Metal Dichotomy, the two values correspond to different helicity. We can use the left and right to distinguish the two values. What we can do is this. We choose the left light. It only couples to K-value. Of course, we need a light which is less than the resonance of acetone. When there is light, the resonance of acetone will slightly blue-shift. If we send a probe of the left light, we will see a blue-shift. If we send a probe of the right light, the resonance of acetone will slightly blue-shift. By using this method, we can break the VAD degeneracy. Let's try to see if it's right. This is our sample. We choose to use Moebillion Dicillinide as our sample. We have encapsulated Moebillion Dicillinide in these two H-BNs. It's in boron nitride. The reason why we do this is that there is a study that says in boron nitride, the quality of Moebillion Dicillinide is very good. This is the reason why we do this. Do we need low temperature in this kind of measurement? Or can we use room temperature? You mean in this kind of measurement? Yes, in room temperature. We can see this kind of phenomenon in room temperature. But some of them are invisible. Some of the things we want to see are invisible. But if it's Moebillion Dicillinide, we can see it in room temperature. Yes. I don't know much about this. I don't know much about this. I don't know much about this. I don't know much about this. I don't know much about this. There is an important thing here. The light we emit is always lower than the energy of acetone. So the light won't be absorbed by the material. It will pass through the material. So there will be no phonon. This is a very important question. Thank you. This is the reflectivity of this sample. Basically, the reflectivity is the absorption. This is Moebillion Dicillinide in room temperature. When we lower it to low temperature, the peak becomes narrower. The intensity of the peak becomes larger. The width of the peak is about 5 MeV. Compared to before, we didn't use boronitride encapsulation or CVD sample. CVD sample has a line width of about 30 MeV. The sample without encapsulation is about 10 MeV. We only have 5 MeV in this sample. This means that the quality of the sample is very good. Another interesting thing is that we can see the absorption from 30 MeV to very large. We can even make it 100% absorption. There are other interesting questions. But I won't talk about it today. You can discuss it if you are interested. I have a question. Have you compared CVD sample with exfoliated sample? Have you measured the result? The quality? Yes. We have compared. Is exfoliated sample better? Yes. Much better. Much better means if we measure absorption or PL, the line width of CVD sample is about 5-10 MeV. But CVD sample is about 30 MeV. Is it because of defects? Yes. The reason is that in CVD sample, there are many inhomogeneous broadening. The source of inhomogeneous broadening is the defects. Yes. Thank you. This is pump probe setup. This is a sample. On the left, there is a laser. We divide it into two parts. One part is called pump. Pump Because the laser has a wide bandwidth, we use a spectrometer to divide the light. We only take about 2 MeV and put the pump on the sample. The other half of the light is called probe. We run it to a delay stage and put it on a sapphire. The function of sapphire is to make the probe light produce nonlinear effect. It will become basically the color of the light will change. It will become the light of broadband. The light of broadband can be put on the sample and used to study the sample. Finally, we put the probe light into a spectrometer to divide the light and put it on the detector. Basically, on the right, we use a picosecond laser light. It has a very sharp light, and we put it on the sample. At the same time, we send a probe with many colors. The probe is very short, and we put it on the sample to study what we want to study. The result is like this. First, look at the middle picture. In the middle picture, the x-axis is the delay, which is the time between the probe and the pump. Then, the y-axis is the delay, and the x-axis is the energy, which is the energy of the probe light. Then, we see the difference between the pump and the non-pump. Let me explain the meaning of this picture. The first thing is that all the effects occur within negative 1 to 1 picosecond. This means that only the pump light has this effect, and only the non-pump light has this effect. This means that it is a coherent effect, which is basically what we want to see. If you draw a line within 0 picosecond, you will get this. Basically, when the pump and the pump probe are combined, the reflectivity changes. We also have the normal reflectivity of the sample. We can measure the reflectivity of the sample when there is no pump. Basically, when there is a pump, the reflectivity increases in the red part, and the reflectivity decreases in the blue part. Basically, it is a shift. In the red part, the reflectivity increases, and in the blue part, the reflectivity decreases. This means that the peak is a blue shift. To draw a picture, we use a ready-tuner light, a sigma plus light, and we probe the k-value. At this time, the energy of the k-value is blue shifted. This is what the picture tells us. The other thing is that we have done this before. This is our group in Berkeley. There is another group in MIT. They have actually done this before. This measurement shows that when the intensity of the pump is very high, the blue shift is about 3 MeV. This means that this 3 MeV is already... We talked about using magnetic field to break the value degeneracy. If you want the energy to change 3 MeV, you need to add 60 Tesla's magnetic field. This is basically impossible. In the world, it is impossible to do 60 Tesla's. However, we can find that we can indeed break the value degeneracy and make the energy shift very large. However, the previous research showed that the k' value is not a couple. Therefore, it has no effect. However, we found that the k' value has some strange effects. The k' value curve is the opposite of the k' value curve. This means that this is a redshift. When we add the k' value, the k' value is redshifted. The next thing we want to know is what happened. What happened? OK. In addition to this, we can also do one more thing. We can change the energy of the reflected light. Just now, we showed that the detuning value is about 50. It is like this. The omega x is about 50 Mv. We can see a redshift. However, when we increase the photon energy of the pump light, the detuning value will decrease. We can see that the peak becomes splitting. If we adjust the photon energy very close to the resonance of acetone, we will find that the curve is completely reversed. It is a blueshift. What does this mean? In fact, when you see a blueshift from a redshift, the first thought is is this a new resonance? Next, we will ask how to explain this phenomenon. Let's go back to the beginning. At the beginning, we said that you have a light state k' acetone. When you add a sigma plus light, you will change k' acetone to redshift. k' acetone to blueshift. Therefore, when you send a sigma plus light, it will be a blueshift. However, there is a problem. Why? In theory, your light state will also be a blueshift. This means that your k' acetone will also be a blueshift. Why didn't anyone notice this? This is actually a wrong picture. In fact, when we are considering the Arpio Stark effect, in addition to considering the light state and the k' acetone, we also need to consider more states. For example, this is a two-acetone state. Basically, after you excite an acetone, you can still excite another acetone. If you add a sigma plus light, you will have a k' acetone. You will have an acetone in k' value. However, if you add a sigma plus light, you can have two acetones in k' value. You can also add a sigma plus light and a sigma minus light. You will have an acetone in k' value. You will also have an acetone in k' value. You can also have an acetone in k' value and k' value. These states are actually in your transition. They all need to be considered. If you consider this way, you will find that the energy of k' acetone does not change. Because you have a ground state that affects it. However, you have a two-acetone state that pushes it down. It will actually stay at a fixed energy. However, your ground state will move down if you have a two-acetone state. At this time, you will find that if you add a sigma minus light, the degree of downshift is the same. Therefore, you will get a sigma that should not change. The next question is that in addition to these states, we know that there is another state called biacetone. As I just explained, biacetone is the interaction between two acetones to generate a bounding energy. This bounding energy will push the energy of the state down. This state will also affect the k' value. We claim that the experimental results we see are from these biacetones. How do we explain this? Let's go back to the experimental data. We can see that this is the dependence of detuning. From left to right, it is redshift to blueshift. In redshift, the photon energy is very small. The photon energy is relatively small. Therefore, the pump will have this effect in addition to this effect. This effect will cause a virtual state above the k' value. This will push the energy of the k' value down. This will cause a redshift in the probe value. When you move the photon energy of the pump very close to the acetone, the virtual state generated by the biacetone will be below the k' value. If it is below the k' value, it will move the acetone state of the k' value up. At this time, we will see a blueshift. This is how we explain our data. In the middle, the photon energy matches the transition of the biacetone and acetone. When these two energy matches, the state will split. We can see that this is a split. According to this method, we can determine the difference between the two acetone states and the energy of the biacetone state. The energy difference is the binding energy. According to the detuning result, the binding energy of the biacetone state is about 20 MeV. This is similar to the effect of the biacetone on TMDC. These effects are consistent. The last thing we do is to write the theory of effective state. We are experimental scientists, so we can't write the complete theory. However, we try to write the interaction of all these states. Basically, we only consider the transition from ground state to k' value. The state related to ground state will change the k' value and the ground state. This is a 2x2 prediction. The state related to k' value is related to free acetone and biacetone state. This is a 3x3 prediction. If you solve this 3x3 prediction, you will get this prediction. The picture on the left is our experiment. As you can see, the experiment is very consistent with the theory. I want to emphasize that this is an effective theory. Many things are fitting. If there is a theory, I hope this theory can help us figure out how these parameters come from. This may involve many-body theory. This is the conclusion. Today, I talked about the history of super-fast light theory and the technique of pump-off. I also showed you the effect of acetone in the two-dimensional semiconductor. The value of valetronics is the value of valetronics. In the end, we demonstrated that we can use light to adjust the value of valetronics. We can also use our sample to observe the effect of valetronics. What's left is what we didn't talk about today. I'm currently doing research on ultrafast optics. I'm still studying 2D material. I'm doing photon-echo spectroscopy. Another interesting thing is the optical star effect. It's a photon-dressed acetone, but it's very weakly dressed. There are other ways to place the semiconductor in a optical chamber. If you make the chamber very small, you can strongly couple the photon with the acetone. This is called acetone-polaroton. This is my recent research in Michigan. I hope you can see the effect of acetone-polaroton. We also did some applications. One of the concepts is that we can use graphene. Basically, if you add voltage to graphene, the absorption of graphene will change. We can use this method to make optical sensors. One of the things we've been doing recently is placing neuron cells on graphene. Neuron cells emit electrical signals. Is it using love to emit electricity? What? What does it mean? Is it using love to emit electricity? That's right. In our experiment, we used the heart of a chicken. But the heart of a chicken doesn't look good on the picture. Basically, we just put some electrical signals on it. Basically, you need to study your heart cells or neurons. Neurons use electricity to send signals. When these electrical signals send signals, they also change the absorption of graphene. If we turn on the light, we can see if the neuron is emitting electricity. Using this method, we can detect the signal of the brain cells. This is an application for biophysics. These are my main collaborators. In Ann Arbor, Hui Deng is my boss. In UC Berkeley, Wang Feng. We worked together to create the Artifical Star Effect. Thank you. Thank you, Joseph. Do you have any questions? Yes. I just asked some questions. Wang, do you have any questions? I have a question. You can go back to the previous slide with sigma plus and sigma minus of the pump probe. On resonance, you can see the X-split. In the middle graph, the two states of the split-up have a parity difference. In theory, in this quantum optically split state, the parity difference should be different by the selection rule. These two states should not... We wrote effective theory, but according to effective theory, there should be no change. The reason is basically this is sigma plus from here to here. But when you add up the up-do-step effect, the remaining is still sigma plus. So basically these two states should not change for this state. This is my understanding. But of course, in reality, we didn't do this experiment. If you probe with sigma plus, you will... This experiment is not easy. It's not easy because if you send a probe with sigma plus, the most important effect will be from ground state to k-value. This is just a very small change. So of course, it's possible to do this experiment, but I'm not sure if I can see the significant effect. Thank you. Because today's time is a little over. So we'll stop here today. I'll pause the recording for now.
