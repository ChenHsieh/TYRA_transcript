00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am honored to be able to introduce Dr. Sun today.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Dr. Sun completed her bachelor's degree from 1999 to 2013

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Taiwan University.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After completing her bachelor's degree from 2003 to 2005,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
she completed her master's degree in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the same university in Taiwan.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
She then completed her Ph.D. degree from 2005 to 2010 at Purdue University.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Her major is Chemical Biology.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
After completing her Ph.D. degree, she went to MIT to do her postdoc.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
After four years, she went to UCSF to do her second postdoc and assistant researcher.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This year, she started her new job as a Senior Scientific Researcher at Genentech.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Today, Dr. Sun is going to talk about

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Use Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Tackle Complex Biology.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now, let's welcome Dr. Sun to give her presentation.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Sun.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry, my voice is a bit hoarse due to my cold.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today, I am going to talk in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Just in case, some of you may not have a background in biology.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I hope you can at least learn about Single-Cell RNA-Seq.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here is my personal email and LinkedIn account.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Although my LinkedIn account is not up to date,

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
please feel free to connect with me.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will be speaking in Chinese today,

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but I am not sure what the term is in Chinese.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want to make it too complicated.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will be focusing on technology.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am currently working at a company,

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so I can't really talk about research projects here.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will try my best to talk about the applications of this technology,

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and the principles behind it.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I hope this will be helpful to those who are interested.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Before we get into the technology,

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will briefly review the biology of NTU.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As you may already know, our body is made up of cells.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Many cells form organs,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and eventually form organs in our body,

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
becoming a functional human body.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
An interesting fact is that our body is composed of over 20 different types of cells.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can see that their forms and functions are very different.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For example, there are nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells,

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and even different types of cells in different organs.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Their functions and forms are very different.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's take a deeper look.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As you can see, our body is made up of cells.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Each cell has a nucleus,

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is a red dot.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In English, it's called a nucleus.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In Chinese, it's called a cell nucleus.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In this cell nucleus, there is a chromosome.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This chromosome is made up of our genes.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think everyone has a concept of genes.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Genes are our genetic material.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Genes are our genetic material.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They are our genetic material.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Genes are our genetic material.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Genes are our genetic material.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In this definition, genes are a DNA segment.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
They can be converted into a useful molecule.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They can perform the functions and functions that they need.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The reason for the general description of gene code is that DNA is a so-called ATCG.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
DNA is a so-called ATCG.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, if we talk about genes,

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
the sequence obtained may be composed of these four ATCGs.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is our so-called gene code.

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In molecular biology, there is a so-called central dogma.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The principle is that we have this genetic material.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Its main structure is DNA.

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It will be transcribed into RNA.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
RNA will be further transcribed into protein.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This protein can perform various biological functions.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
As time goes by, the central dogma is gradually extended to more different forms.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We can even find more different directions from the virus or other systems.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Today's technology involves a discovery.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In the past, we thought that DNA was transcribed into RNA.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But later, scientists found another enzyme that can reverse transcribe RNA back to DNA.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:03,000
With the help of this enzyme, many related extension technologies can be built on this basis.

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Today, we will mainly talk about RNA-seq.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Another way to talk about it is transcriptional analysis or gene expression profiling.

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Basically, we can use gene expression to understand human physiology.

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This picture shows a major timeline and milestone in molecular biology and sequencing technology.

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
As many of you know, the first discovery was in 1953.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In 1977, Sanger's DNA sequencing was developed.

84
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Later, PCR technology was also developed.

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
PCR technology allows us to rapidly increase our DNA in the laboratory.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Many related technologies can be built on this basis.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In 1990, the Human Genome Project was launched.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
After 13 years, the Human Genome Project was established.

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
At this stage, sequencing costs are still very high.

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It is difficult to operate a sequencing project in a lab.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In 2005, the next-generation sequencing technology was introduced.

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This technology has greatly reduced the cost of sequencing.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The next-generation sequencing technology is still widely used.

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In recent years, the third-generation sequencing technology was introduced.

95
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When was single-cell RNA-seq developed?

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The first report on single-cell RNA-seq was made in 2009.

97
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Because of the gradual maturation of the technology,

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
especially the rapid reduction of sequencing costs,

99
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
single-cell RNA-seq can be operated more widely.

100
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now, many extended protocols, technologies, and companies continue to develop rapidly in this field.

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why do we need to do single-cell RNA-seq?

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Before single-cell RNA-seq, we can look at gene profiling.

103
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, what is the difference between a cancer cell and a normal cell?

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
For example, we have a healthy sample and a diseased sample.

105
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:45,000
After sequencing, we can compare the gene profiling of these two cells.

106
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Then we can find out the disease gene.

107
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Or we can find out which signaling pathway is further activated or inhibited.

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But there is a problem.

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
For example, a tumor may contain a variety of different cells.

110
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There may be immune cells, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and so on.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If the tumor is broken down and the RNA-seq is obtained,

112
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the result is a variety of different cells.

113
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
From this heat map,

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
we can still see that some genes are inhibited or activated in the diseased sample.

115
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It is difficult to determine if the disease is caused by immune cells, fibroblasts, or unknown gene cells.

116
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
At this time, if we can do transcriptome profiling at single-cell resolution,

117
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:17,000
we can have a deeper understanding of each cell in a tumor tissue.

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Here are some interesting graphs that I saw on the Internet.

119
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It can give you an idea of why the so-called Bok analysis may cause some misjudgment.

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
For example, in this graph,

121
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
each point here has the so-called x-value and y-value.

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then you can do various calculations.

123
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
For example, the x-value is like this,

124
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the y-value is like this,

125
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the x-deviation is like this,

126
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and the y-deviation is like this.

127
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But even if you calculate all these values,

128
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
what about the relationship between x and y?

129
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So if you just do a Bok analysis,

130
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you may not be able to express the so-called structure behind it.

131
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Another interesting graph is that

132
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
sometimes if you do a Bok analysis,

133
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
you may get a conclusion that leads you to a wrong direction.

134
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
For example, suppose this is your sample.

135
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So your sample contains a lot of different animals.

136
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Then you do a Bok analysis to see what this creature might look like.

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Then you may come to a conclusion that this is what this creature should look like.

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Then you will find that it is very different from the so-called real state.

139
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The so-called single-celled analysis basically has different methods.

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That is to say, under this technology,

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you can analyze each animal separately

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and find a lot of different features.

143
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then based on the features you find,

144
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
you start to do the so-called clustering.

145
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
For example, this graph shows that

146
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you have already found two features.

147
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
One is Firm and the other is Venom.

148
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Then even if you just add two features like this,

149
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you can already cluster a lot of animals into at least two subsets.

150
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
One big subset will be the snakes,

151
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
which has the Venom but doesn't have Firm.

152
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then the other big subset may be the so-called

153
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
it doesn't have Venom, but it has Firm.

154
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
When you can add more and more features,

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
hopefully, finally, you will be able to

156
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
one individual item will be clustered into one group.

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So this is the whole idea about why you need to do profiling at a single-cell level.

158
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then generally in this single-cell field,

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
one of their favorite metaphors is

160
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the so-called fruit smoothie and the so-called fruit salad.

161
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
When you make a Borg RNC asset,

162
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
it's very similar to the so-called fruit smoothie.

163
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Basically, you put all kinds of fruit and vegetables together.

164
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The taste you drink is basically

165
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
an average taste of all ingredients.

166
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So you may not be able to know

167
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
what ingredients are in this.

168
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then maybe the ingredients you taste

169
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
are some special strong ingredients.

170
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Maybe it's an apple, maybe it's a strawberry.

171
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But you can't know that

172
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
maybe there's some cabbage in it or something else.

173
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Single-cell is like you're eating a fruit salad.

174
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Basically, you can taste each individual piece of the fruit.

175
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So somehow you'll know

176
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
what kind of composition the fruit should be made of.

177
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So this so-called fruit smoothie to the fruit salad,

178
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
basically what single-cell RNC wants to achieve

179
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
is that you can show the individual cell type

180
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
that causes the biological response or disease.

181
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Then this summary is a more scientific statement.

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So basically, the so-called Borg RNC

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
measures the so-called average expression level

184
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
for each cell across a population of cells.

185
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Basically, like I just said,

186
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
if you're doing a cancer study,

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you have two samples.

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
One is from healthy tissue,

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
the other is from diseased tissue.

190
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Then you grind it up and compare the two samples.

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Its limitation is basically that

192
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
if you want to study a more complex system today,

193
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
for example, you want to study people's brains

194
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
or some more complex organs,

195
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
then this technology

196
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm afraid I can't give you a very clear result.

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Basically, what single-cell does,

198
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it measures the distribution of expression level

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
for each gene across a population of the cells.

200
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So using this technology,

201
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
every cell has a specific change

202
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that can be shown.

203
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Basically, now there are already a lot of

204
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
so-called commercially available single-cell platforms on the market.

205
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Of course, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages.

206
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
From my personal experience,

207
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have two platforms of experience.

208
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
One is the so-called Fluidigm C1.

209
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The other is called 10x Genomics.

210
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Now I'm going to quickly introduce

211
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
the two single-cell platforms I've used before.

212
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Basically, in general,

213
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the so-called workflow of the single cell,

214
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
its concept is basically the same.

215
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
First of all, you have the so-called tissue of interest,

216
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
either patient tissue or cells,

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
which are some of the cells that you are interested in.

218
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Then, before doing single-cell RIC,

219
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the most important step is that you have to

220
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
prepare in your own way

221
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the so-called single-cell suspension.

222
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Each person may have different approaches.

223
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
For example,

224
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the so-called FACS to do the single-cell selection,

225
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
or to do some so-called micro-dissection,

226
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to sort out the cells one by one.

227
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Then, when you can successfully complete

228
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
your single-cell suspension,

229
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you basically inject it

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
into either single-cell platform.

231
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Then, in the single-cell platform,

232
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
what it does is basically

233
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
to lyse the cell

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and extract the RNA in it.

235
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Then, this RNA is

236
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
reverse transcribed

237
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
into the cDNA.

238
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Then, this cDNA can be amplified

239
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
through PCR.

240
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
After the amplification,

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
we build a library.

242
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Then, these libraries can be sent for sequencing.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like I said,

244
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
this is the so-called sequencing result.

245
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You get the so-called sequence.

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This sequence is basically

247
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the sequence of A, T, C, and G.

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then, you may be mapping.

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Because now many genes have been decoded,

250
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
including human, mouse,

251
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and some species.

252
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So, according to the source of your sample,

253
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
you can map it to the reference genome.

254
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then, you can know

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
what the expression of each gene is.

256
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then, the last step is

257
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the so-called computational analysis.

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because this single-cell RNAC technology

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
is relatively new,

260
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
the computational analysis

261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is still under development.

262
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is basically the same concept.

263
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You have a tissue that you are interested in.

264
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
First, you have to be able to

265
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
dissociate it into the so-called single-cell suspend.

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Then, there are all kinds of different systems

267
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that can make the single-cell suspension

268
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
that you need.

269
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Then, you can further

270
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
dissociate it into the single-cell platform.

271
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This picture is from a recent review paper.

272
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, what you can see here is that

273
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the single-cell RNAC technology

274
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
has developed very rapidly in recent years.

275
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It started with the first single-cell paper

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
around 2009.

277
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
At that time, the single-cell technology

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
was still a very difficult technology.

279
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It was not possible to operate smoothly

280
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
at every level.

281
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Then, the number of times you do it

282
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
may be accumulated from dozens of times.

283
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
However, as time goes by,

284
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
there are more and more different types of

285
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
different technologies,

286
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
including the droplet method.

287
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
There are also some

288
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
random capture technologies,

289
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
such as in-tube barcoding,

290
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and so on.

291
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Now, you can see that

292
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
basically,

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
the single-cell technology

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
can already get a lot of cells

295
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
in one experiment.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Of course, there are many technologies

297
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that continue to develop

298
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
to get more and more cells.

299
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Now, I would like to introduce

300
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
two single-cell platforms

301
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that I have had hands-on experience with.

302
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The first one is FluDyn.

303
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
FluDyn is probably the first single-cell

304
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
RNA-seq technology in the market.

305
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Its basic process is very similar to what I just said.

306
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
First, you need to be able to successfully

307
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
dissociate your tissue.

308
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Basically, this technology

309
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
captures cells to 96 well plate.

310
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Basically, all the so-called cell lysing,

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
RT, and cDNA amplification

312
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
happen in this machine.

313
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Its output is basically

314
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
the cDNA after the amplification.

315
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Then you can make a barcode library

316
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and send for sequencing.

317
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This is the real situation of the C1 chip.

318
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is an image under the microscope.

319
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You can see that

320
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
this cell basically has a fluorescent label.

321
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So you can see that

322
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
after running this chip,

323
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
this cell is basically captured in this chip.

324
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Then all the reactions

325
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
will happen in this reaction.

326
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Finally, when this reaction is completed,

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
you get the cDNA after the amplification.

328
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Then you can further build your library

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and send for sequencing.

330
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Then you will get your data.

331
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
According to my personal experience,

332
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
the C1 chip has some advantages

333
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
but also some disadvantages.

334
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Its advantages are...

335
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh, I may have made a mistake here.

336
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The first one is relatively long prep time.

337
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
This should be its disadvantage.

338
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Its prep time is actually very long.

339
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Of course, if you let your sample

340
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
sit on the ice all the time,

341
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
you may worry that

342
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
its gene expression profile

343
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
may change during that time.

344
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So basically, we hope that

345
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
before we get the so-called

346
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
light cell,

347
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the prep time can be as short as possible.

348
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But this C1 chip

349
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
still has some very good advantages.

350
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
For example, this set of technologies

351
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
allows you to capture single cells

352
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
under the microscope

353
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
one by one.

354
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
For example, this picture shows

355
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
a very beautiful single cell.

356
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Some wells may not have single cells at all.

357
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Some wells may have multiple samples.

358
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Maybe later on,

359
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
when you are building your library,

360
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you may ignore such samples.

361
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Because in the subsequent data analysis,

362
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you may not be able to judge

363
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
whether the data you get is from one cell

364
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
or multiple cells.

365
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Basically, its biggest disadvantage

366
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is the so-called throughput.

367
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Because basically,

368
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in the most primitive C1 chip,

369
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
it can only capture 96 cells at a time.

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
In the later version,

371
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it may be able to capture 800 at a time.

372
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But in fact, in reality,

373
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
its efficiency is very poor.

374
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Maybe only 60% to 70% of the wells

375
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
can capture single cells.

376
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So in fact,

377
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the number of cells you can get every time is extremely small.

378
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So this is the biggest problem with C1.

379
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And later on,

380
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
a lot of research found that

381
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
even some data that had already been published,

382
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
they found that

383
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
some of the results they got

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
were quite related to batch.

385
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So this technology basically,

386
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
in the current single cell field,

387
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
a lot of people have turned to other better

388
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
better technology choices.

389
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
At present,

390
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
the vast majority of single cell RNA-seq platforms,

391
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you will probably see,

392
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
is from this company.

393
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
This company is called 10X Genomics.

394
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Its core technology

395
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
is basically called Gems.

396
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Gen Bits in Emulsion.

397
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So its idea is basically

398
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
that it has a lot of these bits.

399
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then these bits are basically

400
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm thinking the simplest way to do this is

401
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm going to show you a YouTube video.

402
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You should be able to quickly understand

403
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
how this technology works.

404
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Okay.

405
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh, Dr. Sun,

406
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'd like to ask if there's any sound in this video?

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Eh...

408
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's music, so you can't hear the sound, right?

409
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Okay.

410
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But it's okay.

411
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's not talking.

412
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's not talking.

413
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Okay.

414
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, so...

415
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's just background music.

416
00:28:42,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's just background music.

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's just background music.

418
00:29:31,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's just background music.

419
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I think it's easier to use the video.

420
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Wait a minute.

421
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Sorry, I'll turn this off.

422
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So basically, you can see that this is the set of techniques.

423
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's probably like this.

424
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
If you compare these two sets of techniques,

425
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Of course, the biggest advantage of 10X Genomics is that its throughput is very high.

426
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We can capture more than 10,000 cells in each round.

427
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
If you compare it to 96 or 800 cells, 10X is much better than C1.

428
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:06,000
In addition, the advantage of the UMI set of techniques is that it involves some PCR processes.

429
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
This process may also cause some experimental biases.

430
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The UMI set of techniques can basically help correct these biases.

431
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
In addition, the process of generating Gems is extremely fast.

432
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It only takes 7 minutes to generate all the Gems.

433
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So basically, you can make sure that your cells are in a relatively intact state.

434
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Of course, there are some disadvantages.

435
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
For example, 10X Genomics does not sequence all the transcripts.

436
00:31:49,000 --> 00:32:01,000
It only does a small part of 3'N.

437
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So if your research is looking at variants of Gems,

438
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You basically can't use 10X Genomics.

439
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:21,000
On the other hand, many data analysis tools are designed for 10X Genomics.

440
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So if you use this set of systems,

441
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You may get more help in subsequent analysis.

442
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Next, let's talk about some real-world operations.

443
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
In the real world,

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Before injecting into the 10X system,

445
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We have our tissue of interest.

446
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Then we may have different sample prep strategies.

447
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
To control our single-cell suspension.

448
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Before injecting into the 10X chip,

449
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We basically need to do a cell quality control.

450
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
We need to look at several parameters.

451
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
For example, its viability.

452
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And basically, this cell looks like a single cell.

453
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And then there's the cell size.

454
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let you know that your protocol is basically able to target the cells you're interested in.

455
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So the take-home message here will be that

456
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The sample prep protocol optimization is very important.

457
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
For you to get high-quality single-cell data in the future.

458
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
In the first step, it basically determines most of it.

459
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
After your cell QC pass,

460
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You make sure that your single-cell suspension is a very good prep.

461
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Then you can basically inject into the 10X system.

462
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Then all these steps are basically like a kit.

463
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And then you can just run it through.

464
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And now Genome has developed its own computational tool.

465
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I can do the initial data processing.

466
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then you get a so-called gene barcode matrix.

467
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And then you can use this matrix to do the follow-up analysis.

468
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
For the whole workflow of single-cell data analysis,

469
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It's basically divided into two stages.

470
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
The first stage, the yellow one, is basically the so-called sequencing QC.

471
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That is to say, you have to see if your sequencing data is good or bad.

472
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
In this part, it's basically quite mature.

473
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Because I mentioned before that this technique has been used for many years.

474
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That set of techniques is basically the so-called sequencing QC.

475
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It can almost move the whole set to the single-cell RNAC part.

476
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So at this stage of sequencing QC,

477
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's basically looking at the so-called read QC, alignment QC, and mapping QC.

478
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And now Genome has a set of its own software that can help you finish this thing.

479
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Finally, you can get a gene barcode matrix.

480
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And then when you get the gene barcode matrix,

481
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The red part here is basically the so-called further data processing.

482
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm going to take a little bit of time to talk about it.

483
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The so-called further data processing here.

484
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
In the first step, I call it matrix LQC.

485
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What it means is that basically the most important point of this step is to say

486
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You have to get rid of some of the so-called low-quality cells first.

487
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Because if you keep these low-quality cells in your dataset,

488
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
A big problem, it might cause a lot of noise.

489
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And then it might make your subsequent data analysis very difficult.

490
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So basically, after you remove some of the bad cells,

491
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You can take your data to further normalization.

492
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
After normalization, you may need to face another problem.

493
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
After all, single cell technology is based on single cell.

494
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So it will have a lot of unwanted variation.

495
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
For example, it may be a batch effect.

496
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Then all the cells may be in different cell cycle status.

497
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
These may be information that you are not interested in.

498
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Then you may need to use some computational methods to either regress it out.

499
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Or maybe give it a score.

500
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This may be a more detailed data analysis.

501
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Then, in short, when you clean up these data through this step,

502
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Then your dataset can do a lot of downstream data analysis.

503
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It includes clustering, cell type identification,

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And then you can do the so-called differential gene expression analysis.

505
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That is to say, you can compare the gene profiling between cell type A and cell type B.

506
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Which one is the same? Which one is different?

507
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Or maybe you have a very interested cell population.

508
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Then you can see what are the cell service markers.

509
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Or you can compare two situations.

510
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then see which single-only pathway is being activated or inhibited.

511
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
These things are very useful information for both basic biology and disease research.

512
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Then you can also do some network analysis.

513
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Then some people will even take this single cell to do some so-called pseudo-time analysis.

514
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The so-called pseudo-time is that we

515
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Because in a lot of research, such as developmental biology,

516
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It may look at a bit like a time course.

517
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,000
That is, how does this cell change from one state to another state with the eyes of time?

518
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
In the past, you may have to take samples at different times.

519
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Then do the analysis.

520
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The concept of single cell may be that you may not need to take so many time points.

521
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You may take one or two time points.

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Because every cell will give you some information.

523
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Not all cells are in the same state at the same time.

524
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So you can basically go through every cell.

525
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It may be at a certain stage in the process of transformation.

526
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Then it may be in this set of data.

527
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It will give you a so-called pseudo-time.

528
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Such information.

529
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So this is also a very powerful place for single cell.

530
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Let's talk about the so-called metric cell quality control.

531
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
What is it like in a real state?

532
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
How do you filter out the so-called unhealthy cells or cells you don't want?

533
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Of course, everyone may have their own criteria.

534
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Here are some of the most general ways.

535
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
This set of data sets is basically published.

536
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It uses the so-called human blood cells to make a demo data.

537
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This scatter plot is the percentage of the mitochondrion versus the UMI number.

538
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This UMI number can be regarded as how many molecules have been detected.

539
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So-called how many transcripts have been detected.

540
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Then every point here basically represents a cell.

541
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You can see that the majority of the cells are in this position.

542
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,000
In terms of biology, you will know that the vast majority of the cells are in this position.

543
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So these cells have a very high UMI number.

544
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It means that there are a lot of transcripts being detected.

545
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So it is possible that these signals are not coming from one single cell.

546
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
These may be cell aggregation or multiplex.

547
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
These may be the cells you want to get rid of.

548
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Because basically this signal is not coming from one single cell.

549
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Then some other cells you may want to get rid of are the so-called cells.

550
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So you can see that there are very few UMI that can be detected.

551
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But it has a very high percentage of mitochondrion.

552
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Usually when a cell is in an extremely unhealthy state, its mitochondrion will be very high.

553
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So this is also a general criterion that many people will set to filter out some cells that they think are not worth doing downstream analysis.

554
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The last cell that may be used for downstream analysis is this one.

555
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So what does this analysis look like?

556
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
This is basically a result of unbiased clustering.

557
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So you can see that the sample here is from a human pbmc cell.

558
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Here, each point represents a cell.

559
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This type of clustering is called t-SNE clustering.

560
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Basically, it is a clustering algorithm.

561
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Basically, what you can understand is that the closer the cells are, the more similar their properties are.

562
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Basically, they look at, for example, which genes are expressed in this clustering cell, and which genes are expressed in this clustering cell.

563
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Then they can identify what kind of cells these may be.

564
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So in a single-cell RNAC experiment, you can quickly identify all kinds of different immune cells.

565
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
For example, this clustering is basically a B-cell.

566
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The gene expression plotting here further confirms that when you see here, it becomes more purplish, which means that this particular gene is expressed in large quantities.

567
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
This gene is basically a B-cell mutagen.

568
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So it further confirms that these cells do have B-cell properties.

569
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
For example, this CD3E is basically a T-cell marker.

570
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It is also expressed in large quantities in this T-cell population.

571
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Once you get a result like this, you can further study and compare which cells are the same and which cells are different.

572
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Or you can compare two B-cells in a different sample.

573
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Then you can compare the gene profiling of the two B-cells to see what is different.

574
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:00,000
In this way, the result you get will be a signal that only B-cells give you, rather than a result where all cells are averaged.

575
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
This is roughly the concept of a single-cell.

576
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Due to time constraints, I will skip the last part.

577
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:17,000
This is just an example of what a single-cell can do.

578
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
To summarize, there are some things you may need to consider before conducting a single-cell experiment.

579
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:37,000
In my current job, I have to support many single-cell projects on campus.

580
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Based on my experience with many different projects, I can see that data analysis is still the biggest bottleneck in this technology.

581
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
In terms of generating the data, it is not that difficult.

582
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:05,000
However, every time you generate a library of data, it may be over 1,000 cells.

583
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
To be honest, it is not that easy to analyze the data.

584
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Even though we have a single-cell working group in our company, we still have to figure out what is the best normalization method and what is the best batch correction method.

585
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:40,000
In terms of differential gene expression analysis, which method is the best for single-cell analysis?

586
00:45:41,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Basically, if you know exactly what you want to ask, your single-cell data will be more meaningful.

587
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:21,000
However, if you are not sure what you want to see, your data will be lost.

588
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:40,000
In my experience, it is very important to optimize the sample prep protocol before going into the single-cell platform.

589
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:52,000
If you don't optimize your sample prep properly, you may not get the cells you need.

590
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Finally, I want to touch on the single-cell genomics.

591
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The single-cell genomics development is very fast.

592
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
There are many new technologies for different biological problems.

593
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:23,000
For example, the single-cell RAC we just talked about is a single-cell suspension.

594
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,000
However, in some research, you may not be able to get the so-called living tissue.

595
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:42,000
For example, if you want to study the brain, you may only get the tissue after a person's death.

596
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Or you may only get the frozen tissue.

597
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Basically, you can't get the tissue from a living cell.

598
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Therefore, there is a so-called single-cell RAC.

599
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The single-cell RAC takes the tissue from a dead cell and extracts the RNA from it.

600
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
There are also other versions.

601
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:25,000
For example, if you are interested in the recombination of T-cells and B-cells, there is also a single-cell RAC like this.

602
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:36,000
If you are studying cancer T-cell therapy, it will be very useful.

603
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:51,000
If you are studying the chromatin regulation, there is also a single-cell attack C protocol.

604
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You can see which part of the chromatin is open and which part is closed.

605
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
There is also a new technology called CyC.

606
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
CyC adds a DNA barcoding to the antibody.

607
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
CyC turns it into another RNA molecule.

608
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
CyC turns it into a pseudogene.

609
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:29,000
When you run the single-cell platform, CyC becomes an additional signal.

610
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:44,000
In addition to obtaining the RNA expression profile, you can also detect the cell service protein signal.

611
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,000
This technology can also help you with cell type identification.

612
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Overall, CyC is still developing rapidly in the field of sample processing and data analysis.

613
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
This is a brief introduction to CyC.

614
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,000
If you are interested in CyC, you can learn more about it.

615
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Thank you Dr. Sun for giving us a presentation today.

616
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We will now open the Q&A section.

617
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I hope everyone can actively discuss or ask questions about what Dr. Sun just said.

618
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Thank you.

619
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I just saw a person in the chat asking,

620
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Do you mind sharing your presentation slides?

621
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Let's see if Dr. Sun can send the slides to you.

622
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Okay.

623
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Another person asked,

624
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Hi Dr. Sun, for in vivo study, would you suggest to do the qPCR on intracellular organ first,

625
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
then based on the qPCR result to design the experimental for RNA-Seq?

626
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Do you have any suggestions for the qPCR and RNA-Seq?

627
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:25,000
For qPCR,

628
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
if there is a new project coming in,

629
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
we will not go for single cell RNA-Seq.

630
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We will first look at the existing technology,

631
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
such as qPCR or Bulk RNA-Seq.

632
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

633
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
or knockout or wild-type mice,

634
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:11,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

635
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
If your qPCR can already answer your question,

636
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
we usually prefer to ask them to use a relatively cheap and simple technology to confirm.

637
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

638
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:37,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

639
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

640
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

641
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

642
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

643
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

644
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

645
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

646
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:27,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

647
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

648
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

649
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

650
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

651
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

652
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

653
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What software do you use to do batch correction for single-cell RNA-Seq?

654
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Are you asking about rPackage?

655
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Hello?

656
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Oh, rPackage.

657
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I can answer that.

658
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Are you doing single-cell RNA-Seq analysis?

659
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yes.

660
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I believe Serat is doing single-cell RNA-Seq analysis.

661
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Have you heard of Serat?

662
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
If you are interested,

663
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
this is one of the most popular software out there

664
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and it is being developed for single-cell RNA-Seq.

665
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It is being developed for single-cell RNA-Seq.

666
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It is being developed for single-cell RNA-Seq.

667
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
In terms of the CCA,

668
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

669
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
In terms of the CCA,

670
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

671
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
In terms of the CCA,

672
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

673
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
In terms of the CCA,

674
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

675
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
In terms of the CCA,

676
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

677
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
My personal favorite batch collection algorithm is MNN.

678
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
My personal favorite batch collection algorithm is MNN.

679
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It is another package called SCRAN.

680
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It is another package called SCRAN.

681
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It is another package called SCRAN.

682
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

683
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

684
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

685
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

690
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

691
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
