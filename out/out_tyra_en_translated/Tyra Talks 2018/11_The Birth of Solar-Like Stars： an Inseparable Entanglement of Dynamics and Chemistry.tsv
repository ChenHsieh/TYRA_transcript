0	19000	Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are approaching the end of the year, so we may not have a speech next week.
20000	28000	Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Yang Yaolun to tell us about his doctoral research.
28000	33000	Dr. Yang Yaolun is now a doctoral candidate for the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin.
33000	36000	In fact, he is about to graduate.
36000	42000	When he was in college, he graduated from the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin, and then came to the United States to study astronomy.
42000	55000	His specialties and research interests include early-phase star formation, including observations and simulations.
56000	66000	In his doctoral research career, he has used various telescopes such as Herschel, ALMA, and SOFIA to do his research.
66000	72000	What is interesting is that he is also the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.
72000	74000	What kind of event is this?
74000	85000	They will regularly give speeches to the public on astronomy at the bar.
85000	90000	They have now grown to more than 250 people attending each time.
90000	96000	Dr. Yang Yaolun is the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.
96000	109000	Today, he will talk about the topic of the birth of solar-like stars and the inseparable entanglement of dynamics and chemistry.
110000	120000	Let's welcome Dr. Yang Yaolun to give a speech.
120000	126000	Thank you.
126000	129000	I have been involved in this project for a long time.
129000	132000	I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you.
132000	141000	Over the past few years, I have been doing research on star formation at UT Austin.
141000	147000	I am a 6th-year PhD student at UT Austin.
147000	150000	My main advisor is Neil Evans.
150000	156000	We mainly do various observations on star formation.
156000	167000	We use models to explain the physical and chemical phenomena observed in early star formation.
167000	171000	Dr. Yang mentioned SOFIA observations.
171000	180000	What is SOFIA?
180000	186000	SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observations for Infrared Astronomy.
186000	192000	It is an astronomical observatory for infrared.
193000	196000	Why do we use SOFIA for infrared observation?
196000	199000	Because there are a lot of water vapors in the atmosphere.
199000	202000	These water vapors emit a lot of infrared rays.
202000	207000	When we observe on the ground, we only observe the water vapors on the earth.
207000	217000	So, many times, we use a telescope, such as Spitzer or Hubble, to observe infrared rays.
217000	228000	If I remember correctly, we can avoid 95% to 99% of water vapors by using a telescope.
228000	235000	This is SOFIA.
235000	241000	You can see that SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747.
241000	249000	You can see that there is a bulge in the middle section of the tail of the plane.
249000	250000	It is not very clear here.
250000	253000	It is a hole in the middle section.
253000	257000	A 2.7-meter telescope is placed in the hole.
257000	260000	When the telescope flies up, the door will open.
260000	261000	This is how it is observed.
261000	280000	Astronomers and technicians discuss how to make the observation easier to achieve and adjust the strategy in time.
280000	285000	This is how my advisor and I are going to get on the plane.
285000	287000	It is very different.
287000	289000	This is a military airport.
289000	294000	When you enter the airport, you will go up the stairs.
294000	301000	There is a B-2 bomber in the same airport.
301000	306000	This is the inside of SOFIA.
306000	313000	The blue part is the instrument.
314000	319000	The other side of the closed cabin is the telescope.
319000	321000	The other side of the telescope is the mirror.
321000	323000	The other side is the instrument.
323000	326000	There is a balance on the weight on both sides.
327000	342000	Different instruments, telescopes, and mission operators monitor the observation on these stations.
342000	345000	This is a very complicated task.
345000	360000	NASA considers every flight of SOFIA as a mission.
360000	362000	There is a mission director.
362000	367000	There is a mission briefing before departure.
367000	371000	This is the route we flew that day.
371000	376000	We flew from Palmdale, California, about an hour and a half north of LA.
376000	379000	You can see that the route is very strange.
379000	387000	Basically, the route is determined by each arc.
387000	390000	One arc is for a target.
390000	392000	Here we have six or seven targets.
392000	397000	The longer, the longer you stay on the celestial body.
398000	400000	Let's move on to today's topic.
400000	403000	Today's topic is mainly about star formation.
403000	414000	How do we understand the dynamics of early planetary orbits and the corresponding chemical changes?
414000	419000	This is a picture of our galaxy.
419000	424000	You can see a lot of these black irregularities in the middle.
424000	426000	This is what we call Darkland.
426000	429000	It has a lot of dust.
429000	431000	It is also a higher density place.
431000	434000	It is also an area where stars are forming.
434000	440000	If we zoom in to one of them, the Molecular Cloud,
440000	444000	It is mainly a star-forming place.
445000	449000	These black areas are also the so-called dust gathering areas.
449000	452000	It is a place where stars form early.
452000	456000	If we switch to infrared light,
456000	465000	You can see that there are a lot of these pillars or even what we call filamentary structures.
465000	473000	These are from what we imagine as a celestial sphere on Earth.
473000	477000	It's like a sphere in the sky, but it's not a ball or even a block here.
477000	481000	It's more like a texture or a filamentary structure.
481000	483000	Then through these filaments,
483000	489000	The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.
489000	491000	The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.
491000	495000	Then pull to the middle and then reach a high enough density.
495000	499000	Then trigger the activity of this star formation.
499000	505000	This is when the star formation occurs.
505000	507000	You will have a lot of.
507000	513000	Basically, the density will be from 10 to 3 or 10 to 5.
513000	517000	This is the mole per cubic centimeter.
517000	521000	It will be quickly multiplied by 10 to the power of 9 to the power of 10 to the power of 4.
521000	523000	This is a very large number of changes.
523000	527000	In the process, if you have, um.
527000	530000	At the beginning, um.
530000	532000	When the collapse, um.
532000	534000	You're going to have a little bit of, uh.
534000	536000	The angular momentum is in the outermost part.
536000	542000	If you have this smaller angular momentum, it's in a very small area.
542000	544000	It's going to be a lot of rotation.
544000	546000	It's going to be a lot of rotation.
546000	550000	At this time, the degree of rotation is likely to make this.
550000	554000	The collapse of the star formation is not very effective.
554000	556000	That is to say, your, uh.
556000	559000	The gas becomes itself to rotate there, not to continue.
559000	561000	Continue, uh.
561000	563000	It's sucked into the middle of the star.
563000	565000	In the process, there will be a lot of.
565000	567000	We call outflow, and then go.
567000	569000	Go to these, um.
569000	571000	The high-speed rotation of the matter is released.
571000	573000	And then go in to reduce.
573000	575000	The angular momentum of the whole system.
575000	577000	You see the green ones here.
577000	579000	The matter that looks like a jet is the outflow.
581000	583000	Now, this is a simulation.
583000	585000	That is, um, a simulation.
585000	588000	Roughly describe that we are from a filament.
588000	591000	And then slowly, uh, develop into.
591000	593000	It will start with a filament, and then zoom in.
593000	596000	And then you'll see a star.
596000	599000	The early shape of the star.
599000	601000	The situation is a lot of molecules.
601000	603000	Very, very fatal molecules.
603000	605000	How to be in that state.
605000	607000	And then, um.
607000	609000	Collapse and then erupt.
609000	611000	That's what you saw in the picture just now.
611000	613000	This kind of outflow.
618000	620000	OK, so you can see this whole process.
620000	622000	Is very, very.
622000	624000	Very big change, and then, um.
625000	627000	It's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.
627000	629000	Irregular structure.
629000	631000	So.
631000	633000	We also found in observation.
633000	635000	That's what it is.
635000	637000	You can see here, this one.
637000	639000	The picture behind this black and white picture is.
639000	641000	Uh, the distribution of molecules.
641000	642000	This is.
642000	644000	And then the different symbols in front of it.
644000	647000	It means that we are directly observed.
647000	648000	Early star.
648000	650000	Uh, where it appears.
650000	652000	You can see most of it.
652000	654000	Early stars are in, um.
654000	656000	These molecules.
656000	658000	Uh, it's also a more fatal place, so it's produced.
658000	660000	So, um.
660000	662000	We can probably get one of these.
662000	667000	Uh, scenario is to say that you first have a lot of very fatal clouds and dust.
667000	669000	And then through.
669000	674000	Um, these clouds and dust may slowly or even quickly.
674000	675000	Um.
675000	677000	It will collapse to the middle and then become.
677000	680000	Uh, a star or a few stars, I don't know.
680000	683000	So in this process, a very important thing is to say.
683000	687000	Oh, this is probably a very simple one.
687000	692000	Uh, cartoon pattern to express the words is that we have a, uh, a core at the beginning.
692000	693000	We call pre-stereo core.
693000	696000	Simply put, it's the core before the stellar.
696000	698000	So it's called pre-stereo core.
698000	700000	And then you start to collapse.
700000	703000	These core collapse to the middle and become, uh.
703000	706000	Uh, in the early days, it was called pro-star.
706000	708000	So we called this core pro-stereo core.
709000	711000	At the same time, it may, uh.
711000	712000	Um.
712000	714000	It produces a lot of, uh, these.
714000	717000	These flow, this orange side is called the flow.
717000	718000	What about the evolution?
718000	720000	These substances.
720000	724000	The surrounding matter is either sucked into the middle and becomes a part of the star.
724000	725000	Or.
725000	727000	It will be affected by a lot of feedback.
727000	728000	And then it just.
728000	730000	It's just slowly, uh, dissipated.
730000	732000	And then the rest of you are left with a disk.
732000	733000	Because.
733000	737000	There's still a lot of matter, um, in the middle.
737000	739000	The middle part of the high-speed rotation.
739000	741000	There's no way it's very direct.
741000	743000	It's sucked into the middle, uh, on the planet.
743000	745000	So there's a disk.
745000	746000	What about this side?
746000	748000	This disk is, um, planet.
748000	750000	It's where the stars are produced.
750000	753000	So gradually, this disk will slowly evolve into, uh.
753000	755000	Generally, we recognize the planter system.
755000	756000	Just like.
756000	759000	Our solar system, we may be somewhere here.
759000	761000	Okay, um.
761000	763000	So we, uh.
763000	766000	There's a pretty important one.
766000	768000	Uh, the question is, is this.
768000	771000	In the early days of this info, from this.
771000	773000	When you want to produce a pro star.
773000	774000	What?
774000	776000	Uh, it's like a process like this.
776000	779000	How much is his time scale?
779000	781000	Okay, um.
781000	784000	In the pre-status evolution, it's not quite certain now.
784000	786000	So basically.
786000	788000	Um.
788000	790000	If a core starts to collapse.
790000	793000	Production process to become, uh.
793000	795000	Just from, uh.
795000	797000	Core pre-status.
797000	799000	This is probably.
799000	802000	2 million years.
802000	804000	Relatively short.
804000	806000	Then it disappears from disk to disk.
806000	808000	It's probably 10 million years.
808000	809000	So.
809000	812000	And then one, one, for example, like our sun, our sun.
812000	815000	About 10 million years.
815000	817000	So this is probably their time.
817000	820000	It's 1% and 1%.
823000	825000	Then I have another question.
825000	827000	Uh, that's it.
827000	829000	That's one of these.
829000	830000	Uh, how do you say this?
830000	833000	One of these processes.
833000	835000	With the limit, for example, is the model universe.
835000	837000	Or, for example.
837000	839000	Z equals 3, z equals 5.
839000	840000	Or something like that.
840000	843000	Or these things will only happen in the near future.
843000	845000	So there is no difference.
845000	848000	I'm talking about the near future.
848000	850000	Well, the near future is actually.
850000	853000	It's just that it happens, but it happens in the early days.
853000	855000	That even has a lot of.
855000	859000	A lot of active research areas are doing the so-called first star.
859000	862000	It's the first star that starts the earliest.
862000	864000	That's one of the biggest differences.
864000	866000	Uh.
866000	867000	It's in the core.
867000	869000	Um.
869000	873000	This core, a dance core, he wants to collapse.
873000	875000	He doesn't need to, uh.
875000	877000	It doesn't have to be dynamic.
877000	879000	If he is, uh.
879000	881000	The temperature is very high, he is very.
881000	884000	His thermal motion is very strong, so he.
884000	886000	His thermal pressure, he can.
886000	888000	It's easy to be greater than this.
888000	891000	This gravity gives him this middle attraction, so.
891000	894000	Um, when the temperature is very high, it's not easy to collapse.
894000	896000	That's why he has to be cold enough to collapse.
896000	898000	What about in the early universe?
898000	900000	Um, I should say, um.
900000	901000	Um, how do you make this?
901000	903000	This core becomes very cold.
903000	906000	Usually a very important mechanism is called, uh.
906000	909000	Basically, uh.
909000	912000	Your energy, uh, is absorbed by molecules, and then molecules.
912000	914000	Decay.
914000	916000	Decay, and then it becomes radiation.
916000	919000	The radiation goes out, and the energy leaves the system.
919000	921000	So you, you will slowly become cold.
921000	923000	That molecule or.
923000	924000	Um.
924000	925000	It's just more.
925000	929000	In addition to hydrogen, these atoms are more useful for cooling.
929000	931000	That's relative to the early universe.
931000	932000	This cool will be weaker.
932000	936000	So, in the early universe, everyone will think that your core can become.
936000	938000	It can grow very big, and then.
938000	941000	And then it's easy to form a super big quality.
941000	942000	And so on.
942000	946000	I believe that now we have not yet observed anything.
946000	948000	But there should be a lot of simulation to do this part.
951000	952000	Ok, thank you.
954000	956000	Ok, so, um.
956000	959000	So, from an observational point of view, we want to know.
959000	961000	Hey, how does this collapse happen?
961000	964000	What kind of mold does this material go through?
964000	967000	From the outside of this core.
967000	969000	The outer region is transferred to the inner region.
969000	973000	That's like in this simulation, which is simulating.
973000	975000	How does this core collapse?
975000	976000	And then.
976000	977000	In the end.
977000	982000	You can see that the middle of this collapse is very, very short at the beginning.
982000	985000	Compared to the time after that.
986000	989000	So, you can see the same thing as the previous one.
989000	991000	You can see that it is very irregular.
991000	995000	And so it means that there may be a lot of structures in it.
995000	997000	Different structures, different modes.
997000	999000	It depends on the angle you look at.
999000	1001000	It may be outflow.
1001000	1003000	Other places may see it as info.
1004000	1006000	So, um.
1006000	1008000	For the measurement of this info.
1008000	1011000	We mainly want to know how this info started.
1011000	1012000	And then how he did it.
1012000	1014000	For example, how far is he?
1014000	1016000	How big is the size scale?
1016000	1019000	How do you start?
1019000	1022000	For example, how big does this core need to grow at what temperature?
1022000	1024000	He will start to have info.
1024000	1026000	How is his process?
1026000	1031000	How fast does he increase as the radius gets smaller and smaller?
1031000	1034000	Or even not increase, so the radius gets smaller and smaller.
1034000	1036000	It may be slower or faster.
1036000	1038000	So how did he evolve in the end?
1039000	1043000	This rotation dominant region.
1043000	1045000	It's more like a disc.
1045000	1047000	An early disc.
1047000	1049000	A region like that.
1049000	1054000	How did he go from the original radio motion to the rotation?
1055000	1057000	So, um.
1057000	1059000	Through this view, we want to know.
1059000	1061000	What is the model of this info?
1061000	1063000	We have a way to write a very good model.
1063000	1065000	To simulate this part.
1065000	1068000	And then there's the chemical change.
1068000	1070000	How do you change with this info?
1070000	1073000	I'll talk more about this later.
1073000	1075000	Let's talk about it now.
1075000	1079000	And then in a bigger structure.
1079000	1080000	Um.
1080000	1082000	This info is actually.
1082000	1084000	For our so-called initial mass function.
1084000	1085000	Very important.
1085000	1086000	What is the initial mass function?
1086000	1088000	It's a bit like.
1088000	1089000	Um.
1089000	1091000	We're going to build a galaxy now.
1091000	1092000	Build a star system.
1092000	1093000	My inside.
1093000	1094000	Various quality stars.
1094000	1095000	What's the ratio?
1095000	1097000	This is called the initial mass function.
1097000	1100000	There may be smaller mass stars, smaller mass stars, more.
1100000	1102000	That's one.
1102000	1103000	Uh.
1103000	1106000	Mass distribution is the initial mass function.
1106000	1107000	That.
1107000	1110000	But these initial mass functions are mainly refers to.
1110000	1112000	Uh, already generated stars.
1112000	1113000	So we.
1113000	1116000	In the early days, in the space travel, we really want to know.
1116000	1118000	Okay, if we have.
1118000	1120000	This kind of big and small.
1120000	1122000	Different sizes of core.
1122000	1124000	What kind of stars will these cores become?
1124000	1125000	Between them.
1125000	1128000	Core mass distribution and initial mass distribution.
1128000	1131000	Uh, what is the mass distribution of the star?
1131000	1132000	Change.
1132000	1137000	So we hope that in the future, through this understanding, this info model can.
1137000	1138000	Can.
1138000	1141000	There are some hints that say, OK, if we have a core, it may be.
1141000	1143000	A solar mass.
1143000	1145000	That may be how many percent will become.
1145000	1146000	Uh.
1146000	1148000	How much will the middle star be?
1148000	1150000	Is that what we want?
1150000	1152000	I can go through this model.
1152000	1153000	This research.
1153000	1154000	Go to approach.
1154000	1156000	Ultimately approach this problem.
1156000	1160000	How do we go from this blue core mass function to this?
1160000	1162000	Dashboard, all kinds of different dashboards.
1162000	1163000	Uh, initial mass function.
1165000	1168000	The other thing is that we are now in the early days.
1168000	1170000	Uh, these are also seeing a lot of binary systems.
1170000	1172000	And in the general, uh.
1172000	1174000	Already formed a star, we also know.
1174000	1175000	Uh.
1175000	1178000	Most of the stars are binary, that is.
1178000	1180000	Uh, double star or more.
1180000	1181000	Uh, multiple system.
1181000	1183000	Then we also saw this situation in the early days.
1183000	1184000	That.
1184000	1186000	You want to know how this early star.
1186000	1189000	Uh, how can it form such a binary system?
1189000	1190000	Then this.
1190000	1193000	This binary system is for this info or what impact.
1193000	1198000	Or say, what kind of criterion do you want to reach for the mass of your info?
1198000	1201000	What kind of threshold will trigger such fragmentation?
1201000	1202000	Fragment into.
1202000	1205000	Different 2 or 3 or more sources.
1207000	1208000	So we want to know.
1208000	1209000	Uh.
1209000	1211000	This initial condition, what is it?
1211000	1212000	How big is it?
1212000	1214000	Then it is, how much is its quality?
1214000	1217000	Then I hope we can get to know how much.
1217000	1219000	How much mass will be in the middle?
1219000	1221000	How much will be retained in the middle?
1223000	1226000	OK, this is another, uh, this is a very.
1226000	1229000	The system has three, three, three stars in the middle.
1230000	1233000	So we still don't know why it's like this.
1235000	1237000	OK, the other part is.
1237000	1240000	Hey, we're like this, this.
1240000	1244000	MWC480, this, this disk, you see a lot of this kind of structure.
1244000	1248000	But in addition, we also see a lot of different.
1248000	1251000	Uh, more complex, like this.
1251000	1254000	Or this is different.
1254000	1255000	Um.
1255000	1258000	Uh, more large molecules of organic compounds.
1258000	1261000	That, uh, we were in the early, uh.
1261000	1264000	Uh, the core stage also saw a lot of these, uh.
1264000	1266000	Organic chemicals, these.
1266000	1270000	Organic chemicals, because organic chemicals, ultimately, they will become.
1270000	1274000	It will enter the interstitial atmosphere, and then it may be.
1274000	1276000	Trigger, uh.
1276000	1279000	The main part of the life cycle, because these organic chemicals may be.
1279000	1284000	In addition to speaking more broadly, it may even be the first step of life.
1284000	1286000	Or even the seed of life.
1286000	1289000	So we want to know that in the early stage of this core evolution.
1289000	1293000	How do these chemicals change with the information?
1293000	1297000	Um, the same, I'm going to do a lot of explanation in the back.
1299000	1303000	OK, so our goal is to find out how this information happened.
1305000	1308000	Then we are in the way we are currently using it.
1308000	1310000	We are, uh, trying to measure, uh.
1310000	1313000	To measure, uh.
1313000	1316000	Uh, the performance of, uh.
1316000	1320000	Kinematic structure is simply through his.
1320000	1324000	The shape of the line to analyze that in the end, his.
1324000	1328000	Uh, we look at this line of sight inside.
1328000	1331000	What is the path of the movement of the gas?
1331000	1332000	So.
1332000	1336000	Here, if we look at it from this antenna,
1336000	1340000	On the left, this is a very simplified one.
1340000	1342000	Core of the information.
1342000	1347000	One of the more common models is the middle of the information.
1347000	1350000	The velocity is higher than the outside of the information.
1350000	1353000	So you can simplify this thing.
1353000	1355000	Like this picture on the right.
1355000	1358000	This, uh, red is, uh.
1358000	1361000	We look at the path.
1361000	1364000	Because he only has this radio motion.
1364000	1367000	So you can, uh, you can draw a circle like this.
1368000	1371000	And then they, uh.
1371000	1375000	The line of sight above the two points is exactly the same.
1375000	1378000	It means that you will have two, you will have two groups of gas.
1378000	1381000	And then they, for you, his, uh.
1381000	1383000	What is it called?
1383000	1385000	Uh, the cutoff speed is the same.
1385000	1388000	Uh, but they are in different places.
1388000	1390000	Then this will cause, uh.
1390000	1395000	Simplified, it will cause a double profile like this on the left.
1395000	1397000	That.
1398000	1399000	Um.
1399000	1400000	Right, that's it.
1400000	1402000	And then you have this middle absorption.
1402000	1408000	This is from a relatively cold gas on the outside.
1408000	1410000	Maybe it's a cold gas in front of you.
1410000	1413000	And then the stronger radiation that comes in behind the absorption.
1413000	1415000	Because you're cold in front of you.
1415000	1419000	So you're easier to get excited, and then your radiation is absorbed by this colder material.
1419000	1421000	You look at this.
1422000	1426000	So, um, if you have a higher resolution.
1426000	1435000	You can see, uh, like this, like this, if this purple area is our telescope beam.
1435000	1442000	Uh, you can see the cold gas out there, but it's still moving to the center.
1442000	1444000	It's still falling on to the center.
1444000	1448000	So, uh, this kind of, uh, cold gas will give you one.
1448000	1452000	It's not in, it's not in, uh, source velocity, an absorption.
1452000	1455000	It's a redshift because it's far away from you.
1455000	1459000	And then it's going to cause this redshift, this absorption, and it's going to change like this.
1459000	1463000	So this is basically the profile we want to see.
1463000	1466000	We want to measure a profile like this.
1466000	1468000	And then, um.
1469000	1472000	And then when you, uh, in the back, we have this in the middle.
1472000	1477000	There's a, um, continuous source in the middle of every collapsing star.
1477000	1481000	It might be, uh, the hottest part of the disk.
1481000	1482000	The temperature is very high.
1482000	1483000	It might be a few thousand degrees.
1483000	1488000	And then it just gives you a very strong blackbody radiation.
1488000	1491000	So if you put it on, this radiation, this, um.
1491000	1496000	Radiation, continuous radiation will also be absorbed by the colder material in front of it.
1496000	1498000	It's going to be absorbed.
1498000	1502000	So in the end, you're going to get something like this.
1502000	1506000	Continuous originally your continuous may be flat, but in the middle of the part.
1506000	1511000	Uh, because you have a material that's far away from you, you're in this velocity, so you're going to be absorbed by a part of it.
1511000	1517000	So what you actually see, uh, observation in your telescope, observation of the profile will probably look like this.
1517000	1520000	Just simply add the two just now.
1520000	1524000	So when you, if we're in, uh, according to this, uh, two.
1524000	1531000	The front and back of the continuum, the level to correct it, uh, take the continuum away, you'll get this.
1531000	1538000	A strange one, uh, line profile is simply that you, we'll see, uh, the middle absorption is less than 0.
1538000	1540000	You have two radiations less than 0.
1540000	1543000	That's not really because we assume the continuum in the middle.
1543000	1545000	Still, uh.
1546000	1550000	It's the same level as other places, but it's actually partially absorbed.
1550000	1557000	So, uh, we basically want to measure a line profile like this, and then analyze the line profile like this.
1557000	1560000	To understand that we, uh.
1560000	1563000	I've seen this line of sight before.
1563000	1564000	Uh.
1564000	1568000	What is the model of the gas movement?
1568000	1572000	I want to ask a question.
1572000	1574000	Hey, that.
1574000	1577000	Why is that profile?
1577000	1583000	That is, these profiles are not symmetrical to that.
1583000	1587000	Okay, okay, this is the part I just skipped.
1587000	1589000	Uh.
1589000	1593000	Okay, if we go back to the two circles on the right, this picture.
1593000	1599000	Um, in the middle, I write this high high temperature, which is more central.
1599000	1602000	And then on both sides, which is, uh.
1602000	1606000	Large radius is the place where the temperature is lower.
1606000	1610000	Then you can think of it as, um, in this.
1610000	1612000	Uh.
1612000	1617000	In your foreground, in front of you, your foreground is your red foreground material, which is red shift.
1617000	1620000	It's just that it's falling to the center, so it's red shift to you.
1620000	1623000	But in this red shift, this part.
1623000	1625000	You will have, uh.
1625000	1629000	High temperature in the back, low temperature in the front.
1629000	1632000	It means that you are more like you have a cold thing in front of a hot thing.
1632000	1634000	So this cold thing will absorb the back.
1634000	1637000	The hot gas gives you the radiation.
1637000	1641000	Uh, but in the blue shift part, which is on the back side of the envelope.
1641000	1643000	You will, you, you don't have this situation.
1643000	1646000	It's just that the cold stuff is behind the hot stuff.
1646000	1649000	So you don't have this kind of self-absorption.
1649000	1654000	So that's why the red shift peak is lower.
1654000	1659000	Then continue.
1659000	1661000	Why is it the same shape over there?
1661000	1666000	Because the continuum is in the middle.
1666000	1673000	Imagine a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1.
1673000	1674000	So continue.
1674000	1677000	Only in the red part.
1677000	1681000	It's going to be absorbed because the front of the continue doesn't have any blue shift.
1682000	1684000	Oh, I see.
1684000	1687000	Ok, thank you.
1687000	1689000	Um.
1689000	1694000	Yeah, so about 20 years ago, people started measuring this kind of profile.
1694000	1697000	And then this is usually measured with a wireless telescope.
1697000	1699000	That was usually used in the past.
1699000	1701000	It's like this.
1701000	1704000	Uh, we usually think of this little ear or bigger.
1704000	1707000	Maybe it's a 10 meter telescope or a 10 meter dish.
1707000	1712000	Then go to measure these different molecules, and then try to measure the profile.
1712000	1715000	But you can see here, the first one, in addition to the sensitivity.
1715000	1717000	Uh, it's not very good.
1717000	1718000	There are a lot of different structures.
1718000	1720000	He has a lot of this kind of broad line.
1720000	1722000	Or even you don't have a very obvious absorption.
1722000	1726000	Even the most important thing is that you don't have less than 0.
1726000	1727000	So no less than 0.
1727000	1731000	The most important thing is that this absorption is very likely to be.
1731000	1734000	Uh, you're in front of this source.
1734000	1737000	Other completely unrelated to you.
1737000	1740000	You have no way to say.
1740000	1742000	Um, this absorption is not true.
1742000	1744000	It belongs to what you see now.
1744000	1746000	If you can see this absorption.
1746000	1749000	Uh.
1749000	1751000	Drop to 0.
1751000	1752000	It becomes negative.
1752000	1755000	You can find a way to move your telescope.
1755000	1759000	And then you can say, okay, if I move away from the middle, this has a continuous source.
1759000	1762000	See if there's any change in this absorption.
1762000	1763000	You can be more.
1763000	1764000	Uh, sure.
1764000	1768000	Make sure that this absorption material is really associated.
1768000	1770000	The key is that it really belongs to what you see.
1770000	1772000	This kind of course.
1772000	1776000	So, because of the relationship between Resolution and Sensitivity.
1776000	1779000	Uh, this question was broadly studied about 20 years ago.
1779000	1783000	Maybe 5 to 10 years later, everyone thought, okay, it's almost done.
1783000	1784000	You can't do it yourself anymore.
1784000	1785000	So just wait.
1785000	1786000	Um.
1786000	1790000	Uh, the new generation of this Auma wireless wave array.
1790000	1793000	Uh, there's no way to have a better observation result.
1793000	1794000	So what is Auma?
1794000	1797000	Auma is, uh.
1797000	1799000	Uh, Akitama large millimeter sub array.
1799000	1805000	It is a wireless wave array on the Akitama desert plateau in Chile.
1805000	1806000	And then.
1806000	1807000	It's mainly.
1807000	1809000	There should be 66 antennas.
1809000	1812000	It's probably like this bigger antenna on the outside.
1812000	1814000	Each antenna is a 12 meter antenna.
1814000	1815000	There's a smaller one in the middle.
1815000	1817000	Another, uh, separate array.
1817000	1818000	Uh, it's 7 meters.
1818000	1819000	Then it is.
1819000	1823000	Uh, it's basically a collaboration around the world.
1823000	1825000	The United States is NRAO.
1825000	1826000	Oh, that's not NRAO.
1826000	1827000	That's NRC.
1827000	1830000	NRC is Canada's National Research Council.
1830000	1832000	And then Japan's NLJ.
1832000	1833000	Europe's ESO.
1833000	1836000	Taiwan is A, uh, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
1836000	1837000	Uh, there's participation.
1837000	1839000	And then there's Chile.
1839000	1842000	And then this is open to the world.
1842000	1843000	Um.
1843000	1845000	Astronomers can apply to observe.
1845000	1847000	That he mainly.
1847000	1851000	Uh, the biggest bonus is that he can have a very, very good resolution.
1851000	1852000	His.
1852000	1854000	He can see very, very small things.
1854000	1856000	So basically the array is.
1856000	1861000	Uh, the telescope is, uh, your resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by.
1861000	1862000	Uh, you.
1862000	1864000	The diameter of your telescope.
1864000	1867000	The wireless wave array is simply a mirror.
1867000	1868000	Cut.
1868000	1871000	Cut into a lot of little ones.
1871000	1872000	Uh, a different telescope.
1873000	1875000	So you can pull the two telescope very far.
1875000	1877000	As a telescope to use.
1877000	1879000	So this is the biggest.
1879000	1880000	This.
1880000	1882000	Uh, baseline is called baseline.
1882000	1885000	Simply put, his diameter can be up to 15, 15 kilometers.
1885000	1887000	Yeah, it can be analyzed to a very small area.
1887000	1898000	Ok, so at the beginning of this, we started with two more similar profiles that we just drew at the beginning.
1898000	1899000	Like the left side, this is a.
1899000	1901000	This is a, uh.
1901000	1902000	Organic molecules.
1902000	1903000	Uh, what is the Chinese name?
1903000	1905000	The English is.
1905000	1907000	Uh.
1907000	1908000	This, this.
1908000	1915000	You can see if we take it off, you can see this.
1915000	1919000	Go below 0, and then you can see that his absorption is in the red.
1919000	1920000	You've lost it.
1920000	1928000	And then the same thing, in this other source, and then we've seen something similar, but in these two cases.
1929000	1934000	These are all relatively small, because the first one on the left is an organic molecule, so his.
1934000	1938000	He may be in those early stars.
1938000	1940000	Uh, the abundance is not so high.
1940000	1943000	Uh, not much, so the image is relatively weak.
1943000	1952000	Then, like the one on the right, this is a relatively dark source, so it's not so high, so its absorption is relatively small.
1953000	1961000	That's what I'm doing, and I'm mainly using it, uh, to give another source, which is this.
1961000	1967000	And then go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
1967000	1970000	Uh, uh.
1970000	1981000	And then go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
1981000	1986000	It's all about, uh, different different dust and gas.
1986000	1991000	Uh, in the infographic, you can see he has a beautiful outflow, radio, you can see the beautiful outflow.
1991000	1993000	It actually has two sources in the middle.
1993000	1999000	So, here, we're just focusing on irs1, which is the main source.
1999000	2005000	Okay, so when we were in alma cycle 4, we proposed, and then we got our data.
2005000	2007000	It looks like this on the right.
2007000	2012000	It's very much like the way it was drawn before, especially this hcl plus.
2012000	2015000	This curve is basically the same as the one you saw earlier.
2015000	2018000	Then you can see here, although, um.
2018000	2026000	This absorption is very wide, but you can see that he's actually in, uh, redshift.
2026000	2030000	Velocity still has more absorption, which means that he's actually part of it.
2030000	2035000	It comes from, um, the gas that's falling in the middle.
2036000	2037000	Absorption.
2038000	2039000	Um.
2041000	2046000	Okay, so to analyze this curve, we actually need to use one.
2046000	2049000	We can't just read it out of this.
2049000	2054000	Okay, this absorption is in, maybe it's in 0.5 kilometers per second.
2054000	2055000	And then you'll know.
2055000	2060000	Uh, you might know there's something in 0.5 kilometers per second falling in.
2060000	2065000	But you don't know if he's in the place where you're looking at this line of sight.
2066000	2072000	That's because you have absorption and emission mixed together, so we have to, um.
2072000	2077000	Use a very common technique in astronomy, which is ready to transfer the calculation to find a way.
2077000	2081000	Um, to model the way we see it.
2082000	2089000	That's a simple way to say, uh, if I'm here every time, this is a function.
2089000	2091000	It's a, it's a gas.
2091000	2095000	You might have radiation coming in on the left.
2095000	2096000	So what about the radiation?
2096000	2097000	It's going to be in this gas.
2097000	2099000	He may be absorbed by the gas.
2099000	2100000	You're going to become weak.
2100000	2106000	Or after you've been absorbed, or you've been in this gas, it's actually very hot, so he's got some.
2106000	2112000	Uh, he's got some black radiation, or he's got some of his own radiation, so he's probably going to have an emission.
2112000	2117000	So, in the transition of these energies, he's probably going to be part of it.
2117000	2123000	It's the temperature of this gas, or, uh, it's the level population of different molecules in the inside.
2123000	2130000	He's probably going to turn it from a high-frequency state to a high-frequency state, and then it's going to be a high state.
2130000	2138000	The high state will even put some molecules, just break up the molecules into smaller molecules, or even into atoms or even into particles.
2139000	2144000	So you can do this in your mother's face.
2144000	2152000	And then you can go in and say, I've got a line coming in, and it's going to cause some kind of result to my gas and dust, and then you go to the end.
2152000	2159000	In the end, you put each of your mother's from the beginning to the end, and then you can know what comes out of it.
2159000	2168000	Uh, radiation to the end, uh, we observed what it should look like, and then, uh, through, uh.
2168000	2174000	The process of more than once, and then to get a better model to explain what we saw in front of us.
2174000	2184000	So, in fact, what we do is very tedious, but it's also, um.
2185000	2191000	Um, it's actually okay, it's actually not that tedious, but it's a lot of iteration, uh, a lot of iterative process.
2191000	2196000	Basically, after we have a model, we can get it, we can say, okay, our, our.
2196000	2199000	What does it look like? Um.
2199000	2202000	Info this, uh, velocity should look like.
2202000	2209000	We can throw it into, uh, different radio transfer models to do, uh, here we put gas and.
2210000	2212000	Separate because basically.
2212000	2219000	Um, first of all, we use, uh, uh, continuous part of the rain.
2219000	2221000	To go to, uh.
2221000	2225000	To constrain this whole envelope structure, for example, this envelope.
2225000	2228000	Um, his, uh.
2228000	2238000	What is the density, so what changes with the radius, how much of his outflow area, his, uh, angle is, how much is his angle.
2239000	2242000	Then, when we determine this envelope structure.
2242000	2246000	Let's put it in and then calculate it.
2246000	2251000	Okay, if we follow this structure, follow this kinematic, what should the spectrum we get look like?
2253000	2257000	Okay, so, um, this is what we did before, uh, the model.
2257000	2260000	Here, uh, you can see this is, uh.
2261000	2262000	This is.
2262000	2262500	This is.
2264000	2266000	The spectrum behind this.
2267000	2271000	The gray line is the spectrum, and then this is about.
2271000	2277000	Uh, 2 microns, 3 microns, up to 1 millimeter range.
2277000	2278000	Then.
2279000	2281000	Fang, uh.
2281000	2287000	The blue circle is our model, and then the red square is observation.
2287000	2292000	You can see that most of us are going to fit through this, and we're going to fit our model to this observation.
2292000	2296000	And then we'll get a better model to describe this envelope.
2296000	2301000	For example, like I'm drawing here, but in fact, how do we construct it like this?
2301000	2304000	What is the angle of his outflow?
2304000	2306000	What is the density distribution of the envelope?
2308000	2310000	Okay, so you don't want to show off.
2310000	2315000	It's more like it's coming out of the outflow, and then it's coming out of the envelope.
2317000	2326000	Okay, so, um, I mentioned earlier that we're going to take this envelope structure, and we're going to add kinematics, and we're going to figure out how to model this.
2326000	2331000	Uh, but in fact, one of the very, very important, uh, factors is chemistry.
2331000	2333000	So chemistry is not.
2333000	2339000	Uh, well, so chemistry is not just thinking, okay, what molecules are you going to have in there, but molecules like this.
2339000	2342000	Is it possible to exist in that condition?
2343000	2346000	In the atmosphere, you can see it, especially in.
2346000	2351000	Um, these dense core, the density in the middle is very high, and the temperature is quite low.
2351000	2354000	So it's possible to be frozen on top of these dust.
2354000	2361000	If it freezes, you, you, you, you, you can't see it in the atmosphere.
2361000	2364000	So here's the different chemical abundance profile.
2364000	2369000	You might be out there, you might have, uh, the radiation from other places.
2369000	2372000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
2372000	2381000	You might have to separate it and make it two different things, or maybe he's in there, and he'll be that ice will be frozen on the dust, or he'll be in here.
2381000	2387000	It interacts with some electrically charged molecules, and then it generates other particles, and then it disappears.
2387000	2388000	So you don't measure it.
2388000	2396000	And in the middle of that, we're going to go to the main thing I've been doing a lot of time lately, and then we're going to say, what do we want to do?
2396000	2400000	A better abundance profile to explain our data.
2400000	2406000	So, uh, basically, we need to understand this info profile.
2406000	2414000	Uh, we're going to take our dust model to get density, temperature, and velocity, and then we're going to add our chemical bonus.
2414000	2417000	Uh, we're going to find a way.
2417000	2425000	Uh, get a hat spectrum, compare it, if you don't feel good, we'll go back and change it. So this is a very.
2425000	2428000	Uh, a long process.
2428000	2430000	Uh, this is us.
2430000	2432000	Uh, hey.
2432000	2434000	Um, uh, yeah, that's good.
2435000	2448000	My question is, um, like this, in this kind of small system, uh, that kind of info or the final outflow of the gravity distribution is all considered.
2448000	2449000	Is it just normal?
2449000	2451000	That matter is good.
2451000	2455000	If there's a dark matter, he can't say anything about it.
2455000	2457000	It doesn't really matter.
2457000	2460000	And.
2460000	2463000	I'm not sure if it's going to be in the early universe.
2463000	2465000	But at least in the modern universe.
2465000	2470000	Uh, the general assumption is that dark matter is mainly in the outer galaxy.
2470000	2473000	So I rarely.
2473000	2475000	I heard that.
2475000	2484000	Uh, dark matter will affect the evolution of these, at least in the region.
2484000	2490000	So I don't think there's much of an impact.
2490000	2492000	Because that's what I think.
2492000	2499000	If today, in some kind of dark matter, with their own strong interacting, then there will be some small structures.
2499000	2503000	For example, it's a clumpy phenomenon.
2503000	2507000	Maybe it's possible, but I don't think I can see it.
2507000	2510000	Yes, it should be impossible to see.
2510000	2514000	If you have a dark matter, it should be a very, very small scale.
2514000	2517000	That might be something like microlensing.
2517000	2520000	So, uh.
2520000	2524000	So, in a system like this, it should be impossible to see.
2524000	2529000	The current observation should be very far away.
2529000	2532000	Maybe there will be, but it's hard.
2532000	2534000	Okay, thank you.
2534000	2537000	OK, so, uh.
2537000	2539000	This is like this, this is like me.
2539000	2542000	This is our latest profit.
2542000	2545000	The latest model is actually about two days ago.
2545000	2549000	Uh, on the right side, uh, blue is our data.
2549000	2550000	Orange is our current model.
2550000	2552000	And then you see our model.
2552000	2555000	Roughly captured data.
2555000	2561000	The feeling but you can see, for example, in Russian, we still miss a lot of emissions.
2561000	2563000	So, uh.
2563000	2566000	This is actually our status now.
2567000	2570000	In the future, we should continue to do more.
2570000	2577000	Uh, different tuning, and then even to understand that there is no way to make up for this part of the missing mission.
2577000	2578000	And then.
2578000	2581000	To understand that it is possible to say, um.
2581000	2587000	Well, of course, our current model is very, very symmetrical, so basically it is a symmetric model.
2587000	2589000	That, um.
2589000	2595000	The first one is to understand that, OK, if in this very strong assumption, we have no way to make this model.
2595000	2596000	Make this model better.
2596000	2598000	What if it doesn't work?
2598000	2600000	How do we break this?
2600000	2602000	This assumption.
2602000	2605000	And it's not going to create too much freedom.
2605000	2608000	And it becomes, OK, you can say whatever you want.
2608000	2609000	Um.
2609000	2614000	So, uh, this is probably the main thing I'm going to do in the next month or two.
2614000	2617000	And on the left side of the show, this picture is.
2617000	2620000	Uh, basically, it's like.
2620000	2622000	Uh, if you look.
2622000	2624000	This is a map.
2624000	2628000	Then if you take the middle continuous source, it will be like this.
2628000	2631000	This dark place in the middle is the continuous source.
2631000	2633000	After being removed, it causes a very strong absorption.
2633000	2635000	It's like you see this very strong absorption on the right.
2635000	2637000	So when you get close to it, it becomes negative.
2637000	2644000	And then the two bright spots up and down are because you have an outflow, so the outflow is up.
2644000	2648000	Uh, up and down in this direction, so there's an outflow.
2648000	2649000	Uh.
2649000	2653000	Uh, the density is relatively low, so it's easier to be heated, so it's brighter.
2655000	2660000	OK, so why does this info affect this chemistry?
2660000	2667000	That is to say, uh, simply put, if there's a group of gas, now it's going to come from the outside of this envelope.
2667000	2670000	It's travel, you're affected by the infogravity, and you can't travel to the middle.
2670000	2673000	And then falling to this star or disk.
2673000	2677000	It will pass through different temperatures in the middle.
2677000	2679000	It's getting hotter and hotter in the middle.
2679000	2682000	Basically, it's getting hotter and hotter because there's a pro star in the middle.
2682000	2685000	Pro star is emitting a very strong emission.
2685000	2692000	So, but this info can manage is determined by saying, OK, I have this group of gas.
2692000	2696000	This gas will take a long time in different temperature ranges.
2696000	2700000	If it's very slow, it might take a long time in every place.
2700000	2705000	Well, or even if it's in a relatively low temperature, it takes a long time.
2705000	2707000	Or in a relatively high temperature, it will take a long time.
2707000	2711000	That will affect, uh, at different temperatures, it will affect, uh.
2711000	2716000	It should be said that at different temperatures, the chemical reaction that you can generate is different.
2716000	2720000	And the time scale of each chemical reaction is different.
2720000	2724000	If you're in a low temperature, although you have a lot of low temperature chemical reactions,
2724000	2727000	But if you only spend a short time in a low temperature,
2727000	2735000	Then those reactions won't cause any changes to the chemical state of those molecules.
2735000	2742000	So, another way to see is to say, uh, we're actually using these molecules.
2742000	2749000	The radiation to track the dynamic in this envelope.
2749000	2752000	Well, if we don't know where these molecules are going to be,
2752000	2756000	our interpretation is going to be incorrect.
2756000	2759000	So, the other thing I was talking about earlier,
2759000	2765000	these, uh, these dynamic evolution will also affect the chemical reactions that you can produce.
2765000	2767000	So, these two are a bit like interaction.
2767000	2769000	It's like being bundled together.
2769000	2775000	It's hard for you to separate one from each other.
2775000	2776000	So, here's what I'm talking about.
2776000	2778000	For example, in the first question, you might have a lot of free.
2778000	2780000	You know, you have a lot of deterioration.
2780000	2782000	Your H will become very low.
2782000	2787000	And then, in the so-called medium tension,
2787000	2791000	you're going to have a lot of different chemical reactions on the surface of this dust.
2791000	2795000	And that's going to cause the chemistry, the chemistry, the chemistry model.
2795000	2799000	People will tell you that this is going to produce a lot of different species.
2799000	2803000	And now, when it's high temperature, when it's 100 Kelvin,
2803000	2808000	uh, you're going to have a lot of different species on top of this dust.
2808000	2810000	Maybe it's because the temperature is getting higher, so it's coming out.
2810000	2812000	So, it's going to affect what you're seeing.
2812000	2816000	These different bonds are going to be at different temperatures, and there's going to be different changes.
2816000	2821000	So, basically, uh, in the early days, there were two.
2821000	2825000	So far, we've observed that there are two different kinds of, uh, source.
2825000	2826000	One is called Hocker.
2826000	2829000	You know, and then there's Warren Carpenter Molecule Source.
2859000	2863000	Uh, Warren Carpenter Molecule Source is a, uh,
2863000	2874000	uh,
2874000	2875000	uh,
