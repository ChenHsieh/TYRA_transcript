00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm very happy to have you all here today for Lin Bo-xuan's talk.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Let me first introduce our speaker, Lin Bo-xuan.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
She studied economics at NTU, and is now a sophomore at NTU Economics.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Currently, she is an intern at a startup company called ModLab in Pasadena, California.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
Her main topic is game-related data analysis.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Today, we are very happy to invite Lin Bo-xuan to give a talk

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
about how to use class experiment data to test the stability of the final window match

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and the results of the double-sided auction experiment.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Let's welcome Lin Bo-xuan to start her talk.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you, Director Lin.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Without further ado, I'll get started.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Today's topic is very simple.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I'll just ask one question.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Are the results of the economic experiment we see on paper stable?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
To be honest, in the field of economic experiments,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
people are the ones doing the research.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
So, if you want to say that a result is stable,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
you can't just say,

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
if I were in Taiwan, I'd do this result.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Or, if I were in a victim group, I'd do that.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Often, we need to do a lot of different victim groups.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
If we were to say that this result is right for all humans,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
then it should be right to take the same result

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
and do the same experiment in every place.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
But in fact, we often know that

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
this situation is often not necessarily right.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
For example, let's say we measure the risk.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
In Taiwan alone,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
if you only measure the risk for men or women,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
the set of risks may be different.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
So, in fact, if we want to measure stability,

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
that is, if we want to do the same experiment

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
in many places, the result is wrong.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
But often,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
what we want to do

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
is actually very difficult in the experiment.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
First, because economists know

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
that our research funds are limited.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Second, our time is limited.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So, often, it's hard for us to think about

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
whether we can do the same experiment

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
in every corner of the world.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
So, this is a very difficult thing.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Because, mainly, there is a big limitation in economic experiments.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
In fact, we hope to provide real benefits to consumers.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Because of this,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
we need a lot of money and a lot of time.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We need to have a good enough time design.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Basically, it will be impossible to measure in every place in the world.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
So, because of this,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
we did not give up

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
to test whether our experiment results are stable or not.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
So, there are two main ways

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
to do this on our website.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
First,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
for example,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
in the case of Ultraman Game,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
in fact, in the past 50 years,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
there have been a lot of studies on the series of Ultraman Game.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So, basically,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
there is a method

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
that we take the previous experimental data

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
and break it into a very large database

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
to do some meta-analysis here.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Just like what Usterbeck did in 2004.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
But, like this,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
there is a problem.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
In fact, many times,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
all the previous studies of Ultraman Game

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
are the same game,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
but their context is a bit different.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So, in practice,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
many times, your usage is different,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
or your context is different,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
which may affect the result of the experiment.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So, when we use this method,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
we have already lost the control

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
of our experimental design.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Although this method

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
can make our database very rich.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The other way is that

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
we control the same experimental design,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
but go to other places

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
to do the same experiment.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Just like Roth,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
he has been to four countries in the world.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
One is the United States,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
one is Slovenia,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
one is Israel,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
and the other is Japan.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
He went to these four countries

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
to do the same final analysis

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
and market game

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
to see if the results of these four countries

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
were stable or not.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
This is the largest experiment

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
so far.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
But, from this point of view,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
even so,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
we can only do it in a small number of places.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So, in this way,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
although you can

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
control your experimental design,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
but you can't make

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
your database very large.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
So, today,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
what we are doing is

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
using the third method.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
It's like

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
you want to test the stability

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
of a result of an experiment.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
There are three things to do.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
One is the real sound,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
and the third is to have a large enough sample.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
The first two methods

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
are to give up

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
and control the experimental design.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
The other is to give up a large enough database.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But what we are going to do today

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
is to have a large enough database,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and the design

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
is exactly the same.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
But what we give up today is to give up

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
and control the sound.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
In this case,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I can only say that we are the first article

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
to do this.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
We have a lot of data.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
But when we give up

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
and control the sound,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
our experiment

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
will be done in a very

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
no-easy situation.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So, if we can

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
reproduce

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
all the experimental results

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
in the lab,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
it means that the experimental results

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
are very stable.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
As I said,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
what we are going to use today

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
is MobLab.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
MobLab is an experimental platform

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
for all class economics experiments.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
If we take all the data from the class,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
it is actually good and bad.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Of course, the two biggest concerns are

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
that all the students in the class

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
do not use money

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
to provide their sound.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Most of the time, they just use

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
the grade of the course

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
or other random numbers

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
to provide their sound.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
This is what we have lost control of.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
The two biggest concerns are

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
that many students in class

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
may not necessarily be

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
the representative sample

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
of the culture.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
However, there are still

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
a lot of benefits

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
for us to try this method.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
First of all,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
there is no publication bias

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
in our database.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
For example,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
if you take the results

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
of the previous article

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
as a meta-analysis,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
you may get too good results.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
This is called publication bias.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
However,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
all the results, good or bad,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
are recorded in our database.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Another thing is that

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
our company is

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
at least in the class of

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
experimental economics.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
If you want to do a class experiment

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
in the world,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
you basically use our company.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
In fact, our sample is very diverse.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
There are many different areas.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
This gives us a lot of

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
variation to test.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Thirdly,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
the environment in which our data is generated

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
is exactly the same.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The interface, language,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
and the entire experiment process

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
are exactly the same.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
This means that we have

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
completely controlled

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
the process of their game.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
These are the three advantages

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
that we think

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
are very important.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Before talking about these two areas,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I would like to talk about

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
how big our dataset is.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
First of all,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
we can see that

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
this table is a total of

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
10 areas in our dataset.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
You can see that

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
this data is across North America,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Europe, and Asia.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
In Ultraman Game,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
we have more than

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
15,000 sample points.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
For those of you who do not know

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
the economics of time,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
the data in Ultraman Game

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
is about 10 times more than

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
a normal article,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
or 0 to 2.0.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
In DoubleAction,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
there are basically 2.0 more.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
This is a very large sample

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
that we can test.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Next,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
I will talk about these two areas.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
These two areas are actually very simple.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
The first is Ultraman Game.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
In addition,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
why do we choose these two areas?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
The first is because these two areas

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
are the most abundant in our database.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
The second is that these two areas

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
are basically the origin of

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
the economics of time.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
In Ultraman Game,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
there are two people in this game.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
One is Proposer,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
the other is Responder.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Proposer can decide

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
how much to give to the other party.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
This game is very simple.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
There is a ball in the middle.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You can decide how much to give to the other party.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You can pull the ball

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
and decide how much to give to the other party.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
If you decide,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
you can press Submit.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
In this way, the other party can see

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
how much you gave to the other party.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Next,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
suppose I decide to give the other party $45.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
In this way,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
the other party can see

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
that this is

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
a Proposer you have provided.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Proposer can decide

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
how much to give to the other party.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
If you decide to give $45,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
the other party can see

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
how much to give to the other party.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
If you decide to give $45,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
the other party can see

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
how much to give to the other party.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
This is a very simple game.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
It is like a simple negotiation

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
in a simulation game.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
For example,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
when you go to a night market

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
to buy vegetables,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
don't pull the ball.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It is like a simulation game.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
This is the game interface

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
of the Ultraman Game.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Next, I will talk about

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
double-sided auction.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
The most classic example

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
of a double-sided auction

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
is like Wall Street.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
They are selling stocks.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
You may often see some pictures

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
or news photos

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
that there are many machines

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
and many traders

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
raising their hands and shouting.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
This means that

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
everyone is shouting

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
how much to give to this person

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
and how much to give to that person.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Double-sided auction is like

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Ultraman Game.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Ultraman Game has only one side

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
and you are given a Proposer.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
In Double-sided auction,

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
no matter which side,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
the buyer or seller

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
can shout at the same time.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
One is the buyer, the other is the seller.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
If you are the buyer,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
you want to buy something.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
We are buying oranges.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
In this game interface,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
the first thing you can see is

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
how much satisfaction you will get

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
when you buy an orange.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Next, you want to bid.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You can pull a slider bar.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
You can move left and right

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
to decide how much you want to bid

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
to bid for this orange.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
If you buy an orange,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
the benefit is

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the value deducted

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and how much you spent to buy it.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
If you are buying,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
there are two ways to buy.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
One is to bid here.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
The other is

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
if there are many buyers

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
and they are already bidding

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
so you can also buy

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
at the lowest price.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
The next one is

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
the seller.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
The seller actually has the same

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
interface as the buyer.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
If you sell an orange,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
you have the cost

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
so you can see the cost here.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Next,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
you can pull a slider bar

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
to decide how much you want to bid.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
You can ask the price here.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Or you can decide

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
to sell the highest price here.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
So I can sell it here.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Please note that

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
there is a special design

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
here.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
When you decide to

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
ask the price here,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
if the price is

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
negative,

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I will change it to red

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
to warn you

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
that

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
this transaction

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
may result in a negative price.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
So this is the double option

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
game interface.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Let me introduce

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
the game settings here.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
This is because

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
in such a simple game interface,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
many teachers

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
can adjust the game parameters

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
by themselves.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
But in most cases,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
many teachers use the pre-set options.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
In Ultimatum Game,

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
the pre-set price is $100.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
In the case of double option,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
the pre-set market is

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
5 buyers

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
and each buyer

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
can buy 3 items.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
In other words,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
there are a total of 15 items in the market.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
If we draw the value here,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
the black line

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
is the demand curve.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
The gray line

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
is the supply curve.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Before I start,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I want to talk about

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
the theoretical prediction

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
of these two games.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
In Ultimatum Game,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
the theoretical prediction is very simple.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
If we look at it

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
from the perspective of the respondent,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
the balance of a game

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
is basically

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
that if I do this option,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
the reward is higher than the other option,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I should do this.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
So if you look at the responder,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
no matter what positive reward he sees,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I should accept it.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
If I take $1, it's better than $0.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
If I take $2, it's better than $0.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
So in this case,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
if I get a positive reward,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I should accept it.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
If I get a negative reward,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I should accept it.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
If I get a positive reward,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I should accept it.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
This is the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Game.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
However, in the past 50 years of research,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
we all know that

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
this theory is basically written to be overturned.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Because a lot of times

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
when we do research,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
we will find that

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
basically all the recipients

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
will not only give the other party $1,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
because a lot of times you will be very unhappy.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
This is Ultimatum Game.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
In Double Option,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
this is like the high school science textbook,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
you will see Supply and Demand Curve.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
If you want to solve this game, it's actually very simple.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
You have to find a price

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
to clear all the markets.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
So if you are here,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
this gray curve is our

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
theoretical prediction price,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
which is just the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
If this price

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
is higher,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
if it is higher than the balance price,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
it means that

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
there are more sellers who want to sell things at this time,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and fewer sellers want to sell.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
So if the supply and demand are uneven at this time,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
this force will force the price down.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
But if the price is lower,

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
then there are more people who want to sell,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
and fewer people want to sell.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So this force will push the price back.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
This is also the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
This is our balance price.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Then in our predicted market,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
the number of balances is 13,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
and the price of the balance is $112.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
So this is our game setting.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
I want to stop here for a while.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Is everyone OK?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
If there is no problem,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I will continue to talk about the results.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Wait a minute,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
let me confirm first.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
So here

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
the buyer's demand price

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
is $150.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
The forecast is $150, $145,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
$140, and so on.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Then it is reduced to $130.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So $150

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
and then $130.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
What is the last one?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The last one is

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
$120 and $117.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Then the other side is from $50

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and then continue to add $50.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Then I will continue.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
First of all,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
let's talk about

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
the overall result.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
First of all, I want to show you

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
this table.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
To summarize,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
we mainly looked at the five outcome variables.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
What are their numerical statistics?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
First of all, in the Ultimation Game,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
we mainly looked at two outcome variables.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
One is how many proposals you give to the other party.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
The other is how much your acceptance rate is.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
First of all, we see the first one.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
In the case of $100,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
on average,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
you will give the other party about $36.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
This number is actually

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
very close to the result of our experiment.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
For example, if we take

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Rock's article in 1991 as a benchmark,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
the average of the article

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
is 40.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
So our difference is only 4%.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So I think it's a very close result.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Then the second one we looked at

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
is the acceptance rate.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
What we are looking at now is unconditional.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
If we look at

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
the unconditional acceptance rate,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
the acceptance rate is 66%.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Rock's result is about 73%.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So the difference is only 6% or 7%.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
But because our offer

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
is relatively low,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I think our result

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
is able to reproduce

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Rock's result on the aggregate level.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Hello, I have a question.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
You just said

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
he made 40 and then 36.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Or let's just say

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
how much is the experimental

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
and how much is the theoretical expectation.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I think it's very close.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I want to ask

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
what do you think?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Because you didn't show

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
your uncertainty range.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Maybe it's actually a very stable difference,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
so it's not very close.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This is

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
what I will continue to talk about later.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Because I'm going to show you a statistic now.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I'll show you an approximate

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
numerical statistic.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But actually you're right.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
If I have to do it,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I have to look at whether there is a significant difference.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
But actually

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
the first one is

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
this is one point.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
If I want to do an assessment,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
there is another problem.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Our sample number is very unbalanced.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Very unbalanced.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
So it means that our sample number

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
is about more than 10,000 points,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
and their sample number is only more than 1,000 points.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So in fact, when you do an assessment,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
sometimes there are some

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
bad points.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
You need to pay attention.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
But in fact,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
at least in the case of showing data now,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I can only say it out loud.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I can only say it out loud now.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It depends on whether it's close or not.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Next,

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
the other three are

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
the results of the double option.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
For the double option, I'm going to use three indexes

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
to talk about whether this market

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
has been able to

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
refine

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
the prediction of the theory.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
The first three indexes we look at

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
are the average error.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
The definition of the average error is actually below.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
DQ is the price of

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
each unit

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
of each contract.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Subtract it.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This means

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
how much is the difference

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
from our theoretical prediction.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Next, I look at the average.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Because we often have

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
about 800 different market configurations.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
So in order to make everyone

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
comparable, I use

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
the average price to standardize it.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
So we can actually use this index

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
to see how much is our accuracy.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The next one is

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
our

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Smith Alpha.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Smith is to commemorate

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Brown-Smith, so that's why it's called this name.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Next, this index

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
is actually very simple.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
It's the distance between

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
my price and

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
my theoretical prediction price.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So I take the square here.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Then I take another one.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Next, I look at the average distance.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Then I open a number.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
So it's actually very similar to

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
my standard error.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
But what I'm doing today is not average.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
What I'm doing today is

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
theoretical prediction.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Next, I still use

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
my average price to standardize it.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
So I can use this index

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
to measure the fluctuation of price.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
The next

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
and the third index is Efficiency.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
For Efficiency, I want to use

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
the above graph to explain.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
So in this

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
market balance,

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
if this seller

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
makes a deal with this buyer,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
then in the middle,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
the upper part

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
is the

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
profit I make.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
It's the buyer's profit.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
The lower part is the seller's profit.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
So that means

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
the total length of this segment

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
is the

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
profit I can make

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
from this deal.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So I take the

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
supply curve and demand curve

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
and divide it by the area.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
So in theory,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
how much surplus

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
can I get?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So the efficiency

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
definition is

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
the efficiency I achieve

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
in this market

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
and the efficiency

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I expect in theory.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
How much can I get?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
So what I can see here is

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
first,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
my average error is about 6%.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
That means my average price

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
is about 6% higher than the theory.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Next,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
my Smith Alpha,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
my price fluctuation

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
is about 30%.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Next, my efficiency

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
is about 84%.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So in theory,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
these numbers

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
are significantly different.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
However,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
this is related to another problem.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
In our lab,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
we usually let our customers

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
play the same game for 10 or 20 rounds.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
At this time,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
after more than 10 rounds,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
the price will become very stable.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
But here,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
if we play 10 rounds,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
the customer might have already

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
played 2 or 3 rounds.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
This is why the price here is unstable.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
But later on,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I will try to show

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
if

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
our students can play

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
enough rounds,

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
where will they end up?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
This is the result of the double option.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I will show it.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Let's continue to look at

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
the whole distribution.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Sorry to interrupt you.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
This has nothing to do with your speech.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I don't know if you have noticed

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
the Chrome dialogue next to you.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't know which computer

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
you are using.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I don't know what to do.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Thank you for reminding me.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I hope you don't interrupt me.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I don't want to leave the group.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Thank you.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Let's continue.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
First, let's look at

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
the whole distribution of Proposal Offer.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Because

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
in our game design,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
the teacher can decide

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
whether to play 1 round, 2 rounds,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
or how many rounds.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
If you play more than 2 rounds,

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
it will become a repeated game.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
If we divide the data

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
into repeated and repeated games,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
we can see

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
that

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
the first point

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
is

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
the theoretical expectation.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
This is the theoretical expectation.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
This is the theoretical prediction.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
So here,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
whether it's 1 shot game or repeated game,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
only about 10% of the audience

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
play on the theoretical prediction.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Then we have 50%

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
of the audience

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
play on the theoretical prediction.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Next,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
let's look at

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
the distribution.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
The first observation is

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
that we have a lot of proposal offers

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
which means

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I play on the whole number.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I play on 0, 10, 20, 30.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
This is the first observation.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
The second observation is

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
that only about 6% of the audience

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
play on the theoretical prediction.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I give myself less

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
and I give myself more.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
In this game,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
there should be a first-mover advantage.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I should give you 50%

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
if I'm great.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
I shouldn't lose to you.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
I should give you more.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
This is the first observation.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Next, let's compare

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
the distribution with ROC.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
This is ROC's distribution

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
in 1990.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
As Zhang said,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
we didn't do a statistical assessment.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
So we can only see

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
whether we can catch the distribution.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
The first observation is

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
that the density

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
is about 50 to 40.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
is about 50 to 40.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
We can capture this.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
We can capture this.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
At this level,

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
we can replicate their results.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
At this level, we can replicate their results.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
In fact, the biggest difference

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
between our distribution and their distribution is

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
that almost no one here plays on

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
the theoretical prediction.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
But about 10% of people

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
play on the theoretical prediction.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
In fact,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
at least me and Colin

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
are not sure.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Maybe this is the prediction option.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
In the beginning of a game,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
the prediction ball

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
is placed on the theoretical prediction.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
is placed on the theoretical prediction.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
If the student

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
doesn't think about it,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I will throw it away

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
without any strategy.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
So 10% of people

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
may play on the theoretical prediction

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
and may be affected by the prediction option.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
But this is...

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Do you have response time here?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
I will show it later.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
According to your hypothesis,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
the response time should be the lowest.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
But the response time is very high.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
But I will show the result later.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
So it's not necessarily the predicted result.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
So it's not necessarily the predicted result.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
But...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Sorry, can you show the previous video?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Sorry, can you show the previous video?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
OK.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Because I was thinking

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
if you said it's because of the default option,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
if you said it's because of the default option,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I can see...

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Because there are very few people

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
who mentioned 1 in Rose's data.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
But the people who mentioned 1 here

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
seem to be

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
significantly higher than 0.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
But the people who mentioned 1 here

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
seem to be

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
significantly higher than 0.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
So although 0 is so high,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
it may be the effect of the default option.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
But it seems that there are more people

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
who seem to be significant.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
If you look at the balance behavior as 0 or 1,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
there are more people who seem to be significant.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
There are more people who seem to be significant.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
That's what I think.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Thank you for this comment.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
It should be said that

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
it should be said that

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
it should be said that

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
there should be quite a lot of people

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
playing with the theory.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
But it is true that the effect of the default option is a confirmation.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
But I will continue to talk about it.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Next, this is our acceptance rate.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Next, this is our acceptance rate.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Because I think this result is very cool.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
It doesn't matter if I talk about it later.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I must make this result clear.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
First of all, because what we talked about earlier

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
is the unconditional acceptance rate.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
What is more interesting now

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
is to measure the conditional acceptance rate.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Unconditional

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
is the number of offers I see.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
That is to say, because we measure

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
the expected value of the conditions.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
This is actually a function of an offer.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
This is actually a function of an offer.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
So on this graph, my X axis

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
shows how many proposal offers I see.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Then my Y axis shows

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
what is my average acceptance rate.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
In this graph,

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
the black dot represents the information of one-shot game.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
The orange dot represents the information of a repeat game.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Next, the size of each point

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
represents

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
the density of the

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
histogram we saw earlier.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
So if you put

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
the size of the size of the ball on the X axis,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
it becomes the full

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
histogram.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Next, because

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
when I was checking the data,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
I found that between 49 and 50,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
there is actually a

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
20% jump.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
So I think it's weird.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
So I used a specification

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
to measure

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
the P-splice linear

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
specification.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So what you can see is

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
that if you are

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
less than 50,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
you see that your acceptance rate is this curve.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
When it is greater than 50,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
there will be a big break point here.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
This is completely obvious.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It is very obvious.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
When we measure the standard error,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
we also use

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
cluster. Then we have a cluster

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
at the session level.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
We use the most conservative calculation

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
to estimate our variability.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
So in this case, it is also very obvious.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
If we put all the data

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
together, there is about

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
20% to 21% jump.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
If we divide it into one-shot game and

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
repeated game,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
one-shot game is about 16%.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Then again, in repeated game,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
this jump becomes 26%.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
First of all,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
this phenomenon has not been seen in the first 50 years.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
So I think it's a very

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
cool discovery.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Next, let's talk about 1.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
First of all,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
this interpretation is actually very complicated.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Because we have a lot of confounds here,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
which our database can't detect.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
But what we can be sure of is that

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
the source of this point is not

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
the difference in your payoff.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Because you can see that when we come from the left

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
B, you can come from 49.99999.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Then the next step is to come from the right B,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
which is about 50.0000001.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
In fact, this gap is less than

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
how small your Epsilon should be.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
So the effect of this is definitely not

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
from monetary payoff.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Or even if you are in a hypothetical state,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
it is basically not from

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
how much your payoff is.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So it is very possible that this point is

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
your other regarding preference.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
That is to say, at this time, you must

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
consider what other people

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
in this proposal offer.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
What does it look like?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Next, there are many ways to say

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
that we can't uniquely pin down.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
It may be like

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
because you are from 49.999 to 50.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
You have a big gap here,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
which is equality.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Because this paragraph can also mean

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
that I may be very, very care.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Am I equal to you?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Or this is the first one.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Or the other is to say that

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
if you don't give me 50,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I may have to punish you.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So this is why this paragraph may be

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
10% more in the repeated game.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It may be that this 10% is more

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
and I have to punish you.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Or I may care about my fairness.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Or I just say that since

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
we are not playing real money,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I just don't want to lose you.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
So it means that if I am below,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
my acceptance rate is relatively low.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So basically it's the same as

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
you and Yuqi.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
This is what we see in the data.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I would like to ask

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
what your thoughts are.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Actually, I don't know.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Before you do this,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
there is a question.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Although you know a lot,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
but in fact,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
even if you just showed us,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
there are very few offers

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that exceed 50.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
There are about 600.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
If you look at the group,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
there are 600.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
For example,

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
your estimate of acceptance rate

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
because you are not using strategy method,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
you are showing offer.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
So it means that

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
you are now running this break point return.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I think that

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
when it is below 50,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
the variation is actually better.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
But the part above 50

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
is probably more unstable.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
But it looks like

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
this break point is really interesting.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Because

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I think about it.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Because

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Have you ever tried

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
you don't use

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
in the part below 50,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
you don't use linear return to run.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
I haven't tried it yet,

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
but I want to try quadratic.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Because there is another possibility

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
that it is actually not

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
presented as a break point,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
but a more complex

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
non-linear.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Just because you fit linear,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
it doesn't look like a break point.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Because if you look at the data directly,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
it looks at least

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I think it's quite linear.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
If you look at the part of the orange repeat game,

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
it looks like

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
it's actually

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
a strange fall first,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
but it's more stable

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
when it reaches 40.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
This may be more like quadratic.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
If you only look at black,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
it looks like

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
it's a

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
it's a

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
between 20 and above

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
50 is a shakier

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
drop, but

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
below 20

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
it's more stable.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
So

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
it's possible here,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
just because

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
you fit a one-point

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
linear relationship.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
Anyway, I will try quadratic.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
But this is

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
what I estimated.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I think it's quite interesting.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
If this is true,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
how do we

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
at least I think

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
how to reproduce this break point in the lab

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
I think it's quite interesting.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Let's look at the results of ROS.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
If we look at the data of ROS,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
this break point is completely invisible.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
this result

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I think it's quite special.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
This means that we have a lot of work hypothesis

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
running here at the same time.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
However, we have tried

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
a power test.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
This means that if we only draw 10%

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
because our sample number is about 0.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
So if we only draw 10%

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
can we estimate this break point?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
This means that we still have a way to estimate this break point.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
So it may not be because

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
the problem of power in statistics.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Then another

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
our work hypothesis may be because of

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
hypothetical stake.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Is it because it's all

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
invisible?

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So I care more about the ranking between you and me.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
At least I don't want to lose to you.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
So

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
this is my current work hypothesis.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
This may be

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
the next article that can be done

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
is how to reproduce this break point in the lab.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
I think it's quite interesting.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Can you remind us again

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
about the population composition

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
of your data?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
For example,

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
the proportion of each state or

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
province?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
We have seen that

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
in the United States, there are western states,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
central and western states.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Then there are northeastern states.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Then there are southern states.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Then there is Canada.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Then in Europe, there are

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
the United Kingdom and Spain.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Then in Asia,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
there are China, Japan and Singapore.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
What about the proportion?

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
About 80% of the data is in the north.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Then about 10% in Europe

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
and about 10% in Asia.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
OK.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
So overall,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
this result

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
is more conservative.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
It is the result of the main cultural circle

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
in North America, right?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Yes.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
OK. I just want to ask.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But I want to add

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
that the problem is

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
that all the results of the lab

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
are not in North America.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Yes.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
This is true.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
OK.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Then I will...

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Bo-xuan,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
if you want to compare with

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Ross's work,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Ross's work is mainly not in North America.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Then the data of

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
the other works,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
such as Madden Game,

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
can you observe?

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I have almost never seen any points.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Yes. OK.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
OK.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Because of the time...

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
OK.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Let me continue.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
I have a question.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
This article was made

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
about 20 years ago,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
right?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Yes.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Do you think that the evolution of time

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
has a big impact on the data?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Of course it is possible.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Because a lot of social preferences

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
may follow the evolution of time.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
For example, the value of Taiwanese

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
has changed over the past few years.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
So it is true that this may be

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
different.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
But we can see that

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
the social preferences

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
have a big impact on the game.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
If this has any impact on the data,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
it may be OK.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Because the data may be a mirror effect.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
But this is a big problem.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
We can talk about it later.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Then I will continue.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Finally, the teacher just said

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
that we need to show the reaction time.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Our server does record the reaction time.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Then...

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Because

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
OneShotGame and RePDGame

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
have similar patterns.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
So I only use OneShotGame

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
to show the result.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
First of all, the black line

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
represents the reaction time.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
The black line represents the reaction time.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
The black line represents

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
the lowest estimation.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
The orange line

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
represents the acceptance rate.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Then...

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
This is also my lowest estimation.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Then...

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
The X-axis represents

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
my offer.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
If you don't have any concept,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
the lowest estimation is

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
the return time

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
in each section.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
This means that

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I am fitting the data

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
when I am close to 0.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
It is close.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
So what the teacher saw at the beginning

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
is that

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
he spent a lot of time

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
to make the decision.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
He spent almost 20 seconds to make the decision.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
But you can see

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
that 50 is very short.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
There is a drop.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It only takes about 8 seconds to make the decision.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
This means that

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
50 is a very special allocation

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
for the number.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
At least for them,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
if I see 50,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I don't need to think too much

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
to make the decision.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Another thing is that

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
we see a sharp kink

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
in the acceptance rate.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
This means that

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
it is possible that

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
no matter what the

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
probability is,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
at least we can still see something.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
This is the data

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
on the reaction time.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
However, the interpretation is

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
quite special.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
At least for the show data,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
we can spend very little time

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
to make the decision.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Bo-xuan,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
is there no way to record

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
the time for the proposer to enter the game

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
and his proposal?

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Because if you want to see if it is D4...

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Let me think about it.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
What we can see is that

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
we only start to calculate the time

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
when we enter the game.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Because it depends on whether

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
the effect caused by the default option

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
causes many people to raise 0.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Right.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
You are right.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
We do see the time for the proposer.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
However, I remember that

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
it took a lot of time.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
OK.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
This is...

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Hello?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Let me answer.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
At the time close to 0,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
you said that

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
it took a lot of time.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
You mentioned that

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
you were thinking...

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
At the beginning,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
you said that

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
there were many results at 0, right?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Yes.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
At that time,

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
you thought that

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
the starting point of SliderBar was 0, right?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Yes.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
In fact,

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
they spent a lot of time thinking about it.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It seems that

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
it is not because...

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I think it is like

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
canceling the explanation

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
you mentioned at the beginning.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Is it because

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
they just accepted it?

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
That's right.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
However,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
it took a lot of time.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
It took a lot of time.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
It took a lot of time.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
I should show you the time for the proposer.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
The time for the proposer.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
However,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
the explanation of calling is quite interesting.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Why did it take a lot of time

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
to think about it?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Many people were reluctant to accept it.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
It took a lot of time

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
to accept it.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That's right.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Bo-xuan,

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
you can split the responder

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
into accepted and unaccepted.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
OK.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
This is a special point.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I will split it.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
I will write it down.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Next,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I still have some time.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
I want to talk about the result of double option.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Double option is...

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Sorry, Bo-xuan.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Before you talk about double option,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
can I talk about the point of

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Automaton Game?

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I was just thinking that

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
you just said that

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
one possibility is that

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
everyone cares about fairness.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
The other possibility is that

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
everyone cares about

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
not losing.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Is the acceptance rate

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
particularly high?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Yes.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Or is it a whole point?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
There is a point that goes up

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
and then forms a square curve.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
If you care about fairness,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
maybe 50 is particularly high,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
and then 51, 52,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
there will be another point.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
One-shot game is like this.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
There is no repeated game.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
OK.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
I will continue to talk about it.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
OK.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Next, double option is...

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
First, I want to show you

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
what the data looks like.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
This is our predicted market.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Next, the whole price changes.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
This is just an example.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I have 10 regions here.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I choose a market for each region.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I draw it out

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
to show you what it looks like.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
You can see that I only draw four levels.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Because the length is about four levels.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
If you look at the first level,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
everyone may be very noisy.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Next, look at the second level

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and the third level,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
the price changes less.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
In the fourth level,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
the more you play, the more stable it becomes.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
What we want to see here is

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
that under the market mechanism of double option,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
as long as you play about three or four times,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
consumers can find

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
a balanced price, even if I don't tell them anything.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Next, another thing,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
as I said before,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
the market is very short.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
So we want to estimate

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
what it is like.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
If it can play a lot of games,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
where will it end up?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
We spent

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
about a month

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
to come up with this.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
First of all,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
let's talk about intuition.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Let's talk about an example.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Let's say

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
a lot of people here have the same experience.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
When you apply for a PhD,

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I want to know

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
what this student will do

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
in the rest of his career.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But the only thing I can know

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
is what his GPA

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
will look like in the next four years.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
So at this time,

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
for a school,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
if it wants to estimate

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
what will happen next,

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
the only thing it can do is

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
to increase his GPA in different periods.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So it's possible that

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I put more weight on the GPA at the end

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
You can look at two parts.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
The first one is

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
the Dependent Variable on the left.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
On the right,

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
if we look at T as 1,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
this means that I am in the first period.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
In this case,

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
this is back to the simplest return.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
This is very common.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
In the first period,

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
if you use the example of GPA,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
your first semester

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
is likely to have a lot of variables.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Maybe it's because you're a middle school student

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
and you don't know what's wrong with your GPA in the first semester.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
However,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
in the second period,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I only give you one-second weight

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
to explain your starting point,

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
such as building a house or something like that.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
I only give you one-second weight.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I also give you one-second weight

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
for your GPA at that time.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
This means that your GPA at this time

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
may be only half of the population

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
in front of you.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
In the third period,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I put two-thirds weight on your GPA.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
In this case,

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I only give you one-third weight

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
for your starting point.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
So you can see that

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
if I can make T

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
as large as infinite,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
then my beta2

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
is actually

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
the progressive estimate of

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
our dependent variable.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
In other words,

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
if we put this Y

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
on all the indicators of the first three markets,

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
then where will this market end up?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
If consumers can play enough,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
then we put this Y

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
on all the indicators of the first three markets,

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
then we can see that

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
the first one is mean error deviation.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Its final price is only

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
1% higher than the average price.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
It is not significantly different

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
from the theoretical estimate.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Then the final price change

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
is reduced to 11%.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Although the estimate is a bit big,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
it is also not significantly different

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
from the theoretical estimate.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
The final price change is reduced to 97%.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
It is also not significantly different from the first one.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
So these results are basically

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
completely the same as the results of the lab.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
So at least

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
we can prove that

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
double auction is a very stable

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
price mechanism

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
to reach 100% efficiency.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
So we can see that

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
our data also shows the same thing.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
When our students can play enough,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
all of our welfare

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
should be exhausted.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Can I go back to the last page?

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Yes, you can.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I want to confirm

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
the quantitative model.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Why is there no variable

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
next to Beta 2?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Because this means

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
what I want to see is

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
where your final GPA is.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
What I bring here is a constant.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
What I multiply here

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
is a constant.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
The point is that I am

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
multiplying your

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
current GPA

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
with your original demographic

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
variation.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Is it OK?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
It doesn't matter.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
If you don't understand,

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I will discuss with you later.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I will continue.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
What we see in the end is that

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
although we can basically

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
get the theoretical estimate,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
what we want to see is that

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
where your final GPA is.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
What we see in the end is the amount of transactions.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
The horizontal axis

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
is the theoretical estimate amount.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
The vertical axis is the amount of transactions.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
The point is that

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
if the market is not balanced,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
we are often under-traded.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
It is possible that

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
the last one or two transactions

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
may bring us only 1% or 2% of efficiency.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
In this case,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
it is possible that

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
I am too lazy to make the last 1 or 2 cents.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
This is the main result of

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
the double option.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I have about 10 minutes left.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I want to talk about

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
what I said earlier.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
We have a lot of

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
variations in different countries.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I want to use some

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
meta-analysis tools

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
to analyze

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
the composition of these variations.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
First,

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
we look at

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
the variations between countries.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Basically,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
we need to use

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
a

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
meta-analysis

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
to calculate

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I squared.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
If you look at

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
this graph,

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
you can see that

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
these are

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
the average variations of the proposal offer.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Next,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
we have all the variations,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
the variations between countries,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
and the variations within countries.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
What we want to know is

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
what is the proportion of

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
the variations between countries.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
We calculate I squared.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Since we don't have much time,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I won't talk about

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
how to calculate I squared.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
What we can figure out is

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
the proportion of

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
the variations

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
within countries.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
We can see that

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
86.6% of the variations

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
in the proposal offer

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
are significant.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Although we can't say

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
that this is a cultural difference,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
we can say that

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
the variations within countries

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
are significant.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
From the same perspective,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
we look at the acceptance rate.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
The acceptance rate is special

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
because we look at

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
the shape of the probability function.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
In order to make it comparable,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
what we can do is

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
we look at

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
a logic regression.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
On the left, we put 0 and 1 variables,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
which is whether you accept or reject.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
On the right, we put

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
10 dummy variables

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
in addition to the offer.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The result is that

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
the dummy variable

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
is the shape of the probability function.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
We take the coefficient

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
to measure the variations.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We can see that

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
only 30% of the variations

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
come from countries.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
This is not significant.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
We can see that

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
in the Ultimatum Game,

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
the proposal offer has a significant

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
variation between countries,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
but the acceptance rate is not significant.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
This also responds to

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Roth's conjecture in 1991.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Roth proposed a hypothesis

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
in 1991.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
In the Ultimatum Game,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
the cultural difference between

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
countries should be

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
reflected by

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
the proposal offer,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
but it does not affect

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
the acceptance rate.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
This is a very good

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
evidence

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
to respond to

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Roth's initial hypothesis.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Next, we look at

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
the variation between double options.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
We take two things,

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
the first one is the price.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
We look at the first round

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
of each market.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Then we look at

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
the first and last price

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
in the predicted market.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
We want to know

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
how the market price

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
is balanced.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
First, we look at

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
the first price of each market.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
We can see that

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
the first one is

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
only 27.3% of the variations

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
are not written.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
The second one,

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
we can see that

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
the first price

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
is very noisy

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
in some places

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
like Spain or Singapore.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Although the number of variations

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
is small,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
it causes the standard error

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
to be large.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
However,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
in other countries,

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
the standard error bar

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
is very small.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Moreover,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
every country can

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
predict the market price.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Next,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
if we look at

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
the overall price distribution,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
the first price

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
is about 0.33%.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
The second one is

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
only 14% of the overall price,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
so it is almost 60%.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
This tells us that

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
you may not know

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
the market price,

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
but you can

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
stabilize the balance.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
This is the reason

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
why many economists

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
like the market.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Even if you don't know anything,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
the market will tell you

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
what the balance looks like.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Finally,

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I want to summarize

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
with this video.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
In this project,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
we use the lab data

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
to predict the market price.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
In Ultimate Game,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
we can see that

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
more than 94% of the proposals

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
are below 50%.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Many proposals

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
are above the natural

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
poker point.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
In terms of acceptance rate,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
we see a 20% breakpoint.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
In the reaction,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
we see 10% more breakpoints.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
In response time,

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
it is the lowest

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
of the three.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Finally,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
no matter which of the three

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
we use,

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
accuracy,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
fluctuation,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
or efficiency

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
will all be calculated.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Finally,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
we can see that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
in Ultimate Game,

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
the proposal offer

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
has more breakpoints

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
than acceptance rate.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
This is in response to

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Roth's 1990 contracture.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Finally,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
if we compare Ultimate Game

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
with Double Option,

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
we can see a big difference

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
between the two countries.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
This is in response to

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Double Option is a very stable mechanism

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
in all countries.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I think this is all

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I want to say.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I will show my email.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
If you have any questions,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
we have about 5 minutes left.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Let's see what questions you want to ask.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Mr. He,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
do you want to comment?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Mr. He, please comment.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I want to ask

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
if you have any questions.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I will ask first.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Wait a minute.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The first question is for Mr. He.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Do you want to estimate

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
the result of long-term training?

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
There is a way.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
You can show us

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
the data

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
in the lab.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
If you only use the previous few rounds,

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
then you can estimate

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
the result of long-term training.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
This way,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
you can estimate the result of long-term training.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I'm not sure

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
how you estimate the result

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
of long-term training

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
in the country.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I'm not sure

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
how you estimate the result of long-term training.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I will talk about it first.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
No, no.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
What I mean is

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
what is the hypothesis

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
you want to verify.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
If it is a double auction,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
why do you

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
say that

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Asians are more polite?

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
No, what I want to say is

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
double auctions

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
in different places around the world

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
have similar results.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
However,

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
there is a big difference

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
between each country.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That's what I want to say.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Let me think about it.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Let me think about it.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
There is a problem here.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
You think the market

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
is universal.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
You think the market

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
is universal.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
You think the market

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
is universal.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
However,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
there is a problem here.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
There is a problem here.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
If you don't use the strategy method,

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
you can't see

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
the complete strategy

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
of the respondent.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
You think

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
what you see is

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
what you see is

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
acceptable or not,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
you can only explain

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
30% of the variation.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
However,

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
what is the actual strategy?

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I'm not sure

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
I'm not sure

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
where you can check.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
It is possible

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
that because

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
different countries

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
have already explained

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
most of the proposal

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
that is,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
everyone

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
has proposed

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
a social standard

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
that meets

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
the social standard

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
of the proposal.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
But that part

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
may be because it is all

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
hidden in the

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
proposal.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
This is also the point I want to talk about.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
This is also the point I want to talk about.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
OK.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Can I ask a question?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Can I ask a question?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Hi.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
0 and 100

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
0 and 100

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
0 and 100

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I agree with what Meng just said.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
I agree with what Meng just said.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
The default reaction time

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
The default reaction time

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
is a test

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
to see if it is a default effect.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
You said you have

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
experimental instructions.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
You said you have

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
experimental instructions.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Can you tell

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
which ones are

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
really incentivized?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Usually, the incentive for

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
an experiment is

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
how many points I give you

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
if you take part in the experiment.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
But I don't know what their design is like.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
But I don't know what their design is like.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Some may be related to

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
your test result.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Some may be related to

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
your test result.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Some may be related to

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
a participation experiment.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
But the result is not affected by it.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
But the result is not affected by it.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
You will see more than 100 points.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
You will see more than 100 points.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
You will see more than 100 points.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
It may be normal.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Because the result may be

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
a naive or unexpected behavior.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
a naive or unexpected behavior.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
About the more than 0 points,

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I think

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
it is a

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
inherent problem.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
In general, those who do experiments with

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
telecom all use

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Marbled.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Marbled.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't know whether it is right.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But, I think it is.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
What about after-graduate students?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
What about after- graduate students?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
What about after- graduate students?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
The third option is

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
the course of

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Ultimatum Gate.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
The third option is

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
the course of Ultimatum Gate.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The 3rd option is

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
for example,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
after-graduate students finish the course,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Gate is 0.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Then, they do the experiment.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Or, they do the experiment before the theoretical prediction.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
There is a difference.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
There is a difference.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because, after-graduate students do the experiment,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
the 3rd option

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
is the default of many people.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I know.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
We have seen

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
different courses.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The smallest course is the course of Game Theory.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
OK.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
This is a sample.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
OK.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
You can imagine

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
the degree of

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
interaction between

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
the scope of each course,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
this is Ludger' class.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Because we have a class name,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
So, we may roughly know the degree of interaction.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
The only difference is

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
after-shared theory prediction

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
of Ultimatum Gate is 0,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I can't see it.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
For 0 and 100,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
in the data of Google Earth,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
the two peaks

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
are very different.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So, I think

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
if you can

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
clear those data,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
or find the way

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
like just now,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
and then compare with the kink,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
OK.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Maybe it will be closer.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I don't know if it will affect.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
OK.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I have a notebook.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
OK.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
You ask first.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
OK. Thank you.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
This is not a question.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
It's more like a comment.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Since

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
you have the default option

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
bias,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
it seems to be a very serious thing.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
It will make your two curves

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and theory different.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
My idea is

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
whether you can...

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I don't know if it will be too difficult.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
When you change your program,

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
when you change your game,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
you make every starting point different.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You can choose a starting point

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
to solve your next problem.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Let me respond.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
This is technically

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
very simple.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
But there is another problem

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
in economics.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
There is a friction effect.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I'm afraid there will be an anchoring result.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So...

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Oh.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
If

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
your starting point is a very high offer,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
it is very likely that people will be affected

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
by that point.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
OK. My offer is higher.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
If my starting point is lower,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I may be affected by this point.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So we are...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
About this,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
we can't control

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
the standard time.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Usually,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the way to control the prediction effect

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
is to put $100

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
directly on the table.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Don't put it on both sides.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Put it one by one.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
OK.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
But

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
in their operation,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
they choose

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
to put it directly at the beginning.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So there will be a prediction effect.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But in terms of reaction time,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
the effect should be very small.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I have a response.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Or just change the interface

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
to fill in the numbers directly.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Don't use the LaBar method.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Of course,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
this is also possible.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But this may have to talk

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
to the engineer.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But this is also possible.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
But we want to change it.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
We want to use LaBar mainly to

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
make the picture interesting

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
and make consumers want to buy it.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I don't know why.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Everyone thinks LaBar is fun.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I don't know why.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Everyone likes LaBar.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
But there will be a lot of problems.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Of course.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
LaBar is because

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
a lot of people are operating

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
with a tablet.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
This is also...

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I have a question.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You say.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Hello.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You say.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
This question is like this.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
You know that Zhang Anping

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
is studying social psychology.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
They often play this kind of

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
game.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
But they like to do one thing,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
which is to manipulate the victim.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
For example, let you play the game first,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
then teach you game theory,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
then let you play the game,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
then look at the difference.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
But what they do more often is

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
to let you play the game first,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
then let you watch Hitler's documentary,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
do you try to manipulate the victim?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
This is what we can't do.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Because we...

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Because it means

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
different treatments for the victim.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We can compare the experimental group and the control group.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But we are basically because

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
we don't have an experimental group and a control group.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So this is what we can't do.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
There is no way to look at this information.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
But of course, if we are in the lab,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
it can be done completely.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But you can sell the product to the psychology department.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
This is what I am sure of.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
This is what I am sure of.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So now we are going to hire a psychologist.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I think this will be a pretty interesting tour.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Because they are indeed writing.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And they are going to write the first book

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
by themselves in MATLAB.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
In fact, I think the meeting is ugly.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That's what you're doing.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So I think there is

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
marketing potential.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I should tell the boss about this.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And science, in terms of science,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
is actually interesting, I think.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I want to tell the boss about this.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I want to tell the boss about this.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And Bozun,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
let me ask you again.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
As long as you can see

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
all the regions,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
you should be able to see which schools

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
use MATLAB, right?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Yes.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Do you have a proposal for

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
the education level or the income level?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
No income.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
But we have a division

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
for each school.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I want to say that the school itself is an income proxy.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It must be some library.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Yes.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But I haven't connected yet.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I haven't connected with the income in that area.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I propose that you can

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
take a look.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Because you have income data now.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
You have similar income or education

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
level data.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
You should be able to find it up there.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But don't give me homework, please.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
OK.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
In fact, if you have any

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
questions, I can't think of it now.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
You can e-mail me.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Or you can find me on Facebook.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Then...

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The small question I just wanted to ask is

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
that you said that

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
ROTH is between

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
the proposer and the responder.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
You said that the variation comes from the

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
proposer, which is the ROTH hypothesis.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Does this hypothesis come from

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
the observation of its data or from

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
some theory?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It comes from the observation of its data.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Because there are only four

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
countries, and each country basically

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
compares the last round of data.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So you're talking about

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
comparing 100 data points.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
So

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
for ROTH, it can't do

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
statistical analysis. It can only say

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
what the four distributions look like.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And what my observation looks like.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
OK.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
OK.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
So are there any questions

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
from the audience?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Our speech time is

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
almost over.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Can you stay for a while?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I want to talk to you.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Sure.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
OK.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That's all for today's speech.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Thank you.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Applause, please.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Thank you.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'll pause the recording.
