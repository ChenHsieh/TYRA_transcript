0	6000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Tera Talk.
6000	9000	We're honored to have Lin Weikai with us today.
9000	12000	Lin Weikai has been a good friend of mine for many years.
12000	17000	Lin Weikai is now a third-year PhD student at Cornell,
17000	19000	majoring in Computer Science.
19000	22000	Lin's research focuses on cryptography.
22000	26000	His main focus is on Oblivious algorithm.
26000	33000	This allows the algorithm to store data without revealing the content.
33000	38000	He majored in Chemistry when he was a college student.
38000	43000	He majored in Computer Science when he was a master's student.
43000	49000	He majored in Computer Science when he was a master's student.
49000	53000	Before his PhD,
53000	57000	he worked as a software engineer at Chengxin.
57000	60000	He also worked as a research assistant at the Central Academy of Sciences.
60000	66000	What Lin is going to talk about today is the concept of Oblivious algorithm.
66000	70000	But today, he's going to talk about a new definition of
70000	75000	the fairness of multiparty coin tossing.
75000	77000	Let's give him a round of applause.
77000	80000	By the way, remember to turn on the microphone when you clap.
80000	83000	Let's give him a round of applause.
88000	92000	Thank you for such a wonderful introduction.
92000	96000	The title is complicated,
96000	102000	but I assume most of you have heard of the theorem of the game.
102000	106000	Today's topic is
106000	112000	the concept of coin toss.
112000	117000	I'm going to talk about the relationship between coin toss and the theorem of the game.
117000	122000	This work was done by Zhong Kaimin at the Central Academy of Sciences.
122000	127000	Guo Yue, Rafael, and I are both at Cornell.
127000	134000	Cornell Tech is a campus at NYC.
135000	141000	Cornell has a new campus at NYC.
141000	147000	Let's talk about the topic of coin toss today.
147000	155000	The motivation of this research is very realistic.
155000	159000	Although I usually do theoretical research,
159000	162000	our motivation is very realistic.
162000	164000	What is the motivation?
164000	169000	Trump and Xi want to hold a summit.
169000	172000	Where will it be held?
172000	174000	Trump wants to hold it in DC.
174000	176000	Xi wants to hold it in Beijing.
176000	181000	If these two people can't get along,
181000	182000	what should they do?
182000	185000	The easiest way is to make a decision by tossing a coin.
185000	188000	If these two people can't get along,
188000	190000	how can they toss a coin?
190000	194000	This is a tricky question we are going to discuss today.
194000	197000	If these two people can't get along, how can they toss a coin?
197000	201000	Let's not talk about whether the coin toss will be fair or not.
201000	203000	If they can't get along,
203000	206000	if Trump tosses a coin here,
206000	208000	Xi won't believe it even if he doesn't see it.
208000	211000	So what should they do?
212000	215000	If I have a way to toss a coin,
215000	217000	a way to toss a coin remotely,
217000	219000	if the coin tosses out,
219000	220000	Xi is in DC,
220000	221000	Xi is in Beijing.
221000	224000	If the coin tosses out remotely is fair,
224000	226000	everyone will be happy.
226000	228000	Half and half chance.
228000	229000	In the game,
229000	232000	someone will tell you that there is a payoff.
232000	234000	What is the coin toss?
234000	240000	Which side has how many payoffs or utilities?
240000	243000	But let's not talk about this.
243000	247000	In history,
247000	251000	there is a hotline between the United States and the Soviet Union.
251000	253000	Maybe there is also a hotline between Trump and Xi.
253000	256000	If they don't meet, they can talk on the phone.
256000	259000	If there is a question in the middle,
259000	261000	you can interrupt me at any time.
261000	266000	I hope everyone can understand what I am talking about today.
266000	268000	If you don't understand,
268000	270000	don't be afraid.
270000	272000	Try to ask.
272000	276000	The purpose of the hotline is that
276000	278000	you say one sentence, I say one sentence,
278000	281000	and the other party can hear what I say.
281000	283000	Then there is nothing else.
283000	286000	So the hotline can't help you directly
286000	288000	toss a coin.
288000	290000	It's not such a good thing.
290000	292000	But what can the hotline do?
292000	296000	The hotline can communicate on both sides.
296000	298000	After the communication,
298000	302000	the hotline may have an output.
302000	304000	B is equal to 0 or B is equal to 1.
304000	306000	It's the same side.
306000	308000	The hotline can do this.
308000	311000	It can help you create a random variable.
311000	313000	Its value is 0 or 1.
313000	315000	The probability is 0.5 or 0.5.
315000	319000	What I want is to get a random variable.
319000	323000	It's a random variable defined by math.
324000	330000	If you are familiar with the random variables defined by math,
330000	334000	or you've heard of it in class,
334000	339000	I have a way to get the two sides to toss a coin.
339000	341000	How do you do it?
341000	343000	Trump throws a coin first.
343000	345000	The coin is 1.
345000	349000	Then Trump says to Xi on the phone,
349000	351000	my coin is 1.
351000	353000	Then Xi says,
353000	355000	I got it.
355000	357000	Your coin is 1.
357000	360000	Then both sides agree that the coin is 1.
360000	367000	If Trump throws a fair coin,
367000	370000	this method may work.
370000	373000	But Xi is obviously not happy.
373000	375000	If Trump is a bad guy,
375000	377000	and he didn't throw the coin at all,
378000	383000	it's not a good thing for Xi.
383000	386000	He won't agree with the result of the coin toss.
386000	393000	Don't say that Trump made a mistake at the beginning,
393000	395000	and made it unfair.
395000	399000	Even if he made a very complicated LeTouJi,
399000	401000	and recorded it,
401000	403000	and sent it to Xi through a hotline,
403000	408000	Xi won't believe it.
408000	414000	If Trump didn't cheat,
414000	416000	it may work.
416000	418000	But neither side believes each other.
418000	420000	This is a common problem in cryptography.
420000	422000	If neither side doesn't believe each other,
422000	424000	what should we do?
425000	428000	A long time ago,
428000	434000	there was a technology called commit.
434000	440000	Trump first calculated a number X
440000	445000	using SHA.
445000	447000	Then he told Xi.
447000	449000	This thing is called commit.
449000	451000	Xi said,
451000	453000	you calculated X, I calculated Y,
453000	455000	and then E.
455000	457000	Then Trump said,
457000	459000	my X is below E,
459000	461000	and then he made a mess.
461000	465000	In order to hide the E at the beginning.
465000	467000	Then these two sides,
467000	469000	X and Y, XOR,
469000	473000	is the result of the coin toss.
473000	475000	In cryptography,
475000	477000	these two things are simplified
477000	479000	into commit and open.
479000	481000	That is,
481000	483000	he wrote an X,
483000	487000	and then sealed it in the envelope to Xi.
487000	489000	After Xi received it,
489000	491000	he opened the envelope.
491000	493000	The purpose of the envelope
493000	495000	is to prevent the person
495000	499000	who wrote the envelope from changing.
500000	503000	The person who received the envelope
503000	505000	can't see it for the time being.
505000	507000	This is called commit and open.
507000	509000	In the past...
509000	511000	I have a question.
511000	513000	Does this hotline
513000	515000	have a rule
515000	517000	that you have to do it one by one?
517000	519000	Can't you say it at the same time?
519000	521000	If you say it at the same time,
521000	523000	everyone says 1, 2, 3,
523000	525000	and I say 1 or 0,
525000	527000	and everyone says XOR.
527000	529000	This is a very good question.
529000	531000	But because everyone doesn't believe it,
531000	533000	they might say it slowly.
533000	535000	So...
535000	537000	This hotline
537000	539000	has a rule
539000	541000	that you have to do it one by one.
541000	543000	You can't say it at the same time.
543000	545000	You can't say it at the same time.
545000	547000	I should say that
547000	549000	I didn't assume
549000	551000	that this hotline
551000	553000	had to do it one by one.
553000	555000	But Trump and Xi agreed
555000	557000	and...
557000	559000	If someone says it slowly,
559000	561000	what should you do?
561000	563000	Do it again?
563000	565000	Yes, yes.
565000	567000	Then it will be endless.
567000	569000	Okay, good.
569000	571000	Also,
571000	573000	when we imagine a hotline,
573000	575000	we can't judge
575000	577000	who says it slowly.
577000	579000	Because of the message delay,
579000	581000	we can't be sure
581000	583000	who says it slowly.
583000	585000	If we do it one by one,
585000	587000	we can be sure of the order.
587000	589000	Okay, got it.
589000	591000	So,
591000	593000	at the same time,
593000	595000	on the internet,
595000	597000	it's hard to judge.
599000	601000	This is a good question.
601000	603000	Let's say
603000	605000	all the protocols
605000	607000	are one by one.
607000	609000	And the order is...
609000	611000	Okay,
611000	613000	then,
613000	615000	this thing,
615000	617000	this commit and open,
617000	619000	if you have a good commit,
619000	621000	when you commit,
621000	623000	the other side can't be opened.
623000	625000	And the other side of the bus
625000	627000	can't be tampered with.
627000	629000	Then this thing,
629000	631000	this coin toss thing,
631000	633000	can be done fairly.
633000	635000	Because when it commits to x in advance,
635000	637000	it doesn't know what will happen to y.
637000	639000	And when it commits to y,
639000	641000	it doesn't know what x is.
641000	643000	So,
643000	645000	the result will be
645000	647000	fair.
647000	649000	And
649000	651000	we can be sure
651000	653000	the other side can't tamper with the result.
657000	659000	Then,
659000	661000	this thing,
661000	663000	we've been talking about fairness.
663000	665000	What kind of fairness
665000	667000	do we want?
667000	669000	The formal definition of
669000	671000	mathematics is
671000	673000	the expected value is 0.5.
673000	675000	The result of the commit is only 0 and 1.
675000	677000	And the probability is 0.5.
677000	679000	So the expected value is
679000	681000	0.5 times 0 plus 0.5 times 1
681000	683000	equals 0.5.
683000	685000	I want the expected value
685000	687000	to be exactly 0.5.
687000	689000	Then,
689000	691000	if you look at this thing carefully,
691000	693000	it's not exactly 0.5.
693000	695000	I'll talk about this later.
695000	697000	So it usually adds
697000	699000	a very small fraction,
699000	701000	negligible.
701000	703000	But let's leave it alone.
703000	705000	I just want 0.5.
705000	707000	Then,
707000	709000	this thing,
709000	711000	unfortunately,
711000	713000	in the
713000	715000	previous result,
715000	717000	a long time ago,
717000	719000	about 30 years ago,
719000	721000	what can't we do?
723000	725000	This
725000	727000	adversary,
727000	729000	like Trump or Xi,
729000	731000	can end
731000	733000	earlier.
733000	735000	This protocol is not finished yet.
735000	737000	He said I'm not going to play like this.
737000	739000	And
739000	741000	this adversary
741000	743000	is
743000	745000	only when there is a limited
745000	747000	computing power,
747000	749000	this
749000	751000	protocol,
751000	753000	this is easier for the protocol
753000	755000	to do.
755000	757000	Let's assume that Trump and Xi
757000	759000	have limited
759000	761000	computing power.
761000	763000	It's all polynomial time
763000	765000	algorithm.
765000	767000	This polynomial time,
767000	769000	you may not be familiar with it,
769000	771000	but
773000	775000	you can make a decision
775000	777000	within a few seconds.
779000	781000	Then
781000	783000	any
785000	787000	protocol like this,
787000	789000	in the result of this cliff,
789000	791000	it can design
791000	793000	an attacker to crack
793000	795000	any protocol.
795000	797000	So
797000	799000	to achieve the expected value
799000	801000	is exactly 0.5,
801000	803000	no protocol can do it.
803000	805000	The result is
805000	807000	such a strong impossibility.
807000	809000	That is to say,
809000	811000	no protocol can do this.
811000	813000	In this way,
813000	815000	let's take a look at this example.
815000	817000	Just
817000	819000	commit and open this example.
819000	821000	Here,
821000	823000	we are using the
823000	825000	new hash function.
825000	827000	It's not new, it's about
827000	829000	more than ten years.
829000	831000	So far, everyone still believes that SHA-256
831000	833000	is difficult to crack.
833000	835000	For example,
835000	837000	Bitcoin is still in use.
837000	839000	How to
839000	841000	crack it?
841000	843000	If
843000	845000	Xi's
845000	847000	computing power is
847000	849000	infinite,
849000	851000	he can easily
851000	853000	decrypt SHA-256x
853000	855000	which is equal to a certain number.
855000	857000	As long as he violently
857000	859000	tries all the x,
859000	861000	he can decrypt the x.
861000	863000	After Xi knows
863000	865000	the value of x,
865000	867000	he can choose a relative y
867000	869000	so that the result is what he likes.
869000	871000	For example, he likes 0.
871000	873000	0 represents Beijing.
873000	875000	So when he sees that the value of x is 1,
875000	877000	he chooses a y
877000	879000	so that the result is Beijing.
879000	881000	Trump doesn't know
881000	883000	that he was fooled.
883000	885000	He can only delete 1.
885000	887000	The result is what Xi wants.
887000	889000	This is
889000	891000	if
891000	893000	one of them
893000	895000	has
895000	897000	infinite computing power,
897000	899000	something may happen.
903000	905000	But
905000	907000	what I said last time
907000	909000	is even stronger.
909000	911000	Even if Xi only has
911000	913000	limited computing power,
913000	915000	he can still attack.
915000	917000	How effective
917000	919000	this attack method
919000	921000	can be?
921000	923000	It can make the expectation value
923000	925000	deviate
925000	927000	to any
927000	929000	deviation
929000	931000	to any
931000	933000	deviation
933000	935000	to any
935000	937000	deviation
937000	939000	to any
939000	941000	1 in three rounds.
941000	943000	So
943000	945000	1 in three rounds.
945000	947000	The number of attacks
947000	949000	is about 1 in three rounds.
949000	951000	This is a very powerful attack.
951000	953000	For example,
953000	955000	For example,
955000	957000	For example,
957000	959000	the attacker
959000	961000	has infinite computing power.
961000	963000	He can make
963000	965000	his expectation value
965000	967000	deviate to 0.5.
967000	969000	He can choose
969000	971000	what he wants.
971000	973000	But if he only has
973000	975000	limited computing power,
975000	977000	he can't
977000	979000	make the expectation value
979000	981000	deviate so much, but he can
981000	983000	deviate to a certain number,
983000	985000	which is 1 in three rounds.
985000	987000	I just gave a random number,
987000	989000	but according to this protocol,
989000	991000	it is about 1 in three rounds.
991000	993000	The expectation value is 1 in three rounds.
993000	995000	From 0.5 to 0.5 plus 1 in three rounds
995000	997000	is 0.8.
997000	999000	So
999000	1001000	the result of
1001000	1003000	cleave is very strong.
1003000	1005000	You can't make a fair copy.
1005000	1007000	Because no matter what protocol,
1007000	1009000	it can create an attacker.
1009000	1011000	Then
1011000	1013000	make an effective attack in a limited time.
1013000	1015000	Then
1015000	1017000	here
1017000	1019000	There is another thing
1019000	1021000	to talk about this attack.
1021000	1023000	This
1023000	1025000	What kind of
1025000	1027000	impact will it have at the beginning and end?
1027000	1029000	For example,
1029000	1031000	at the beginning, I talked about the simplest
1031000	1033000	protocol.
1033000	1035000	Trump threw a copper plate,
1035000	1037000	and Xi Jinping received it and
1037000	1039000	admitted that it was a copper plate.
1039000	1041000	He admitted the result of the copper plate.
1041000	1043000	This thing
1045000	1047000	has a fail-stop.
1047000	1049000	If one of them
1049000	1051000	can end early
1051000	1053000	and not late,
1053000	1055000	it is difficult to achieve
1055000	1057000	a fair result.
1057000	1059000	For example, Trump threw a copper plate,
1059000	1061000	and he saw this copper plate
1061000	1063000	was not what he liked.
1063000	1065000	He said, then I won't play.
1065000	1067000	Then
1067000	1069000	this
1069000	1071000	If you don't play, Xi Jinping
1071000	1073000	So far
1073000	1075000	we still assume that he is
1075000	1077000	honest
1077000	1079000	to follow the game rules at the beginning.
1079000	1081000	He received
1081000	1083000	a copper plate message
1083000	1085000	and then he
1085000	1087000	admitted that the message of the copper plate
1087000	1089000	was their consensus.
1089000	1091000	But
1091000	1093000	one of them is not late,
1093000	1095000	what is the other party's consensus?
1095000	1097000	This is
1097000	1099000	difficult to say.
1101000	1103000	In order to have a consensus,
1103000	1105000	we usually have to define
1105000	1107000	one of them
1107000	1109000	is not honest and not late.
1109000	1111000	What should the other party say?
1111000	1113000	Xi Jinping
1113000	1115000	threw a copper plate
1115000	1117000	and it was 0.5.
1117000	1119000	Or he has to
1119000	1121000	fix the output
1121000	1123000	0 or 1
1123000	1125000	It's hard to say.
1125000	1127000	Trump
1127000	1129000	can see what he is doing
1129000	1131000	honestly
1131000	1133000	and decide
1133000	1135000	when to end
1135000	1137000	and when not to end.
1137000	1139000	The entire output
1139000	1141000	is completely controlled
1141000	1143000	by the dishonest
1143000	1145000	party.
1145000	1147000	Then
1147000	1149000	there is no fairness
1149000	1151000	or
1151000	1153000	security.
1153000	1155000	The result of this copper plate
1155000	1157000	output
1157000	1159000	its fairness is the security
1159000	1161000	I want.
1161000	1163000	So
1163000	1165000	the focus here is
1165000	1167000	this
1167000	1169000	computationally bounded
1169000	1171000	the attacker's
1171000	1173000	computing power is limited
1173000	1175000	and it can end early
1175000	1177000	these two things.
1177000	1179000	If one of them is missing
1179000	1181000	we all know
1181000	1183000	we all know
1183000	1185000	it can be done
1185000	1187000	If I assume
1187000	1189000	the attacker will never
1189000	1191000	end early
1191000	1193000	then this copper plate
1193000	1195000	can be played
1195000	1197000	up to 0.5
1197000	1199000	but these two conditions
1199000	1201000	these two computationally bounded
1201000	1203000	and failstop
1203000	1205000	when these two conditions exist at the same time
1205000	1207000	we can't do it.
1207000	1209000	And the proof that we can't do it
1209000	1211000	is to really build a
1211000	1213000	attacker
1213000	1215000	and then target
1215000	1217000	any protocol
1217000	1219000	to attack.
1219000	1221000	So
1221000	1223000	but
1223000	1225000	but
1225000	1227000	when you look at the first page
1227000	1229000	you may find it
1229000	1231000	strange
1231000	1233000	if Trump can't end early
1233000	1235000	then Xi Jinping can
1235000	1237000	say I like to be in Beijing
1237000	1239000	then I will be in Beijing.
1239000	1241000	This is
1241000	1243000	another definition
1243000	1245000	of
1245000	1247000	the focus
1247000	1249000	Hello
1261000	1263000	Hello
1265000	1267000	Is my connection broken?
1269000	1271000	I can't hear you.
1271000	1273000	Ok
1273000	1275000	So
1275000	1277000	Can you hear me?
1277000	1279000	I can't hear you.
1279000	1281000	I can hear you.
1281000	1283000	But
1283000	1285000	I can't hear the speaker.
1285000	1287000	Ok
1287000	1289000	Ok
1295000	1297000	So the connection is broken.
1299000	1301000	Let me contact him.
1305000	1307000	Hello
1307000	1309000	Can you hear me?
1309000	1311000	I can hear you.
1311000	1313000	I can hear you.
1313000	1315000	I can hear you.
1315000	1317000	How are you?
1317000	1319000	I can't hear you.
1319000	1321000	I am scared.
1321000	1323000	I can't hear you.
1323000	1325000	I can't hear you.
1327000	1329020	So
1329020	1331020	I call you
1331020	1333020	because
1333020	1335020	I can't hear you.
1335020	1337020	I can't hear you.
1337020	1339020	I can't hear you.
1339020	1341020	I can't hear you.
1341020	1343020	Can you hear me?
1347020	1349020	I can hear you.
1349020	1351020	I can hear you.
1351020	1353020	I think my internet is down.
1353020	1355020	I don't know where I am.
1355020	1357020	I just
1357020	1359020	talk about
1359020	1361020	the commit and open
1361020	1363020	protocol can
1363020	1365020	protect
1365020	1367020	good people.
1367020	1369020	And
1369020	1371020	why this protocol
1371020	1373020	can protect good people?
1373020	1375020	If
1375020	1377020	one side
1377020	1379020	can't finish early,
1379020	1381020	the other side
1381020	1383020	will be happy to say
1383020	1385020	the other side is bad
1385020	1387020	so I can
1387020	1389020	protect my own interests
1389020	1391020	to protect the interests of good people.
1391020	1393020	So I will
1393020	1395020	produce the result
1395020	1397020	that good people like.
1397020	1399020	Because
1399020	1401020	the other side can't finish early.
1401020	1403020	And
1403020	1405020	this
1405020	1407020	is just
1407020	1409020	one example.
1409020	1411020	Of course, you can also
1411020	1413020	let the other side finish early
1413020	1415020	and Trump
1415020	1417020	will choose the result he likes.
1417020	1419020	This is another case.
1419020	1421020	In short,
1421020	1423020	the commit and open
1423020	1425020	protocol
1425020	1427020	can
1427020	1429020	guarantee
1429020	1431020	the
1431020	1433020	previous definition.
1435020	1437020	Even if
1437020	1439020	one side is attacking
1439020	1441020	and the other side's expectation
1441020	1443020	is still over 0.5,
1443020	1445020	the payoff is still over 0.5.
1445020	1447020	Because
1447020	1449020	the basic idea
1449020	1451020	is simple.
1451020	1453020	If one side can't finish early,
1453020	1455020	the other side will be happy
1455020	1457020	to choose the result he likes.
1457020	1459020	He can choose.
1459020	1461020	So
1461020	1463020	if one side can't finish early,
1463020	1465020	the other side is
1465020	1467020	a good person.
1467020	1469020	If a good person chooses the result he likes,
1469020	1471020	his expectation value will not be
1471020	1473020	reduced by bad people.
1475020	1477020	Is it okay
1477020	1479020	to go this far?
1479020	1481020	If it's okay,
1481020	1483020	it will be a little more complicated later.
1483020	1485020	But
1485020	1487020	the most important thing to define here
1487020	1489020	is to protect the expectation value of good people.
1489020	1491020	And the payoff
1491020	1493020	is the most important point.
1493020	1495020	First,
1495020	1497020	we need to define
1497020	1499020	what a good person is.
1499020	1501020	Second,
1501020	1503020	what a payoff is.
1503020	1505020	The payoff is
1505020	1507020	the protocol.
1507020	1509020	After running the result,
1509020	1511020	I look at the result and decide
1511020	1513020	how much benefit this result will bring me.
1513020	1515020	Then
1515020	1517020	I define
1517020	1519020	that I want to protect the interests of good people.
1519020	1521020	The expectation value is greater than a certain number.
1521020	1523020	Of course,
1523020	1525020	if I say a little more here,
1525020	1527020	the payoff
1527020	1529020	is completely
1529020	1531020	restricted to
1531020	1533020	the payoff function
1533020	1535020	defined by this example.
1537020	1539020	The payoff function itself is very simple.
1539020	1541020	But
1541020	1543020	in Game Theory,
1543020	1545020	there are many strange payoffs
1545020	1547020	that will make
1547020	1549020	these results strange.
1549020	1551020	But we won't discuss those today.
1551020	1553020	Even in my paper,
1553020	1555020	there is no way to discuss so much
1555020	1557020	because there are too many strange payoffs.
1557020	1559020	But the simplest
1559020	1561020	payoff function
1561020	1563020	is the focus
1563020	1565020	of this paper.
1567020	1569020	Okay,
1569020	1571020	next,
1571020	1573020	next,
1573020	1575020	well,
1575020	1577020	well,
1577020	1579020	well,
1579020	1581020	what you see here
1581020	1583020	is that there are only two players
1583020	1585020	and two parties
1585020	1587020	playing.
1587020	1589020	The two parties
1589020	1591020	can achieve
1591020	1593020	the fairness
1593020	1595020	in this
1595020	1597020	fairness in interest.
1597020	1599020	The result
1599020	1601020	may not be fair,
1601020	1603020	but the interest is fair.
1603020	1605020	Then we start.
1605020	1607020	But a very natural question is
1607020	1609020	when
1609020	1611020	you add one more person,
1611020	1613020	is there any way
1613020	1615020	to achieve
1615020	1617020	the fairness?
1617020	1619020	So we just
1619020	1621020	add one more person.
1621020	1623020	Then
1623020	1625020	I don't know if the third person
1625020	1627020	is Jin Xiaopang or
1627020	1629020	Putin.
1629020	1631020	Anyway, it's A, B, C.
1631020	1633020	Then
1633020	1635020	we assume the simplest
1635020	1637020	is
1637020	1639020	what kind of output
1639020	1641020	do these three people like
1641020	1643020	is public.
1643020	1645020	It's also public
1645020	1647020	who aborts early and
1647020	1649020	doesn't play early.
1649020	1651020	So if C aborts early
1651020	1653020	and doesn't play,
1653020	1655020	A and B will not play
1655020	1657020	sooner or later.
1657020	1659020	So let's assume
1659020	1661020	all the messages are public.
1661020	1663020	Maybe you can imagine
1663020	1665020	three hotlines or something.
1665020	1667020	Or
1667020	1669020	now this very popular
1669020	1671020	blockchain
1671020	1673020	messages are all public.
1673020	1675020	So if one of them doesn't play
1675020	1677020	or if one of them sends
1677020	1679020	a message, the other two can
1679020	1681020	know at the same time.
1681020	1683020	One of the possible applications
1683020	1685020	may be
1685020	1687020	eating dumplings and tigers
1687020	1689020	on the blockchain.
1689020	1691020	But how do these three people define
1691020	1693020	eating dumplings and tigers?
1693020	1695020	You can also say
1695020	1697020	the result of
1697020	1699020	eating dumplings and tigers
1699020	1701020	is 1.
1701020	1703020	If the person who chose 1
1703020	1705020	is 1,
1705020	1707020	then he won.
1707020	1709020	If the person who chose 0 is 0,
1709020	1711020	he also won.
1711020	1713020	Of course, this payoff is not
1713020	1715020	0.3. So in some cases,
1717020	1719020	the seller of
1719020	1721020	eating dumplings and tigers may lose money.
1721020	1723020	And the loser is not ABC.
1723020	1725020	It's the one who
1725020	1727020	opened the casino.
1727020	1729020	This is just
1729020	1731020	one example.
1731020	1733020	But
1735020	1737020	in terms of game theory,
1737020	1739020	there are many
1739020	1741020	forms of this game.
1741020	1743020	But for now,
1743020	1745020	let's focus
1745020	1747020	on this
1747020	1749020	simplest example.
1749020	1751020	I just want to
1751020	1753020	ask
1753020	1755020	to protect the
1755020	1757020	real
1757020	1759020	interest.
1759020	1761020	Can we do this?
1761020	1763020	Then
1763020	1765020	this definition
1765020	1767020	we call it Maximin.
1767020	1769020	Maximin is also
1769020	1771020	a terminology borrowed
1771020	1773020	from game theory.
1773020	1775020	In the game,
1775020	1777020	Maximin means
1781020	1783020	everyone
1783020	1785020	maximizes
1785020	1787020	their own
1787020	1789020	interest.
1789020	1791020	I want to
1791020	1793020	minimize
1793020	1795020	my own interest.
1795020	1797020	Basically,
1797020	1799020	it means
1799020	1801020	when others maximize
1801020	1803020	their interest,
1803020	1805020	I want to maximize
1805020	1807020	my own interest.
1807020	1809020	Why is it called Maximin?
1809020	1811020	Because if one side is maximized
1811020	1813020	and the other side is minimized.
1813020	1815020	Anyway,
1815020	1817020	intuition
1817020	1819020	means
1819020	1821020	I want to protect good people.
1821020	1823020	Good people
1823020	1825020	are people who play according to the rules of the game.
1825020	1827020	The interest of good people
1827020	1829020	should be greater than or equal to 0.5.
1829020	1831020	This is the expectation value.
1831020	1833020	After this thing is defined,
1833020	1835020	the first question we ask is
1835020	1837020	whether it can be done.
1837020	1839020	Of course, there are other definitions
1839020	1841020	of Maximin.
1841020	1843020	Some are very natural.
1843020	1845020	Some may seem
1845020	1847020	unnatural in some scenarios.
1847020	1849020	But we'll talk about it
1849020	1851020	later.
1851020	1853020	For now,
1853020	1855020	let's focus on
1855020	1857020	the definition of
1857020	1859020	protecting good people's interests.
1861020	1863020	Let's pause here.
1863020	1865020	Is this definition clear?
1865020	1867020	My definition is
1867020	1869020	that my protocol
1869020	1871020	should protect good people's interests.
1871020	1873020	This is my definition.
1873020	1875020	Then I ask
1875020	1877020	whether this protocol
1877020	1879020	can be constructed
1879020	1881020	to protect good people's interests.
1881020	1883020	I have a question.
1883020	1885020	You said
1885020	1887020	we should protect
1887020	1889020	according to the rules of the game.
1889020	1891020	This is a starting point
1891020	1893020	of your research.
1893020	1895020	I can understand this.
1895020	1897020	The concept of
1897020	1899020	protecting good people's interests
1899020	1901020	is translated to
1901020	1903020	greater than or equal to 0.5
1903020	1905020	for the expected payoff
1905020	1907020	of honesty.
1907020	1909020	You said your game
1909020	1911020	is not zero-sum.
1911020	1913020	Is greater than or equal to 0.5
1913020	1915020	greater than or equal to 0.5?
1915020	1917020	You asked
1917020	1919020	a good question.
1919020	1921020	I don't write
1921020	1923020	a quantifier here.
1923020	1925020	For example,
1925020	1927020	A, B, C are all honest.
1927020	1929020	They all follow the rules of the game.
1929020	1931020	Then
1931020	1933020	everyone's
1933020	1935020	expected value is 0.5.
1935020	1937020	So you will ask
1937020	1939020	the total expected value is 0.5.
1939020	1941020	So I
1941020	1943020	don't have a quantifier here.
1943020	1945020	It's just that
1945020	1947020	every honest is greater than 0.5.
1949020	1951020	Oh, I see.
1951020	1953020	I define
1953020	1955020	it as
1955020	1957020	A, B, C
1957020	1959020	all follow the rules of the game.
1959020	1961020	But they
1961020	1963020	may not
1963020	1965020	care about each other.
1965020	1967020	They may not like each other.
1967020	1969020	But they all follow the rules of the game.
1969020	1971020	They are all good people.
1971020	1973020	So the better way
1973020	1975020	is that
1975020	1977020	if I follow the rules of the game,
1977020	1979020	it's my best choice
1979020	1981020	among the players.
1985020	1987020	This question
1987020	1989020	will become another definition.
1989020	1991020	What you just said will become another definition.
1993020	1995020	So we'll
1995020	1997020	discuss it later.
1997020	1999020	OK, thank you.
1999020	2001020	OK, so
2001020	2003020	if
2003020	2005020	this definition
2005020	2007020	is not a problem,
2007020	2009020	then we can
2009020	2011020	discuss
2011020	2013020	a simple example.
2013020	2015020	When everyone
2015020	2017020	wants the result to be
2017020	2019020	1, or everyone
2019020	2021020	wants the result to be 0,
2021020	2023020	then
2023020	2025020	this thing
2025020	2027020	is extremely simple.
2027020	2029020	This thing
2029020	2031020	is extremely simple.
2031020	2033020	As long as
2033020	2035020	everyone sees
2035020	2037020	the same side number,
2037020	2039020	then everyone outputs
2039020	2041020	the same side number.
2041020	2043020	As long as everyone sees
2043020	2045020	the same side number,
2045020	2047020	then everyone outputs 1.
2047020	2049020	Then everyone is happy.
2049020	2051020	For example,
2051020	2053020	if everyone wants the result
2053020	2055020	to be 1,
2055020	2057020	then everyone outputs 1.
2057020	2059020	The dealer
2059020	2061020	in the casino is not happy,
2061020	2063020	but the rules of the game
2063020	2065020	are set.
2065020	2067020	The players are happy
2067020	2069020	because everyone can win.
2069020	2071020	But this example is not very interesting.
2071020	2073020	Because
2073020	2075020	if
2075020	2077020	Trump, Xi and Putin
2077020	2079020	all want to go to DC,
2079020	2081020	then
2081020	2083020	they don't need to discuss this thing.
2083020	2085020	They are happy to go to DC.
2085020	2087020	So
2087020	2089020	this case is not interesting.
2089020	2091020	Let's change to
2091020	2093020	a more complicated one.
2093020	2095020	If one of the players
2095020	2097020	has a different side number,
2097020	2099020	he is a minority.
2099020	2101020	But
2101020	2103020	I assume
2103020	2105020	the bad guy who doesn't follow the rules of the game
2105020	2107020	can only do one thing,
2107020	2109020	which is
2109020	2111020	he can't play earlier.
2111020	2113020	I also have
2113020	2115020	a slightly more complicated
2115020	2117020	rule of the game
2117020	2119020	that can protect
2119020	2121020	the interests of good people.
2121020	2123020	How to do this rule of the game?
2123020	2125020	It's very simple.
2125020	2127020	Let the minority throw the coin.
2127020	2129020	After throwing the coin,
2129020	2131020	he tells the result of the coin
2131020	2133020	to the other two players.
2133020	2135020	Then the other two players
2135020	2137020	are very happy to receive the coin.
2137020	2139020	Then the game is over.
2139020	2141020	Why
2141020	2143020	can this rule of the game
2143020	2145020	protect the interests of good people?
2145020	2147020	Because
2147020	2149020	this game only forces
2149020	2151020	one person to speak from the beginning to the end,
2151020	2153020	which is the minority.
2153020	2155020	If the minority
2155020	2157020	speaks,
2157020	2159020	he follows the rules of the game.
2159020	2161020	If he wants to speak,
2161020	2163020	he must follow the rules of the game.
2163020	2165020	Otherwise, he will shut up.
2165020	2167020	If he speaks,
2167020	2169020	it means he follows the rules of the game.
2169020	2171020	This coin is also
2171020	2173020	fair.
2173020	2175020	After the other two players
2175020	2177020	receive the coin,
2177020	2179020	they follow the rules of the game.
2179020	2181020	Because
2181020	2183020	everything is fair
2183020	2185020	according to the rules of the game.
2185020	2187020	If the only person
2187020	2189020	who speaks
2189020	2191020	does not follow the rules of the game,
2191020	2193020	how can he not follow the rules of the game?
2193020	2195020	He can only
2195020	2197020	shut up.
2197020	2199020	He does not say what he should say.
2199020	2201020	This is his only way
2201020	2203020	not to follow the rules of the game.
2203020	2205020	When A and C see B
2205020	2207020	do not follow the rules of the game,
2207020	2209020	they are happy to decide that B is a bad person.
2209020	2211020	A and C can be happy to say
2211020	2213020	that we do not care
2213020	2215020	about the loss of the bad person.
2215020	2217020	We just follow our happiness.
2217020	2219020	So
2219020	2221020	what I just
2221020	2223020	talked about
2223020	2225020	is to prove
2225020	2227020	that the rules of the game
2227020	2229020	can easily protect
2229020	2231020	the interests of good people.
2231020	2233020	So
2233020	2235020	if the only thing
2235020	2237020	bad people can do
2237020	2239020	is not to play,
2239020	2241020	this thing is also easy to do.
2241020	2243020	Just
2243020	2245020	as I just said,
2245020	2247020	throw a coin, send a message,
2247020	2249020	and it's over.
2249020	2251020	But
2251020	2253020	these examples
2253020	2255020	of Trump and Xi
2255020	2257020	or Putin
2257020	2259020	are not like this.
2259020	2261020	They may
2261020	2263020	not follow the rules of the game,
2263020	2265020	not throw a coin,
2265020	2267020	so
2267020	2269020	the previous one, B
2269020	2271020	threw a coin and sent a message,
2271020	2273020	this thing is
2273020	2275020	that the bad guy
2275020	2277020	may not follow this rule at all.
2277020	2279020	And
2279020	2281020	if he doesn't follow this rule,
2281020	2283020	then
2283020	2285020	he can't protect
2285020	2287020	the interests of good people.
2287020	2289020	This is what we call
2289020	2291020	random
2291020	2293020	input.
2293020	2295020	This is what we call
2295020	2297020	random input.
2297020	2299020	This is what we call
2299020	2301020	random input.
2301020	2303020	Everything is not fair
2303020	2305020	when it is tampered with.
2305020	2307020	And
2307020	2309020	And
2309020	2311020	And
2311020	2313020	the main difficulty
2313020	2315020	of this project is
2315020	2317020	to discuss
2317020	2319020	whether this case
2319020	2321020	is fair
2321020	2323020	to Maximin.
2323020	2325020	And
2325020	2327020	And
2327020	2329020	We
2329020	2331020	We
2331020	2333020	spent a lot of time
2333020	2335020	We spent a lot of time
2335020	2337020	discussing whether he can do it or not.
2337020	2339020	We can't think of a way
2339020	2341020	to really do this thing
2341020	2343020	to protect
2343020	2345020	honest players.
2345020	2347020	But we can't prove
2347020	2349020	that he can't do it.
2349020	2351020	So we can't do this thing.
2351020	2353020	At the beginning,
2353020	2355020	we thought he could do it.
2355020	2357020	The reason is
2357020	2359020	The reason is
2359020	2361020	The reason is
2361020	2363020	When bad guys
2363020	2365020	When bad guys
2365020	2367020	are restricted,
2367020	2369020	there is a solution.
2369020	2371020	There are
2371020	2373020	many technologies
2373020	2375020	on traditional documents
2375020	2377020	that allow
2377020	2379020	that allow
2379020	2381020	a simple example
2381020	2383020	that allows a simple example
2383020	2385020	to resist
2385020	2387020	the restricted bad guys.
2387020	2389020	And then,
2389020	2391020	we get a
2391020	2393020	cryptographic operation
2393020	2395020	and get a
2395020	2397020	protocol that
2397020	2399020	the bad guys are not restricted
2399020	2401020	but still safe.
2401020	2403020	This is called the game rule.
2403020	2405020	Because
2405020	2407020	there are a lot of experiences in our documents,
2407020	2409020	we can upgrade
2409020	2411020	this security
2411020	2413020	in different situations.
2413020	2415020	So when we first
2415020	2417020	saw this problem,
2417020	2419020	we can upgrade
2419020	2421020	the security
2421020	2423020	with what we already know
2423020	2425020	or what we already know
2425020	2427020	in the documents.
2427020	2429020	But
2429020	2431020	later on,
2431020	2433020	we moved more documents
2433020	2435020	and finally proved that
2435020	2437020	it can't be done.
2437020	2439020	And
2439020	2441020	especially
2441020	2443020	the bad guys
2443020	2445020	can't be done
2445020	2447020	like
2447020	2449020	what I said earlier
2449020	2451020	about the result of cleave.
2451020	2453020	We really built
2453020	2455020	a
2455020	2457020	limited time attacker
2457020	2459020	a polynomial time attacker
2459020	2461020	to attack
2461020	2463020	any
2463020	2465020	protocol like this.
2465020	2467020	And
2467020	2469020	the middle proof is more complicated.
2469020	2471020	I won't talk about it.
2471020	2473020	But
2473020	2475020	the point is
2475020	2477020	these protocols
2477020	2479020	can't be done
2479020	2481020	in a lot of situations.
2481020	2483020	And the proof
2483020	2485020	is
2485020	2487020	the proof
2487020	2489020	taught in high school or
2489020	2491020	university math class.
2491020	2493020	The technical details
2493020	2495020	in the middle
2495020	2497020	are skipped.
2497020	2499020	But I think
2499020	2501020	this
2501020	2503020	thing
2503020	2505020	should be
2505020	2507020	conveyed.
2507020	2509020	I defined
2509020	2511020	a
2511020	2513020	so-called
2513020	2515020	fair board
2515020	2517020	for a
2517020	2519020	specific payoff function.
2519020	2521020	This is very specific.
2521020	2523020	I have countless payoff functions.
2523020	2525020	Only this
2525020	2527020	payoff function
2527020	2529020	can't be
2529020	2531020	fair.
2531020	2533020	Maybe other payoff functions can.
2533020	2535020	Because
2535020	2537020	some payoff functions
2537020	2539020	are easy to do.
2539020	2541020	For example, if everyone's payoff looks the same,
2541020	2543020	it may
2543020	2545020	degenerate to a
2545020	2547020	case I just discussed.
2547020	2549020	And
2549020	2551020	the so-called
2551020	2553020	profit of the city
2553020	2555020	is defined
2555020	2557020	in this way.
2557020	2559020	So there must be
2559020	2561020	some way to define
2561020	2563020	the profit.
2563020	2565020	But even in such a simple way
2565020	2567020	to define
2567020	2569020	the profit,
2569020	2571020	there is still
2571020	2573020	no way to
2573020	2575020	protect the profit.
2575020	2577020	This is the message
2577020	2579020	I want to convey.
2579020	2581020	And
2581020	2583020	one more thing.
2583020	2585020	Even if
2585020	2587020	the attacker has limited computing power,
2587020	2589020	it still can't be protected.
2589020	2591020	If your attacker
2591020	2593020	has very limited
2593020	2595020	computing power,
2595020	2597020	you still can't
2597020	2599020	protect the city's
2599020	2601020	profit.
2601020	2603020	So
2603020	2605020	what I just said
2605020	2607020	is back to the first example.
2607020	2609020	Where should
2609020	2611020	Trump and Xi meet?
2611020	2613020	They can decide.
2613020	2615020	But
2615020	2617020	when one person becomes the third person,
2617020	2619020	and Putin is added,
2619020	2621020	there is no way to
2621020	2623020	protect the city's profit.
2623020	2625020	This is the
2625020	2627020	biggest message
2627020	2629020	I want to convey.
2629020	2631020	There must be
2631020	2633020	one or two people
2633020	2635020	whose profits will be damaged.
2635020	2637020	And
2637020	2639020	the witness here
2639020	2641020	is very complicated.
2641020	2643020	But
2643020	2645020	it's just a simple
2645020	2647020	expected value calculation.
2647020	2649020	But there are a few more turns.
2649020	2651020	But
2651020	2653020	I won't
2653020	2655020	talk about
2655020	2657020	the details.
2661020	2663020	So
2663020	2665020	to sum up,
2665020	2667020	more than three people
2667020	2669020	can be grouped
2669020	2671020	into
2671020	2673020	a larger
2673020	2675020	organization.
2675020	2677020	For example,
2677020	2679020	if I have
2679020	2681020	ten people,
2681020	2683020	I can group
2683020	2685020	them into
2685020	2687020	three large groups.
2687020	2689020	If
2689020	2691020	the three large groups
2691020	2693020	correspond to
2693020	2695020	what I just said,
2695020	2697020	they still can't
2697020	2699020	do it.
2699020	2701020	Or if I can
2701020	2703020	correspond to two people,
2703020	2705020	I can tell you
2705020	2707020	the result of
2707020	2709020	Cliff earlier.
2709020	2711020	So
2711020	2713020	this...
2713020	2715020	Actually I was going to ask
2715020	2717020	if you keep saying
2717020	2719020	you have three parties
2719020	2721020	and you want to generalize
2721020	2723020	what N-Party will do.
2723020	2725020	Intuitively,
2725020	2727020	it makes sense.
2727020	2729020	If you can group them
2729020	2731020	into three parties,
2731020	2733020	you can reduce the problem.
2733020	2735020	But if you say
2735020	2737020	the bad guys
2737020	2739020	can be grouped
2739020	2741020	into a group of bad guys,
2741020	2743020	you still have to assume
2743020	2745020	the bad guys
2745020	2747020	are good to each other.
2747020	2749020	They are honest.
2749020	2751020	So the shared information
2751020	2753020	is what they are doing.
2753020	2755020	They know
2755020	2757020	each other is breaking the rule.
2757020	2759020	Yes.
2763020	2765020	Your question is very good.
2765020	2767020	So I will
2767020	2769020	jump a little bit
2769020	2771020	to talk about
2771020	2773020	high-level.
2773020	2775020	I assume
2775020	2777020	the bad guys
2777020	2779020	I mentioned
2779020	2781020	are
2781020	2783020	good guys
2783020	2785020	and bad guys.
2785020	2787020	The bad guys
2787020	2789020	have
2789020	2791020	a common...
2791020	2793020	What is it called?
2793020	2795020	For example,
2795020	2797020	they have
2797020	2799020	a bad guy
2799020	2801020	controlling them.
2801020	2803020	So your question is
2803020	2805020	maybe
2805020	2807020	the bad guys A
2807020	2809020	and bad guys B
2809020	2811020	have different interests.
2811020	2813020	So they
2813020	2815020	control each other.
2815020	2817020	So far,
2817020	2819020	I assume
2819020	2821020	the bad guys A
2821020	2823020	and bad guys B
2823020	2825020	have a bad guy leader.
2825020	2827020	Maybe he is not
2827020	2829020	in the game.
2829020	2831020	But he is the leader of the bad guys.
2831020	2833020	He controls all the bad guys.
2833020	2835020	All the bad guys
2835020	2837020	cooperate with each other.
2839020	2841020	So
2841020	2843020	for the
2843020	2845020	bad guys
2845020	2847020	or good guys
2847020	2849020	two or three
2849020	2851020	should be
2851020	2853020	easy to explain.
2853020	2855020	Did I answer your question?
2855020	2857020	Yes.
2857020	2859020	It's the same as I thought.
2859020	2861020	OK. Thank you.
2861020	2863020	I will talk about
2863020	2865020	the bad guys A
2865020	2867020	and bad guys B.
2867020	2869020	Sometimes,
2869020	2871020	the bad guys A and bad guys B
2871020	2873020	don't always
2873020	2875020	have the same leader.
2875020	2877020	But
2877020	2879020	to sum up,
2879020	2881020	most examples
2881020	2883020	can't be used
2883020	2885020	to protect
2885020	2887020	the good guys.
2887020	2889020	Unless
2889020	2891020	the problem is simple.
2891020	2893020	Only one
2893020	2895020	person has different preferences.
2895020	2897020	And the bad guy is very limited.
2897020	2899020	He can only
2899020	2901020	play. He can't do anything else.
2901020	2903020	Only a small piece
2903020	2905020	can be
2905020	2907020	justified.
2907020	2909020	The justification defined
2909020	2911020	under Maximine
2911020	2913020	can only be justified
2913020	2915020	by a small piece.
2915020	2917020	The rest can't be justified.
2917020	2919020	It's quite sad.
2919020	2921020	Just now,
2921020	2923020	the host
2923020	2925020	asked
2925020	2927020	some good questions.
2927020	2929020	For example,
2929020	2931020	I defined
2931020	2933020	that the good guys' interests can't be damaged.
2933020	2935020	My starting point is to protect the good guys' interests.
2935020	2937020	The other starting point
2937020	2939020	is more like
2939020	2941020	game theory's
2941020	2943020	Nash Equilibrium.
2943020	2945020	The so-called bad guys
2945020	2947020	or corrupt parties
2947020	2949020	must have
2949020	2951020	a certain economic motivation
2951020	2953020	to do bad things
2953020	2955020	to break the rules.
2955020	2957020	This is
2957020	2959020	another
2959020	2961020	definition.
2961020	2963020	This definition is very natural.
2963020	2965020	For example,
2965020	2967020	I defined a set of game rules
2967020	2969020	in a certain game.
2969020	2971020	Even if
2971020	2973020	there is a
2973020	2975020	bad guy controlling
2975020	2977020	certain people,
2977020	2979020	he becomes a bad guy.
2979020	2981020	But the bad guys
2981020	2983020	controlled by the boss
2983020	2985020	don't have to
2985020	2987020	listen to the boss.
2987020	2989020	They have to
2989020	2991020	listen to
2991020	2993020	the boss
2993020	2995020	to increase
2995020	2997020	their own interests.
2997020	2999020	Then,
2999020	3001020	Nash Equilibrium
3001020	3003020	requires
3003020	3005020	the boss
3005020	3007020	to increase
3007020	3009020	the interests of the bad guys.
3009020	3011020	This is
3011020	3013020	very difficult
3013020	3015020	for the boss.
3015020	3017020	Especially,
3017020	3019020	for example,
3019020	3021020	what I said
3021020	3023020	from the beginning is that
3023020	3025020	the output is only 0 or 1.
3025020	3027020	Your preference
3027020	3029020	is only 0 or 1.
3029020	3031020	If the boss
3031020	3033020	controls both
3033020	3035020	0 and 1,
3035020	3037020	the boss
3037020	3039020	can't
3039020	3041020	satisfy
3041020	3043020	both sides.
3043020	3045020	Because
3045020	3047020	one side's interest increases,
3047020	3049020	and the other side's interest decreases.
3051020	3053020	So,
3053020	3055020	this definition is
3055020	3057020	called Strong Nash.
3057020	3059020	Strong Nash is borrowed
3059020	3061020	from Nash Equilibrium.
3061020	3063020	But in fact,
3063020	3065020	this definition is easier
3065020	3067020	to achieve than Maximine.
3067020	3069020	Because the boss
3069020	3071020	can do less
3071020	3073020	and receive more restrictions.
3079020	3081020	So,
3081020	3083020	it's very easy
3083020	3085020	to be fair
3085020	3087020	under this definition.
3087020	3089020	I don't know
3089020	3091020	if the boss is a bad guy,
3091020	3093020	or a good guy.
3093020	3095020	As long as the two sides
3095020	3097020	have different preferences,
3097020	3099020	let them play
3099020	3101020	what I said at the beginning.
3101020	3103020	One side commits
3103020	3105020	X,
3105020	3107020	the other side
3107020	3109020	decides a random Y,
3109020	3111020	and the other side
3111020	3113020	commits at the beginning,
3113020	3115020	opens the envelope
3115020	3117020	and decides what X1 and X2 are.
3117020	3119020	Everyone
3119020	3121020	listens to them.
3121020	3123020	No matter how many people are there,
3123020	3125020	10, 100, 1000,
3125020	3127020	as long as two people
3127020	3129020	are working.
3129020	3131020	This thing
3131020	3133020	is easy to prove.
3133020	3135020	Just list all the conditions
3135020	3137020	and it can be proved that
3137020	3139020	this game rule
3139020	3141020	can achieve
3141020	3143020	Strong Nash.
3143020	3145020	The boss can't
3145020	3147020	increase
3147020	3149020	the benefits of the boss.
3157020	3159020	Let's go back to the first page.
3161020	3163020	If you think about it,
3163020	3165020	you will find
3165020	3167020	these two definitions
3167020	3169020	are exactly the same
3169020	3171020	in 2Party.
3171020	3173020	Because in 2Party,
3173020	3175020	there are only two people.
3175020	3177020	In 2Party,
3177020	3179020	under this payoff,
3179020	3181020	it is a completely zero-sum game.
3181020	3183020	The situation of the two people
3183020	3185020	is symmetrical.
3185020	3187020	So the payoff of the bad guy
3187020	3189020	is equal to
3189020	3191020	the payoff of the good guy.
3191020	3193020	This was established
3193020	3195020	in Zero-sum.
3195020	3197020	In the case of two people,
3197020	3199020	there is only one bad guy
3199020	3201020	and one good guy.
3201020	3203020	So these two definitions are exactly the same.
3203020	3205020	But in 3 or 4 people,
3205020	3207020	or more people,
3207020	3209020	these two definitions are completely different.
3209020	3211020	One is
3211020	3213020	almost impossible.
3213020	3215020	The other is
3215020	3217020	almost possible.
3217020	3219020	This is a big difference.
3223020	3225020	In addition to these two definitions,
3225020	3227020	in my paper,
3227020	3229020	I will consider
3229020	3231020	other definitions.
3231020	3233020	Maybe more natural, maybe more complicated,
3233020	3235020	I don't know.
3235020	3237020	The first one is
3237020	3239020	the benefits of good people alone.
3239020	3241020	In the case of Group,
3241020	3243020	I don't consider the benefits alone.
3243020	3245020	I consider the benefits of all good people
3245020	3247020	to be added.
3247020	3249020	The benefits of good people
3249020	3251020	to be reduced
3251020	3253020	or the benefits of bad people
3253020	3255020	to be added.
3255020	3257020	There may be different
3257020	3259020	situations.
3259020	3261020	For example,
3261020	3263020	when the boss controls
3263020	3265020	a group of bad guys,
3265020	3267020	he may add all the benefits of the bad guys
3267020	3269020	and divide them.
3269020	3271020	This may be
3271020	3273020	a suitable
3273020	3275020	model for discussion.
3275020	3277020	For example,
3277020	3279020	the feasibility of these two
3279020	3281020	is between Maximin
3281020	3283020	and StrongNash.
3283020	3285020	These four definitions
3285020	3287020	are a bit complicated,
3287020	3289020	so I won't talk about them all.
3291020	3293020	Anyway,
3293020	3295020	in the case of
3295020	3297020	only two people,
3297020	3299020	these definitions are equivalent.
3299020	3301020	In the case of two people,
3301020	3303020	the total is equal to the individual.
3303020	3305020	In the case of zero-sum,
3305020	3307020	the increase of bad people
3307020	3309020	is equal to the decrease of good people.
3309020	3311020	So these four definitions
3311020	3313020	are the same
3313020	3315020	in the case of two people.
3315020	3317020	However,
3317020	3319020	they are completely different
3319020	3321020	in the case of more than three people.
3323020	3325020	If you have learned
3325020	3327020	or seen
3327020	3329020	some game theory,
3329020	3331020	you will
3331020	3333020	immediately think of
3333020	3335020	the question just asked by the host.
3335020	3337020	There are
3337020	3339020	various settings in game theory,
3339020	3341020	such as the payoff function.
3341020	3343020	Maybe the payoff function
3343020	3345020	I just gave is not the most natural.
3345020	3347020	In some cases,
3347020	3349020	the payoff of zero-sum is more natural.
3351020	3353020	Or in some cases,
3353020	3355020	what kind of outcome
3355020	3357020	does everyone like?
3359020	3361020	What kind of outcome
3361020	3363020	does everyone like?
3363020	3365020	Where does Trump like to meet?
3365020	3367020	Where does Xi like to meet?
3367020	3369020	Maybe
3369020	3371020	the payoff function
3371020	3373020	is not the most natural.
3373020	3375020	Maybe it's private.
3375020	3377020	Everyone doesn't know.
3377020	3379020	This is a more natural setting.
3379020	3381020	In some cases,
3381020	3383020	it may be like this.
3383020	3385020	Of course,
3385020	3387020	from the beginning to the end,
3387020	3389020	I only talked about
3389020	3391020	throwing a coin.
3391020	3393020	Then this coin has only two sides,
3393020	3395020	0 or 1.
3395020	3397020	Then the coin becomes a dice.
3397020	3399020	0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
3399020	3401020	Or I want to do something more complicated.
3401020	3403020	For example,
3403020	3405020	Trump and Xi want to
3405020	3407020	add their salaries together.
3407020	3409020	Something like this.
3411020	3413020	These are all questions
3413020	3415020	that can be discussed in depth.
3417020	3419020	But there are a lot of questions
3419020	3421020	that can be studied.
3421020	3423020	This paper
3423020	3425020	only discussed a small part of
3425020	3427020	the blue ones.
3427020	3429020	So this is
3429020	3431020	the coin toss I talked about today.
3431020	3433020	Thank you everyone
3433020	3435020	for taking the time to listen to me.
3435020	3437020	Thank you.
3439020	3441020	Please turn on the microphone.
3441020	3443020	Let's give a round of applause
3443020	3445020	to our speaker today.
3449020	3451020	Do you have any questions?
3453020	3455020	No.
3459020	3461020	Let me ask you a question.
3461020	3463020	This question is not
3463020	3465020	related to the content of the lecture.
3465020	3467020	Did you publish this paper?
3467020	3469020	Or did you throw it away?
3469020	3471020	Do you want to
3471020	3473020	write down the title of the paper
3473020	3475020	and some other information
3475020	3477020	that we can find,
3477020	3479020	such as the date of the paper
3479020	3481020	and so on.
3481020	3483020	Then it will be recorded.
3483020	3485020	If you are interested,
3485020	3487020	you can look for it.
3487020	3489020	How can I write it?
3489020	3491020	I don't know.
3491020	3493020	You can jump back to your PowerPoint.
3493020	3495020	Okay.
3495020	3497020	Just type it here.
3497020	3499020	We can see it now.
3499020	3501020	Wait for me.
3501020	3503020	Text box.
3503020	3505020	Okay.
3505020	3507020	Now we are typing the text.
3507020	3509020	Do you have any questions?
3509020	3511020	Do you have any comments?
3515020	3517020	You can ask some basic questions.
3517020	3519020	For example,
3519020	3521020	what do you study
3521020	3523020	and so on.
3525020	3527020	I have an interesting question.
3527020	3529020	Of course,
3529020	3531020	this is the most fundamental
3531020	3533020	scenario.
3533020	3535020	Then we can
3535020	3537020	think about
3537020	3539020	a special example.
3539020	3541020	But now you...
3541020	3543020	Let me think.
3543020	3545020	So what you just said
3545020	3547020	is basically
3547020	3549020	your maximum
3549020	3551020	and the two parties below
3551020	3553020	are two extremes.
3553020	3555020	They can be discussed.
3555020	3557020	But those in the middle
3557020	3559020	are in, for example,
3559020	3561020	how many parties do bad people have?
3561020	3563020	Are the interests of bad people
3563020	3565020	completely the same?
3565020	3567020	In these cases,
3567020	3569020	your conclusion
3569020	3571020	is related to
3571020	3573020	N,
3573020	3575020	how many good people and bad people
3575020	3577020	are assigned to each other.
3577020	3579020	What is the relationship between them?
3579020	3581020	Will it affect your conclusion?
3581020	3583020	Yes.
3583020	3585020	I...
3585020	3587020	I just posted
3587020	3589020	the conference here.
3589020	3591020	I will jump back to my PowerPoint.
3591020	3593020	It is...
3597020	3599020	In...
3599020	3601020	In Max and Min,
3601020	3603020	the simple case
3603020	3605020	is that
3605020	3607020	when greater than or equal to 3,
3607020	3609020	it is impossible.
3609020	3611020	In the middle,
3611020	3613020	the group Max and Min
3613020	3615020	is the same as Max and Min,
3615020	3617020	greater than or equal to 3,
3617020	3619020	it is impossible.
3619020	3621020	It is related to N.
3621020	3623020	Three people can't do it,
3623020	3625020	or four people can't do it.
3625020	3627020	In the middle,
3627020	3629020	no matter how many people can do it,
3629020	3631020	it is related to N.
3633020	3635020	Does this answer the question?
3635020	3637020	Yes.
3637020	3639020	Actually, this is just the beginning of my question.
3639020	3641020	I should say that
3641020	3643020	I also expect that
3643020	3645020	this thing is related to N,
3645020	3647020	and N will affect your conclusion.
3647020	3649020	If this is the case,
3649020	3651020	it is closer to
3651020	3653020	the realistic situation.
3653020	3655020	For example,
3655020	3657020	how do you study in computer science?
3657020	3659020	Do you calculate one by one?
3659020	3661020	Or do you use
3661020	3663020	Monte Carlo
3663020	3665020	to use empirical methods
3665020	3667020	to conclude
3667020	3669020	some relationships,
3669020	3671020	such as the relationship with N,
3671020	3673020	or what is the solution
3673020	3675020	under some threshold,
3675020	3677020	what do you usually do?
3677020	3679020	So,
3679020	3681020	the question asked by the host
3681020	3683020	is more like
3683020	3685020	I have
3685020	3687020	a set of definitions
3687020	3689020	on the left,
3689020	3691020	a set of
3691020	3693020	maybe it is the sky,
3693020	3695020	maybe it is
3695020	3697020	some
3697020	3699020	realistic
3699020	3701020	problem motivator
3701020	3703020	definition,
3703020	3705020	a set of
3705020	3707020	motivator definitions,
3707020	3709020	how do I discuss
3709020	3711020	or
3711020	3713020	how do I discuss
3713020	3715020	the definition on the left
3715020	3717020	whether it can be done
3717020	3719020	or not,
3719020	3721020	especially
3721020	3723020	in this
3723020	3725020	current
3725020	3727020	talk discussion
3727020	3729020	it is
3729020	3731020	related to N,
3731020	3733020	and how
3733020	3735020	to say
3735020	3737020	how much can be done
3737020	3739020	and how much can't be done.
3739020	3741020	In this
3741020	3743020	work,
3743020	3745020	there is
3745020	3747020	no good way.
3747020	3749020	In the middle,
3749020	3751020	every case
3751020	3753020	where N is greater than
3753020	3755020	how much can't be done,
3755020	3757020	is used
3757020	3759020	to
3759020	3761020	transform
3761020	3763020	to make another statement
3763020	3765020	N is greater than how much can't be done.
3765020	3767020	For example,
3767020	3769020	at the beginning,
3769020	3771020	N is greater than 2,
3771020	3773020	the first result is
3773020	3775020	the lower bound of cleave.
3775020	3777020	The following
3777020	3779020	is to
3779020	3781020	extend
3781020	3783020	the first
3783020	3785020	cleave's
3785020	3787020	impossibility
3787020	3789020	to 3 and 4.
3795020	3797020	In this example,
3797020	3799020	there is no good way.
3799020	3801020	There may be
3801020	3803020	other examples,
3803020	3805020	but
3805020	3807020	these definitions
3807020	3809020	are
3809020	3811020	the definitions of
3811020	3813020	cleave.
3813020	3815020	We
3815020	3817020	don't have
3817020	3819020	these continuous
3819020	3821020	or
3821020	3823020	continuous
3823020	3825020	or functional
3825020	3827020	mathematical tools
3827020	3829020	to use.
3829020	3831020	For example,
3831020	3833020	I asked
3833020	3835020	if there is
3835020	3837020	Monte Carlo
3837020	3839020	or experiments
3839020	3841020	to prove
3841020	3843020	those
3845020	3847020	experimental
3847020	3849020	methods,
3849020	3851020	we usually
3851020	3853020	avoid them.
3853020	3855020	Because
3855020	3857020	experimental methods
3857020	3859020	are difficult to prove.
3859020	3861020	Even if there are
3861020	3863020	only 3 or 4 small numbers,
3863020	3865020	it is not possible
3865020	3867020	to prove.
3867020	3869020	So,
3869020	3871020	we
3871020	3873020	rarely use them.
3873020	3875020	Maybe
3875020	3877020	we don't know
3877020	3879020	how to use them
3879020	3881020	to prove them.
3881020	3883020	Our
3883020	3885020	proof
3885020	3887020	is here.
3887020	3889020	It is more
3889020	3891020	comprehensive.
3891020	3893020	We calculate the probability.
3893020	3895020	After that,
3895020	3897020	we use...
3897020	3899020	For example,
3899020	3901020	here,
3901020	3903020	we calculate the expectation
3903020	3905020	and the probability.
3905020	3907020	Then, we use the average
3907020	3909020	to conclude
3909020	3911020	whether it is possible or not.
3917020	3919020	I see.
3919020	3921020	Thank you.
3921020	3923020	Do you have any questions?
3923020	3925020	Hello.
3925020	3927020	I have a question.
3927020	3929020	Please go ahead.
3929020	3931020	I still don't understand.
3933020	3935020	Can you
3935020	3937020	explain
3937020	3939020	how to
3939020	3941020	reduce
3941020	3943020	3 to 3?
3943020	3945020	How to reduce
3945020	3947020	almost
3947020	3949020	and malicious
3949020	3951020	to 3?
3951020	3953020	This
3953020	3955020	is a good question.
3957020	3959020	It is very simple.
3959020	3961020	Let's assume
3961020	3963020	n is equal to 4.
3963020	3965020	If n is equal to 4,
3965020	3967020	in this line,
3967020	3969020	unanimous
3969020	3971020	is the same.
3971020	3973020	Almost is one less.
3973020	3975020	Only one less.
3975020	3977020	If n is equal to 4,
3977020	3979020	it is...
3979020	3981020	I just type it.
3981020	3983020	It is 0, 1,
3983020	3985020	1, 1.
3985020	3987020	It is 0, 1, 1.
3987020	3989020	Of course,
3989020	3991020	it is symmetric.
3991020	3993020	0 may be in one person.
3993020	3995020	We don't know.
3995020	3997020	We don't care.
3997020	3999020	It is 0, 1, 1.
3999020	4001020	Then,
4001020	4003020	you have to ask
4003020	4005020	whether
4005020	4007020	there is a rule
4007020	4009020	that allows 4 people
4009020	4011020	to protect
4011020	4013020	the interests of honest people.
4013020	4015020	Let's assume
4015020	4017020	there is a rule
4017020	4019020	that allows
4019020	4021020	4 people
4021020	4023020	to protect
4023020	4025020	the interests of honest people.
4025020	4027020	What do we do?
4027020	4029020	We do
4029020	4031020	that
4031020	4033020	I don't care
4033020	4035020	whether 1, 1, 1, 1 is a good person or a bad person.
4035020	4037020	I tie
4037020	4039020	the two people
4039020	4041020	who like 1 together.
4041020	4043020	It is
4043020	4045020	a person.
4045020	4047020	It is
4047020	4049020	a fatter person.
4049020	4051020	They all like 1.
4051020	4053020	The fatter person
4053020	4055020	likes 1.
4055020	4057020	If
4057020	4059020	there is a rule that allows
4059020	4061020	4 people to protect
4061020	4063020	the interests of honest people,
4063020	4065020	I tie
4065020	4067020	the two people who like 1 together.
4067020	4069020	Then,
4069020	4071020	they
4071020	4073020	play according to the rules of 4 people.
4073020	4075020	I don't care
4075020	4077020	whether it is a good person or a bad person.
4077020	4079020	After
4079020	4081020	I tie
4081020	4083020	the two people together,
4083020	4085020	there are only 3 people left.
4085020	4087020	Their preferences
4087020	4089020	are 0, 1, 1.
4089020	4091020	Their preferences are 1.
4091020	4093020	So, I tie
4093020	4095020	their preferences to 1.
4097020	4099020	If
4099020	4101020	there is a rule that allows
4101020	4103020	4 people to protect the interests of honest people,
4103020	4105020	it is a rule
4105020	4107020	that allows 3 people
4107020	4109020	to protect the interests of honest people.
4109020	4111020	Okay.
4111020	4113020	Okay.
4113020	4115020	It feels like a math problem.
4115020	4117020	Yes.
4117020	4119020	It's what we often do.
4119020	4121020	We don't have a good tool.
4121020	4123020	Is it the same
4123020	4125020	for other preferences?
4125020	4127020	Do you tie all 0s
4127020	4129020	and 1s together?
4129020	4131020	This question
4131020	4133020	is a good question.
4133020	4135020	We tie
4135020	4137020	0s and 1s together.
4137020	4139020	Then, we tie
4139020	4141020	other 0s and 1s together.
4141020	4143020	Why do we tie like this?
4143020	4145020	It's because
4145020	4147020	Cliff's result said
4147020	4149020	that
4149020	4151020	when you play
4151020	4153020	with two parties,
4153020	4155020	you must have a way
4155020	4157020	to make them leave
4157020	4159020	0.5.
4159020	4161020	I don't know
4161020	4163020	if it's from 0.5 to 1
4163020	4165020	or from 0.5 to 0.
4165020	4167020	But there must be one side.
4167020	4169020	I don't know which side it is.
4169020	4171020	He didn't tell you.
4171020	4173020	But after
4173020	4175020	tying 0s and 1s together,
4175020	4177020	if it's one side,
4177020	4179020	in my definition of
4179020	4181020	maximum,
4181020	4183020	it will definitely hurt
4183020	4185020	one of the 0s and 1s.
4185020	4187020	Because 0s and 1s are tied together.
4187020	4189020	Okay.
4189020	4191020	It doesn't matter which side it is.
4191020	4193020	So,
4193020	4195020	I can get
4195020	4197020	a contradiction like this.
4197020	4199020	Okay.
4199020	4201020	It's amazing.
4201020	4203020	The thing is that
4203020	4205020	you can go down
4205020	4207020	a few pages.
4207020	4209020	I don't remember.
4209020	4211020	Go down again.
4211020	4213020	This is also right.
4213020	4215020	The method of
4215020	4217020	strong Nash equilibrium
4217020	4219020	is that you call a 0 and
4219020	4221020	a 1 out.
4221020	4223020	Then they are tied together.
4223020	4225020	The reason why this method
4225020	4227020	can't be used in Max and Min
4227020	4229020	is that you may choose
4229020	4231020	0 and 1.
4231020	4233020	One of them is a bad guy.
4235020	4237020	I'll cut it here.
4241020	4243020	I sent two representatives
4243020	4245020	to point at the board.
4247020	4249020	Why this thing
4249020	4251020	doesn't work
4251020	4253020	in Max and Min?
4253020	4255020	The question is like this.
4255020	4257020	The definition of Max and Min
4257020	4259020	is that
4259020	4261020	the benefits of good people
4261020	4263020	can't be harmed.
4263020	4265020	So,
4265020	4267020	in the definition of Max and Min,
4269020	4271020	the bad guy doesn't care
4271020	4273020	about his own benefits.
4273020	4275020	The bad guy
4275020	4277020	can lose money.
4277020	4279020	But the good guy
4279020	4281020	just wants to harm the good guy maliciously.
4281020	4283020	For example,
4283020	4285020	the red one is the bad guy
4285020	4287020	and the green one is the good guy.
4287020	4289020	Can you tell the difference?
4289020	4291020	The red one is the bad guy
4291020	4293020	and the green one is the good guy.
4293020	4295020	I can tell at the beginning.
4299020	4301020	Sometimes the color is not enough.
4301020	4303020	Because some people
4303020	4305020	have color blindness.
4307020	4309020	There are three bad guys
4309020	4311020	and two good guys.
4311020	4313020	If the bad guy just wants to harm
4313020	4315020	the good guy maliciously,
4315020	4317020	he can point to the bad guy
4317020	4319020	and the good guy will like him.
4319020	4321020	Then he will be harmed.
4321020	4323020	He doesn't care.
4323020	4325020	The good guy is happy.
4325020	4327020	But as long as the good guy is not happy,
4327020	4329020	Max and Min won't work.
4331020	4333020	So, this thing
4333020	4335020	doesn't work in Max and Min.
4335020	4337020	Does it have anything to do with
4337020	4339020	the question
4339020	4341020	the host asked at the beginning?
4341020	4343020	Do I consider
4343020	4345020	all the benefits of the good guy
4345020	4347020	or the benefits of the good guy
4347020	4349020	individually?
4349020	4351020	My strictest condition
4351020	4353020	is that I can't harm
4353020	4355020	every benefit of the good guy.
4355020	4357020	So, Max and Min
4357020	4359020	can't harm every good guy.
4359020	4361020	Yes.
4365020	4367020	This is a difficult question.
4367020	4369020	The definition
4369020	4371020	is tricky.
4371020	4373020	There will be a lot of groups
4373020	4375020	after the number of people.
4377020	4379020	I have a question
4379020	4381020	that is unrelated.
4381020	4383020	If
4383020	4385020	there is
4385020	4387020	something
4387020	4389020	that is completely random
4389020	4391020	and everyone agrees that it is random.
4391020	4393020	For example,
4393020	4395020	there is a quantum stack.
4395020	4397020	For example, the radiation of the sun.
4397020	4399020	This is also possible.
4399020	4401020	But you have to observe
4401020	4403020	the same thing in two places.
4403020	4405020	Yes.
4405020	4407020	There is
4407020	4409020	something called quantum entanglement.
4411020	4413020	Do you know this?
4413020	4415020	I know.
4415020	4417020	There are two examples.
4417020	4419020	For example,
4419020	4421020	they have to spin up together
4421020	4423020	and spin down together.
4423020	4425020	I assign these two
4425020	4427020	to two people
4427020	4429020	who are far away.
4429020	4431020	They observe this example.
4431020	4433020	Spin up
4433020	4435020	means one place.
4435020	4437020	Spin down means another place.
4437020	4439020	In this way,
4439020	4441020	can we solve this problem?
4441020	4443020	We don't need these protocols.
4443020	4445020	There will be
4445020	4447020	some ways
4447020	4449020	that you can operate.
4449020	4451020	Actually,
4451020	4453020	I know entanglement,
4453020	4455020	but I'm not familiar
4455020	4457020	with how to do it.
4457020	4459020	For example,
4459020	4461020	you mentioned that
4461020	4463020	you have to create two examples
4463020	4465020	that have entanglement.
4465020	4467020	I'm not
4467020	4469020	familiar with it.
4469020	4471020	Can we
4471020	4473020	do this entanglement
4473020	4475020	in advance
4475020	4477020	and
4477020	4479020	bias to
4479020	4481020	one side?
4481020	4483020	I'm not sure.
4483020	4485020	Maybe.
4485020	4487020	It seems that
4487020	4489020	we need some proof
4489020	4491020	to prove that
4491020	4493020	the entanglement
4493020	4495020	we created at the beginning
4495020	4497020	is fair.
4497020	4499020	I really don't know.
4499020	4501020	I just heard it.
4501020	4503020	After creating the entanglement,
4503020	4505020	you have to give
4505020	4507020	these two entanglement to two people.
4509020	4511020	In this
4511020	4513020	long-distance definition,
4513020	4515020	it may not be
4515020	4517020	very suitable.
4517020	4519020	I don't know if there is a better explanation
4519020	4521020	that it can't be done.
4521020	4523020	But you have to
4523020	4525020	give two bits
4525020	4527020	to two people,
4527020	4529020	or give two examples to two people.
4529020	4531020	Actually,
4531020	4533020	it doesn't
4533020	4535020	go well with this
4535020	4537020	definition.
4537020	4539020	Why don't I
4539020	4541020	create an entanglement
4541020	4543020	and give the result to two people?
4543020	4545020	OK.
4545020	4547020	It makes sense.
4547020	4549020	It doesn't seem that
4549020	4551020	it can be solved.
4551020	4553020	But I think
4553020	4555020	there is room for discussion.
4555020	4557020	Because some
4557020	4559020	can prove
4559020	4561020	that the entanglement
4561020	4563020	is fair.
4563020	4565020	Another thing
4565020	4567020	I want to ask is
4567020	4569020	at the beginning,
4569020	4571020	what I said
4571020	4573020	is that
4573020	4575020	1, 2, 3,
4575020	4577020	everyone says a number at the same time,
4577020	4579020	and then X, O, 2.
4579020	4581020	Why can't
4581020	4583020	everyone
4583020	4585020	say X, O, 2
4585020	4587020	at the same time
4587020	4589020	and then
4589020	4591020	say the number?
4591020	4593020	If it's
4593020	4595020	more than 12 o'clock,
4595020	4597020	you lose.
4597020	4599020	It's the same with fail-stop.
4599020	4601020	Fail-stop means
4601020	4603020	if you are slow,
4603020	4605020	you lose.
4605020	4607020	Yes, but
4607020	4609020	I think
4609020	4611020	at the same time,
4611020	4613020	it's difficult in practice.
4613020	4615020	One is in China,
4615020	4617020	the other is in the U.S.
4617020	4619020	The distance is
4619020	4621020	quite far.
4621020	4623020	The transmission message
4623020	4625020	may also have a delay
4625020	4627020	of 0.0 seconds.
4627020	4629020	0.0 seconds
4629020	4631020	plus
4631020	4633020	on the food,
4633020	4635020	if the light
4635020	4637020	is directly
4637020	4639020	connected,
4639020	4641020	it may be OK.
4641020	4643020	But the network on the food
4643020	4645020	has passed many host
4645020	4647020	and the delay
4647020	4649020	may be almost 1 second.
4649020	4651020	You can't be sure
4651020	4653020	how much time is there.
4653020	4655020	59 minutes and 59 seconds.
4655020	4657020	Is 1 second enough?
4657020	4659020	Or
4659020	4661020	too much
4661020	4663020	will be a bit slow.
4663020	4665020	It's hard to decide.
4665020	4667020	At the same time,
4667020	4669020	this is mainly
4669020	4671020	difficult to do on the food.
4671020	4673020	So people think
4673020	4675020	if you can't do it
4675020	4677020	or you can't prove it,
4677020	4679020	you give up.
4683020	4685020	Failstuff
4685020	4687020	also requires a time.
4687020	4689020	Yes, failstuff
4689020	4691020	is...
4691020	4693020	Yes, failstuff is...
4693020	4695020	Let me put it this way.
4695020	4697020	At the same time,
4697020	4699020	the rules are tight.
4699020	4701020	At the same time,
4701020	4703020	after my message
4703020	4705020	is sent out,
4705020	4707020	it takes at least
4707020	4709020	1 second to send it.
4709020	4711020	It may not work if I arrive early.
4711020	4713020	Because if I arrive early,
4713020	4715020	there will be a relatively slow output.
4717020	4719020	It won't work if I arrive late.
4719020	4721020	Is it slow output
4721020	4723020	or is it
4723020	4725020	slow? I don't know.
4725020	4727020	But failstuff
4727020	4729020	has a relatively large
4729020	4731020	range.
4731020	4733020	I can
4733020	4735020	arrive in 0 seconds
4735020	4737020	or 10 minutes.
4739020	4741020	So the range is relatively large.
4741020	4743020	If I can't wait for you for 10 minutes
4743020	4745020	and you haven't sent it out,
4745020	4747020	it's just
4747020	4749020	1 second
4749020	4751020	or 1 minute
4751020	4753020	to send it out.
4753020	4755020	So the
4755020	4757020	condition is
4757020	4759020	strictly
4759020	4761020	weak.
4765020	4767020	Very interesting talk. Thank you.
4767020	4769020	Thank you.
4769020	4771020	Actually,
4771020	4773020	it's been more than 10 minutes.

4775020	4777020	the microphone again.
