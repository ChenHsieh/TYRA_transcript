00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am honored to be able to introduce Dr. Sun today.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Dr. Sun completed her bachelor's degree from 1999 to 2013

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Taiwan University.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After completing her bachelor's degree from 2003 to 2005,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
she completed her master's degree in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the same university in Taiwan.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
She then completed her Ph.D. degree from 2005 to 2010 at Purdue University.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Her major is Chemical Biology.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
After completing her Ph.D. degree, she went to MIT to do her postdoc.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
After four years, she went to UCSF to do her second postdoc and assistant researcher.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This year, she started her new job as a Senior Scientific Researcher at Genentech.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Today, Dr. Sun is going to talk about

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Use Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Tackle Complex Biology.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now, let's welcome Dr. Sun to give her presentation.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Sun.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry, my voice is a bit hoarse due to my cold.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today, I am going to talk in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Just in case, some of you may not have a background in biology.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I hope you can at least learn about Single-Cell RNA-Seq.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here is my personal email and LinkedIn account.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Although my LinkedIn account is not up to date,

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
please feel free to connect with me.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will be speaking in Chinese today,

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
but I am not sure what the term is in Chinese.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want to make it too complicated.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will be focusing on technology.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am currently working at a company,

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so I can't really talk about research projects here.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will try my best to talk about the applications of this technology,

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and the principles behind it.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I hope this will be helpful to those who are interested.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Before we get into the technology,

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will briefly review the biology of NTU.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
As you may already know, our body is made up of cells.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Many cells form organs,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and eventually form organs in our body,

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
becoming a functional human body.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
An interesting fact is that our body is composed of over 20 different types of cells.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can see that their forms and functions are very different.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For example, there are nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells,

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and even different types of cells in different organs.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Their functions and forms are very different.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's take a deeper look.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
As you can see, our body is made up of cells.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Each cell has a nucleus,

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
which is a red dot.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In English, it's called a nucleus.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In Chinese, it's called a cell nucleus.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In this cell nucleus, there is a chromosome.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This chromosome is made up of our genes.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think everyone has a concept of genes.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Genes are our genetic material.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Genes are our genetic material,

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and they can determine our body functions.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Generally speaking, genes are basically DNA fragments.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They can be converted into useful molecules,

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
which can perform the functions required by our body.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We usually talk about gene decoding or gene encryption.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The main reason is that DNA is composed of a series of ATCG,

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
which is a double helix structure made up of four different genes.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Generally speaking, if we talk about gene decoding,

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the sequence you get may be composed of four ATCG

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
in different ways.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is our so-called gene code.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
In molecular biology, there is a so-called central dogma.

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's the principle that we have this genetic material.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Its main structure is DNA,

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
which is transcribed into RNA.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
RNA is further transcribed into protein.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Protein can perform various biological functions.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
As time goes by,

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the central dogma is gradually extended to more different forms.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We can even find more different directions from the virus or other systems.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Today's technology involves a discovery.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In the past, we thought that DNA was transcribed into RNA.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Later, scientists found another molecule

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that allows RNA to reverse transcribe back to the DNA.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because of the help of this molecule,

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
many related extension technologies can be built on this basis.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Today, we are going to talk about RNAseq.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In other words, transcriptome analysis,

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
or gene expression profiling,

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
we can use genes to understand human physiology.

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This picture shows a major timeline and milestone in molecular biology and sequencing technology.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In 1953, the first discovery of DNA double-stranded structure was made.

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In 1977, Sanger's DNA sequencing was developed.

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Later, PCR technology was also developed.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
PCR technology allows us to rapidly increase our DNA in the lab.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Many related technologies can be built on this basis.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In 1990, the Human Genome Project was launched.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
After 13 years, the Human Genome Project was established.

93
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
At this stage, the sequencing cost was still very high.

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It was difficult to operate the sequencing project in the lab.

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
In 2005, the Next Generation Sequencing was introduced.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Next Generation Sequencing is a next-generation sequencing technology.

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This technology has greatly reduced the cost of sequencing.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
More and more Genome Projects related to sequencing can be carried out more smoothly in labs.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Up to now, Next Generation Sequencing technology is still widely used.

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In recent years, the Third Generation Sequencing technology has been introduced.

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When was Single Cell RNAse developed?

102
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Single Cell RNAse was first reported in 2009.

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Single Cell RNAse is a technology that is becoming more and more mature.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Single Cell RNAse is a technology that is becoming more and more mature.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Many advanced protocols, technologies, and companies continue to develop rapidly in this field.

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why do we need to do Single Cell RNAse?

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Before Single Cell RNAse, we can look at gene profiling.

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

109
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

110
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

112
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

113
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:08,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

114
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.
