00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Mengchang, and I am a student at Mata University.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
What I want to talk about today is about 4-way mixing and squeeze light.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
If you have any questions at any time, you can ask, just turn on your microphone.

00:22.000 --> 00:33.000
My field is in the field of atomic physics, which is relatively low-energy physics.

00:33.000 --> 00:44.000
Our research unit is JQI, which is the United States Department of State.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
It is a rather special institution, which is under the Department of Commerce in the United States.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Although they don't sound like they are doing this kind of specialized research,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
they have actually won four Nobel Prizes in atomic physics.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
So it's a pretty special national standard.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
My instructor is Paul Leitz.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Our main source of research funding is from the Air Force in the United States.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
At the beginning, I want to let everyone know what squeezing means.

01:25.000 --> 01:51.000
We want to compress all the information into a better measurement.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
After watching the video, let's get down to business.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
The experiment we are doing now is using laser light.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
The characteristic of laser light is that it is a coherent state.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
What is a coherent state?

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't know if you've heard of it.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm sure you've heard of the non-coherent principle.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
The non-coherent principle tells us that we can't...

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
We used to think that the results of delta x and delta t must be greater than h-bar.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
We can imagine that our laser light has a so-called non-coherent property.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
Non-coherent property means that it has its government amplitude and its horizontal axis.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Both of these can't be measured very accurately in practice.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
That is to say, it has its limits.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
You can see that when our laser light is in coherent state,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Basically, it's always in coherent state.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
When it's in coherent state, you'll see its...

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Its FN or phase fluctuation is actually...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Its result is in...

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
That is to say, the curve on the left represents the line that meets the non-coherent principle.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Mathematically, we know that when your delta...

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
My y-axis is delta e, and my x-axis is delta phi.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
If these two variables are in the minimum value,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
When the two are equal, they are actually in their so-called minimum value.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Laser light is when these two values are equal.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Then it presents such a coherent state.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
So what is Squeeze state?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Squeeze state means that you can...

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
That is to say, we don't need to measure all the information of laser light very accurately.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
We can say that we just need to measure the phase very accurately.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Or we can measure our government very accurately.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
When you see that your phase is measured very accurately,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
In fact, it still meets its non-coherent principle.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Then it will lead to the inaccuracy of your government.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It will become very large.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Then your phase can be measured very accurately.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
So a while ago, probably the year before last,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Isn't there a gravity wave measurement experiment?

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
It is to use this Squeeze light to throw away your impurities.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I will talk about quantum impurities.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Because you are in coherent state.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Then go to the limits of quantum mechanics.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Then push it to compress it so that you can measure the phase very accurately.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Then they may have a so-called interferer.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Then the interferer can measure the phase of something.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
If the gravity wave passes over the earth,

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
Then you can measure the phase of this gravity wave.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
There will be some changes.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
As long as you have a way to enter this Squeeze state,

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
You can let a certain frequency of the phase be able to measure it very accurately.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Because the gravity wave passes through like this,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So its frequency will be very weak.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
If you are very weak, your impurities will be very strong.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
You need to have a way to get rid of this impurity.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Then measure to the phase you want.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
But what we did in the experiment,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
We did another one.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
We are so-called Two-Mode Squeezing.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Two-Mode Squeezing is to say,

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm producing two intangles of light.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
That is to say, I now have some special light and non-linear effects.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Then produce two intangles.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
What about these two intangles?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Some of their signals are exactly the same.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
So if I input a light,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That light is called Probe.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Then it will produce its oscillation.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It uses a Twin Beam.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
These two lights have each other.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
For example, there is quantum co-relative.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
That is, quantum co-relative.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Quantum co-relative.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
So when I can put these two lights together,

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
I can get another one called Intensity Difference.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
That is to say, I can let my Intensity Difference,

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
to measure the noise of this two-mode intensity is the lowest.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
This may be a bit abstract.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'll show you some data later.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
If you don't quite understand, you can ask me again.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
The preliminary introduction is,

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
I spent 20 minutes to introduce what happened.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I have introduced the background knowledge needed at the beginning.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
If no one has any questions, I will continue.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
OK.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
How do we make this?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Excuse me.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You just said that the intangles,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
How is it produced?

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
Is it also produced by something?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Is it produced by intangles?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
We don't use intangles.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
We use Rubidium Vapor.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Rubidium is a 2A group.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
The Rubinium Nitrate.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Rubinium Nitrate.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
We will hit a very strong laser beam.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
This strong laser beam will have a non-linear interaction with a very weak beam.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Then produce another conjugate,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
another intangle beam.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
How are they produced?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I will introduce a little later.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
How do they produce this twin beam?

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
I want to talk about 4-Way Missing.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
4-Way Missing.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Total is 4 beams.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
But we only put 2 beams in.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Then 3 beams will be produced.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
There will be a more detailed explanation of the pattern later.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
How is this produced?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Thank you.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Can I ask a question?

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
What is 4WM?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
4 is 4.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
W is 4-Way Missing.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Or translated into Chinese,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
it is 4-Way Missing.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
4-Way Missing.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I should say that it is the abbreviation of this.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
My standard abbreviation.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
Does it mean that 4 waves are mixed together?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Yes.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But you only have 2 beams.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I will show you a picture of the conjugate later.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Then everyone will be confused.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Did you just say that these 2 beams are added or subtracted?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Added.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Because they are...

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Actually, they said that the intensity of the beam is 1.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Then the intensity of the beam will have a magnification ratio.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
The magnification ratio is G.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
So the light coming out is G.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Then the other conjugate beam is G-1.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
So they even put that...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Originally it was Coherent State.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If it has a magnification effect,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
it will become Thermal State.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
That is to say, it is no longer the original laser beam.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It is a very messy light.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
After the two conjugates are subtracted,

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
you will see the effect of the twin.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
They become very messy together.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But when they are subtracted,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
they will see that they are actually very beautiful and become messy together.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
OK, thank you.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
May I ask a question?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
So what is the power of these laser beams?

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
My pump power is about 750mW.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It's quite big.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Of course, it can't be compared to super fast light.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
We are continuous wave.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
OK, you also answered my second question.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Sorry, let's continue.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
The result we did is...

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
There is a relatively influential improvement.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
When you want to look at the magnification compression,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
the lower the frequency,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
the greater the interference in other environments.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
For example, you walk over there.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Or you have a call coming in.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
These may have some interference in your system.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Then it will cause you to be unable to see the so-called squeeze light at a very low frequency.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
That is, the compression of the magnification.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Even if there is a car driving on the main road,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
it will have a great impact.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
So our lab is doing experiments in such a deep basement.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Our result is...

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Anyway, our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
In recent years, we have broken through the following three orders.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
From Kilohertz down to about 1,000 times to a few Hertz.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
You can see the effect of the magnification compression.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Especially like the gravitational wave measurement I introduced at the beginning.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
It must be seen at a very low frequency.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Because theoretical mathematicians have calculated the magnitude of the gravitational wave.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
So if you can only see the squeeze light of Kilohertz,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
you can't use it to do these gravitational wave measurements.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
So in the past ten years,

13:09.000 --> 13:19.000
this squeeze light has been developed in such a way that it can still have this effect at a very low frequency.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
In the future, it will be possible to measure the gravitational wave.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
In the result of our experiment,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
there will be some applications in image processing.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Because you want to see if you can pass the image through a very weak light.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Then maybe you can do some biological experiments.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
A lot of low light hits your sample.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Then you can get rid of these impurities.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Then you can see the signal very clearly.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
So it has some applications in biology.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Then it can even do some correction.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
And it's a quantum correction.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Then I will continue to introduce it later.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
This is our 4-way missing.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
So on the right, we are.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
This is our wafer cell.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I drew the picture like this.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
The length of this wafer cell is about two centimeters long.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
Then the diameter is about an inch.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Anyway, it's a very small cell.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Then you put a very strong pump beam in.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
Then the strength of this pump beam is about 450 mW.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
Then it will interact with the other very weak beam.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Then you look at the link map on the left.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
There are a lot of links in it.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
But we only care about the link that we will call.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
This lambda type link.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
It should be quite common to do quantum computing.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
There may be something very famous in quantum computing.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's called EIT.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Slow light storage technology.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Basically, it's quite similar to that.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
For example, you hit a very strong pump beam.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Very strong pump beam.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Then it will interact with your probe beam.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Then this very strong pump beam.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
It also interacts with the ground state on the other side.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Then because of energy conservation.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
So it releases the fourth conjugate beam.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
So you only hit two beams in.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
But in a continuous operation.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
It actually acts like there are four waves interacting with each other.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Two of the four waves are the same pump beam.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
So this pump beam is at the same time as these two ground states.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
What you want to see is that.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
In addition to energy conservation.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
It actually has to meet the other momentum conservation.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Then we usually don't talk about momentum conservation.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
We also talk about phase matching.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
In other words, this wave pump beam.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
In addition to interacting with the probe beam.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
The momentum inside.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
That is to say, the pump beam and the probe beam have a very small angle.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
About 0.3, 0.4 degrees.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Then we have four waves.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
So the total momentum of this pump beam.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
There will be two.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Then it will produce another conjugate beam.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So it's in the other direction.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Then you see.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
When you have any phase fluctuation.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Or any frequency fluctuation.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It has to meet this.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Momentum energy conservation rate.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
So any fluctuation has to make it consistent.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
So this is a bit.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
This is a more general way to explain.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Because they have to be energy conservative.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Momentum conservation.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
So any fluctuation.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
The fluctuations must be consistent.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
In order to meet this condition at the same time.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
That's how it produces the twin beam.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
This is some of our experimental conditions.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Then you will see this delta.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Big delta.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
This big delta is about 1.3GHz.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
It's a pretty far detune.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Because of our experiment.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
In fact, our entire group is called.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Laser cooling and tracking.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Our group is called.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Laser cooling and tracking team.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Research team is like this.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
One of us.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Our big boss is.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
We have a big boss.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Then there are four teachers below.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Then I did this.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
The only thing is to do it with heat source.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
This heat source is about 120°C.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
We have to heat it up.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Then let it become a vapor.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So at the beginning, someone just asked.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Are we using crystal or what?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
We are not using crystal.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
If you use crystal.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
There are other.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Also doing.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Or doing that kind of twin beam.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
In fact, they are doing single mode.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Anyway, crystal can also be used to do that.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Squeeze line.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Anyway, some principles are still a bit different.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
We might use.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
K3 is the third stage.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
If it is crystal, it may be K2.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
There are some differences in nature.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
That's right.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Then the next one is.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
We are several.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
This one is about ten years ago.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Experimental results.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
That.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
You will see that.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Ten years ago.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We actually used TESAFA laser.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
To do this experiment.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
That.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
TESAFA laser is.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Its feature is that it is very expensive.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's about.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
One or two decades ago.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
We.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Buy a TESAFA.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
About.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
More than 200,000 dollars.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Then now it is more than 200,000.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Or its.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Power becomes stronger.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
That's right.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
You see.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
The company is doing this experiment.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
You need to have one.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Very expensive.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
TESAFA laser.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
More than 200,000 dollars.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
This.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
This is not practical at all.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
So.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
We started to develop.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Cheaper.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Then again.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
It is a dilutable.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Laser light source.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
That's it.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
What about the TESAFA laser we used at the beginning?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Go again.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
When doing this low-frequency quantization.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
There is a.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Ah.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Should I talk about this first?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Experimental map.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What does it mean?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That is.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Here you will see the blue line here.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
The blue line here is the so-called shot noise.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Then I just started.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Not to say.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Laser light.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
It is coherent state.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
What about coherent state?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
In fact.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
One of its features is that.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Its impurities.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Will not change.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
That is to say.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
You are measuring.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
You are now inserting a light.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
This.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
This picture has pink.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
This light.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Insert.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Then you use this photodial.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
To detect this.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Then send it in.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Spectrum analyzer.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
That is.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Spectrum.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Spectrum analyzer.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
That.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
This spectrum analyzer will tell you.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
This.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
How much is the impurity of the frequency of this light?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
If you insert this light.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
It's a laser.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
It's a coherent state.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Its impurities.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Its impurities.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Will not change.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Just like this blue light.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
The blue.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The curve is like this.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
We insert a light.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Then use a beam splitter.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Divide this light into half.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Then divide it into half.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Then subtract these two.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Then do the measurement of this impurity.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Then why do these two subtract?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Because.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
You can also.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
You can only measure one light.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
That is.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
You can also get a similar answer.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It's just the impurity power.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
If you measure one light.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
The impurity power will be halved.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
If you measure two lights.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The impurity power will be doubled.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
That's it.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
There is another one.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
The reason we want to divide it into two lights.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
That is.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
In fact, although the laser light is a coherent state.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
But it's in the low frequency.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
There are all kinds of impurities.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Will come in.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
If you don't use two lights.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
If you don't use two lights.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
You can't put those.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The so-called classical impurity.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Or the technical impurity.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Eliminate it.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
So you have to use.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Use one light.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Divide it into two.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Then do the subtraction.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Then measure the impurity.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
This is the so-called.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I will talk about it later.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It is the so-called shot noise.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's called the mega shot.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Its frequency.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It should always be flat.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
This is a.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Our field is a very.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Ah.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I didn't know this was a common thing before I came in.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Then now.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Okay, this is the coherent state.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
The impurity must be.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
The so-called.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The so-called two-color frequency has changed.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So it's the so-called shot noise.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
What about the red light?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
This is what I just produced.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Glow beam.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I am not.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I am now.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
To be more specific.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
The setting of our experiment is to say.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I hit a pump beam.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Then.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Hit another glow beam.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Then these two.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Intensity.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
The pump beam.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Its intensity is about 10,000 times as strong as the glow beam.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Then it goes through this non-linear.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Element.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
The element plus.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
After the effect.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It will produce this glow beam.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
This glow beam is amplified.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Then it will also produce another one.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Conjugate beam.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
So they are a twin.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Then after these two lights are cut off.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I call it.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Intensity.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Difference.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Squeezing.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Or in other words, it is squeeze.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
In other words, it is squeeze light.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Then these two lights.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
That is to say.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
We will.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
To control the light of this input.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Then let the power of the output light.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
With these two lights.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
The power of these two shot noise lights is exactly the same.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Then you will see.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
When we.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
If I have the so-called.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Squeeze light.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Squeeze light.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
My two intensity.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Difference.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
This is weaker than my shot noise.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Sorry.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Let me ask.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
So the frequency of your four lights should be.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
What is the range?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Because.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
So the frequency below you should be.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
The frequency of the big noise.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Right?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Ah.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
It should not be called big noise.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Because these two.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
The frequency of these two lights is different.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yes.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
You look at the left picture.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Have you seen this cross-section?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Yes.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So you have two pink lights.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Is it a wave of visible light?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
He.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
In fact, he is a distant infrared light.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Light of 795nm.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Ah.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yes.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
So that.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
That is also right.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
A few hundred terahertz.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Right?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yes.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
So you.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
So you just.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
The next page.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
That one.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Um.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The following frequency is kilohertz.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Is it the difference between the two?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
My.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
The problem is.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Is.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
The frequency on both sides.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
You.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
You want to see.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
You.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
You have a side wave now.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Correct.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Then this side wave has a side wave frequency.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Right?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
But I.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I am now.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm talking about.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
These noise.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
To do.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Negative analysis.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Of.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Noise frequency.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Not to say.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
My whole side wave.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
What is the frequency?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Not this frequency.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
But this noise.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
He has his own frequency.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
He has.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
So.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
So you just.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Your next page.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
The noise.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Your next page.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Spectrum is.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
These noise.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Spectrum.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Not the light itself.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Spectrum.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yes.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
That is.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
His noise.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Just make sure.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Um.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Good.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Thank you.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Continue.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Because like.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Light.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Light has his.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
His distribution.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
So.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Anyway, he.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
He actually.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Anyway, he.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
He.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
There will be a.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Distribution of noise.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
That.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
If it is.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
His distribution of noise.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
That is to say.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
His frequency.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
The noise.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
The power should be the same.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
This.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
That.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Uh.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Here.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
For missing noise.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That is.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I do.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Intensity difference.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
When.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
The noise.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
That.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Uh.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Db to.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Units.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Every three db is.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Cut in half.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
That is.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
So that means.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
You look at this.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Red.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
This.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Blue.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
The 8db that is.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Every three db is cut in half.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
These 3db is half.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Another half.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
So, the rest of the 8th.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
is.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
About.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
10 percent.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
The noise only.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
That is.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
If i originally had.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
This.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
This.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
The noise of the laser beam.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
If i was 1.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
That red.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
The noise of this kernel.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Only left.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Original.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Only 17%.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
That is.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Its noise is.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
In fact, it is very weak.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
That's right.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
The focus here.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Is to say.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
You can see that.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Hey.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
At low frequency.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
There are some small peaks here.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
In fact, this small peak is.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
This.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Very expensive.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
There is a very stupid.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
The disadvantages of the TESLA-5 laser.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Because it has cavities inside.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
That this cavity will.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Causing it to have these resonance.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
The noise comes out.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
So.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
When you are at low frequency.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Will be affected by these cavities.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
You can't see it.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Very low frequency.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
The compression of quantum noise.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
That's right.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Let's say.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Ah.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
We are.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
When doing experiments.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Sometimes put the laser.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Will lock the laser.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
What does it mean to lock the laser?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Is to make its frequency fixed.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Will not float around.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Or.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Is to make its bandwidth narrow.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
The meaning of narrow bandwidth.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
That is to say.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
I have a sine now.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
Is your sine a very simple sine?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Or is your sine.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Sine or.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
There is a flat sine.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
That is to say.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
This flat.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That's what I'm talking about.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Right.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
This is flat.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Correct.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Ah.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Ah.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Probably like this.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
So.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
So.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
There is a picture here.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
That is to say.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Let's measure the TESLA-5.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
More than 200,000 dollars.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
TESLA-5 laser.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
When the line width.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
You will find that.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
This blue dash 9.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Is.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That is.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
When we do experiments.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
We just.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Anyway, just hit the light.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Hit in.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Fiber.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Then go.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
To measure its.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Line width.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Correct.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
You will see that it is probably.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Maybe a few.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Hundreds or dozens of kHz.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Ah.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
The blue dash 9.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Its width is probably.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Maybe dozens of kHz.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
So.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
So narrow.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
It's pretty beautiful.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
But.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
When we lock up the laser.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
It becomes.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
More noisy.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
This is.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
The disadvantage of TESLA-5 laser is.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
You lock up.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
In fact.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Your.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Your frequency is fixed.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
But.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
The quality of your laser.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Is getting worse.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Correct.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Then you have to put it.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Line width becomes narrower.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
In fact.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
It will be quite complicated.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Then we look at another.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
Red curve.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
This red curve is.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
The red line is.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
2G TESLA.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Then you haven't locked up.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
It's like this.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It's dash 9.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Red dash 9.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Is.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
About a few.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Megahertz.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
So wide.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
But when we lock up.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
After.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
This is the red line.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
It becomes very narrow.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
It's probably a few.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Probably.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Even less than.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
A kHz.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
So narrow.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Line width.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
So.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
For 2G TESLA.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It may be.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
Our TESLA.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
2G TESLA.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Probably.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
So.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Relative to.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Compared with TESLA.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
It's a lot cheaper.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Probably.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
One TESLA.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
You can buy.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
About nine.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
2G TESLA.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Like this.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
But 2G TESLA.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
It's actually.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Its.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Light is weaker.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Correct.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Then this is another team.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
In.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Australian.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Experimental research.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Then he is.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I just forgot who asked.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Is.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
They are using.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Crystal.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
To do.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Then their method.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Not called.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
O.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
P.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
O.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
O.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
P.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
O.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
What is it?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Important.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Correct.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
This is.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Another way to use.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
To do.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Squeeze line.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Then they.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
This.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
This picture on the left.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
You see this black.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
This.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
This straight line.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
The so-called.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Shot noise.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Shot noise.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I just said.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Laser light noise.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Then you see.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
There are other.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Very messy line.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
There are red lines.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Blue line.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Red line.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Black line.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Blue line.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Then you see.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
There is a power here.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That is to say.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
His power.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
From 6.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
From 6.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Microwave.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Down to.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
0.7.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Microwave.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Down to a few.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Power.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
When.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
You see.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
His.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Miscellaneous.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Low frequency.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
When.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Getting weaker and weaker.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Correct.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
That.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
In fact, this piece of paper.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
He.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I don't know.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Why.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Will be like this.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
They are.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
A record.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
That is to say.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
They can.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Do.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
Squeeze line.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
Then.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
It's under 280 Hz.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
That.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
That.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
In fact.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
We already know.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Why.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Correct.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Then he.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Here because.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It's also his own problem.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
So there will be some.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Some.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Peak.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Noise.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Is particularly strong.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Of course.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
These are not important.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
The point is.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
He can be very low.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Very low frequency.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
More than 200 Hz.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Can still.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
There is.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
The effect of compression.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
That.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Blue line.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
With.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Not.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
The red line and the black line.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Is.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
At low frequency.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Because there are a lot of.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
Classic noise.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Basic noise.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
It's hard to see.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Noise compression.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Effect.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
Especially.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
When he.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
When the bubble is very strong.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Correct.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
That.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
This.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Next.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
These are.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
That.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Is.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Go.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
To.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Next weekend.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
To go to California.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
The meeting.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
The main content of the report.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Correct.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
That.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Is.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Our.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
For missing.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Setup.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Is.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
The device of time.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
We have a.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Second-level thunderstorm.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
That.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Second-level thunderstorm.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Is very cheap.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Not very cheap.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Is about.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
$20,000 to $30,000.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
Then we put.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Part of the light.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Out.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Then.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
Double pass LN.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Then.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Why.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Double pass LN.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Because.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
This LN.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Is.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
About 1.5GHz.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
He will put.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Light frequency.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Shift.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
1.5GHz.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
That.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
You put it.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Reflect it again.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
After coming back.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
You will get.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
About.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
3GHz.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Shift.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
That.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
3GHz.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Shift.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
With me.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
The front.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
This connection.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
You see.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Pink.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
This is my original light.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Pump beam.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Pump beam.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
That.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
I double pass LN.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Then I got.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Pump beam.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Then.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
We can start.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Experiment.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
But.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
This is just my.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
In fact.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Pump beam.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Generate.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
The way.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Then we put.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
Part of the light.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Out.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
That.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Part of the light.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Is.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
To lock the laser.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
That.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
This is.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Variation.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Spectroscopy.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
One.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Locking the laser.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Light wave.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
The way.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
That.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
You may.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
More often.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
But.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
It's another way.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
But.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
In fact, this way.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Variation.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Spectroscopy.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Is.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Very easy.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
That.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
It's very simple.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
You can go.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Your laser beam.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
That.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
Light wave.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Make it.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Very low.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Low to.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Hundreds of.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Hundred hertz.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Right.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
That.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
It's pretty good.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
The way.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
That.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
If you have any questions.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
You can.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
You can continue to ask.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Anyway.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
We put this.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
Locking.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
Signal.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Send it back.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
Secondary laser.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Control current.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Then you can.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Its.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
The thread of the laser.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Shorten it.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
That.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
In fact.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
These are not difficult.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
This experiment.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Probably.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
If you want to set it up.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Probably.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
As long as.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
One.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Month.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
You can set it all up.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Right.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
That.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
Like our group.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
A lot.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Doing PTC.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
That.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Probably.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
More than three or four years.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
Not necessarily.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Right.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
So this experiment.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Relatively.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Very.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Very.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
Very simple.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Then we.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
After the laser is locked.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
We're going to take.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Another one.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Light.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
There are about 30.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Minimum.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Light.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Put it in.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Amplifier.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
This amplifier.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Also.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Relatively.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Very cheap.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
This amplifier.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Only.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
$3,000.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Right.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
So.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
The whole laser system.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Less.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Less than $30,000.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Right.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
So.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
For.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Taiwan.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Want to do this experiment.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Actually.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Is.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
It's very likely.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
That is to say.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
You don't have to.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Spend $270,000.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
To send.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
One.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
One.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
You can do this experiment.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Right.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Then you usually have to do.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Non-linear.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Light-emitting experiments.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
You usually need.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Very strong laser light.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Of course.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Very strong laser light.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Then the light source is good.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Then you will use.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Laser.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
But.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
We don't need it now.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
We just need a.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Diode laser.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
This magnifier.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
This magnifier is called.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Tap Amplify.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
You can get it.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Like.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Like the old TESLA.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
The same strong light.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Is.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
The light of 2W.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Right.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Then we put.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Just now.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
The light of our double-paste LED.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
This is called.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Probe.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Hit in.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Our.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Lubidium cell.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Then there is.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
120 degrees C.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
So high temperature.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Then combine.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
This magnifier.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Tap Amplify.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
This magnifier.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
The light released.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Then actually.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
I just said.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
This magnifier.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
This magnifier.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
It is.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
2W.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Output.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
But.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
In fact.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
We really send in.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Only 750 mW.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
0.75W.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Light.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
0.75W light.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
In fact.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
It's enough for us to do experiments.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Then why.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
Will lose so much.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
In fact.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
In fact.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
We.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Is.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Most of them.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
Their difficulty is.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
This magnifier.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Although.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Only 3000.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
But.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
The light coming out.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Is a square light.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
You can't.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Take it to do experiments.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Then you.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
You have to.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Do some shaping.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
These shapes.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Is.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
From our high school.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Those light.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Is.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
One-third.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Plus one-third of Q.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Plus one-third of F.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
This light.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Concept.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
You know.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
How to put this.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Square light.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Form it.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Into.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
A.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
High-spin.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Correct.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
So.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
After the formation.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
We.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Put the light into Fiber.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Like this.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Then come out.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
Only about 750 mW.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Then these two lights.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Pump.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Plus pull.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Then there will be pull.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Conjugate.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
That is.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
This is our tradition.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Do.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
That.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Pull and missing.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Then do.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Their.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Intensity difference.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Correct.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
That.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
The point is.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
The point is.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
How to do it.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Very low quality.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Magnifier.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Magnifier.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Then you will see.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
This way.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Same.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
This.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Dash 9.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Red Dash 9.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Is.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Shot noise.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Blue Dash 9.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Also shot noise.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
But these two lights.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
The.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Power.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Is different.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Red Dash 9.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
This total power.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Is.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
About.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
130.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
That.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
About 130 mW.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
That.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Blue.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Dash 9.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Its light.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
About.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Only 17 mW.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
That.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
These two lights.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Why.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
I want to do this comparison.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
That is to say.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
You see.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
When its high frequency.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
When dozens of TOS.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
You see.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
The quantum noise you see.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
To say.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Is.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Quite consistent.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
But when it's low frequency.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
It's different.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
Why.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Because.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
You think about it.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
That is to say.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
When your light.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
Getting weaker and weaker.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
In fact.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
It is.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
When it's low frequency.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
It will have a lot of.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
classical.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Noise.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Or some.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Technical noise.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
That.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
You think about it.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Ah.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
I just didn't say.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
One thing.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
Is.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
What is vacuum.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Vacuum.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
It is.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Powerful.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
That.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Remember.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
That is.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Simple harmonic.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Oscillation.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Didn't I tell you.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
What.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
N plus.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
One-half.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
H8.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Omega.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
That is.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
That.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
SHM.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
The energy.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
That.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
When N is equal to 0.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
When vacuum.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
There is still a power.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
That.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
When there is this energy.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
It has its noise.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
And.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Especially.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
It is also a coherent state.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
So.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
When.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
You don't have any light.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
It is also a coherent state.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Because it is a very pure.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Very pure.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Coherent state.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Otherwise.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
You just think about it.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
When your power is getting weaker.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
When it gets weaker.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Is it.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
When it comes to the end.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Is it to be confined to vacuum.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
When.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
It.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
There can't be any other noise.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Hello.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I have a question.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Okay.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
You ask.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Um.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
That is.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Although these four lines are different.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
But he actually has a complete.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
That is.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
His four lines.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
In the end at that.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Low frequency.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
All over again.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
That.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
It looks a bit like.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
That is.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
You can still excite a lot.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
Vacuum.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
The mold is there.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
That.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I have always had a question from the beginning.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Because I was just thinking.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Listen to see if you will speak.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
But I really want to ask now.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
That is.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Why do you use high temperature.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
That is.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Not high temperature cavity.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Just use high temperature.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
That.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
That.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Medium gas.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
If you make it.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Cloud.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Will it be suppressed?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
This.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
This.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
This.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
This.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
This.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
This.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
This.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
This.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
This.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Listen to sure to that.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
I think.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
That is, ah.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
The one.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Pro memory element.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Is there one easy way.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Erm.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
The sensor you.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Sense...

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Essence...

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
That's the sensor lightning.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
It can hold thepot.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It can hold pot.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
I.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
The projector.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
To the power to the power.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
To the light source.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
The crow.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
The camera, the night...

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
You kinda.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
The lighting, right.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Camera and настро the light.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
The lighting and the smoke.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
So.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
The light sources.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
The destination.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
And the plus.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Is also the usual Three...

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
The.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
Resolution.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Is your.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Resolution.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
The bandwidth.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Low.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
This will move backwards.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Keep moving backwards.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
Keep moving backwards.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
So if I can adjust it to a few hertz.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
When.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Then you'll be in.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
In.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
About one or two hertz.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
You'll see this.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
One over F.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
The noise.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
So.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
So.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
So this.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
It doesn't really matter.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
That.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
That's your resolution.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Is related.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Oh.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
With your resolution.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
With your resolution.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
The bandwidth.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Is related.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Okay.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
Okay.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Okay.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Okay.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Okay.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Okay.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Okay.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
So.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
So you can see.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
The red line.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
At low frequency.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Its value.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
The noise.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Is only up to.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
One point.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
One point five kilohertz.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
When the blue line.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
This.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
This.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
This will be.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
One kilohertz.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
That's the one.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
That.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
The Australian.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
The Australian.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Paper.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
That paper.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Is.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Is the same effect.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
That is to say.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
When your.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
Your light source.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Getting weaker and weaker.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
When your seed light is getting weaker and weaker.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
It's getting closer and closer to your.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Coherent state.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
It is.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Shut noise limit.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
But.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Is.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
Coherent state.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
The real coherent state light.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
No other.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Other classical noise.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Because any classical noise.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Will.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Disturb your.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
The.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Squeeze light.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Yes.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
So when our light is getting weaker and weaker.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
We can see.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
More.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Better.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Low frequency.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
The.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
The light is getting weaker and weaker.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
That.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
That.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
This.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
This looks like nothing.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Because.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Because only.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Only.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
One kilohertz.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Only.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Then we.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Let's look at another way.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
That is to say.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
We.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
This.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Is.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
The.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
The.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
The.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
The.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
The.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
The.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
The.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
The.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
The.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
The.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
So its.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
The more its coherent effect is.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
It's.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
The amplification efficiency is.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
What you hit a.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
You.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
You've got a probion.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
In.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
This.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Atomic substance.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
It will produce 25 atomic.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
The 25 light particles.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
That is to say, its magnification ratio is 25 times.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Yes.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Then you want to see.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
That is to say.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
When my.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
My game.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
The bigger it is.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
That means.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
The seed I need is getting weaker.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
That's what I need.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
When the seed is getting weaker.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
I can see it.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Even lower and lower and lower.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
A few hundred hertz.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
I can.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I can see the effect of the light particle.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Yes.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
That.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
That this.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
This is already us.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
About two or three years ago.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
The result of the cause.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But our boss insisted at that time.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Is.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
No.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
There's nothing to publish.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Yes.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
That.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Recently.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
China has a.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
The research result is that they have.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Down to 700 hertz.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
About.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
700 hertz.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Then.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Send it out.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
But then.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Our result.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
The result we want to publish is.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
We have.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Down to about.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
About.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
The result is 10 hertz or so.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
That is.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
We.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
We have.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
One order.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Another order.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Another order.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Going down.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
That.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
That is.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Here is what I want to share.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
That is.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Actually.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Sometimes, there is.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
It takes some luck.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Yes.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Some ideas are very sudden.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Yes.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
So.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Was.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
One day last year.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
I went to my boss's office and said.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Why don't we add the second one?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
Come in.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
That is.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
There was only one light coming in.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Then.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Pro 1.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Country 1.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Then.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Why don't we add the second one?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Yes.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
The boss said.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Because the second one is added.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
It will become.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
It's like doing another experiment.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
That is.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
Our lab is not just doing this.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Do another experiment.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Is.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Take.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
Two.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Pumping.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Then.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Form a.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
So-called single mode.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Squeeze.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
That is.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Anyway, it's another experiment.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
It's a bit.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
A little comparison.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
It seems to become that kind of experiment.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
But.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
After the boss finished explaining.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Anyway.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Just try it.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
No difference.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
That is.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Take a.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
This.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Maybe a few minutes or a few hours.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
To try it.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Then.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
I saw that.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
A different result came out.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
That is.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Our record is like this.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Pushed down another order.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
To.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Nearly 10 Hz.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
That is.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
So.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Good.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Hey.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
This video should be the last one.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
That is.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Anyway, we are now.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Which one is your latest result?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
Ah.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
All.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
All.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
That is.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
This result is used.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
We hit two lights.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Go in.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
That is.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
I just.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
I only showed.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
The experiment in the front.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Only.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
The first light.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Pumping.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
With pumping.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Do.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Interaction only.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
That.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
All the following data.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Are two lights.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
That is.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Most of the data.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Are two lights.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
I.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Use a beam splitter.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
You all.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Can you all see my shoulder?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
That is.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Oh, yes.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
This is the beam splitter.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Divide it.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Will divide.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Half of the light.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Finished.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Yes.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
You have the second probing.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
After the second probing comes in.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
It will produce another.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
Conjugate.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
That is.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
That.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Then you will see.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Hey.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Our experiment result is.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
When your.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Ah.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
This red line.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Are all shot noise.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
But I am from.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
100 kHz.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Draw to.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
1 Hz.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
That is.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
That red line.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Is shot noise.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
That.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
Blue line.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Is.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
That.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Oh.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
I will talk about it later.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
That is.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Anyway.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Blue.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
These blue lines and black lines.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Are our new.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Our new experiment result.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
That.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
This picture.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Just want to tell you.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
A phenomenon.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
That is.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
We.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
In practice.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
That is.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
We.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
We.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Before.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Break through to a few hundred Hz.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
That.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Break through to a few hundred Hz.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
The main.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
The limit is.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It has a background noise.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
That.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Where did the background noise come from?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
From this pump.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
After this pump is hit.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
We are using.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
A beam splitter.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Filter it.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
But it still has.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
Its.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Correlation.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Not so pure.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
So it will have.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
So-called leakage.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
That leakage.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Will.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Will pollute your.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Probe and.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Conjugate.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Will cause.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
You will see this green line.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
The green line is.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
We put.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Probe in.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Blocked.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
So we only have.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
We.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
We can't measure anything.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
But wrong.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
You still have to measure.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
This.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Green line.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
What is this green line?

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
It's your pump.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
The leakage.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
Run to your probe.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
And.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Conjugate in.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
So.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
So.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
So this.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Limits us.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Our technology.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
That is to say.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
We could.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Our original technology is.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
From a few kHz.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Then.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Compressed to a few hundred kHz.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
That.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Why can't.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Compressed down.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Because.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
We have a background here.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Pump.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
Flash.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Pump.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Light.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Will pollute.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Your.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Green beam.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
That.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Of course.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
The story is not like this.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
But anyway.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
We just go.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Just.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
I don't know why.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
I just put that.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Adjusting that light.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
I don't know why.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Then.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Adjusting.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
That pump.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
It becomes weak.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
And then.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
To measure this.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
It turned out to be.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
I made the angle bigger.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Just like this.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Make the angle bigger.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
That.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Pump's leakage.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Will become.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Gray line.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
So beautiful.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
So low.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
So.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
We.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Just like this.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
As long as we make the angle bigger.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Then.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
You will see the black line.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Then.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
That squeeze light.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Will.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Drop to about 10 kHz.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
That.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Anyway.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
This.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
This.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
This.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
This.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
This.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
This.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
This.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
This.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
This.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
This.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
This.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
This.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
This.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
So.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
I mean.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
This.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
This experiment.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
That is.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Blue.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Red.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
This blue line is all.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Shot noise.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
That red line is to say.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
We only hit one light.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Then.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
We.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
We put Probeam.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Put.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Put it.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
A little lower.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Let Probeam and Country Creeper.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
The pump is the same.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Then.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
To measure the squeeze light.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Then.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
It's so scary.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Right.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Then if we hit two lights in.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
After.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
This.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
This.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
This.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
You don't have to lock the laser at all.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
The laser is not locked at all.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
But you can also lock the laser.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
After you lock the laser.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Your laser line.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
From a few megahertz to.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
About a few hundred hertz.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
Or kilohertz.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Then you will see.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Just that one.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
One light.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Will become.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
You.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
You can see.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Better.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Magnetic field effect.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
But.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Two lights.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Still more.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
More perfect.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Then we can even do it.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
About.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Six hertz.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
This is our current.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Then.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Then this is of course.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
We still have some.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Dust in the air.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Fall into your.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Light path.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Will interfere.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Your beam.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
So we will.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Do some.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Cover it.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Then you can.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Make it beautiful.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
I don't know.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
You can make it very low.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Like this.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
That.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
This is.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Can go back to the next one.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
The next one.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Hey.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Method 1.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Method 2.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
In fact.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
I just saw you.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Because you are.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
There's an ice.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Split.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
So.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
For example.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Your method 1.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
With method 2.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Probe.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
The total energy is the same.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
I think so.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Is it right?

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Yes.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Yes.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
That is to say.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Your method 1.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Your terminal.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Maybe.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
The terminal is.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
10 microwatt.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
That method 2 is.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Five.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Five microwatt.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Yeah.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
What's that?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
Physics.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Principles.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Physics.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Principles.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
Can you explain.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
It's in.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Let him.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
This.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Is it so different?

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Why?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Because I think.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Method 1.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Method 2.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
His.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
This.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Angle.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
It should be harder.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
The same.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
I.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
I mean.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
That is to say.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Why can he.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
That is to say.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Causing.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Such a big difference now.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Yeah.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Do you know?

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
This method 1.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
That is.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
I hit the light.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
The terminal.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
The terminal is 1.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
And then after this magnification.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
After the ring.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
The light coming out is G.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Right?

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
That's my country.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
This curve.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
It's G minus 1.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Because he doesn't have a terminal.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
So his power is G minus 1.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
For him.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
There has always been a power difference.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
That's the E.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
The difference of that terminal.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
But.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Your frequency.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
If Zhang Yuan.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Piao.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Piao.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
That is to say.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
If you don't fix its frequency in the laser.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Your.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
When your frequency is floating.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Your game.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Your magnification.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The magnification ratio is always floating there.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
So you will get a different magnification ratio.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
At different times.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
As a result.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
You will have additional noise.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Yeah.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
But method 2.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
That is to say.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
You hit.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
0.5 in.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
He came out G times 0.5.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
That.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
His country can be 0.5 times.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
G minus 1.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Right?

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
But.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Your other light.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
It's also the opposite.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
There is also a G generation.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
That you originally here.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
G minus 1.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
With your G.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Add up like this.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
The power difference on both sides.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
It's zero.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
No matter how your frequency floats.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Your.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
Total.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Power difference.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
All the same.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
You.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
You have.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
You have understood.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
I'm not talking about this point.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
There is.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
But I'm thinking.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
That is.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
You do this experiment today.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
The main purpose.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Is to get.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
You.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
The last.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
This is produced.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Conjugate.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
This is a perfect.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Conjugate.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
Not.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Ah.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Not.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
I just.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Let me.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Because.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
We.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
We here.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
This.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Conjugate.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
There will be a power difference.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Then.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
I just want to put this.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
The power difference.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Eliminate it.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Then you can see.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
At.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
Very low frequency.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
I can still see.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
That is.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
You.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Also.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
At the time of input.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Already.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
The so-called classical noise.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Already.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Eliminate it.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
This classical.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Or the mechanical noise.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Because it will be.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
You.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
You two.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Pro beam.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Pro 1 and Pro 2.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Both.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
The same classical noise.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Then you.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
The same.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
As soon as you go in.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Already.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Already.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Eliminated.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
So you come out.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Also very clean.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
There are two.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Enlarged.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Total power.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
It's exactly the same.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Even your frequency.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Your laser light.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
Did not shrink.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
His.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
His.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Total power.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Always fixed.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Correct.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
It's a bit hard to imagine.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
But.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Oh.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Can.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
This.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Continue.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
No, it's.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Okay.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
You.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
You continue to finish.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
No.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Actually.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
I'm almost done.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
That is to say.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
We.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
This time is.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
There is no.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Capacity inside.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Like I just said.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Some.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Opio.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Capacity.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
So the light they emit.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Not.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Multi-spatial mode.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
So it can't be used.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Image processing.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Correct.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
Then.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
We are almost ready now.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
We are even.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Below 10 Hz.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
We can all see this.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Volume noise reduction.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
What is this?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
What is the importance of this?

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
I'll tell you later.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Correct.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Then.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
We will now.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
That is.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Low frequency noise reduction.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Can only do.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
About 6 Hz.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
The main reason is.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
We still have other.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Laboratory.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Light.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
Light table.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Or what.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Stability.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
The problem.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Correct.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Then we have this laser.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
For missing.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Squeeze line.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
It is.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Portable.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
It is.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
It's not a big one.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
It's a diode laser.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Then again.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Compared to.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
It's a lot cheaper.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Correct.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You can do it for $30,000.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Then.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
We.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
We will use it later.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Do.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Image experiment.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Then this image experiment.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
That is to say.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
We will have a mask.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
This.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
A mask.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Will put a laser beam.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Use a.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
A mask.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Block it.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Then.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
It will produce.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
A.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Totoro.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Conjugate Totoro.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
Then this is.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
Conjugate.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
So they.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Go.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Turn it.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
About 180 degrees.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
Something like that.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Then they cut each other.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
You can see this.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Image.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
The.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
This.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
This is called imaging.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
That is.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Quantum quality imaging.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
That.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Because.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
You.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
If you can't.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
In all frequencies.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
When you see this quantum noise.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
That is to say.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
If you are in low frequency.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
When.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
If there is a lot of physical noise.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Then you.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
When you are doing.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Image experiment.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
You are.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Open the shutter.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
So open the camera shutter.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It is to put all.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Frequency.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Noise.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Collect it all.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
So you are in low frequency.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
If you can't see the quantum noise.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
It will destroy your whole image.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
So.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Our previous.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
The.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Can't do it.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
This.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
This imaging.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
The main difficulty is that.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
We can't do it in low frequency.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
This.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
The quantum noise.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
That is to say.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
That.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Another application is.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Absolute correction.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
That.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
That is to say.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
If this.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
The light.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Is coming in one by one.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
That.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
It.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Once enlarged.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Double.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Ten times the light.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
That.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
You will see probing.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
That.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
The same.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Also.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
The same.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
The same number of.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
The light comes out.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
So you.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
This.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Dictator A.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
And the following dictator.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
They must.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
The same light.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
And so.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
The time.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The position must be the same.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
So when.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
The above.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
The dictator.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Receive my.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
When the light.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
It will tell you the following.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
I received one.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Did you receive one?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Correct.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
If I received.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
100.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
I told the other party.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
I received 100.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
You.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
If you only received.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
97.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
That's when.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Your quantum efficiency.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
It's only 97%.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Correct.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
So.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
That is to say.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
The traditional quantum.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
The traditional.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Calibration.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
The proof is.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
I have.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
In addition.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Another.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Dictator.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
That this dictator.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
I already know.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
What is its efficiency.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Then I compare the two.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
I can compare.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
What is my relative efficiency.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.000
What is the relative quantum conversion efficiency.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
So.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
If you have one.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Already know.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
And then know the relative.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
Then you know.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
This.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Calibration after.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
What is the result.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
But.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
This.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
The way is to say.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
I don't have to know the above.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Or the following.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Quantum efficiency.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
I can all.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Get.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Absolute.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.000
Calibration.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
That quantum efficiency.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Correct.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
That is.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.000
We can use.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
To do.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
To make up.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
So.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
That's about it.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Thank you all.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
If.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
Any questions.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Welcome to ask.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
Does anyone have a question?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Hello.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Hi.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
Do you want to ask first?

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
You ask first.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
You ask first.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
I actually.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Because you just mentioned that.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Gravitational wave.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Is this LIGO?

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Yes.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
But I think this thing.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Than.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
It's a hundred times better than LIGO.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
I think.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Okay, I'll say it like this.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
In fact, there is no.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
LIGO.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
They are an international.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Many countries' plan.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
So I think.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
We use a very simple way.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
I immediately thought of one.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Application.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
That's it.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
LIGO.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
Its frequency.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
In fact, it is much higher than here.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
That's a lot higher.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
The reason is that he can only do that.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Ah.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
If you do that.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
He can only measure.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
It's close to the earth.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
It's also the red.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Reddish.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Smaller.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Gravitational wave.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
So he can only measure.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
The so-called contemporary universe.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
The occurrence of phenomena.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
For example.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Planet collision.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Black hole collision.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Those.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
For cosmology.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Or high-energy physics.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
Very interesting.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Is the ancient gravitational wave.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Then they happened a long time ago.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
Then it has been.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Very big.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Very big.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
Redshifted.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
To.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Very low frequency.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Yes.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Then this thing can be used.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Yes.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
That is to say.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Now.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
I know China.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
Japan.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
India.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
They are all developing.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Just like LIGO.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Of.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
This kind of interference.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Ah.

58:09.000 --> 58:10.000
We.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
This method is.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Twin beam.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Of course.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
LIGO.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
They hope to be single mode.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.000
Just a single light.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
Um.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
But we can also do that experiment.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
No problem.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Yes.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
But the other point is.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
LIGO.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
They only want your wave.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Not.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Ah.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
1024.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
No meter.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
It seems that as long as you are not that wave.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
They.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
They don't want it.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Anyway.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
You.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
All their devices are for.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
1024.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
That wave.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
So.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
Our 795 wave.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
It's far from them.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
So they don't want it.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
But actually.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Basically physics.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
There is no difficulty.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
So you can only.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
As long as you find.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
That frequency.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
The light source.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
It's OK.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
I tell you.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
You can check an experiment.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
There is an experiment called LISA.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
L.I.S.A.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
That is a.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
LIGO in space.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
I think that thing.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
May be for this.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
It's very.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Is.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
It's suitable for use.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
But.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
This.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
I think I.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
It's more important to do it first.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
So.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Of course.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Of course.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
They.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
They care.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
I don't care.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
Oh.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
OK.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
I think it's very good.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
Thank you.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Thank you.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Hey.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
I want to ask.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
It's your last one.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
Uh.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
In the next one.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
So.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Do you want to do it?

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Like a single-ray experiment?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
So.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
You like this.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
The setup is very similar to that.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Red capital.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
H.O.M.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
The experiment.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
Do you want to do that?

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Or you.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Actually.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
This is just a demo.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
I want to tell you.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
How did he.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
His.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
His.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
His.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
His.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
His.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
His idea is to make it.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
With respect to.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
That is to say.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
It.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
The two are unknown.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
The two emitted efficiency are indecisive.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
So.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
It's like I give you a ball.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
I said at the same time.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
Give one ball to another person.

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
Then you two can interact with each other.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Do some coexistence cornets.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
The co-efficient of yourselves.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
This.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
This is a demo.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But the real garbage has grown this way.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
He gave it to the patient.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Then test its co-efficient relationship.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Get.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
The so-called quantum quantum.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
That one.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Dictator's quantum efficiency.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Then we.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
This experiment should.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
To get a.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Very.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
The reason to use low-quality quantum compression is because.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
We.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
To be with.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The national standard group.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The already known co-efficient should be compared.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Then.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Then I.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
The boss gave me the goal.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
That is.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
As long as we can get.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Below 1 kilohertz.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
1 kilohertz is about the same as 200 hertz.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
But we keep doing it like this.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Keep doing it to 10 hertz.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
So.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
We will become.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Any.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Almost any frequency.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
We can.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Just do the quantum correction.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Correct.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That question is.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Is.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Maybe it has nothing to do with what I did.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Hello.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I didn't understand.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Say it again.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Oh, that's your question.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Ah, actually, I don't understand it either.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Because.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Because we.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
We are just very simple.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
To measure his.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Co-efficient.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Then go to his.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
That.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Dictator's quantum efficiency.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
That's it.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
No.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Nothing else to do.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Oh, no.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Because of that.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Hey.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You just said this.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
This experiment.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Then.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
From this.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
With.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
This has nothing to do with China.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
There is an experiment called Hong.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I know you said that Hong.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Right.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
HOM.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Yes.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
That.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I look like.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Is.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Should be.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Conceptually very similar to that.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Right.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Yes.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But we.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Mainly to measure his quantum.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Is.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Not.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Measure his.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yes.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I understand.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Yes.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Hello.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Hey.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I want to ask a question.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Uh.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Is.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
You produce here.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Uh.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
This is your program here.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
This.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Conjugate disease.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
They.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
After production.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
They are still.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
They are coherent.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Uh.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
No.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
They are thermal.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
This is a coherent disease.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Still.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Squeeze.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Uh.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Just.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Only.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Proceed.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Is.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Coherent disease.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
It produces.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Is.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Thermal disease.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Is.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
The noise.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Is.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Coherent disease.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Hundreds of times.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Is.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It is.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Very.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
A.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Thermal noise.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Is.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That is.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
He.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
He.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Than the original.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Coherent.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Coherent disease.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
About.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
About.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
15.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
TB.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Is.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
2.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
5.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Square.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
So.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Big.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Probing.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
These two lights.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Reduce.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
That is to say.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
They are magnified at the same time.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
They are.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Quantum.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Co-related.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Then.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
When I.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Although it is 2.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
5.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Square.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
More.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Magnification.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But when the two.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
After reduction.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
We are.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Get a.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Very.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Clean.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Intensity.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Difference.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Squeeze light.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
This is.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Coherent.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Still.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Magnification.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Light.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Is.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Also.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Thermal.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
OK.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Then.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The reason is because.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
You are using.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Atom.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
That is.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It has a lot of.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
3D scattering.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Just.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Because.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
As long as you magnify.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Should say.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Any.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
This non-linear magnification.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
After magnification.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Is.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Thermal disease.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
OK.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That is.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Second harmonic.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Or.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
General.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Forward mixing.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Is it?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I actually don't know.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Their.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
OK.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Second harmonic.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Is it?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I don't think so.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Maybe.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Because they are.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Second harmonic.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Can also be used.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Just like.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Some.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Do.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
They are.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
What frequency.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
To use.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Second harmonic.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
To.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Create the next frequency.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Higher frequency.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
That.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Is.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It must be.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Laser beam.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
To do some experiments.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
If it is not.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Laser beam.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Then.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
It's useless.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Second harmonic.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I think it should be.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Coherent beam.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Yes.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It should be.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Your probe and conjugate.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Is thermal.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Yes.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
But I.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
This is.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Power magnification.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
I guess.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Second harmonic.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Its power is still.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Conservation.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Still forward.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
You put.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Probe and conjugate.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
You will.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Get one.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Is amplitude.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Squeeze the light.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Is it?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Is.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You can't.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Conjugate.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Is.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You can't.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Amplitude.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Is.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Its intensity.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Difference.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
OK.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Yes.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Then.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I have a question.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Is.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Your.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Weak.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Is.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
There is an experiment.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Is.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
You put.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Probe.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Seed.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Seed.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Intensity.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Strengthening.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Angle.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yes.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Then.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
You said there.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Will.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Is.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
The frequency.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Will.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Go down.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Why.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Because.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Because.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I have to have a seed.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I need to have a seed.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Come in.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
That is.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
You.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
You see.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Method 1.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
After I come in.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Then.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
If I have a seed.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Not.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Cohesive state.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Low frequency.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Not.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Cohesive state.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Because.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
You.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Your laser is low frequency.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
In fact.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
There are many.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Other impurities come in.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Do.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The effect of low frequency.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
When the effect.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
My AOM has given him another impurity.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
There are more.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
More.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Very scary impurities.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Like this.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
But.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
More than 10 dB.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Yes.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
When you.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
You hit this light.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Getting weaker and weaker.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
When.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
These ancient.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Impurities.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Will be.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Non-linear.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Take it.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Take it.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Take it.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Cut off.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
That is.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
These ancient impurities.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Not with you.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
The power is.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It's a.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It's a non-linear way.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Cut off.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Cut off.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
When vacuuming.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You don't have any impurities.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Because vacuuming is.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Cohesive state.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
So.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It has a non-linear.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Take it.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Into a.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
A.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Cohesive state.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Effect.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Oh.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I mean.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Just.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Ancient impurities.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Will not be.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Will not be magnified.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Then.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Quantum impurities.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Will be magnified.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Ah.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I mean.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Ancient impurities.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You can use.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Reduce the power.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Green it off.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
OK.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yes.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
That.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Quantum way.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You can't.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Green it off.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
OK.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yes.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Then.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Uh.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The last question.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It's.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It's.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Now these.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
This.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Dicephyl laser.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
With.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Dial laser.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
To compare.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
It's.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It's.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Who is it?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Uh.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It's.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I'm.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Is.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
It'

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Is.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Is.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Still.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Still.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Net.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
You.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Still.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Still.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It's.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
It's.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Still.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Too.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Still.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Not just now.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So yes.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That's.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Equal good, Yuk.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
It's.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Quite.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
It's.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It's.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Iya.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Time.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Better.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Speed telekinesis better.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.020
Do you know?

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.020
It's.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.020
Deal.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.020
Why?

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.020
Is.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:52.020
Questions.

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:53.020
Are.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.020
You.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.020
Your corners.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.020
Girl.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.020
Yet.

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.020
Don't assume it.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.380
Because that's partner.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.380
Web-site.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:01.380
Okay.

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.380
Don't assume.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.380
Right?

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:04.380
See a second.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.380
There's.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380
The coordination.

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.380
Right.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.380
I'm.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.380
It's.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.380
It's.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.380
It's.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.380
Tight.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.380
So.

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.380
plus or minus.

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.380
Is.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800
Okay.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800
Oh.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.800
Good.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Oh.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
Hello.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.800
How are you?

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.800
My name is peter.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.680
When will you start the team.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680
Yes.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680
Uh.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.680
So I.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680
My mood.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.680
Uh.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.680
Yeah.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.680
Uh.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.680
Time is expensive.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.680
Yeah.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.680
Uh uh.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.680
And.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.680
Uh.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.620
Uh.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:42.960
You can ask me or I'll be in California next week.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.580
I'll be in California next week for a meeting for a week.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.380
And I'll be reporting the results.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:52.260
If there's any place you'd like to recommend, you can tell me.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.260
Thank you.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.380
Are you going to Clio?

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.660
Yeah, I'm going to Clio.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.580
Oh, okay.

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.780
Are you going too?

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.220
Yeah, I'm going too.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.660
Oh, we'll see each other on Saturday.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.960
I'll be reporting on Sunday afternoon.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh, okay. I haven't seen when I'll be reporting.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.120
Oh, really?

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.500
Actually, our idea of two lights

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:21.800
also solves another problem with Dialazer.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.000
If I keep talking, I won't be able to finish.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.060
So, it's also in Clio.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.960
We'll be doing the same experiment on Sundays.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.360
I'll be reporting on Sundays.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.860
I'll see if I have time to listen.

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:36.060
Okay, welcome.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:37.260
Thank you.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.260
You're welcome.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.060
So, that's it.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:02.260
Thank you, everyone.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.060
Thank you.
