0	4000	Q&A SESSION
4000	8000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech.
8000	13000	Today's speech topic is very special and I like it very much.
13000	16000	The speaker is Liu Junlin.
16000	20000	He is going to talk about LATEX and DINNER today.
20000	22000	I will briefly introduce the speaker today.
22000	29000	The speaker got a doctorate in electrical engineering from Caltech this year.
29000	36000	His main field of research is digital signal processing and statistical signal processing.
36000	38000	This is a brief introduction of the speaker.
38000	46000	Without further ado, let's welcome the speaker to talk about today's speech tool.
46000	54000	Please turn on the microphone and let's clap together.
54000	56000	Let's start the speech.
56000	58000	We'll leave the time to Junlin.
58000	60000	Thank you.
60000	62000	I need to turn on the microphone.
62000	64000	You can turn it on, I'll turn it off.
64000	66000	Then I'll turn it on here.
70000	73000	Okay, thank you.
73000	76000	Thank you for the invitation from TAIRA.
76000	82000	I am honored to give a special academic speech today.
82000	87000	Today's speech topic is mainly about LATEX.
87000	91000	Another tool called TIKZ and DINNER.
91000	96000	How to use these three tools in academic reports.
96000	104000	Before talking about this topic, I want to mention why I want to talk about this topic.
104000	110000	First of all, when I received the invitation, I also thought about whether to talk about my special research topic.
110000	114000	Thinking about it later, I think it's too professional.
114000	117000	It may not be useful to everyone.
117000	124000	Then I turned to talk about some tools in the academic world that I have a little experience with.
124000	126000	These three tools.
126000	129000	By the way, let me share my experience with these tools.
129000	132000	Next is my speaker.
132000	136000	The speaker will first do a brief introduction.
136000	139000	Then I will focus on these three tools.
139000	144000	Then show some of the presentations I made.
144000	147000	Presentations made with these three tools.
147000	150000	Finally, a little summary.
150000	156000	Before starting the whole talk, I want to show you a picture.
156000	161000	I believe everyone should have at least a little experience in academic research.
162000	170000	In fact, academic research can be divided into several stages.
170000	171000	Suppose you want to do academic research.
171000	175000	First of all, you need to have the most primitive research idea.
175000	178000	According to this idea, you have to make a corresponding plan.
178000	184000	For example, how much funding to apply for, how many students to receive, and how large your lab needs.
184000	190000	After these things, you are responsible for managing people or managing the progress of the plan.
190000	195000	After having people or progress, you may need to design experiments and collect data.
195000	198000	Then make a corresponding conclusion based on your data.
198000	202000	The last step, I personally think it is a very important step.
202000	205000	When you have the results of your research,
205000	210000	You may have to publish it to the appropriate conference and magazine.
210000	215000	Make the right oral report and promote your results to let others know.
215000	222000	I believe that many research topics are related to this research cycle.
222000	226000	The topic of my report today is related to this research cycle.
226000	230000	But I'm not going to share with you how to find new research topics.
230000	233000	I'm not going to teach you how to do research.
233000	239000	Of course, it has nothing to do with the following topics.
239000	242000	Of course, it has nothing to do with my research topics.
243000	247000	The topic of my report today is related to the sixth topic,
247000	251000	Publication and Presentation.
251000	255000	It has a little bit to do with these two topics.
255000	261000	But I'm not going to teach you how to write a paper or how to do oral expression.
261000	263000	This is another topic.
263000	268000	My main focus today is to show you a picture.
269000	270000	This picture...
270000	273000	Because of copyright issues, I didn't put the original picture on the screen.
273000	277000	I'll just put a copy and I'll show it to you.
277000	281000	After I click on it, I have to change to share, right?
288000	290000	This one.
292000	295000	I don't know if you can see this picture.
295000	299000	If you know Ph.D. Comics, it's actually a...
299000	303000	When you read the textbook, you can draw a picture like this.
303000	305000	I'll show you.
305000	310000	This is a pretty close ecology in the academic world.
310000	313000	When you finish writing the paper, you show it to the boss.
313000	317000	The boss will change it for you for the first, second, and sixth time.
317000	319000	Or later...
319000	321000	According to what he wrote, I don't know how many times.
321000	323000	49 times, right?
323000	325000	Okay.
325000	329000	This is actually something that happens quite often in the academic world.
329000	334000	Because everyone wants to adjust the quality of the paper to be very perfect.
334000	338000	After it's very perfect, it will be sent to the magazine
338000	342000	or find a way to try to publish it.
342000	348000	In this case, you can see that this student is in great pain.
348000	350000	The reason for the pain is actually...
350000	351000	There are several reasons.
351000	354000	The first one is that he changed it back and forth many times.
354000	358000	You can see that the file name is different every time.
358000	361000	Suppose you look at this Revision 8, Common File.
361000	363000	Do you know what the boss changed?
363000	364000	You probably can't tell.
364000	368000	You don't know what the boss did just by looking at the file name.
368000	369000	There's another one. You can look at the photo.
369000	371000	He also wrote a track change.
371000	374000	After you open the file, he might say,
374000	377000	Oh, what did he change in this file?
377000	383000	But if I want to compare this Revision 18 with Revision 2,
383000	386000	it should be quite difficult in this situation.
386000	392000	I'm actually using this comic as a motivation today.
392000	398000	We can use LaTeX to deal with this situation more effectively.
398000	402000	It won't be so painful to change the paper.
402000	405000	I'm going back to the original...
411000	416000	This is my story.
416000	421000	My report today is mainly focused on LaTeX.
421000	426000	I believe that everyone has a little background on LaTeX.
426000	428000	Someone calls it LaTeX.
428000	430000	I personally like to call it LaTeX.
430000	434000	Because the word LaTeX has another meaning.
434000	438000	It's actually a text layout system.
438000	444000	I will introduce a tool called TIKZ later.
444000	452000	It's actually a interface that can display images in LaTeX.
452000	454000	Finally, I mentioned what Beamer is.
454000	457000	It's mainly used to make videos.
457000	461000	Okay, then...
461000	465000	Okay, then I won't talk too much nonsense.
465000	468000	I'll just go straight into what LaTeX is.
468000	471000	LaTeX is actually the most primitive version.
471000	472000	It's called TeX.
472000	478000	It was actually designed and published by Professor Donald Knuth.
478000	480000	It's a layout system.
480000	484000	The so-called layout system means that
484000	490000	it designs the text you want to type
490000	493000	with a text file.
493000	494000	Then, through the layout system,
494000	500000	it can design the font size and distance of the text
500000	503000	and then prepare it into a final version of the file.
503000	505000	This is the so-called layout system.
505000	509000	The version of TeX is very interesting.
509000	512000	You can see it's a strange number.
512000	516000	There's actually a story behind it.
516000	520000	Professor Knuth was quite confident in the text he wrote.
520000	525000	So he felt that the text he wrote had very few bugs.
525000	527000	So if someone found a bug,
527000	531000	he would give a corresponding check as a reward.
531000	533000	Then when TeX was revised,
533000	535000	the number would be added,
535000	538000	but the way it was added was not the usual software,
538000	539000	which is to add 1 and add 2.
539000	542000	It's the number of decimal places after pi.
542000	545000	This is the current version.
545000	547000	The little story is that
547000	553000	if Knuth can't maintain it in the future,
553000	556000	the final version will be changed to pi.
556000	560000	So it's still a prime number.
560000	564000	Then it might become pi at some point.
564000	567000	This is the TeX system.
568000	570000	What we often use in LaTeX
570000	574000	is to add some additional instructions to TeX.
574000	576000	These instructions allow us to
576000	579000	efficiently arrange a file.
579000	581000	For example, in a academic document,
581000	584000	it usually has a title and author.
584000	586000	Then you may want to control the size of the page.
586000	588000	You have to add a password.
588000	590000	LaTeX will wrap these functions
590000	593000	into some very simple applications,
593000	595000	so you don't have to worry about
596000	600000	what the format of the title, author, and password is.
600000	605000	You just need to focus on what your content is.
605000	606000	If you have any questions,
606000	609000	please feel free to interrupt me at any time.
609000	610000	Let me ask you here.
610000	611000	You turned on your microphone,
611000	613000	that is, your speaker.
613000	615000	So if everyone is talking, you can hear it.
615000	617000	I'm not sure if you turned it on or not.
617000	619000	Oh, right.
619000	621000	Okay, that should be fine.
621000	623000	Oh, yes, I just muted it.
623000	626000	Okay, I'll move on to the next page.
630000	632000	I'm sure you all have experience with LaTeX.
632000	634000	I'll just quickly talk about it here.
634000	638000	LaTeX mainly inputs a text file
638000	640000	and then goes through some layout systems.
640000	641000	After going through the layout system,
641000	643000	you can output the final file.
643000	647000	Usually, the text file name is .tex.
647000	650000	After going through the layout system,
650000	653000	there are a lot of different options here.
653000	656000	I just mentioned .tex and LaTeX.
656000	658000	There are other different ones later.
658000	662000	They are used for different layout situations.
662000	663000	The final result of the layout
663000	665000	may be this kind of different file names.
665000	671000	The most common is to arrange the file into a PDF file.
671000	673000	This is the LaTeX system,
673000	678000	which is the most basic concept.
678000	680000	Okay, in the next page,
680000	682000	I'll briefly introduce
682000	689000	the basic structure of a LaTeX file.
689000	690000	I'd like to ask
690000	693000	if you think this is too simple.
693000	694000	You may think it's too simple.
694000	696000	If you all have experience.
696000	698000	No, no.
698000	699000	No?
699000	701000	So do I need to explain a little more?
701000	702000	Yes.
702000	703000	Okay.
703000	705000	I said no, no.
705000	709000	Does that mean you need to skip it?
709000	713000	I think it's just right.
713000	714000	That's it.
714000	715000	Let's talk about it quickly.
715000	717000	Okay, let's talk about it quickly.
717000	722000	A standard LaTeX file is probably...
722000	724000	First, it will have a command
724000	726000	called document class start.
726000	729000	Then the GuaHu part will specify
729000	732000	whether I want this file to be an article,
732000	734000	a report, or a book.
734000	735000	It will first define
735000	740000	the approximate size of this file.
740000	743000	Then usually after this document class,
743000	745000	there will be a part of the area
745000	747000	called use package.
747000	749000	That is to say, this file,
749000	753000	some of the commands it will need,
753000	755000	for example, more complicated math,
755000	758000	or some special font,
758000	759000	or some other functions,
759000	761000	such as if there is a hyperlink,
761000	763000	or some special color,
763000	766000	or drawing.
766000	767000	These enhanced functions
767000	772000	are usually introduced with this use package.
772000	774000	This is the second part of this file.
774000	777000	The next part is that
777000	779000	these commands will specify
779000	781000	what the title of this file is,
781000	782000	and then its author,
782000	784000	the author's name at the back,
784000	787000	and then the date of this file.
787000	788000	It's very simple to use.
788000	790000	You just type in this command
790000	792000	and change this part to say
792000	793000	what the title is,
793000	795000	what the author's name is,
795000	798000	and what the date is.
798000	802000	This part is usually called preamble.
802000	803000	The real file starts
803000	805000	with the beginning document,
805000	807000	the end document.
807000	809000	The latex command is
809000	811000	that most of the commands
811000	815000	are processed by the beginning and end.
815000	816000	The beginning means
816000	819000	that I am now at the beginning of a certain environment,
819000	821000	and the end is the end of this environment.
821000	824000	So from the 10th and 15th lines,
824000	826000	this means that
826000	828000	between the 10th and 15th lines,
828000	838000	I will describe the content of this file.
838000	841000	After defining the file,
841000	842000	we can see that the 11th line
842000	845000	is a command called makeTitle.
845000	846000	This command means that
846000	849000	based on the title author date I specified earlier,
849000	852000	I will make a corresponding
852000	855000	title shape.
855000	859000	The important part of this part is that
859000	860000	when you do this,
860000	862000	you don't have to worry at all
862000	865000	about how big the title font is,
865000	866000	how big the author font is,
866000	869000	or how much the date font should be.
869000	870000	This part of the latex
870000	872000	will help you
872000	875000	to arrange it according to the specified command.
875000	876000	So all you have to do is
876000	879000	focus on your content.
879000	881000	For the 12th to 14th lines,
881000	884000	I will simply show an example.
884000	887000	It can arrange some mathematical parameters.
887000	891000	Here I use a command called
891000	893000	beginAlign and endAlign
893000	897000	to insert a mathematical value
897000	901000	with a whole width.
901000	903000	This command will also add a
903000	906000	function number behind the function.
906000	908000	This is a very simple one.
908000	911000	Of course, there are a lot of commands behind it.
911000	915000	I don't want to mention so many time factors.
915000	919000	This is a standard example.
919000	921000	Next, I will show you that
921000	923000	if you are really interested in
923000	926000	making real latex files,
926000	929000	there are some that I have used,
929000	931000	and there are some editors
931000	933000	or some interfaces that I recommend.
933000	937000	There are usually two types of editors.
937000	939000	There is a type of editor
939000	942000	that I call Latex Specific.
942000	944000	This type of editor
944000	947000	will automatically
947000	949000	compile the compiled file
949000	954000	and sometimes compile the PDF
954000	957000	to the same interface.
957000	959000	So you can
959000	961000	click some quick buttons at the same time
961000	963000	and you can quickly see
963000	966000	the contents of the compiled file.
966000	968000	Then there are often used
968000	971000	text maker, text studio, textworks, etc.
971000	974000	I just had a discussion with the host
974000	977000	that there are some web page interfaces
977000	980000	such as Overleaf or ShareLatex.
980000	982000	These interfaces mean that
982000	984000	you don't need to install anything at all.
984000	988000	Your stuff is stored in the remote server.
988000	990000	As long as you open the web page, you can edit it.
990000	992000	You don't have to worry about
992000	994000	which editor to use to edit it.
994000	997000	It has done a good job of compatibility.
997000	1001000	As long as you focus on the content of the file,
1001000	1003000	the format of the file
1003000	1005000	will automatically arrange it for you.
1005000	1007000	This is one type.
1007000	1009000	I call it Latex Specific.
1009000	1011000	There is another type.
1011000	1013000	I call it General.
1013000	1015000	Basically, as long as you can open the text file,
1015000	1016000	you can do this.
1016000	1018000	I often use things like
1018000	1020000	Vim, Emacs, etc.
1020000	1024000	I personally like to use Sublime Text.
1024000	1028000	You can also use Windows Notebook.
1028000	1030000	It depends on your preference.
1030000	1032000	As long as you can open the text file,
1032000	1034000	you can edit and save it.
1034000	1037000	As for the layout system,
1037000	1039000	if you use a single board Latex,
1039000	1043000	you need to install a larger system.
1043000	1045000	This system includes
1045000	1053000	the editing interface I mentioned earlier.
1053000	1055000	I often use things like
1055000	1059000	TechLive, MiKTX, or MacTek.
1059000	1061000	These are used separately.
1061000	1065000	TechLive can be used for Windows or Linux.
1065000	1068000	MiKTX is mainly used for Windows.
1068000	1071000	This is mainly used for Mac.
1071000	1073000	After editing,
1073000	1075000	you can choose
1075000	1078000	which PDF monitor you want.
1078000	1081000	There are many different choices.
1081000	1085000	This is mainly to give you an overview.
1085000	1088000	What are the most basic Latex tools?
1088000	1091000	How do we make a simple text file?
1091000	1094000	What is the content?
1094000	1096000	The first is the background.
1096000	1100000	Next, I will introduce the main focus of this talk.
1100000	1104000	I think everyone will be more interested in this.
1104000	1106000	But if you come to listen,
1106000	1111000	you should already have a good understanding of Latex.
1111000	1113000	So for this picture,
1113000	1118000	you might think it's acceptable.
1118000	1120000	The meaning of this picture is
1120000	1123000	Latex vs Word.
1123000	1129000	Horizontal represents the complexity of processing files.
1129000	1132000	Y-axis represents the time you need.
1132000	1134000	The meaning of this picture is
1134000	1136000	when your file is very small,
1136000	1138000	maybe only one page,
1138000	1140000	or one or two pages,
1140000	1141000	not much content,
1141000	1142000	maybe only text,
1142000	1144000	when it's simpler,
1144000	1146000	in this case, you can use Word
1146000	1149000	to make this file in a very short time.
1149000	1152000	But when your file is very large,
1152000	1154000	for example, you want to write a journal paper,
1154000	1158000	you want to write a book,
1158000	1160000	some problems will arise.
1160000	1162000	At present, I still don't know
1162000	1164000	how to use Microsoft Word
1164000	1166000	to effectively solve these problems.
1166000	1169000	But Latex has a corresponding method.
1169000	1172000	Here, I would like to say
1172000	1175000	that I will compare Word and Latex.
1175000	1177000	I personally use Latex more often,
1177000	1180000	so I might be a little biased.
1180000	1182000	I might think Latex is better.
1182000	1184000	The same function,
1184000	1186000	Word may also be able to achieve.
1186000	1188000	If you want to discuss with me,
1188000	1191000	please feel free to interrupt me.
1191000	1195000	The first point I want to discuss
1195000	1204000	is the difficulty of mathematical editing.
1204000	1206000	If you use Microsoft Word,
1206000	1208000	the tool you often use
1208000	1210000	may be called a square editor.
1210000	1212000	Some people may think that
1212000	1213000	the square editor is too ugly.
1213000	1218000	They will use tools like MathType.
1218000	1220000	These tools are mainly
1220000	1224000	used to edit the square editor with a mouse.
1224000	1226000	So you need to use a mouse
1226000	1228000	to click here and there
1228000	1230000	to select some up and down icons,
1230000	1232000	to select some root numbers,
1232000	1238000	some special mathematical symbols.
1238000	1240000	I don't say this is not good.
1240000	1243000	This is an input method.
1243000	1245000	But if you use Latex,
1245000	1248000	suppose you want to input the following symbol,
1248000	1250000	you can use Word at all.
1250000	1252000	You don't have to leave the keyboard.
1252000	1256000	Just input these symbols with the keyboard
1256000	1260000	and you can output the following mathematical equation.
1260000	1263000	You may think
1263000	1265000	how to convert this equation
1265000	1268000	to these strange symbols.
1269000	1271000	This actually depends on
1271000	1274000	your familiarity with Latex.
1274000	1277000	For example,
1277000	1279000	Begin and Align
1279000	1283000	means that I inserted a row of wide mathematical equations.
1283000	1286000	The input method
1286000	1288000	is actually quite similar to the way we read.
1288000	1290000	It's the same from left to right.
1290000	1293000	If I need a square,
1293000	1295000	I will enter a square.
1295000	1296000	If I need the initial a,
1296000	1298000	I will enter an a.
1298000	1300000	This command means
1300000	1302000	I want the initial a in mathematics.
1302000	1305000	It's very similar to the way
1305000	1307000	to input words in mathematics.
1307000	1310000	I need an initial u, initial c, initial v,
1310000	1312000	and then a right square.
1312000	1314000	This symbol means up and down,
1314000	1316000	and then up and down plus 1.
1316000	1318000	So this command
1318000	1322000	is not the final result,
1322000	1323000	but in terms of reading,
1323000	1326000	it's actually quite in line with people's reading habits.
1326000	1328000	It's the same from left to right.
1328000	1331000	Another advantage I use is
1331000	1333000	when Latex is in the array,
1333000	1336000	you can add blanks and arrays at will.
1336000	1339000	So you can put a very complex mathematical equation
1339000	1342000	with very effective arrays.
1342000	1345000	You can insert an array or a blank
1345000	1348000	to make it easier to read.
1348000	1350000	So like me,
1350000	1353000	this equation represents this part.
1353000	1356000	Then according to the following
1356000	1358000	different structures of this mathematical equation
1358000	1360000	to make a relative array.
1360000	1362000	So when you want to change the mathematical equation,
1362000	1364000	you can also easily go back
1364000	1366000	to the relative Latex part
1366000	1369000	to change its original code.
1369000	1372000	This is my personal experience.
1372000	1373000	The first advantage is that
1373000	1375000	the mathematical equation is very easy to input.
1375000	1378000	Let's pause for a moment.
1378000	1379000	Do you have any questions?
1379000	1381000	I want to...
1381000	1382000	I guess I should turn this on.
1382000	1383000	Then you can turn it on.
1383000	1384000	It's okay.
1384000	1385000	Then I'll just use your side to talk.
1385000	1386000	It's okay.
1386000	1390000	I want to share something with you.
1390000	1392000	It's a powerpoint plug-in.
1392000	1395000	It's called Iguana Text.
1395000	1397000	I'll post it in the chat room for everyone to see.
1397000	1399000	It's actually...
1399000	1400000	Because you mentioned that
1400000	1402000	the Microsoft equation is an editor.
1402000	1404000	It's actually very ugly.
1404000	1407000	So someone developed a powerpoint plug-in.
1407000	1410000	In fact, all the mathematical equations
1410000	1412000	are still using Latex code.
1412000	1414000	Basically, it's also
1414000	1417000	what the author shared on the screen.
1417000	1419000	It just happens to be a plug-in
1419000	1421000	that can be placed directly in your powerpoint.
1421000	1422000	So it's beautiful.
1422000	1424000	This Iguana Text
1424000	1427000	is a very, very advanced
1427000	1430000	Microsoft equation editor.
1430000	1431000	So I'll post it in the chat room
1431000	1432000	and share it with you.
1432000	1434000	Thank you for sharing.
1434000	1436000	Because I...
1436000	1438000	My computer is actually Linux.
1438000	1439000	So it's...
1439000	1442000	Iguana Text can't be installed at all.
1442000	1443000	It can be installed, but...
1443000	1444000	It's very painful.
1444000	1445000	It's very painful.
1445000	1447000	So I'm just...
1447000	1450000	I'm not familiar with this aspect of the plug-in.
1450000	1452000	Okay, so this is...
1452000	1454000	I personally think the first advantage is
1454000	1457000	to edit in a mathematical way.
1457000	1460000	Okay, what about the second part?
1460000	1462000	This is a personal experience
1462000	1464000	of sharing.
1464000	1465000	That is to say,
1465000	1467000	when you need to deal with
1467000	1469000	a very large file,
1469000	1472000	suppose you want to write a doctor's thesis,
1472000	1474000	and then suppose your research results
1474000	1475000	are very rich,
1475000	1477000	you write up to 500 pages.
1477000	1479000	Yes, write a 500-page doctor's thesis.
1479000	1481000	If you have Word experience,
1481000	1484000	that is, you open a 500-page Word file,
1484000	1487000	what will happen?
1487000	1489000	I haven't really opened it myself,
1489000	1491000	but I've heard people share their experience
1491000	1493000	that usually this situation is...
1493000	1495000	First of all, when you open the file,
1495000	1496000	it will be very, very slow
1496000	1500000	because it needs to scan all 500 pages.
1500000	1501000	Then next,
1501000	1507000	if you have some text blocks in the middle,
1507000	1510000	some blocks you pulled yourself,
1510000	1511000	it will be slower
1511000	1513000	because it needs to load these blocks.
1513000	1517000	Okay, but for our purpose,
1517000	1520000	these steps are not necessary.
1520000	1522000	We just need to change
1522000	1525000	a paragraph in our text.
1525000	1527000	So the focus of our focus
1527000	1529000	should be to pick this paragraph
1529000	1531000	and then modify it.
1531000	1535000	After that,
1535000	1537000	that is, to do this,
1537000	1539000	it should not need to be loaded
1539000	1542000	into other blocks.
1542000	1544000	If it's Word,
1544000	1545000	I don't know yet
1545000	1547000	how to avoid this problem.
1547000	1551000	Suppose you have a 500-page thesis.
1551000	1552000	If it's LaTeX,
1552000	1554000	it can use a...
1554000	1556000	It's a bit like writing a word.
1556000	1557000	Suppose you write a thesis,
1557000	1559000	you can use a file called
1559000	1561000	Thesis.txt for your thesis.
1561000	1562000	Under this file,
1562000	1564000	you separate the different content.
1564000	1566000	You may need to separate a file,
1566000	1568000	Introduction a file,
1568000	1569000	Topic 1 separate a file.
1569000	1570000	Under Topic 1,
1570000	1572000	you can have your own Introduction,
1572000	1573000	your own introduction,
1573000	1574000	your own translation.
1574000	1575000	That is to say,
1575000	1576000	you make your file
1576000	1579000	a system plan.
1579000	1580000	Distribute different content
1580000	1583000	into different files.
1583000	1584000	The advantage of this is that
1584000	1586000	if I want to change
1586000	1588000	Example 1 of Topic 1,
1588000	1589000	I just need to open this file
1589000	1592000	and make a relative modification.
1592000	1593000	I don't need to
1593000	1596000	load all the files.
1596000	1597000	This is the first advantage.
1597000	1599000	The second advantage is
1599000	1600000	if I want to see
1600000	1604000	the result of this part of the translation,
1604000	1605000	I can translate this
1605000	1607000	Thesis.txt file,
1607000	1609000	but I can put
1609000	1610000	these unnecessary ones,
1610000	1611000	such as
1611000	1612000	Example 1,
1612000	1613000	Introduction,
1613000	1614000	Topic 2,
1614000	1615000	Topic 3,
1615000	1616000	Conclusion,
1616000	1617000	I can just block it.
1617000	1619000	I have a simple version.
1619000	1621000	Thesis.txt only has
1621000	1624000	Example 1 in Topic 1.
1624000	1625000	I only do translation
1625000	1626000	for this file.
1626000	1627000	So I can see right away that
1627000	1629000	I changed this thing,
1629000	1631000	and it will look like this
1631000	1633000	in the real file.
1633000	1634000	So this can reach
1634000	1636000	a very large file,
1636000	1638000	we make it a system partition,
1638000	1639000	then we can edit
1639000	1640000	a small file,
1640000	1641000	and we can see
1641000	1643000	the result of the editing very quickly.
1643000	1645000	This is my personal opinion
1645000	1649000	the second advantage of LaTeX.
1649000	1651000	Next is
1651000	1652000	to continue to the next one.
1652000	1655000	The third advantage
1655000	1658000	is the compatibility problem.
1658000	1659000	If you often use
1659000	1661000	Microsoft Word,
1661000	1662000	you may still remember
1662000	1663000	about ten years ago
1663000	1664000	there was a
1664000	1665000	Dock version
1665000	1667000	to DockX version
1667000	1669000	a pain period.
1669000	1671000	Dock version is mainly
1671000	1673000	I think DockX version
1673000	1675000	is Office 2007
1675000	1678000	Word 2007 plus
1678000	1680000	about ten years ago.
1680000	1681000	Anyway,
1681000	1682000	there is this pain period.
1682000	1683000	Before that,
1683000	1687000	it was all DOC version.
1687000	1688000	Like this file format change
1688000	1691000	there will be some
1691000	1692000	some trouble.
1692000	1694000	Suppose you wrote a paper
1694000	1696000	twenty years ago,
1696000	1697000	you may now
1697000	1699000	the format will run out.
1699000	1700000	This thing,
1700000	1702000	especially in the academic world
1702000	1705000	it should not be allowed.
1705000	1706000	Suppose you have a picture
1706000	1707000	you run out
1707000	1709000	then your data will run out.
1709000	1711000	So it's very troublesome
1711000	1714000	to maintain anything.
1714000	1716000	Microsoft has such
1716000	1718000	DOC to DOCX
1718000	1721000	history.
1721000	1722000	So it's hard to guarantee
1722000	1724000	DOCX may be changed
1724000	1725000	to other formats.
1725000	1728000	It's hard to say.
1728000	1730000	So this is a
1730000	1736000	history of Word.
1736000	1738000	Another one is
1738000	1739000	even if you use the same file
1739000	1742000	you use DOCX.
1742000	1744000	If you use different versions of Word
1744000	1747000	it may run out a bit.
1747000	1748000	Maybe its line
1748000	1750000	or font will be a bit
1750000	1753000	not the same as your original edit.
1753000	1755000	Suppose some people don't have Word
1755000	1757000	they use Pages or LibreOffice
1757000	1759000	it may be different.
1759000	1761000	This is the same
1761000	1764000	in academic papers
1764000	1769000	a very disadvantageous phenomenon.
1769000	1770000	Another one is
1770000	1771000	you may use different computers
1771000	1772000	different operating systems
1772000	1774000	Windows, Mac.
1774000	1777000	This file
1777000	1778000	may not be able to run
1778000	1781000	in other operating systems.
1781000	1783000	If you use LaTeX
1783000	1787000	its editable file
1787000	1789000	is actually Word.
1789000	1790000	So Word
1790000	1792000	you can run a lot of things.
1792000	1793000	You can run a notebook
1793000	1795000	and Mac, Linux
1795000	1796000	all can be run.
1796000	1800000	The final file is PDF
1800000	1805000	almost every platform can support PDF.
1805000	1807000	There are a lot of software
1807000	1809000	you can use.
1809000	1811000	This is my
1811000	1813000	third advantage
1813000	1814000	from my experience.
1814000	1817000	The file format is Word
1817000	1820000	and there is no DOC, DOCX
1820000	1823000	or other problems.
1823000	1825000	Next I will
1825000	1829000	Is there any questions?
1829000	1831000	All right.
1831000	1835000	Next I will look at
1835000	1839000	one of my personal experiences.
1839000	1842000	Look at the picture on the left.
1842000	1844000	I will draw it roughly.
1844000	1846000	Suppose you have a paper
1846000	1849000	you are writing a journal paper.
1849000	1850000	This box represents
1850000	1851000	one of your pictures
1851000	1853000	it is Figure 1.
1853000	1856000	Then you are in the text
1856000	1857000	in the paragraph
1857000	1859000	you need to mention Figure 1.
1859000	1861000	Then in a certain place
1861000	1863000	you need to mention 20%
1863000	1864000	this number.
1864000	1866000	Then in another place
1866000	1867000	you need to mention
1867000	1868000	X equals 10
1868000	1869000	this message.
1869000	1871000	Then this 20%
1871000	1872000	and X equals 10
1872000	1873000	it may actually be
1873000	1875000	one of the Figure 1
1875000	1877000	some data points
1877000	1879000	the conclusion.
1879000	1880000	I use red here
1880000	1881000	means
1881000	1882000	red means
1882000	1886000	my experiment data.
1886000	1888000	The file is here
1888000	1890000	there is no problem
1890000	1892000	Word or LaTeX
1892000	1895000	can reach this function.
1895000	1897000	Now suppose there is a situation
1897000	1900000	suppose your boss is not satisfied with Figure 1
1900000	1901000	he is not satisfied with the parameters
1901000	1904000	he thinks you change the parameters
1904000	1906000	to see if these numbers
1906000	1909000	become more effective.
1909000	1911000	So in some cases
1911000	1912000	you may need
1912000	1914000	after you finish writing the paper
1914000	1916000	you need to update your data.
1916000	1917000	Maybe you need to run again
1917000	1919000	run to a new set of data.
1919000	1921000	In terms of updating
1921000	1922000	in concept
1922000	1923000	the red part
1923000	1925000	needs to be updated together.
1925000	1927000	Because you run a new result
1927000	1929000	your Figure content changes.
1929000	1931000	So this Figure 1
1931000	1932000	it
1932000	1933000	you may also
1933000	1934000	in the process of text editing
1934000	1936000	this Figure 1 becomes Figure 2.
1936000	1938000	So this
1938000	1939000	this
1939000	1940000	this
1940000	1942000	Figure 1 also needs to be relatively modified.
1942000	1943000	This number
1943000	1944000	needs to be modified
1944000	1947000	according to your experiment data.
1947000	1950000	If you use Word
1950000	1951000	you can think about
1951000	1952000	if you use Word
1952000	1954000	how to achieve this?
1954000	1956000	Maybe you just
1956000	1957000	run MATLAB again
1957000	1959000	generate another picture
1959000	1960000	and then
1960000	1961000	after the picture is generated
1961000	1962000	you put the picture back
1962000	1963000	back to Figure 1
1963000	1964000	put the picture back
1964000	1965000	then you have to remember
1965000	1966000	you need to change 20%
1966000	1968000	you may now become 15%
1968000	1970000	and now X may not be 12
1970000	1972000	X may become 12
1972000	1973000	So
1973000	1974000	a job
1974000	1976000	you need to change Figure 1
1976000	1977000	at the same time you have to pay attention
1977000	1978000	you have to change 20%
1978000	1979000	with X
1979000	1981000	all these things need to be changed.
1983000	1985000	When your file is complicated
1985000	1987000	this thing will appear
1987000	1988000	more times.
1988000	1990000	So if it appears
1990000	1991000	100 times
1991000	1992000	then you change 95
1992000	1994000	you have 5 forgotten to change.
1994000	1996000	Then your data is wrong.
1996000	1997000	Okay, then LaTeX has a solution
1997000	1999000	that is
2000000	2001000	first you can use
2001000	2003000	Label and Reference
2003000	2004000	to update
2004000	2006000	your Figure numbers.
2006000	2008000	If you use LaTeX
2008000	2010000	to write paper
2010000	2012000	this value should be used often.
2012000	2014000	This is my own
2014000	2015000	experience
2015000	2016000	that is
2016000	2018000	20% and X is 10
2018000	2019000	These two data points
2019000	2021000	are actually related to Figure 1.
2021000	2025000	So before you use LaTeX
2025000	2027000	you can
2027000	2028000	when you write MATLAB
2028000	2032000	you generate two text files at the same time
2032000	2035000	output 20% and X is 10
2035000	2037000	that is, the city directly input these two numbers
2037000	2039000	it is for two different files
2039000	2041000	when you write paper
2041000	2043000	you directly include these two files
2043000	2045000	right
2045000	2046000	so you
2046000	2047000	when you write a file
2047000	2048000	you have to pay attention
2048000	2049000	that is
2049000	2051000	what value
2051000	2053000	is related to what
2053000	2054000	then put all these things
2054000	2055000	together
2055000	2058000	then it is convenient to update
2058000	2059000	this is one of my
2059000	2060000	experience
2060000	2062000	because
2062000	2064000	I also studied for a while
2064000	2066000	then I found out that
2066000	2067000	LaTeX has this
2067000	2070000	quite convenient function
2070000	2072000	that
2072000	2075000	the last one I
2075000	2076000	this picture I
2076000	2077000	showed you before
2077000	2078000	that is
2078000	2080000	final.doc
2080000	2081000	that is
2081000	2082000	if you use Word
2082000	2084000	you will keep changing
2084000	2085000	and then
2085000	2086000	change the name
2086000	2087000	then you may track
2087000	2089000	do not know how
2089000	2090000	this can track
2090000	2091000	but it may be
2091000	2092000	very difficult to say
2092000	2093000	the difference is very far
2093000	2095000	version to track
2095000	2098000	that if LaTeX, then
2098000	2099000	first I have to state that
2099000	2100000	LaTeX itself
2100000	2101000	it does not provide
2101000	2103000	that is the file tracking function
2103000	2105000	it needs to add some other
2105000	2107000	software
2107000	2108000	then
2108000	2109000	I often use my own
2109000	2111000	software called GIT
2112000	2113000	that if you have written
2113000	2114000	that is
2114000	2116000	a relatively large software
2116000	2117000	project
2117000	2118000	project
2118000	2119000	GIT is actually a management
2119000	2120000	that is
2120000	2122000	a program code
2122000	2125000	version control system
2125000	2127000	it can control
2127000	2128000	that is to say
2128000	2129000	this program code
2129000	2130000	at what time
2130000	2131000	by which
2131000	2132000	program designer changed
2132000	2134000	what part of who changed
2134000	2135000	then
2135000	2136000	these changes
2136000	2138000	it will have a relative record
2138000	2139000	then
2139000	2140000	between different users
2140000	2141000	to do
2141000	2142000	these changes
2142000	2143000	record
2143000	2144000	it integrated
2144000	2145000	in the same project
2145000	2146000	so
2146000	2147000	this
2147000	2148000	GIT is actually
2148000	2149000	a pretty
2149000	2150000	I personally think
2150000	2151000	pretty great invention
2151000	2153000	because it can
2153000	2154000	like that
2154000	2155000	software engineering
2155000	2156000	some super big project
2156000	2157000	it can use
2157000	2158000	a lot of people together
2158000	2159000	that is
2159000	2160000	a lot of engineers
2160000	2162000	to do the same software
2162000	2163000	then it can ensure that
2163000	2164000	different engineers
2164000	2165000	will not change
2165000	2166000	other engineers
2166000	2167000	the result
2167000	2168000	so
2168000	2169000	that
2169000	2170000	this function
2170000	2171000	it actually
2171000	2172000	needs to use
2172000	2173000	LaTeX file
2173000	2174000	plus GIT
2174000	2175000	to achieve
2175000	2176000	that
2176000	2177000	I only simply list
2177000	2178000	a few keywords
2178000	2179000	if you use
2179000	2180000	GIT
2180000	2181000	this software
2181000	2182000	to monitor
2182000	2183000	that is
2183000	2184000	LaTeX file
2184000	2185000	file
2185000	2186000	change
2186000	2187000	text
2187000	2188000	you wait
2188000	2189000	to come up
2189000	2190000	and say
2190000	2191000	you can control
2191000	2192000	that is
2192000	2193000	your file
2193000	2194000	at what time
2194000	2195000	to change
2195000	2196000	what place
2196000	2197000	you
2197000	2198000	usually
2198000	2199000	commonly modified
2199000	2200000	that is
2200000	2201000	you add text
2201000	2202000	or delete text
2202000	2203000	then
2203000	2204000	right
2204000	2205000	then GIT
2205000	2206000	has a feature
2206000	2207000	that is
2207000	2208000	every time you modify
2208000	2209000	you can do
2209000	2210000	something like
2210000	2211000	change block
2211000	2212000	it can
2212000	2213000	send a simple report
2213000	2214000	that
2214000	2215000	in this version
2215000	2216000	which file was changed
2216000	2217000	then
2217000	2218000	you can do
2218000	2219000	very detailed
2219000	2220000	so
2220000	2221000	that
2221000	2222000	with this feature
2222000	2223000	you do not have to
2223000	2224000	that
2224000	2225000	change content
2225000	2226000	it forced
2226000	2227000	because
2227000	2228000	this is not easy
2228000	2229000	to read
2229000	2230000	that
2230000	2231000	use GIT
2231000	2232000	can also be
2232000	2233000	very easy to
2233000	2234000	reply to the changes
2234000	2235000	before
2235000	2236000	then
2236000	2237000	you can do
2237000	2238000	a lot of people
2238000	2239000	in this
2239000	2240000	cooperation
2240000	2241000	that
2241000	2242000	this is
2242000	2243000	my personal experience
2243000	2244000	that
2244000	2245000	finally show you
2245000	2246000	that
2246000	2247000	I mentioned
2247000	2248000	the first five
2248000	2249000	advantages
2249000	2250000	that
2250000	2251000	probably
2251000	2252000	the second
2252000	2253000	with
2253000	2254000	this
2254000	2255000	with this
2255000	2256000	second
2256000	2257000	and the fourth
2257000	2258000	is my personal experience
2258000	2259000	that
2259000	2260000	good
2260000	2261000	later if
2261000	2262000	we use more advanced
2262000	2263000	there are some other
2263000	2264000	features
2264000	2265000	like
2265000	2266000	we can
2266000	2267000	write a paper
2267000	2268000	in
2268000	2269000	is to use
2269000	2270000	reference
2270000	2271000	when
2271000	2272000	it can
2272000	2273000	automatically

2302000	2303000	good
2303000	2304000	that
2304000	2305000	next
2305000	2306000	I want to
2306000	2307000	discuss
2307000	2308000	a called
2308000	2309000	TIKZ
2309000	2310000	I'm sorry
2310000	2311000	I have a
2311000	2312000	small problem
2312000	2313000	that
2313000	2314000	you said
2314000	2315000	you can
2315000	2316000	output
2316000	2317000	a certain
2317000	2318000	or a certain
2318000	2319000	number
2319000	2320000	when
2320000	2321000	that
2321000	2322000	side I do not
2322000	2323000	understand
2323000	2324000	you say
2324000	2325000	I can
2325000	2326000	picture
2326000	2327000	picture, then
2327000	2328000	I can
2328000	2329000	understand
2329000	2330000	that I
2330000	2331000	output a
2331000	2332000	picture
2332000	2333000	and then
2333000	2334000	I just
2334000	2335000	reference
2335000	2336000	to that
2336000	2337000	picture
2337000	2338000	and then
2338000	2339000	feature
2339000	2340000	will not
2340000	2341000	change
2341000	2342000	but you
2342000	2343000	is to produce
2343000	2344000	a picture
2344000	2345000	you are using
2345000	2346000	tools like
2346000	2347000	MATLAB
2347000	2348000	or something like
2348000	2349000	that
2349000	2350000	you are using
2350000	2351000	RR
2351000	2352000	RR
2352000	2353000	good
2353000	2354000	that should
2354000	2355000	also be
2355000	2356000	the same
2356000	2357000	meaning
2357000	2358000	good
2358000	2359000	I mean
2359000	2360000	that
2360000	2361000	because
2361000	2362000	this is just
2362000	2363000	a reference
2363000	2364000	picture
2364000	2365000	if my
2365000	2366000	feature 1
2366000	2367000	is a
2367000	2368000	long
2368000	2369000	picture
2369000	2370000	I did not
2370000	2371000	draw
2371000	2372000	then this
2372000	2373000	20%
2373000	2374000	represents
2374000	2375000	that
2375000	2376000	the second
2376000	2377000	data point
2377000	2378000	is the first
2378000	2379000	data point
2379000	2380000	of 20%
2380000	2381000	it represents
2381000	2382000	this
2382000	2383000	question
2383000	2384000	and then
2384000	2385000	in the file
2385000	2386000	I
2386000	2387000	especially
2387000	2388000	use
2388000	2389000	a number
2389000	2390000	20%
2390000	2391000	to
2391000	2392000	represent
2392000	2393000	is
2393000	2394000	particularly
2394000	2395000	emphasize
2395000	2396000	this picture
2396000	2397000	of a
2397000	2398000	feature
2398000	2399000	like this
2399000	2400000	here
2400000	2401000	integrated
2405000	2406000	that is to say
2406000	2407000	when you output
2407000	2408000	this picture
2408000	2409000	this picture
2409000	2410000	has included
2410000	2411000	20%
2411000	2412000	of this information
2412000	2413000	in the
2413000	2414000	inside
2414000	2415000	Oh
2415000	2416000	right
2416000	2417000	that
2417000	2418000	good
2418000	2419000	so now if you want
2419000	2420000	to update data
2420000	2421000	you run
2421000	2422000	the experiment
2422000	2423000	20%
2423000	2424000	becomes 15%
2424000	2425000	in this picture
2425000	2426000	looks like
2426000	2427000	15%
2427000	2428000	but you
2428000	2429000	you become
2429000	2430000	you have to go back
2430000	2431000	to your paper
2431000	2432000	part of
2432000	2433000	the 20%
2433000	2434000	manually changed
2434000	2435000	to 15%
2435000	2436000	so
2436000	2437000	your
2437000	2438000	figure
2438000	2439000	is not a
2439000	2440000	that it actually
2440000	2441000	contains another
2441000	2442000	thing I do not know
2442000	2443000	what this
2443000	2444000	is called
2444000	2445000	because this
2445000	2446000	I have not used
2446000	2447000	but your
2447000	2448000	figure is not a
2448000	2449000	example of a
2449000	2450000	.eps
2450000	2451000	such a file
2451000	2452000	I
2452000	2453000	look at
2453000	2454000	my back
2454000	2455000	there is no
2455000	2456000	case
2456000	2457000	Oh
2457000	2458000	I
2458000	2459000	that
2459000	2460000	but I can
2460000	2461000	that I
2461000	2462000	take as an example
2462000	2463000	suppose
2463000	2464000	now this is
2464000	2465000	what I want
2465000	2466000	to be
2466000	2467000	good
2467000	2468000	then
2468000	2469000	he
2469000	2470000	he is
2470000	2471000	this strange
2471000	2472000	picture
2472000	2473000	and then
2473000	2474000	suppose
2474000	2475000	I wrote
2475000	2476000	later
2476000	2477000	when I
2477000	2478000	specifically
2478000	2479000	mentioned
2479000	2480000	that
2480000	2481000	this function
2481000	2482000	is the lowest
2482000	2483000	point
2483000	2484000	is the lowest
2484000	2485000	point
2485000	2486000	0.2
2486000	2487000	I
2487000	2488000	that
2488000	2489000	now
2489000	2490000	suppose you
2490000	2491000	teach
2491000	2492000	you to run
2492000	2493000	another picture
2493000	2494000	this function
2494000	2495000	of the picture
2495000	2496000	that you become
2496000	2497000	you later
2497000	2498000	in that
2498000	2499000	article
2499000	2500000	when you
2500000	2501000	do not
2501000	2502000	0.2
2502000	2503000	this place
2503000	2504000	you have to
2504000	2505000	follow your
2505000	2506000	picture
2506000	2507000	to do
2507000	2508000	relative
2508000	2509000	modification
2509000	2510000	that
2510000	2511000	OK
2511000	2512000	?
2512000	2513000	I guess
2513000	2514000	I guess
2514000	2515000	his question
2515000	2516000	should be
2516000	2517000	that
2517000	2518000	I will mention
2518000	2519000	the next section
2519000	2520000	I personally
2520000	2521000	prefer to
2521000	2522000	use
2522000	2523000	latex
2523000	2524000	to
2524000	2525000	draw
2525000	2526000	that
2526000	2527000	of course
2527000	2528000	I know a lot of users
2528000	2529000	will save
2529000	2530000	EPS
2530000	2531000	right
2531000	2532000	that I just
2532000	2533000	mentioned the
2533000	2534000	problem is
2534000	2535000	that he
2535000	2536000	is with you
2536000	2537000	picture
2537000	2538000	is not
2538000	2539000	directly
2539000	2540000	related
2540000	2541000	so
2541000	2542000	should be
2542000	2543000	said
2543000	2544000	if you are
2544000	2545000	in the
2545000	2546000	picture
2546000	2547000	this
2547000	2548000	can achieve
2548000	2549000	this thing
2549000	2550000	but I
2550000	2551000	want to mention
2551000	2552000	that
2552000	2553000	latex
2553000	2554000	can also
2554000	2555000	do
2555000	2556000	control
2556000	2557000	these
2557000	2558000	things
2558000	2559000	that
2559000	2560000	I
2560000	2561000	want to
2561000	2562000	say
2562000	2563000	this page
2563000	2564000	is that
2564000	2565000	you
2565000	2566000	file
2566000	2567000	some
2567000	2568000	part of
2568000	2569000	the data
2569000	2570000	with
2570000	2571000	some other
2571000	2572000	other
2572000	2573000	other
2573000	2574000	part of
2574000	2575000	the data
2575000	2576000	they are
2576000	2577000	related to each other
2577000	2578000	that if
2578000	2579000	you
2579000	2580000	are writing
2580000	2581000	files after
2581000	2582000	you did not
2582000	2583000	put this thing
2583000	2584000	into consideration
2584000	2585000	that you have to
2585000	2586000	manually update
2586000	2587000	figure 1
2587000	2588000	manually update
2588000	2589000	this 20%
2589000	2590000	and manually
2590000	2591000	update this
2591000	2592000	three parts
2592000	2593000	because you
2593000	2594000	write files
2594000	2595000	when you did not
2595000	2596000	pay attention
2596000	2597000	to you
2597000	2598000	is to write
2598000	2599000	separately
2599000	2600000	when you
2600000	2601000	update
2601000	2602000	you become
2602000	2603000	because you
2603000	2604000	know that the
2604000	2605000	red part
2605000	2606000	is actually
2606000	2607000	these data
2607000	2608000	points these
2608000	2609000	values are
2609000	2610000	related to each
2610000	2611000	other
2611000	2612000	so if you
2612000	2613000	have this
2613000	2614000	concept, then
2614000	2615000	you can
2615000	2616000	put
2616000	2617000	figure 1
2617000	2618000	these
2618000	2619000	or these
2619000	2620000	values
2620000	2621000	are output
2621000	2622000	into three
2622000	2623000	different files
2623000	2624000	figure 1
2624000	2625000	maybe you
2625000	2626000	figure 1.
2626000	2627000	EPS
2627000	2628000	is a file
2628000	2629000	and then this
2629000	2630000	20%
2630000	2631000	you may
2631000	2632000	output
2632000	2633000	a data
2633000	2634000	1.
2634000	2635000	TXT
2635000	2636000	and then
2636000	2637000	this place
2637000	2638000	you may output
2638000	2639000	a data
2639000	2640000	2.
2640000	2641000	TXT
2641000	2642000	and then this
2642000	2643000	data 1 and
2643000	2644000	data 2
2644000	2645000	you have to
2645000	2646000	use your
2646000	2647000	MATLAB
2647000	2648000	or R to
2648000	2649000	generate
2649000	2650000	when you
2650000	2651000	are drawing
2651000	2652000	a good calculation
2652000	2653000	at the same time
2653000	2654000	you put
2654000	2655000	20%
2655000	2656000	and 10%
2656000	2657000	it out
2657000	2658000	output
2658000	2659000	into two
2659000	2660000	TXT
2660000	2661000	EPS
2661000	2662000	and then you
2662000	2663000	input data
2663000	2664000	1.
2664000	2665000	TXT

2666000	2667000	2.
2667000	2668000	TXT
2668000	2669000	so
2669000	2670000	this is
2670000	2671000	ok
2671000	2672000	I know
2672000	2673000	this is
2673000	2674000	a personal
2674000	2675000	use
2675000	2676000	I think this
2676000	2677000	is very practical
2677000	2678000	and if you
2678000	2679000	want to change
2679000	2680000	a lot of things
2680000	2681000	at once
2681000	2682000	you have to
2682000	2683000	remember this
2683000	2684000	thing
2684000	2685000	I
2685000	2686000	wrap up
2686000	2687000	a little bit
2687000	2688000	now this
2688000	2689000	20%
2689000	2690000	but
2690000	2691000	when I do
2691000	2692000	figure 1
2692000	2693000	I do
2693000	2694000	another thing
2694000	2695000	called
2695000	2696000	data 1
2696000	2697000	equals
2697000	2698000	20
2698000	2699000	measure
2699000	2700000	right
2700000	2701000	thank you
2701000	2702000	ok
2702000	2703000	this is mainly
2703000	2704000	practical
2704000	2705000	and
2705000	2706000	this
2706000	2707000	doesn't seem
2707000	2708000	to have a book
2708000	2709000	talking about
2709000	2710000	this
2710000	2711000	this is
2711000	2712000	more of a
2712000	2713000	writing habit
2713000	2714000	here
2714000	2715000	to remind
2715000	2716000	the distance
2716000	2717000	is
2717000	2718000	time
2718000	2719000	I
2719000	2720000	will
2720000	2721000	talk about
2721000	2722000	TIKZ
2722000	2723000	and
2723000	2724000	Beamer
2724000	2725000	TIKZ
2725000	2726000	is a
2726000	2727000	language
2727000	2728000	that can
2728000	2729000	draw a
2729000	2730000	picture
2730000	2731000	and
2731000	2732000	it can
2732000	2733000	directly
2733000	2734000	do the
2734000	2735000	drawing
2735000	2736000	in
2736000	2737000	Lighttime
2737000	2738000	and
2738000	2739000	I
2739000	2740000	personally
2740000	2741000	like it
2741000	2742000	because
2742000	2743000	this is a
2743000	2744000	basic introduction
2744000	2745000	so I
2745000	2746000	jump to
2746000	2747000	some basic
2747000	2748000	things
2748000	2749000	that
2749000	2750000	I
2750000	2751000	just
2751000	2752000	mentioned
2752000	2753000	is the
2753000	2754000	EPS file
2754000	2755000	so I
2755000	2756000	think you
2756000	2757000	have some
2757000	2758000	basic
2758000	2759000	knowledge
2759000	2760000	of the
2760000	2761000	file
2761000	2762000	basically
2762000	2763000	a
2763000	2764000	file
2764000	2765000	can be
2765000	2766000	classified
2766000	2767000	as a
2767000	2768000	quantity
2768000	2769000	file
2769000	2770000	or
2770000	2771000	a
2771000	2772000	dot
2772000	2773000	file
2773000	2774000	a
2774000	2775000	quantity
2775000	2776000	file
2776000	2777000	different
2777000	2778000	lines
2778000	2779000	different shapes
2779000	2780000	different words
2780000	2781000	and their
2781000	2782000	color they
2782000	2783000	are stored
2783000	2784000	information
2784000	2785000	so when you
2785000	2786000	enlarge the
2786000	2787000	picture
2787000	2788000	when it
2788000	2789000	can be
2789000	2790000	based on
2790000	2791000	these
2791000	2792000	shapes
2792000	2793000	colors
2793000	2794000	to do
2794000	2795000	the same
2795000	2796000	proportion
2796000	2797000	so you
2797000	2798000	will not see
2798000	2799000	these
2799000	2800000	sentence
2800000	2801000	phenomenon
2801000	2802000	that
2802000	2803000	dot
2803000	2804000	picture
2804000	2805000	means that
2805000	2806000	that
2806000	2807000	special
2807000	2808000	academic report
2808000	2809000	academic research
2809000	2810000	it
2810000	2811000	actually
2811000	2812000	quantity picture
2812000	2813000	is a better
2813000	2814000	choice
2814000	2815000	because
2815000	2816000	back to the
2816000	2817000	beginning
2817000	2818000	is that you
2818000	2819000	have to do
2819000	2820000	academic report
2820000	2821000	you have to
2821000	2822000	say that
2822000	2823000	the precise
2823000	2824000	and concise
2824000	2825000	is that
2825000	2826000	you describe
2826000	2827000	things to be
2827000	2828000	precise
2828000	2829000	like this
2829000	2830000	is not
2830000	2831000	acceptable
2831000	2832000	like this
2832000	2833000	is not
2833000	2834000	acceptable
2834000	2835000	for
2835000	2836000	this
2836000	2837000	setting
2837000	2838000	you may
2838000	2839000	standard
2839000	2840000	Latex may
2840000	2841000	be less used
2841000	2843000	because most of the
2843000	2844000	blocks may still
2844000	2846000	Matloft
2846000	2847000	paste well
2847000	2848000	output into
2848000	2849000	EPS
2849000	2850000	and then add
2850000	2851000	in
2851000	2852000	that
2852000	2853000	TIKZ
2853000	2854000	this
2854000	2855000	reading kit
2855000	2856000	it is
2856000	2857000	such
2857000	2858000	a process
2858000	2859000	it
2859000	2860000	is called
2860000	2861000	a begin
2861000	2862000	and then
2862000	2863000	TIKZ
2863000	2864000	this
2864000	2865000	way is
2865000	2866000	it draws a
2866000	2867000	point it
2867000	2868000	designated
2868000	2869000	coordinates
2869000	2870000	such as
2870000	2871000	the
2871000	2872000	seventh line of
2872000	2873000	this instruction
2873000	2874000	means that
2874000	2875000	I start
2875000	2876000	at the
2876000	2877000	coordinates
2877000	2878000	negative
2878000	2879000	0.50
2879000	2880000	has been drawn
2880000	2881000	to 0.50
2881000	2882000	so I
2882000	2883000	have drawn
2883000	2884000	this line
2884000	2885000	and then
2885000	2886000	this bar
2886000	2887000	arrow
2887000	2888000	means that
2888000	2889000	I want to draw
2889000	2890000	a line
2890000	2891000	and then the
2891000	2892000	arrow is
2892000	2893000	the second
2893000	2894000	this instruction
2894000	2895000	means that
2895000	2896000	I'm at
2896000	2897000	1.50
2897000	2898000	this coordinate
2898000	2899000	I want to put
2899000	2900000	a node
2900000	2901000	and then the
2901000	2902000	node content is
2902000	2903000	X
2903000	2904000	so I have
2904000	2905000	a X
2905000	2906000	here
2906000	2907000	and then
2907000	2908000	this node
2908000	2909000	is to
2909000	2910000	the right
2910000	2911000	of this
2911000	2912000	coordinate
2912000	2913000	node
2913000	2914000	is to
2914000	2915000	put a
2915000	2916000	text
2916000	2917000	instruction
2917000	2918000	and then
2918000	2919000	the middle
2919000	2920000	number can
2920000	2921000	specify that
2921000	2922000	I want to ask
2922000	2923000	your arrow
2923000	2924000	symbol is
2924000	2925000	which line
2925000	2926000	is the first line
2926000	2927000	of the middle number
2927000	2928000	right
2928000	2929000	so your arrow
2929000	2930000	is this
2930000	2931000	is drawn
2931000	2932000	is
2932000	2933000	a
2933000	2934000	so
2934000	2935000	the seventh line
2935000	2936000	is only to draw
2936000	2937000	arrow
2937000	2938000	that the eighth line
2938000	2939000	is to draw
2939000	2940000	X
2940000	2941000	that
2941000	2942000	nine and ten
2942000	2943000	this line
2943000	2944000	is that it can
2944000	2945000	combine the
2945000	2946000	instruction
2946000	2947000	I can draw
2947000	2948000	arrow
2948000	2949000	while drawing
2949000	2950000	text
2950000	2951000	this means that
2951000	2952000	from 0.5 to
2952000	2953000	0.5
2953000	2954000	draw a
2954000	2955000	arrow
2955000	2956000	after
2956000	2957000	I put a
2957000	2958000	node
2958000	2959000	and this node
2959000	2960000	is in
2960000	2961000	this
2961000	2962000	0.5
2962000	2963000	above
2963000	2964000	I want to draw
2964000	2965000	a Y
2965000	2966000	right
2966000	2967000	so I can draw
2967000	2968000	X axis
2968000	2969000	and Y axis
2969000	2970000	and then
2970000	2971000	some other
2971000	2972000	people like to say
2972000	2973000	I can draw
2973000	2974000	a rectangle
2974000	2975000	rectangle
2975000	2976000	is to say
2976000	2977000	I specify
2977000	2978000	four
2978000	2979000	four points
2979000	2980000	I draw
2980000	2981000	from this
2981000	2982000	negative one
2982000	2983000	negative one
2983000	2984000	this point
2984000	2985000	to positive one
2985000	2986000	this is
2986000	2987000	two relative
2987000	2988000	points and then
2988000	2989000	I want to draw a
2989000	2990000	rectangle
2990000	2991000	and then this

2995000	2996000	0.0 is the
2996000	2997000	circle
2997000	2998000	and then the
2998000	2999000	radius is
2999000	3000000	one
3000000	3001000	and then
3001000	3002000	green means
3002000	3003000	that I want to
3003000	3004000	draw it

3025000	3026000	points
3026000	3027000	that
3027000	3028000	point
3028000	3029000	here
3029000	3030000	I use
3030000	3031000	a cartoon to

3038000	3039000	so I
3039000	3040000	use
3040000	3041000	degree to
3041000	3042000	represent
3042000	3043000	and then the
3043000	3044000	second point
3044000	3045000	is the
3045000	3046000	radius
3046000	3047000	so I
3047000	3048000	equal to
3048000	3049000	90
3049000	3050000	equal to
3050000	3051000	this point
3051000	3052000	start
3052000	3053000	and then draw

3054000	3055000	to the
3055000	3056000	angle is
3056000	3057000	210
3057000	3058000	and then draw
3058000	3059000	the angle
3059000	3060000	is 330
3060000	3061000	and then this
3061000	3062000	cycle is
3062000	3063000	back to
3063000	3064000	the original
3064000	3065000	point
3065000	3066000	so I have
3066000	3067000	to mention
3067000	3068000	here is that
3068000	3069000	you use this
3069000	3070000	set of tools
3070000	3071000	you can be very
3071000	3072000	precise to draw
3072000	3073000	the picture
3073000	3074000	you want
3074000	3075000	because of
3075000	3076000	these numbers
3076000	3077000	you can see
3077000	3078000	it is
3078000	3079000	this circle
3079000	3080000	it with this
3080000	3081000	square is
3081000	3082000	cut
3082000	3083000	you can imagine
3083000	3084000	if you draw
3084000	3085000	this picture
3085000	3086000	with PowerPoint
3086000	3087000	you can draw
3087000	3088000	that square
3088000	3089000	and circle
3089000	3090000	cut
3090000	3091000	may be
3091000	3092000	you need to adjust
3092000	3093000	quite a long
3093000	3094000	should be able to draw
3094000	3095000	but to adjust
3095000	3096000	quite a long
3096000	3097000	because you specify
3097000	3098000	this axis
3098000	3099000	you can also
3099000	3100000	ensure that
3100000	3101000	this triangle
3101000	3102000	is the inner
3102000	3103000	circle
3103000	3104000	and you can be sure
3104000	3105000	that this point
3105000	3106000	on the circle
3106000	3107000	so
3107000	3108000	simply put
3108000	3109000	I want to say
3109000	3110000	that you use
3110000	3111000	this set of
3111000	3112000	TIKZ
3112000	3113000	is very
3113000	3114000	precise drawing
3114000	3115000	you can draw
3115000	3116000	the picture
3116000	3117000	very precisely
3117000	3118000	so
3118000	3119000	this comparison
3119000	3120000	I skip
3120000	3121000	because of
3121000	3122000	time
3122000	3123000	so
3123000	3124000	next I will
3124000	3125000	introduce
3125000	3126000	called
3126000	3127000	PGF
3127000	3128000	PLOT
3128000	3129000	it is actually
3129000	3130000	based on
3130000	3131000	TIKZ
3131000	3132000	a set of
3132000	3133000	drawing
3133000	3134000	package
3134000	3135000	yes
3135000	3136000	it is
3136000	3137000	mainly
3137000	3138000	it can draw
3138000	3139000	like this
3139000	3140000	picture
3140000	3141000	and it
3141000	3142000	has a very good
3142000	3143000	compatibility
3143000	3144000	with
3144000	3145000	LaTeX
3145000	3146000	and
3146000	3147000	it
3147000	3148000	is also
3148000	3149000	I thought
3149000	3150000	it
3150000	3151000	because it is
3151000	3152000	text
3152000	3153000	so you can
3153000	3154000	simply say
3154000	3155000	you draw a picture
3155000	3156000	you can
3156000	3157000	ensure that
3158000	3159000	I changed the picture
3159000	3160000	where
3160000	3161000	this may
3161000	3162000	use
3162000	3163000	Office
3163000	3164000	autofocus may be
3164000	3165000	quite difficult
3165000	3166000	because
3166000	3167000	like you
3167000	3168000	to adjust the position
3168000	3170000	you just adjust a pixel
3170000	3171000	you may be in
3171000	3172000	Word
3172000	3173000	is more difficult to see
3173000	3174000	the change
3174000	3175000	but if you use
3175000	3176000	the text
3176000	3177000	you use this
3177000	3178000	TIKZ
3178000	3179000	to track the
3179000	3180000	words you can
3180000	3181000	see the
3181000	3182000	change in
3183000	3184000	this
3184000	3185000	because of time
3185000	3186000	so I'll show you
3186000	3187000	a simple
3187000	3188000	example
3188000	3189000	is good
3189000	3190000	this is also my
3190000	3191000	experience
3191000	3192000	here
3192000	3193000	if you want to
3193000	3194000	draw a picture
3194000	3195000	and paste it
3195000	3196000	into the paper
3196000	3197000	usually
3197000	3198000	the workflow is
3198000	3199000	I first use
3199000	3200000	Meta
3200000	3201000	or Python
3201000	3202000	or
3202000	3203000	suppose to
3203000	3204000	write a
3204000	3205000	script
3205000	3206000	after writing it
3206000	3207000	out of the
3207000	3208000	corresponding
3208000	3209000	picture
3209000	3210000	and then save it
3210000	3211000	as a
3211000	3212000	.
3212000	3213000	After saving the
3213000	3214000	picture file
3214000	3215000	you put the
3215000	3216000	picture file
3216000	3217000	into the
3217000	3218000	file
3218000	3219000	so it's
3219000	3220000	like this
3220000	3221000	this picture
3221000	3222000	actually has
3222000	3223000	some problems
3223000	3224000	if you are
3224000	3225000	large enough
3225000	3226000	it has some
3226000	3227000	problems
3227000	3228000	the first
3228000	3229000	problem is
3229000	3230000	that these
3230000	3231000	words are too
3231000	3232000	small
3232000	3233000	but the
3233000	3234000	size of the
3234000	3235000	words
3235000	3236000	depends on
3236000	3237000	the ratio of
3237000	3238000	your picture
3238000	3239000	if you put
3239000	3240000	the picture
3240000	3241000	into the
3241000	3242000	picture file
3242000	3243000	some words
3243000	3244000	look fine
3244000	3245000	but if you
3245000	3246000	put it
3246000	3247000	too large
3247000	3248000	the words
3248000	3249000	look too
3249000	3250000	small
3250000	3251000	so it's
3251000	3252000	not easy
3252000	3253000	to read
3253000	3254000	this also
3254000	3255000	tells us that
3255000	3256000	the size of the
3256000	3257000	words
3257000	3258000	is related
3258000	3259000	to the
3259000	3260000	file
3260000	3261000	so
3261000	3262000	controlling
3262000	3263000	the
3263000	3264000	size of
3264000	3265000	the
3265000	3266000	words
3266000	3267000	should be
3267000	3268000	handled
3268000	3269000	in
3269000	3270000	a
3270000	3271000	systematic
3271000	3272000	way
3272000	3273000	the second
3273000	3274000	problem is
3274000	3275000	that
3275000	3276000	for some people
3276000	3277000	it's
3277000	3278000	too
3278000	3279000	systematic
3279000	3280000	so
3280000	3281000	it should
3281000	3282000	be handled
3282000	3283000	in a
3283000	3284000	systematic way
3284000	3285000	because it
3285000	3286000	depends on
3286000	3287000	the
3287000	3288000	ratio of
3288000	3289000	the
3289000	3290000	word
3290000	3291000	and
3291000	3292000	the
3292000	3293000	ratio
3293000	3294000	of
3294000	3295000	the
3295000	3296000	picture
3296000	3297000	and
3297000	3298000	the
3298000	3299000	word
3299000	3300000	so
3300000	3301000	if you
3301000	3302000	use
3302000	3303000	the
3303000	3304000	original
3304000	3305000	workflow
3305000	3306000	you
3306000	3307000	have to
3307000	3308000	manually
3308000	3309000	input
3309000	3310000	the
3310000	3311000	word
3311000	3312000	and
3312000	3313000	manually
3313000	3314000	input
3314000	3315000	the
3315000	3316000	word
3316000	3317000	and
3317000	3318000	manually
3318000	3319000	input
3319000	3320000	the
3320000	3321000	word
3321000	3322000	and
3322000	3323000	manually
3323000	3324000	input
3324000	3325000	the
3325000	3326000	word
3326000	3327000	and
3327000	3328000	manually
3328000	3329000	input
3329000	3330000	the
3330000	3331000	word
3331000	3332000	and
3332000	3333000	manually
3333000	3334000	input
3334000	3335000	the
3335000	3336000	word
3336000	3337000	and
3337000	3338000	manually
3338000	3339000	input
3339000	3340000	the
3340000	3341000	word
3341000	3342000	and
3342000	3343000	finally
3343000	3344000	your
3344000	3345000	application
3345000	3346000	file
3346000	3347000	and
3347000	3348000	you
3348000	3349000	need to
3349000	3350000	decipher
3350000	3351000	that
3351000	3352000	word
3352000	3353000	and
3353000	3354000	eventually
3354000	3355000	you
3355000	3356000	need to
3356000	3357520	decipher
3357520	3359000	that
3359000	3360000	word
3360000	3361000	and
3361000	3362000	eventually
3362000	3363000	you need to
3363000	3364000	decipher
3364000	3365000	the
3365000	3366000	word
3366000	3367000	and
3367000	3368000	encode
3368000	3369000	that
3369000	3370000	word
3370000	3371000	and
3371000	3372000	use
3372000	3373000	decrease
3373000	3374000	the
3374000	3375000	word
3375000	3376000	and
3376000	3377000	字
3377000	3384840	ok
3384840	3386840	you need to adjust the size of the image
3386840	3388840	and the font
3388840	3390840	of course you need to adjust the
3390840	3391840	initialization of the line
3391840	3392840	this is
3392840	3393840	you need to make relative adjustments
3393840	3395840	according to your file
3395840	3396840	ok
3396840	3397840	this
3397840	3399840	I personally recommend this workflow
3399840	3402840	because when you want to run another image
3402840	3404840	you just need to change the raw data
3404840	3405840	you run it again
3405840	3407840	you don't need to change the image
3407840	3408840	you just need to change the raw data
3408840	3410840	so this data will
3410840	3412840	be like running another image
3412840	3414840	you don't need to worry about the size of the word
3414840	3416840	or the group of the equation
3416840	3418840	or anything else
3418840	3419840	ok
3419840	3420840	this is my recommended workflow
3420840	3423840	so this is my personal experience
3423840	3427840	ok
3427840	3428840	10 minutes left
3428840	3429840	ok
3429840	3430840	I don't have much left
3430840	3431840	ok
3431840	3432840	for binger
3432840	3433840	ok
3433840	3434840	I will talk about binger
3434840	3435840	binger
3435840	3436840	is actually
3436840	3437840	based on LaTeX
3437840	3440840	it is a system that can be used for projection
3440840	3441840	like this image
3441840	3443840	is made by binger
3443840	3445840	binger
3445840	3446840	I personally think the advantage is that
3446840	3447840	it has some
3447840	3450840	pre-defined themes and colors
3450840	3452840	and these themes and colors
3452840	3454840	are very suitable for academic reports
3454840	3456840	academic speeches
3456840	3458840	and
3458840	3459840	these files
3459840	3461840	are all PDF files
3461840	3463840	so compatibility is not a problem
3463840	3465840	and of course it also has some other advantages
3465840	3466840	and these advantages are mainly
3466840	3469840	overlap with LaTeX and TRKG
3470840	3472840	ok, next I want to show you
3472840	3474840	an example
3474840	3476840	let me show you this image
3477840	3479840	like this
3496840	3498840	let me play it again
3498840	3499840	ok
3505840	3507840	I may choose the wrong window
3507840	3510840	because I seem to have two windows
3510840	3511840	this one?
3511840	3512840	this one?
3512840	3513840	yes
3517840	3519840	oh, this one, I know this one
3519840	3520840	oh, this one, yes
3520840	3522840	this is
3522840	3523840	binger
3523840	3525840	has built-in format
3525840	3527840	and
3527840	3529840	there are different names
3529840	3530840	such as
3530840	3531840	Ann Arbor
3531840	3532840	or something
3532840	3534840	there are a lot of names
3535840	3536840	this means that
3536840	3537840	if you go to the projection
3537840	3539840	to configure its
3539840	3540840	shape
3540840	3541840	so you can see that
3541840	3543840	some projection
3543840	3545840	it will have some
3545840	3547840	footnotes
3547840	3549840	and
3549840	3550840	some footnotes
3550840	3552840	may be on the left and right
3552840	3553840	so it can choose
3553840	3555840	binger's theme
3555840	3556840	and this theme
3556840	3558840	will control the configuration of the projection
3558840	3559840	after choosing the theme
3559840	3560840	you can choose
3560840	3561840	binger's color
3561840	3563840	what kind of color I want to use
3563840	3564840	like this
3564840	3566840	like this may be
3566840	3568840	red
3568840	3569840	red
3569840	3570840	and maybe
3570840	3572840	some are yellow
3572840	3574840	some are gray
3574840	3575840	and so on
3575840	3577840	so
3577840	3579840	binger has
3579840	3581840	a lot of choices
3581840	3582840	to do
3586840	3587840	ok
3587840	3588840	this is
3588840	3589840	to show you
3589840	3590840	binger has some
3590840	3592840	themes and colors
3592840	3593840	ok
3593840	3595840	if you want to use binger
3595840	3596840	to make a projection
3596840	3597840	actually
3597840	3598840	this page
3598840	3600840	the corresponding code is very simple
3600840	3601840	these lines
3601840	3603840	if you want to produce a binger code
3603840	3604840	you just
3604840	3606840	produce a binger slide
3606840	3607840	you just use
3607840	3608840	begin friend
3608840	3609840	end friend
3609840	3610840	to deal with it
3610840	3611840	and put a
3611840	3612840	big quotation mark
3612840	3614840	put the binger you want to put in the middle
3614840	3616840	put the title you want to put in the middle
3616840	3617840	and in the middle
3617840	3618840	you just need to focus on
3618840	3620840	what your content is
3620840	3621840	so like my front page
3621840	3622840	I mainly put this
3622840	3623840	prince
3623840	3624840	put a prince
3624840	3625840	like this
3625840	3626840	so
3626840	3627840	like this
3627840	3628840	uh
3628840	3629840	uh
3629840	3630840	like this header
3630840	3631840	or that
3631840	3632840	footer
3632840	3633840	I don't have to worry
3633840	3634840	binger will automatically
3634840	3637840	fill these in for you
3637840	3638840	and
3638840	3639840	this information
3639840	3640840	is actually
3640840	3641840	a professional projection
3641840	3642840	because the audience
3642840	3643840	must know
3643840	3644840	who you are
3644840	3645840	what page you are in
3645840	3647840	what is the topic you want to report
3647840	3648840	ok
3648840	3650840	then I will skip it quickly
3650840	3651840	then
3651840	3652840	here are some details of binger
3652840	3653840	it has some built-in
3653840	3654840	like a block
3654840	3655840	you can choose
3655840	3656840	and you can also make
3656840	3658840	many different columns
3658840	3659840	because of the time factor
3659840	3660840	I skipped
3660840	3662840	binger can do the same
3662840	3663840	is to
3663840	3664840	change pages
3664840	3665840	some effects
3665840	3666840	like this
3666840	3667840	same
3667840	3668840	same video
3668840	3669840	I can control
3669840	3670840	in the first page
3670840	3671840	I want to appear
3671840	3672840	some words
3672840	3673840	in the second page
3673840	3674840	appear other words
3674840	3675840	third
3675840	3676840	then in another page
3676840	3677840	appear other words
3677840	3678840	like this
3678840	3679840	that means
3679840	3680840	in the first page
3680840	3681840	to the last page
3681840	3682840	I have to appear
3682840	3683840	this
3683840	3684840	on-site 1 to end
3684840	3685840	this line
3685840	3686840	and then
3686840	3687840	I jump to the next page
3687840	3688840	this is the result of the second page
3688840	3689840	the second page
3689840	3690840	it will appear
3690840	3691840	on-site 2
3691840	3692840	then
3692840	3693840	at the same time
3693840	3694840	on-site 2 and 3
3694840	3695840	right
3695840	3696840	that
3696840	3697840	if I jump to the next page
3697840	3698840	when the third page
3698840	3699840	it should
3699840	3700840	appear
3700840	3701840	this
3701840	3702840	because
3702840	3703840	I have to appear
3703840	3704840	on-site 1 to the last page
3704840	3705840	then
3705840	3706840	this page
3706840	3707840	middle
3707840	3708840	this should disappear
3708840	3709840	so it will become
3709840	3710840	this
3710840	3711840	right
3711840	3712840	binger
3712840	3713840	it can also do
3713840	3714840	some
3714840	3715840	here
3715840	3716840	is
3716840	3717840	it used
3717840	3718840	many different
3718840	3719840	videos
3719840	3720840	to do
3720840	3721840	similar animation
3721840	3722840	effect
3722840	3723840	but
3723840	3724840	animation
3724840	3725840	here
3725840	3726840	is not as good
3726840	3727840	as
3727840	3728840	powerpoint
3728840	3729840	powerpoint
3729840	3730840	can also
3730840	3731840	binger animation
3731840	3732840	is relatively
3732840	3733840	simple
3733840	3734840	I think it is relatively simple
3734840	3735840	but
3735840	3736840	if we want to do
3736840	3737840	academic reports
3737840	3738840	in fact, I think
3738840	3739840	this is a good thing
3739840	3740840	when the mosquitoes
3740840	3741840	jump around
3741840	3742840	in fact, your
3742840	3743840	your readers
3743840	3744840	will be a little
3744840	3745840	confused
3745840	3746840	like this
3746840	3747840	right
3747840	3748840	good
3748840	3749840	that
3749840	3750840	this is mainly
3750840	3751840	I briefly introduce
3751840	3752840	binger
3752840	3753840	that
3753840	3754840	time factor
3754840	3755840	I quickly
3755840	3756840	show some
3756840	3757840	of my own
3757840	3758840	presentation
3758840	3759840	like this
3759840	3760840	this is a
3760840	3761840	poster
3761840	3762840	and this is
3762840	3763840	made with
3763840	3764840	LaTeX
3764840	3765840	and TI-KZ
3765840	3766840	and
3766840	3767840	its original file
3767840	3768840	is actually very large
3768840	3769840	seems to be
3769840	3770840	its width
3770840	3771840	seems to be
3771840	3772840	64 inches
3772840	3773840	and
3773840	3774840	the length
3774840	3775840	seems to be
3775840	3776840	more than 30 inches
3776840	3777840	and
3777840	3778840	because of
3778840	3779840	its
3779840	3780840	so I just
3780840	3781840	output a
3781840	3782840	pdf file
3782840	3783840	that
3783840	3784840	during the
3784840	3785840	production process
3785840	3786840	I directly
3786840	3787840	pdf file
3787840	3788840	it
3788840	3789840	so
3789840	3790840	the resolution
3790840	3791840	is very
3791840	3792840	very high
3792840	3793840	so
3793840	3794840	this is actually
3794840	3795840	a poster
3795840	3796840	right
3796840	3797840	that
3797840	3798840	that
3798840	3799840	what kind of
3799840	3800840	restrictions
3800840	3801840	are all
3801840	3802840	drawn with
3802840	3803840	TI-KZ
3803840	3804840	very
3804840	3805840	spectacular
3805840	3806840	very spectacular
3806840	3807840	right
3807840	3808840	that
3808840	3809840	can be drawn
3809840	3810840	right
3810840	3811840	so
3811840	3812840	so
3812840	3813840	some people say
3813840	3814840	LaTeX
3814840	3815840	is very
3815840	3816840	plain
3816840	3817840	it is
3817840	3818840	very
3818840	3819840	simple
3819840	3820840	right
3820840	3821840	right
3821840	3822840	so
3822840	3823840	the application
3823840	3824840	is very
3824840	3825840	simple
3825840	3826840	it is

4199480	4200480	現在就我們三個人
4200480	4201480	因為現在就我們三個人
4201480	4202480	那現在就我們三個人
4202480	4203480	那這樣子
4203480	4204480	Oscar你有什麼問題嗎
4204480	4205480	Oscar你有什麼問題嗎
4205480	4206480	有
4206480	4207480	就是那個
4207480	4208480	就是那個
4208480	4209480	就是那個
4209480	4210480	就是
4210480	4211480	就是
4211480	4212480	就是
4212480	4213480	就是
4213480	4214480	就是
4214480	4215480	就是
4215480	4216480	就是
4216480	4217480	就是
4217480	4218480	就是
4218480	4219480	就是
4219480	4220480	所以我想我
4220480	4221480	所以我想我的問題是
4221480	4222480	所以我想我的問題是
4222480	4223400	就是
4223400	4224400	就是
4224400	4225400	那麼花多久的時間
4225400	4226400	譬如假設你要做出
4226400	4228400	你今天這個style就好了
4228400	4231400	大概花了多久的時間
4231400	4232800	製作出這個東西
4232800	4234800	或者說你的learning curve是多陡
4237080	4238600	好
4238600	4239720	我誠實回答
4239720	4240600	我誠實回答
4240600	4241880	就這一整期的影片
4241880	4242880	就這一整期的影片
4242880	4244240	我大概
4244240	4246240	厲害
4246240	4248240	認真做
4248240	4249400	因為我之前
4249400	4251360	就有什麼慢些少增多增
4251360	4252480	那認真的做只是
4252480	4253480	人生畢業
4253480	4255480	那我大概花了三到四天吧
4255480	4256480	對
4256480	4258480	那當然有一些投影片是那種
4258480	4260480	像這一頁投影片我是
4260480	4262480	我是就直接做
4262480	4264480	所以我就是那個code
4264480	4266480	直接複製過來這樣
4266480	4268480	然後對
4268480	4270480	有一些是現成的
4270480	4272480	那
4272480	4274480	多陡的話我覺得
4276480	4278480	我可以跟你分享一下我的經驗
4278480	4280480	就是我
4280480	4282480	第一次用Latex的話
4282480	4284480	大概是
4284480	4286480	我十二年前
4286480	4288480	我第一次用Latex
4288480	4290480	那
4290480	4292480	當時是好像有
4292480	4294480	有一個作業要
4294480	4296480	打那個就是解答吧
4296480	4298480	打Solution
4298480	4300480	然後他就是請我們用Latex
4300480	4302480	來打這樣
4302480	4304480	那當時我算是第一次
4304480	4306480	接觸Latex然後當時我會的功能
4306480	4308480	就是把字打出來
4308480	4310480	把方程式打出來
4310480	4312480	大概就這樣
4312480	4314480	然後連
4314480	4316480	可能還有基本的reference
4316480	4318480	就是說
4318480	4320480	方程式1
4320480	4322480	文件裡面引用方程式1
4322480	4324480	方程式1這樣
4324480	4326480	那插入圖片其實那個時候還不太會
4326480	4328480	所以我大概十二年前
4328480	4330480	大概就是文字打出來的程度
4330480	4332480	大概我想一下
4332480	4334480	大概我
4334480	4336480	我八年前就是
4336480	4338480	我有一群朋友就說我們就是有分組報告
4338480	4340480	就說大家
4340480	4342480	幾個朋友就說那我們都
4342480	4344480	要不要都用Latex來打這樣
4344480	4346480	當時就是強迫自己
4346480	4348480	因為有通財壓力
4348480	4350480	所以就是
4350480	4352480	某一門課的所有報告
4352480	4354480	都用Latex打
4354480	4356480	那當時我自己的經驗就是
4356480	4358480	可以把文字打出來
4358480	4360480	可以把方程式打出來
4360480	4362480	那還會插入一些圖這樣
4362480	4364480	那可是圖還是
4364480	4366480	簡單的就是
4366480	4368480	當時還是用PNG的圖
4368480	4370480	對然後就是插入圖
4370480	4372480	OK那之後就是我上
4372480	4374480	授班之後呢
4374480	4376480	我就想說
4376480	4378480	聽說這個東西對
4378480	4380480	寫Paper很有用那是不是要認真
4380480	4382480	學一下這樣
4382480	4384480	我當時授班的時候就是我假設
4384480	4386480	如果有書面報告就會
4386480	4388480	盡量就是
4388480	4390480	把它整理成用Latex
4390480	4392480	把它整理成一份文件
4392480	4394480	然後
4394480	4396480	把一些圖片啊或者是
4396480	4398480	重要的方程式推導過程
4398480	4400480	把它打成一份Latex文件
4400480	4402480	然後
4402480	4404480	在那個之後我才
4404480	4406480	還會比較多其他功能就是什麼插入
4406480	4408480	除了插入圖片之外
4408480	4410480	可能還會
4410480	4412480	把圖片做裁剪
4412480	4414480	或者是插入表格表格
4414480	4416480	裡面再插入圖片
4416480	4418480	對就是我覺得
4418480	4420480	Learning curve是
4420480	4422480	根據你手頭上的project
4422480	4424480	去決定的
4424480	4426480	如果你手頭上的project就是只要
4426480	4428480	把字打出來的話那其實
4428480	4430480	沒有到非常的困難
4430480	4432480	你大概只要知道你
4432480	4434480	怎麼把數學方式打出來
4434480	4436480	Latex就會排
4436480	4438480	排出一個還
4438480	4440480	OK的文件給你看這樣
4440480	4442480	那如果你後面要進行更多的調整的話
4442480	4444480	你就必須要去學一些
4446480	4448480	其實我蠻多資訊都是Google來的
4448480	4450480	就是如果你
4450480	4452480	可以把你的問題
4452480	4454480	用英文描述去Google
4454480	4456480	通常會找到答案
4456480	4458480	有時候會有些線
4458480	4460480	你直接複製貼上
4460480	4462480	好我不知道
4462480	4464480	這樣可能回答有點太長
4464480	4466480	反正簡短的回答就是說
4466480	4468480	我花蠻多時間的
4468480	4470480	我博班也是
4470480	4472480	都在處理
4472480	4474480	Latex這些格式
4474480	4476480	做投影片之類的
4476480	4478480	所以花時間
4478480	4480480	然後
4480480	4482480	取決於你手上的project
4482480	4484480	那我個人是覺得做出這些結果
4484480	4486480	還蠻有成就感的
4486480	4488480	對
4488480	4490480	不知道這樣有沒有回答到很多問題
4490480	4492480	對
4492480	4494480	那這樣說好了就是說如果你有想要
4494480	4496480	做出什麼
4496480	4498480	畫面的話
4498480	4500480	你也可以跟我討論這樣
4500480	4502480	對
4502480	4504480	因為有時候是
4504480	4506480	我想要做出某個畫面可是我不知道
4506480	4508480	對你的指令是什麼
4508480	4510480	或是說我不知道要怎麼做出
4510480	4512480	這個
4512480	4514480	舉例來說像我聽到這一頁
4514480	4516480	假設我要做出這個結果
4516480	4518480	PowerPoint可能就很簡單
4518480	4520480	我就是拉三個文字方塊
4520480	4522480	然後字放進去
4522480	4524480	那如果是beamer的話你可能
4524480	4526480	必須要知道下面這些指令這樣
4526480	4528480	可是這種東西就是說
4528480	4530480	你知道之後你以後就記得了
4530480	4532480	然後使用起來就是會
4532480	4534480	就是你看到這個圖
4534480	4536480	你就知道OK
4536480	4538480	所以我就必須要放這些指令才會出現這個結果
4538480	4540480	所以這個有時候也是
4540480	4542480	取決於你的
4542480	4544480	有沒有遇到這個問題
4544480	4546480	然後熟悉度怎麼樣這樣
4546480	4548480	當然就是
4548480	4550480	有任何問題歡迎跟我討論
4550480	4552480	對
4554480	4556480	感謝
4556480	4558480	不客氣不客氣
4558480	4560480	很高興有人可以
4560480	4562480	討論
4562480	4564480	比如說就像大概你的12年前
4566480	4568480	我可以做出一個Document
4568480	4570480	然後裡面有一些方程式
4570480	4572480	插幾個圖就插幾個EPS圖
4572480	4574480	我還沒有辦法像你剛剛講的
4574480	4576480	做出那個
4576480	4578480	就有raw data跟
4578480	4580480	bigger style的那個東西
4580480	4582480	這個我主要是個人使用經驗
4582480	4584480	那
4584480	4586480	我覺得你加EPS
4586480	4588480	有它的方便性
4588480	4590480	因為你的圖就是EPS嘛
4590480	4592480	直接插入
4592480	4594480	你只要稍微調一下它的大小就可以了
4594480	4596480	那這個有它的方便性在
4596480	4598480	我一剛開始也都是這樣做的
4598480	4600480	那
4600480	4602480	就是我
4602480	4604480	有點是
4606480	4608480	做越多事情我會發現就是
4608480	4610480	每個工具都有
4610480	4612480	它的各自一些限制
4612480	4614480	那
4614480	4616480	所以我目前是用這樣的workflow
4616480	4618480	對
4618480	4620480	如果初學者我還是還蠻建議
4620480	4622480	就是直接用EPS把圖放進去
4622480	4624480	這樣方便
4626480	4628480	可是這樣就會被嫌棄說那個
4628480	4630480	像你剛剛講的
4630480	4632480	字太小
4632480	4634480	這件事情我被嫌了大概100遍
4636480	4638480	好這個我也可以稍微
4638480	4640480	做經驗分享
4640480	4642480	我在換這個workflow之前呢
4642480	4644480	我有
4644480	4646480	另外一個就是workflow假設
4646480	4648480	這個是1這是2.0
4648480	4650480	我有一個1.5workflow
4650480	4652480	就是
4652480	4654480	存檔的時候不要直接存EPS
4654480	4656480	你像MATLAB可以存
4656480	4658480	FIG檔
4658480	4660480	我不知道RR可不可以
4660480	4662480	就是某一種文
4662480	4664480	某一種圖檔
4664480	4666480	它是可以再被載入
4666480	4668480	然後再重新調格式的
4672480	4674480	像說如果是MATLAB的話它有一個檔案叫做
4674480	4676480	FIG檔
4676480	4678480	然後這個檔案呢你可以
4678480	4680480	再被MATLAB載入之後
4680480	4682480	它跟MATLAB產生圖是
4682480	4684480	完全一樣的
4684480	4686480	就它會把這些
4686480	4688480	格式啊字啊全部都是
4688480	4690480	儲存起來存到那個FIG檔
4690480	4692480	裡面
4692480	4694480	那所以我的workflow
4694480	4696480	1.5就是
4696480	4698480	除了存PNG
4698480	4700480	EPS之外我還會存一個FIG檔
4700480	4702480	然後
4702480	4704480	1.5的workflow就是說
4704480	4706480	假設字太小我就打開FIG檔
4706480	4708480	調這個字的大小
4708480	4710480	再存成一次EPS
4710480	4712480	對
4712480	4714480	那這個算是
4714480	4716480	workflow 1.5啦
4716480	4718480	那勉強可以啦
4718480	4720480	你就看這個字太小
4720480	4722480	那我就是再開一次再調一次
4722480	4724480	再存一次
4724480	4726480	是可以
4726480	4728480	對
4728480	4730480	如果是R的話
4730480	4732480	可能要再
4732480	4734480	應該是有個相對應的格式它可以存成
4734480	4736480	就是最原始
4736480	4738480	就是可編輯的
4738480	4740480	可能要找一下是哪一個格式
4740480	4742480	對
4742480	4744480	我就要研究一下
4744480	4746480	這個好處就是說
4746480	4748480	你不用你程式不用再重跑啦
4748480	4750480	因為你的圖是
4750480	4752480	就是可編輯的圖已經是
4752480	4754480	存好了
4754480	4756480	對
4758480	4760480	這算是使用經驗
4760480	4762480	那初學者還是
4762480	4764480	EPS我還蠻建議的
4764480	4766480	就是方便而且又是像量圖
4766480	4768480	嗯
4770480	4772480	好
4772480	4774480	那
4774480	4776480	請問還有什麼問題嗎
4778480	4780480	目前好像還好
4780480	4782480	就是總之就是
4782480	4784480	就是多練習嘛
4784480	4786480	對其實就是取決於說
4786480	4788480	你
4788480	4790480	你用data做了多少
4790480	4792480	事情就是
4792480	4794480	當你做越多的報告你就會遇到
4794480	4796480	越多的
4796480	4798480	小地方需要克服這樣
4798480	4800480	對那
4800480	4802480	當你都克服之後你就
4802480	4804480	這東西就會變成是你的這樣
4804480	4806480	那當然你
4806480	4808480	如果想要跟我討論我也
4808480	4810480	非常歡迎我也會把
4810480	4812480	相對應的code
4812480	4814480	就是把一些code給
4814480	4816480	大家看這樣讓大家知道
4816480	4818480	這是怎麼做的
4818480	4820480	對
4822480	4824480	我覺得Latex Community它還蠻
4824480	4826480	都還蠻和善的啦
4826480	4828480	你去Google它都可以找到code
4828480	4830480	那我很多code也都是拼湊的
4830480	4832480	來的
4832480	4834480	對
4836480	4838480	所以我覺得
4838480	4840480	我覺得重點是要
4840480	4842480	要有人一起討論啦如果有人一起討論的話
4842480	4844480	就是可能有大家不同的做法
4844480	4846480	對
4846480	4848480	好謝謝
4848480	4850480	現在大家問題好像都差不多了
4850480	4852480	那我想請問俊霖有特別想要再
4852480	4854480	補充嗎
4854480	4856480	跟大家講一兩句話就是給所有
4856480	4858480	想學Latex的人
4858480	4860480	因為我想之後等你講完這段小節
4860480	4862480	我就把錄影就關了
4862480	4864480	OK
4864480	4866480	好了
4868480	4870480	我覺得Latex還是取決於
4870480	4872480	你的
4872480	4874480	你想要做什麼文件
4874480	4876480	像這張圖
4876480	4878480	如果你只是要很簡單的
4878480	4880480	做個research note的話
4880480	4882480	又無所謂的
4882480	4884480	可是當你的文件
4884480	4886480	複雜度越來越高的時候
4886480	4888480	當你要寫論文寫書的時候
4888480	4890480	Latex我
4890480	4892480	私心推薦啦
4892480	4894480	當然一剛開始學習
4894480	4896480	門檻是比較高的
4896480	4898480	可是如果有相對應的機會去練習
4900480	4902480	嘗試把自己的報告用Latex
4902480	4904480	去做的話
4904480	4906480	我相信大家也都會
4906480	4908480	上升
4908480	4910480	大家都可以發paper
4910480	4912480	好那就這我這集的小節
4912480	4914480	謝謝講者
4914480	4916480	那這樣我就先把錄影就關起來了
