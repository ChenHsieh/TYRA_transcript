WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Yes, Project Terra is an international platform for sharing information.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
We hope that scholars from all over the world can share with us

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
the results of our current research and development,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
and more importantly, what is the trend of development.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
This is not something you can easily find in Taiwan.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Project Terra can also provide people who are doing research

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
with opportunities to exchange and collaborate.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
So we hold a seminar like this every week.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
The speakers are basically all members,

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
and they will share their new ideas and research trends.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
Project Terra is a self-releasing organization

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
that is dedicated to public service.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
We have no intention of making any profit.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
All of our members are very enthusiastic doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
You can see our website.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
you can take a look at our website.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
and would like to keep in touch with us,

01:38.000 --> 01:48.000
you can join our membership.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
If you can find other people to work with,

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
we will be happy to help you.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
If you have any questions,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
you can ask us directly.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We are usually very free to talk.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Sure, no problem.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I would like to remind you that

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
when we have more and more listeners,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
we will set the volume to silent.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
So if you remember to click on the microphone icon

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
before speaking,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
you can ask questions or

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
if you have any questions,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
you can directly talk to the speaker, Beta.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay, Beta, let's get started.

03:09.000 --> 03:23.000
For some reason, I can't share the screen.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Let me re-join.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay, thank you, Ted.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
My name is Chengxinda.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
My Chinese name is Ergongcheng.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
My surname is Daoda.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Today, I would like to thank Ted and Terra

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
for giving me the opportunity to introduce

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
a method we are developing.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
This is a new method.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
The main purpose of this method is to deal with

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
the interaction between light and matter.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
We hope to provide a new way

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
to do this.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The method we propose is called

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Mixed Quantum Classical Electrodynamics.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
In English, it should be called

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Quantum-Fixed Mixed Electrodynamics.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I will introduce to you in detail

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
what kind of method it is.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Okay, let me introduce myself.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
My name is Chengxinda.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
My background is that when I was in Taiwan,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I was studying math and physics in college.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I majored in math and physics.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Later, for some reason,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
when I applied to go to college,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I saw that there was a program called

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Chemical Physics in Columbia.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I thought it was very similar to what I was doing.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
It was also something I was interested in.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
So I applied to this program.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I was very lucky to apply to this program.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I found out that when I came to the United States,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I became a chemical physicist.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I have been used as a chemical physicist from beginning to end.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Because of this reason,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I am now working as a chemical physicist

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
at Penn University.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
To sum up,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I use the theory of physics

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and the computational method developed in physics

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
to study the problem of chemistry.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
My professional field is

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
studying dynamics,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
which is the theory of dynamics

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and the computational method of dynamics.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Specifically,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
my Ph.D. is in Columbia.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I am doing chemical dynamics,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
that is,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
electromagnetic dynamics in a chemical environment.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
My postdoc,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
what I am doing now

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
is a little different from my Ph.D.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I am doing the interaction of light and matter.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Today,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
my talk will focus on

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
my postdoc work.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
OK.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
First of all, what is light?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We often say that light is an object.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Basically,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
light is a very important thing in everyday life.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Light is basically an electromagnetic wave.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Electromagnetic waves

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
are basically the source of all our information.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We see things in this world.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
From the greatest extent,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
how do we know

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
what happens on other planets

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
or on Mars, for example?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We can

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
reflect the light of the sun from Mars

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
and see from the spectrum of sunlight

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
what kind of matter there is on Mars.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
How much of this matter is there?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Then,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
there are more possibilities

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
in the development of modern science.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
These are no longer visible light.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We have different kinds of light

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
from low energy to high energy.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Then, from the low energy range,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
we have NMR

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
to Raman

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
or IR spectrum.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
These things are

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
lower than visible light.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Within the range of higher than visible light,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
there is UV,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
which is ultraviolet,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
and

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
X-ray spectroscopy, which is more powerful.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Basically, our feature is that

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
basically,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
this

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
spectroscopy

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
shows that

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
the stronger the energy,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
the deeper we can see.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Just like in the form of X-ray,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
we can see that it can

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
reflect the electrons in the inner layer.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
So you can know what the behavior of the electrons in the inner layer is.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
This is one of the functions

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
of light and matter interaction.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
In recent years,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
because of the development of nanotechnology,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
we can make our devices

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
in a smaller scale.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
So we can even use light,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
the quality of light,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
to manipulate matter,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
to change the nature of matter.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
For example,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
we can put

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
a chemical reaction

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
in a cavity,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and the nature of the chemical reaction

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
may be changed.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Or we can put this chemical reaction

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
on a crystal.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
This chemical reaction may have

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
different behavior.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
There are other

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
different nanostructures,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
nanostructures,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
which can have different

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
effects on light-matter interaction

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
and change the nature of matter.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Another very important example

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
is that in recent years,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
there is a very popular

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
study

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
on how we use

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
light-matter interaction

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
to change,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
for example,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
this paper

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
is a paper

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
about

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
the conductivity

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
of organic semiconductors.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
They put a very thin

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
membrane structure,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
and there is a circle

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
above it,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
and attach it

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
to the organic semiconductor.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It can change

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
the conductivity of the semiconductor.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It can change it

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
from a bad conductor

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
to a better conductor.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
But these

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
modern developments

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
all use the nature of light-matter.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
When we need

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
to understand the nature of light-matter,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
we need to discuss

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
what is light

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
and what is the difference

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
between classical light and light-matter.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
The classical light

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
is in the left panel.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
We regard classical light as an electromagnetic wave,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
and the development

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
of the electromagnetic wave

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
is based on

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
the Maxwell's equation,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
which is

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
the Maxwell's equation.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
This is a Maxwell's equation

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
without a source.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
This is a

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
propagate,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
a electromagnetic wave moving forward

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
without any source.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
This is the classical view

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
of light.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
In quantum mechanics,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
we regard light as a group

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
of energy.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Its energy

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
is discretized.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
You may have heard of

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
the Uncertainty Principle,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
which is

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
the Uncertainty Principle.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The Uncertainty Principle

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
in light

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
corresponds to

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the distribution of energy.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The energy may not be

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
only one energy,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
but a distribution of probability.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
How does quantum mechanics

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
evolve light?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It is based on the Heisenberg equation.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
It is based on the Heisenberg equation.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
The H is an operator

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
in quantum mechanics.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
The H is an operator

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
in quantum mechanics.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
The H is an operator.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
H represents the energy.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
This basically

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
describes how light

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
evolves

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
in a space.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
What is the difference

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
between classical

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
and quantum mechanics?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's look at

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
the matter.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We can see

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
the difference between

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
classical and quantum.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Classical matter

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
is a particle

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
or many particles.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Many particles

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
follow

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Newton's law

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
in quantum mechanics.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
We all know

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
classical mechanics.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
A particle has a certain speed

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
and this speed changes over time.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
In quantum mechanics,

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
the energy

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
is considered

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
continuous.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
the energy

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
is considered continuous.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
In quantum mechanics,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
the energy

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
doesn't

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
use proofs

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
to describe matter,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
instead we use function

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
named wave function.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
In uncertainty principle

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
it is a

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
distribution

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
frame of reference

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
for environment

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
and momentum.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Uncertainty principle

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
is not a satisfied

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
you can

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
you can

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
you can write down its

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
spatial distribution and

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
momentum distribution

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
of a wave function.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
This wave function

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
follows the following thing called

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Schrodinger equation

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Schrodinger equation

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
is written like this.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Since we

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
now know these

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
physical

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
classical and quantum

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and quantum of light.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
When we want to describe

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
the reaction of modern light

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and the interaction of light and matter

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
our ideal state

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
is to use quantum light

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
and quantum matter.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
When I have quantum light and quantum matter

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
together

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
we can

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
this is a set of

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
quantum electric mechanics

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
called QED.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
In this QED

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
we can

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
put the whole

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
matter and light

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
in the same wave function

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
they will have a combined

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Hamiltonian

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and they can

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
evolve together.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
This can include

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
all interactions

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
in quantum mechanics.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
But this is a very large

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
calculation.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It is very difficult

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
to do a real calculation

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
except for some basic

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
model problems.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
One of the reasons is

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
this total wave function

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
contains a lot of

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
degrees of freedom

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
a lot of variables.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This thing

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
may be in a real situation

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
for example

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
I take a real nanoparticle

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
or a real

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
particle structure

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
this thing

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
can't be done.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So we have

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
a compromise

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
approach.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
We develop a set

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
called Mixed Quantum Classical

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
which is a combination of

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
classical quantum mechanics.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
In this we

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
put light as classical

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
as classical

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and matter as matter.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Therefore

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
we don't need to

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
evolve the light

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
we just need to know

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
what is the

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
behavior of matter.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
We put light's behavior

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
as a time-dependent perturbation

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
as a

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
driving force

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
as if

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
something is pushing

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
matter

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
into evolution.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
This is a more

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
practical approach.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
But it has some problems.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
As I said

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
it is OK for some problems.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
This is not

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
our first approach.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Many people have done this.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But it has some problems.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
The first problem is

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
it doesn't have feedback.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Feedback means

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
we treat the light

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
as bending

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
The system

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
doesn't throw

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
any energy

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
or feedback

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
into the light.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
So

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
if you

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
take the whole system

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
and put light and matter

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
together

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
you will find that

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
this theory doesn't

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
conform to energy conservation.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
The second problem is

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
it has uncertainty principle.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
In other words

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I should have

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
a standard difference

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
between light and matter.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
In other words

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't have

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
only one point

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
so I should have

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
a wide distribution.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But we have

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
classical light

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
so there is no

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
fluctuation.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Another problem

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
is time dependent perturbation.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It is a linear response.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
It is a linear response.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
It is a linear response.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
It is a linear response.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Basically

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
it is a linear response.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The light pushes

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
the light

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
and it responds.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
But this

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
is a strong coupling.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
If the light is very strong

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
and it can change

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
the quality of light

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
this theory

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
cannot be explained.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
cannot be explained.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
The most serious problem

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
is that it cannot

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
capture a

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
important physical quality

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
called spontaneous emission.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
called spontaneous emission.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I will explain it later.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
These problems

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
make

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
classical method

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
cannot explain

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
quantum mechanics.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
quantum mechanics.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
quantum mechanics.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
quantum mechanics.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
My work

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
is to develop

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
a new

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
mixed quantum classical

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
a new

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
mixed quantum classical

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
a new

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
a new

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
we can

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
recover

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
we can reconstruct

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
spontaneous emission

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
we can

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
enforce

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
influence energy conservation

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
we can

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
we can build habitual light

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
we can build habitual light

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
we can build habitual light

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
how can we do it?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
sorry, I have a question

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
ok, go ahead

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I want to ask

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
because

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
using quantum mechanics is a bit difficult

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
can't do

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
analytical solution

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
to what extent

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
for example, molecular

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
or elemental

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
single element

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
or many body

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
yes, usually

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
many body

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
because many body

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
its scale is exponential n

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
so

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
if you add

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
exponential n

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
your computer can't run

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
so

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
what we can do

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
is

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
take some degree of freedom

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
as classical

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
there are many good classical methods

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
to propagate Maxwell's equation

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
but

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
for example, single molecule

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
can be calculated?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
yes, single molecule can be calculated

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
as a

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
as a

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
chemist

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I want to do something practical

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I see

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
because I do high energy

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I don't know

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I only do one by one

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
two or three more

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
seems difficult

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
what we want to do

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
for example,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
put a molecule

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
into a cavity

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I see

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
ok, thank you

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
I want to ask

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
is this LR

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
same as

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Lindblad equation operator?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
thank you

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
open system

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
which one?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
it's very similar

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I won't write it down

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
but

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
it's very similar to

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Lindblad

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
but it can't be written as

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Lindblad form

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
because it's a non-linear term

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
it's not like Lindblad

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
it's a linear term

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
it's a time-dependent

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
and skewed Lindblad

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
ok

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
keep talking

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'm looking forward to it

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I'll talk about it later

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
ok

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
basically

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
what we want to do

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
because we have a friend who does high energy

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
we have

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
low energy

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
chemical system

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
so we don't consider

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
relative effect

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
ok

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
next

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
let's talk about

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
what is spontaneous emission

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
what is spontaneous emission

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
the quantum theory of spontaneous emission

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
was written by Dirac in 1927

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Dirac

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
of course

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Einstein explained it

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
before Dirac

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
but the paper in 1927

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
he used

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
the first principle

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
to introduce

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
spontaneous emission

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
so

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I see it as

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
a major contribution

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
what is spontaneous emission

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
it's basically

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
a transition

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
from a stimulated state

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
to an excited state

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
simply put

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I have an electron

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
it's in a stimulated state

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
it's in an excited state

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
it emits the same light

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
it's called spontaneous emission

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
the most important thing about it

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
it's in vacuum

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
a quantum system

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
a two-level system

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
a stimulated state and an excited state

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
in vacuum

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
it still emits

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
this thing

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
because

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
in quantum theory

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
we use

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
zero-point energy

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
it's the

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
light in vacuum

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
the lowest energy

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
some theories

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
it's called vacuum fluctuation

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
although it's vacuum

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
it still

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
interacts with

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
the quantum system

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
to emit spontaneous emission

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
why is spontaneous emission

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
so important

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
because fundamentally

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
it's a quantum process

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
in classical theory

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
it's impossible

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
to get spontaneous emission

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
second

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
it's basically

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
spontaneous emission

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
responsible for

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
almost all light

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
we can see

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
it's because of spontaneous emission

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
zero light, flat light

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
visible light

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
it's because of

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
spontaneous emission

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
next

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
it's a

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
quantum electrodynamics

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
after Dirac

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
in 1927

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
after paper

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
a lot of people

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
like Pauli, Wigner

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Eisenberg, Fermi

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Freeman Dyson

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and Feynman

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
started to do

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
QED research

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
what we want to say

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
if we take

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
mixed quantum classical equation

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
to deal with

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
spontaneous emission

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
what will happen

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
here

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I want to explain

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
what is

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
mixed quantum classical

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
first

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
we see

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
you can see my mouse

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
oh yes

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
can you see my mouse

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
yes

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
ok

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
it's a little bit lag

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
if you want to stop

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
slow down

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
ok, no problem

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I will stop here

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
ok, first question

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
we assume a system

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
a two-level system

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
in vacuum

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
this system

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
is completely in

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
spontaneous emission

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
no distribution

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
in

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
mixed quantum classical

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
there is no spontaneous emission

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
which is

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
this line

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
this picture

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
horizontal is time

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
vertical is

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
stimulated

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
stimulated

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
population

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
that

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
red line

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
means no matter

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
how long

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
this system

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
will not emit any light

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
first of all

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
this is wrong

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
qualitatively

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
but we found

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
if

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I am

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
not in

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
spontaneous emission

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I have half

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
0.5, 0.5

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I have half

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
half in

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I found

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
there is a little bit

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
spontaneous emission

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
real spontaneous emission

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
this black line

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
compared

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
there is a gap

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
another

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
this is

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
we tried

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
a method

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
we tried other methods

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
three methods

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
mixed quantum classical

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
called

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
SQC

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
or

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
CPA

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
mixed quantum classical

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
there is a problem

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
the right picture

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
the middle curve

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
the middle curve

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
real spontaneous emission rate

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
red

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
this is

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
the left picture

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
from there

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
emission rate

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
compare with

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
real spontaneous emission

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
rate

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
sometimes

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
almost all

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
ground state

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
very close

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
very close

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
real spontaneous emission rate

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
but

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
getting worse

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
more and more population

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
in

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
spontaneous emission

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
more and more

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
other methods

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
opposite

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
opposite

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
behavior

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
this is the second problem

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
the last problem

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
basically

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
old problem

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
our factory

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
classical factory

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
no fluctuation

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
anything about

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
fluctuation

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
must be wrong

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
next

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
the method

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
plus R

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
we call

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
the average length

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
we use

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
because it is the simplest

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
average length

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
in the average length

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
plus

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
LR

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
LIMBRA

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
what is the plus R

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
it has 3 functions

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
first

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I put

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
extra relaxation

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I put some population

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
from the top

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
to the ground state

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
this additional population

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
we use

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
according to

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to deduce

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
in every time state

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
how much

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
how much relaxation

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
let it

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
with

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
spontaneous emission rate

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
same

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
this is the first thing

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
second

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
because we

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
took some

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
population

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
from the ground state

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
to the ground state

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
where is the energy

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
should be put

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
to the power plant

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
it should be

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
it should be

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
classical

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
it should be

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
part of the power plant

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
or plant

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
to

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
to ensure

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
the whole system

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
energy conservation

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
so we designed a way

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
the energy

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
can be put to the power plant

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
and

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
we designed

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
stochastic

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
defacing

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I put

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I put this system

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
there is a random process

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
it will

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
decide

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
the system phase

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
in every time

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
there is a random process

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
it will decide

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
the system phase

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
this small

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
stochastic defacing

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
introduce

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
classical

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
power plant

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
fluctuation

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I am not running a single trajectory

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I am running many trajectories

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
to balance the trajectory

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
so

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
we will have

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
the power plant

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
there will be fluctuation

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
there will be

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
so

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
we can tell

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
what is

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
what is

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
what is

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
what is

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
what is

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
what is

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
what is

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
what is

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
what is

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
what is

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
what is

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
what is

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
what is

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
what is

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
what is

44:00.840 --> 44:02.840
what is

44:02.840 --> 44:04.840
what is

44:04.840 --> 44:06.840
what is

44:06.840 --> 44:08.840
what is

44:08.840 --> 44:10.840
what is

44:10.840 --> 44:12.840
what is

44:12.840 --> 44:14.840
what is

44:14.840 --> 44:16.840
what is

44:16.840 --> 44:18.840
what is

44:18.840 --> 44:20.840
what is

44:20.840 --> 44:22.840
what is

44:22.840 --> 44:24.840
what is

44:24.840 --> 44:26.840
what is

44:26.840 --> 44:28.840
what is

44:28.840 --> 44:30.840
what is

44:30.840 --> 44:32.840
what is

44:32.840 --> 44:34.840
what is

44:34.840 --> 44:36.840
what is

44:36.840 --> 44:38.840
what is

44:39.840 --> 44:41.840
what is

44:41.840 --> 44:43.840
what is

44:44.840 --> 44:46.840
what is

44:46.840 --> 44:48.840
what is

44:48.840 --> 44:50.840
what is

44:50.840 --> 44:52.840
what is

44:52.840 --> 44:54.840
what is

44:54.840 --> 44:56.840
What is

44:56.840 --> 44:58.840
What is

44:58.840 --> 45:00.840
What is

45:00.840 --> 45:02.840
What is

45:02.840 --> 45:04.840
What is

45:04.840 --> 45:06.840
What is

45:07.840 --> 45:11.840
Okay, so let me recap it again

45:11.840 --> 45:15.840
What did we learn from Raman Scannering?

45:15.840 --> 45:17.840
What we learned is that

45:17.840 --> 45:19.840
Raman Fast++R can actually

45:19.840 --> 45:21.840
allow us to get

45:21.840 --> 45:23.840
multi-state transitions

45:23.840 --> 45:25.840
We can do multi-state transitions

45:25.840 --> 45:27.840
We just need to put the correct

45:27.840 --> 45:29.840
spontaneous emission in

45:29.840 --> 45:31.840
We can get multi-state transitions

45:31.840 --> 45:33.840
And it's still pretty accurate

45:33.840 --> 45:35.840
And

45:35.840 --> 45:37.840
Even if we don't have

45:37.840 --> 45:39.840
a classical frequency

45:39.840 --> 45:41.840
We don't need to put another frequency

45:41.840 --> 45:43.840
to make it vibrate

45:43.840 --> 45:45.840
We can still

45:45.840 --> 45:47.840
We can still get inelastic scattering

45:47.840 --> 45:49.840
with Mixed Chromium Classical

45:49.840 --> 45:51.840
And lastly, let's talk about

45:51.840 --> 45:53.840
Excuse me

45:53.840 --> 45:55.840
Did I interrupt you?

45:55.840 --> 45:57.840
Did I interrupt you?

45:57.840 --> 45:59.840
No, no, no

45:59.840 --> 46:01.840
Oh, okay

46:01.840 --> 46:03.840
I have a question

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
Because it looks like

46:05.840 --> 46:07.840
Raman Fast++R and Quantum

46:07.840 --> 46:09.840
are basically the same

46:09.840 --> 46:11.840
But my question is

46:11.840 --> 46:13.840
For example, if you want to manually

46:13.840 --> 46:15.840
add a relaxation

46:15.840 --> 46:17.840
and a defacing

46:17.840 --> 46:19.840
and a defacing

46:19.840 --> 46:21.840
and a defacing

46:21.840 --> 46:23.840
You basically have three parameters

46:23.840 --> 46:25.840
to add in, right?

46:25.840 --> 46:27.840
How do they get it?

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
Oh, they all

46:29.840 --> 46:31.840
Oh, they all

46:31.840 --> 46:33.840
are based on

46:33.840 --> 46:35.840
Fermi's Golden Rule

46:37.840 --> 46:39.840
All my transitions

46:39.840 --> 46:41.840
are based on Fermi's Golden Rule

46:41.840 --> 46:43.840
Just like in Raman

46:43.840 --> 46:45.840
What I'm doing is

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
I'm using Fermi's Golden Rule

46:47.840 --> 46:49.840
for these two transitions

46:49.840 --> 46:51.840
I'm using Fermi's Golden Rule

46:51.840 --> 46:53.840
to figure out how much I need

46:53.840 --> 46:55.840
to add

46:55.840 --> 46:57.840
These three things

46:57.840 --> 46:59.840
are related to each other

46:59.840 --> 47:01.840
Everything is based on

47:01.840 --> 47:03.840
Fermi's Golden Rule

47:03.840 --> 47:05.840
So if I'm not wrong

47:05.840 --> 47:07.840
If I'm not wrong

47:07.840 --> 47:09.840
You add a resonance

47:09.840 --> 47:11.840
intermediate state in the middle

47:11.840 --> 47:13.840
You add a resonance

47:13.840 --> 47:15.840
intermediate state in the middle

47:15.840 --> 47:17.840
If it's Fermi's Golden Rule

47:17.840 --> 47:19.840
You choose an energy

47:19.840 --> 47:21.840
and all your in and out

47:21.840 --> 47:23.840
will be resonant with that energy

47:23.840 --> 47:25.840
No

47:25.840 --> 47:27.840
But

47:27.840 --> 47:29.840
What I'm doing is

47:29.840 --> 47:31.840
What I'm doing is

47:31.840 --> 47:33.840
I know

47:33.840 --> 47:35.840
For example, I know

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
every transition 2-1

47:37.840 --> 47:39.840
2-1 and 2-0

47:39.840 --> 47:41.840
are based on different Fermi's Golden Rule

47:41.840 --> 47:43.840
Fermi's Golden Rule is a rate

47:43.840 --> 47:45.840
There's a transition rate

47:45.840 --> 47:47.840
There's a transition rate

47:47.840 --> 47:49.840
In my theory

47:49.840 --> 47:51.840
I can deduce

47:51.840 --> 47:53.840
How much is the difference

47:53.840 --> 47:55.840
between Errandfest and Fermi's Golden Rule

47:56.840 --> 47:58.840
Then I'll use those three things

47:58.840 --> 48:00.840
to add up

48:04.840 --> 48:06.840
Let me ask

48:07.840 --> 48:08.840
Sorry

48:08.840 --> 48:11.840
You can move to the next slide

48:11.840 --> 48:13.840
Yes

48:13.840 --> 48:15.840
To the next one

48:15.840 --> 48:17.840
The first one on the right

48:17.840 --> 48:19.840
So

48:19.840 --> 48:20.840
Sorry

48:20.840 --> 48:21.840
To the one before

48:21.840 --> 48:23.840
On the right

48:23.840 --> 48:28.840
So the input frequency

48:28.840 --> 48:30.840
and

48:30.840 --> 48:32.840
in these ranges

48:32.840 --> 48:34.840
Do you need to calculate

48:34.840 --> 48:36.840
how to add up

48:36.840 --> 48:38.840
the other parameters?

48:38.840 --> 48:41.840
Or these are already

48:41.840 --> 48:44.840
The omega i

48:44.840 --> 48:46.840
There are ten

48:46.840 --> 48:48.840
Do you need to add up

48:48.840 --> 48:50.840
the other parameters

48:50.840 --> 48:52.840
ten times?

48:52.840 --> 48:54.840
That might be easy

48:54.840 --> 48:56.840
I don't know

48:56.840 --> 48:58.840
I'm just asking

48:58.840 --> 49:00.840
It's okay

49:00.840 --> 49:02.840
We don't need to

49:02.840 --> 49:04.840
Every trajectory

49:04.840 --> 49:06.840
is the same

49:06.840 --> 49:08.840
Just change one parameter

49:08.840 --> 49:10.840
Just omega i

49:10.840 --> 49:12.840
Yes, I just need to change omega i

49:12.840 --> 49:14.840
I didn't change anything

49:14.840 --> 49:16.840
I didn't change anything

49:16.840 --> 49:18.840
in the calculation

49:18.840 --> 49:20.840
So I don't need to calculate again

49:22.840 --> 49:24.840
Can I ask a question?

49:24.840 --> 49:26.840
You are calculating

49:26.840 --> 49:28.840
Whether it's Rayleigh or Raman

49:28.840 --> 49:30.840
You said you want to use Fermi's Golden Rule

49:30.840 --> 49:32.840
But in general

49:32.840 --> 49:34.840
Your state 2 is a virtual state

49:34.840 --> 49:36.840
So

49:36.840 --> 49:38.840
In reality

49:38.840 --> 49:40.840
You can't get the real coupling constant

49:40.840 --> 49:42.840
So how do you solve this problem?

49:44.840 --> 49:46.840
Can't get the real coupling constant

49:48.840 --> 49:50.840
In practice

49:50.840 --> 49:52.840
You can measure Rayleigh scattering cross-section

49:52.840 --> 49:54.840
Or Raman scattering cross-section

49:56.840 --> 49:58.840
But you can't get

50:00.840 --> 50:02.840
Real state and virtual state

50:02.840 --> 50:04.840
How much is the coupling

50:04.840 --> 50:06.840
Yes

50:08.840 --> 50:10.840
It's like this

50:10.840 --> 50:12.840
I don't have virtual state

50:12.840 --> 50:14.840
and real state coupling

50:14.840 --> 50:16.840
The coupling I use is

50:16.840 --> 50:18.840
Resonant

50:18.840 --> 50:20.840
I should not say resonant

50:20.840 --> 50:22.840
The coupling I use is

50:22.840 --> 50:24.840
Actually 1 and 2 coupling

50:28.840 --> 50:30.840
So

50:30.840 --> 50:32.840
If you look back from the lab

50:34.840 --> 50:36.840
Because my idea is

50:36.840 --> 50:38.840
more from

50:38.840 --> 50:40.840
Initial

50:40.840 --> 50:42.840
The first principle

50:42.840 --> 50:44.840
If I want to calculate

50:44.840 --> 50:46.840
If I want to calculate

50:46.840 --> 50:48.840
The actual molecule

50:48.840 --> 50:50.840
To calculate this

50:50.840 --> 50:52.840
I will use

50:52.840 --> 50:54.840
Electronic Structure

50:54.840 --> 50:56.840
To calculate

50:56.840 --> 50:58.840
The real coupling

50:58.840 --> 51:00.840
This coupling

51:00.840 --> 51:02.840
Not the real coupling

51:02.840 --> 51:04.840
In electronic structure

51:04.840 --> 51:06.840
How big is the coupling

51:06.840 --> 51:08.840
This coupling

51:08.840 --> 51:10.840
This coupling

51:10.840 --> 51:12.840
Can be calculated

51:12.840 --> 51:14.840
Transition dipole moment

51:14.840 --> 51:16.840
1 and 2 state transition dipole moment

51:16.840 --> 51:18.840
The light I hit

51:18.840 --> 51:20.840
Whether there is resonance

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
I use the transition dipole moment

51:26.840 --> 51:28.840
So you mean

51:28.840 --> 51:30.840
You are in the molecule

51:30.840 --> 51:32.840
You all have real state

51:32.840 --> 51:34.840
You use real state transition dipole moment

51:34.840 --> 51:36.840
You sum up all these real states

51:38.840 --> 51:40.840
Yes

51:40.840 --> 51:42.840
Because

51:42.840 --> 51:44.840
In this

51:44.840 --> 51:46.840
I don't have any

51:46.840 --> 51:48.840
virtual state

51:48.840 --> 51:50.840
It's not like

51:50.840 --> 51:52.840
Sum of state

51:52.840 --> 51:54.840
I have a lot of virtual state

51:54.840 --> 51:56.840
Here is real state

51:56.840 --> 51:58.840
Different frequency

51:58.840 --> 52:00.840
Thank you

52:02.840 --> 52:04.840
It is

52:04.840 --> 52:06.840
A bit like a driving system

52:06.840 --> 52:08.840
It is a dynamical system

52:08.840 --> 52:10.840
Hope to answer your question

52:12.840 --> 52:14.840
Any other questions

52:16.840 --> 52:18.840
No, I will continue

52:18.840 --> 52:20.840
Where did I just talk about

52:20.840 --> 52:22.840
In the end, we want to say

52:22.840 --> 52:24.840
In the end, we want to say

52:24.840 --> 52:26.840
The problem we want to deal with

52:26.840 --> 52:28.840
Is a strong problem

52:28.840 --> 52:30.840
What about this strong problem

52:30.840 --> 52:32.840
Model triplet

52:32.840 --> 52:34.840
It is a two-level system

52:34.840 --> 52:36.840
Back to a very simple two-level system

52:36.840 --> 52:38.840
There is a very strong

52:38.840 --> 52:40.840
Classical field

52:42.840 --> 52:44.840
The biggest feature of this model triplet

52:46.840 --> 52:48.840
I think the coolest thing is that it is classical

52:48.840 --> 52:50.840
Classical in quantum now

52:50.840 --> 52:52.840
It's a bit like laser

52:52.840 --> 52:54.840
It is a coherent state

52:54.840 --> 52:56.840
Very close

52:56.840 --> 52:58.840
Classical

52:58.840 --> 53:00.840
Classical electric field

53:00.840 --> 53:02.840
But it emits

53:02.840 --> 53:04.840
The light wave

53:04.840 --> 53:06.840
It is a very

53:06.840 --> 53:08.840
Not classical

53:08.840 --> 53:10.840
Quantum light wave

53:10.840 --> 53:12.840
Why is this

53:12.840 --> 53:14.840
Because of this field

53:14.840 --> 53:16.840
This electric field

53:16.840 --> 53:18.840
Because it is very strong

53:18.840 --> 53:20.840
Basically, it has exceeded

53:20.840 --> 53:22.840
So we can't use it anymore

53:22.840 --> 53:24.840
In quantum theory

53:24.840 --> 53:26.840
It is a bit like

53:26.840 --> 53:28.840
Mixing state

53:28.840 --> 53:30.840
A bit like hybridization

53:30.840 --> 53:32.840
The picture in the lower right corner

53:32.840 --> 53:34.840
In fact, on the left

53:34.840 --> 53:36.840
On the left side of this diagonal

53:36.840 --> 53:38.840
Is the Bayer state

53:38.840 --> 53:40.840
I made

53:42.840 --> 53:44.840
Two-level system

53:44.840 --> 53:46.840
Generate

53:46.840 --> 53:48.840
Sorry

53:48.840 --> 53:50.840
Two-level system and light

53:50.840 --> 53:52.840
The state generated by the frequency

53:52.840 --> 53:54.840
Draw it out

53:54.840 --> 53:56.840
After drawing the hybridization

53:56.840 --> 53:58.840
You will find that the right side

53:58.840 --> 54:00.840
Is the state after hybridization

54:00.840 --> 54:02.840
It's a bit like a mix

54:02.840 --> 54:04.840
It's a bit like a dress state

54:04.840 --> 54:06.840
Hybridization is light

54:06.840 --> 54:08.840
With

54:08.840 --> 54:10.840
Hybridization of two-level system

54:10.840 --> 54:12.840
So its energy level

54:12.840 --> 54:14.840
Will be changed

54:14.840 --> 54:16.840
Then

54:16.840 --> 54:18.840
In the model on the right

54:18.840 --> 54:20.840
It has three different

54:20.840 --> 54:22.840
Launch

54:22.840 --> 54:24.840
Frequency

54:24.840 --> 54:26.840
The first one we call T

54:26.840 --> 54:28.840
Why is it called T?

54:28.840 --> 54:30.840
It's very simple

54:30.840 --> 54:32.840
It's called 3 photons

54:32.840 --> 54:34.840
You can see it from

54:34.840 --> 54:36.840
The highest

54:36.840 --> 54:38.840
After 1, 2, 3

54:38.840 --> 54:40.840
Three times to the lowest

54:40.840 --> 54:42.840
So it's called triple

54:42.840 --> 54:44.840
3 photons

54:44.840 --> 54:46.840
Then F is called fluorescence

54:46.840 --> 54:48.840
Fluorescence is basically the lowest connection

54:48.840 --> 54:50.840
The two closest connections

54:50.840 --> 54:52.840
Between

54:52.840 --> 54:54.840
Launch

54:54.840 --> 54:56.840
Then the other two

54:56.840 --> 54:58.840
It's called Rayleigh

54:58.840 --> 55:00.840
Two Rayleigh

55:00.840 --> 55:02.840
It goes through two photons

55:02.840 --> 55:04.840
It's called Rayleigh

55:04.840 --> 55:06.840
That

55:06.840 --> 55:08.840
This

55:08.840 --> 55:10.840
The quantum theory

55:10.840 --> 55:12.840
Gave us three

55:12.840 --> 55:14.840
Different frequency

55:14.840 --> 55:16.840
It's three different peaks

55:16.840 --> 55:18.840
Then these peaks

55:18.840 --> 55:20.840
It will be produced

55:20.840 --> 55:22.840
It contains the Rabi frequency

55:22.840 --> 55:24.840
This

55:24.840 --> 55:26.840
The gentleman on the left is Rabi

55:26.840 --> 55:28.840
He used to be in Columbia

55:28.840 --> 55:30.840
Very cool

55:30.840 --> 55:32.840
Then

55:32.840 --> 55:34.840
We can also use this

55:34.840 --> 55:36.840
Mixed quantum classical method

55:36.840 --> 55:38.840
Let's try

55:38.840 --> 55:40.840
We found that if we don't put any

55:40.840 --> 55:42.840
If we don't change any plus r

55:42.840 --> 55:44.840
We found that this system

55:44.840 --> 55:46.840
It's basically classical in classical out

55:46.840 --> 55:48.840
It's classical in, it's classical out

55:48.840 --> 55:50.840
There won't be much change

55:50.840 --> 55:52.840
If you're a kid

55:52.840 --> 55:54.840
Or high school

55:54.840 --> 55:56.840
There's a physical phenomenon

55:56.840 --> 55:58.840
You put

55:58.840 --> 56:00.840
A pile of protein

56:00.840 --> 56:02.840
Put in a

56:02.840 --> 56:04.840
Tie a pile of protein

56:04.840 --> 56:06.840
On the same pole

56:06.840 --> 56:08.840
The pole has a fixed frequency

56:08.840 --> 56:10.840
After a long time, they will be synchronized

56:10.840 --> 56:12.840
This phenomenon is basically

56:12.840 --> 56:14.840
It's very similar to what we see here

56:14.840 --> 56:16.840
Say

56:16.840 --> 56:18.840
I

56:18.840 --> 56:20.840
But there are a lot of different frequencies

56:20.840 --> 56:22.840
Running inside

56:22.840 --> 56:24.840
In fact, we're looking at this

56:24.840 --> 56:26.840
Mixed quantum classical

56:26.840 --> 56:28.840
In a short time, you'll see three peaks

56:28.840 --> 56:30.840
We can see three peaks

56:30.840 --> 56:32.840
But for a long time, you'll find the two peaks next to it

56:32.840 --> 56:34.840
It's slowly disappearing

56:34.840 --> 56:36.840
Only the middle peak is left

56:36.840 --> 56:38.840
It's basically a

56:38.840 --> 56:40.840
Classical driving system

56:40.840 --> 56:42.840
Classical in, classical out

56:42.840 --> 56:44.840
Nothing else

56:44.840 --> 56:46.840
The rest is

56:46.840 --> 56:48.840
The same old problem

56:48.840 --> 56:50.840
There's no fluctuation here

56:52.840 --> 56:54.840
With this

56:54.840 --> 56:56.840
We'll find that

56:56.840 --> 56:58.840
The blue line is the line after the plus

56:58.840 --> 57:00.840
We can see

57:00.840 --> 57:02.840
There's a stable

57:02.840 --> 57:04.840
Side peak

57:04.840 --> 57:06.840
It won't be because of time

57:06.840 --> 57:08.840
It won't be because of time

57:08.840 --> 57:10.840
It's gone

57:10.840 --> 57:12.840
Why is there a stable side peak

57:12.840 --> 57:14.840
It's actually a

57:14.840 --> 57:16.840
It's attributed to

57:16.840 --> 57:18.840
Random perturbation

57:18.840 --> 57:20.840
Stochastic defacing

57:20.840 --> 57:22.840
It's kind of like

57:22.840 --> 57:24.840
In this classical system

57:24.840 --> 57:26.840
Push it from time to time

57:26.840 --> 57:28.840
Don't let it fall back

57:28.840 --> 57:30.840
The huge frequency

57:30.840 --> 57:32.840
Don't let it be forever

57:32.840 --> 57:34.840
Classical in, classical out

57:34.840 --> 57:36.840
There's this little stochastic

57:36.840 --> 57:38.840
Defacing is actually very important here

57:38.840 --> 57:40.840
It can make

57:40.840 --> 57:42.840
The two side peaks

57:42.840 --> 57:44.840
All stable

57:44.840 --> 57:46.840
We want to know

57:46.840 --> 57:48.840
Here we can see

57:48.840 --> 57:50.840
These three ratios

57:50.840 --> 57:52.840
R, F, T

57:52.840 --> 57:54.840
With

57:54.840 --> 57:56.840
All classical theory

57:56.840 --> 57:58.840
The prediction is consistent

57:58.840 --> 58:00.840
We want to know

58:00.840 --> 58:02.840
Is there anything else

58:02.840 --> 58:04.840
More interesting

58:04.840 --> 58:06.840
We can compare with classical theory

58:06.840 --> 58:08.840
Here

58:08.840 --> 58:10.840
We show

58:10.840 --> 58:12.840
This graph

58:12.840 --> 58:14.840
It's an experiment

58:14.840 --> 58:16.840
2012

58:16.840 --> 58:18.840
Nature Phantomics

58:18.840 --> 58:20.840
What did it change

58:20.840 --> 58:22.840
It's a model triplet

58:22.840 --> 58:24.840
Different lines

58:24.840 --> 58:26.840
From bottom to top

58:26.840 --> 58:28.840
Different

58:28.840 --> 58:30.840
Infrared frequency

58:30.840 --> 58:32.840
You'll find

58:32.840 --> 58:34.840
There are a few

58:34.840 --> 58:36.840
Features

58:36.840 --> 58:38.840
The middle peak

58:38.840 --> 58:40.840
There are some

58:40.840 --> 58:42.840
Different

58:42.840 --> 58:44.840
Different infrared behavior

58:44.840 --> 58:46.840
The first one

58:46.840 --> 58:48.840
Peak position

58:48.840 --> 58:50.840
You can see the picture on the right

58:52.840 --> 58:54.840
The middle line

58:54.840 --> 58:56.840
Is

58:56.840 --> 58:58.840
Central peak

58:58.840 --> 59:00.840
It doesn't change much

59:00.840 --> 59:02.840
This

59:02.840 --> 59:04.840
Side peak

59:04.840 --> 59:06.840
It's with

59:06.840 --> 59:08.840
This width

59:08.840 --> 59:10.840
Many people call

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
Generalized

59:12.840 --> 59:14.840
Rabi frequency

59:14.840 --> 59:16.840
It's off resonance

59:16.840 --> 59:18.840
It's off resonance

59:18.840 --> 59:20.840
Rabi frequency

59:20.840 --> 59:22.840
That

59:22.840 --> 59:24.840
The experiment and theory

59:24.840 --> 59:26.840
Very well

59:26.840 --> 59:28.840
This peak

59:28.840 --> 59:30.840
Basically

59:30.840 --> 59:32.840
Basically

59:32.840 --> 59:34.840
This

59:34.840 --> 59:36.840
It's not hard to get

59:36.840 --> 59:38.840
The experiment and theory

59:38.840 --> 59:40.840
It's not too bad

59:40.840 --> 59:42.840
We

59:42.840 --> 59:44.840
In

59:44.840 --> 59:46.840
In urnfest plus r

59:46.840 --> 59:48.840
You can see

59:48.840 --> 59:50.840
The same behavior

59:50.840 --> 59:52.840
Central peak

59:52.840 --> 59:54.840
Fixed

59:54.840 --> 59:56.840
Side peak

59:56.840 --> 59:58.840
Similar

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.840
Generalized

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.840
Rabi frequency

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.840
The picture is a bit

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.840
I want to be like the left

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.840
X and y

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.840
Opposite

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.840
If you flip it over

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.840
The color is correct

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840
Blue to blue

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.840
This is

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.840
Can be

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.840
A very good point

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.840
Basically

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.840
It's not hard

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.840
Next

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.840
Here

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.840
There's another peak

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.840
Outside

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.840
Right

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.840
Left and right

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.840
Resonance

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.840
Resonance

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.840
It may be

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.840
Higher

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.840
Higher

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.840
I'm sure

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.840
I have an impression

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.840
Please tell me

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.840
I remember

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.840
Model triplet

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.840
Very strong

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.840
Equivalent to

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840
This connection

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.840
AC

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.840
Create another connection

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.840
My previous understanding

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.840
Right

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.840
So the calculation

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.840
Is

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.840
2012

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.840

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.840
No use

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.840
The method

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.840
The method

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.840
The method

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.840
Is

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.840
Dark shift

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.840
Electrophonon

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.840
Calculate

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840
OK

Later

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.840
Many people

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.840
Explained

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.840
There is a good resource

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.840
Corinth

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.840
Work

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.840
Right

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.840
Next

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.840
More interesting

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.840
I'm comparing

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.840
This picture

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.840
I want to compare

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.840
Peak position

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.840
Can i get

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.840
Correct

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.840
Coherence emission

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.840
This one on the left

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.840
Quotient

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Quantum mechanics

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.840
The whole quantum theory

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.840
Calculated

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.840
Coherence emission

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.840
The ratio

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.840
That

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840
This green dot

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.840
Is a dot

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.840
We use

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.840
The first

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.840
We found

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.840
Near resonance

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.840
Delta omega is 0

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.840
Near resonance

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.840
Very good

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.840
Is there a way

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.840
We have a caveat

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.840
That is

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.840
Quantum mechanics

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.840
Based on

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.840
Rotating wave approximation

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.840
Near resonance

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.840
Near resonance

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840
So we don't know

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.840
Far away

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.840
Resonance

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.840
Quantum mechanics

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.840
This calculation

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.840
Quantum mechanics

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.840
Is it accurate?

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.840
So this place

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.840
We are not very clear

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.840
Is this place accurate?

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.840
We get

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.840
Quite different

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.840
Near resonance

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.840
The result is close

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.840
That right

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.840
Is a

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.840
Can

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.840
Almost beyond

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.840
Rotating wave approximation

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.840
That is

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.840
If we look at the left

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.840
Peak

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840
For

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.840
For

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
Different frequency

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840
Change

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840
The red line

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.840
Right side

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.840
The blue line is the left side peak

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.840
That

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.840
Is

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840
In this

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.840
This

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.840
It is a

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.840
It will not

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.840
Unpredictable

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.840
Because

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.840
It only focuses on

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.840
One level

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.840
One level

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.840
This

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.840
Approximation

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.840
So it can get

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.840
The middle finger is right

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840
But it can't get this

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.840
At this point

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.840
But our

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.840
Mixed quantum classical method

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.840
Because I didn't do anything

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.840
This

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.840
Rotating wave

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:02.840
So the result I got

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.840
I can get this

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.840
Linear crossing

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.840
This result

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.840
The result of the experiment is the same

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.840
On the experiment

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.840
We can see this

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.840
It is not a fixed point

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.840
It is a linear crossing

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840
This result

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.840
Very exciting

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.840
So

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.840
We

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.840
So the last

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.840
This is the last recap

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.840
We found this

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.840
RFS class R dynamics

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.840
It can

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.840
Can simulate quantum mixing

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.840
There is no mixing

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.840
But only

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.840
Driving field

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.840
With a small stochastic

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.840
I can simulate

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.840
Quantum mixing

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.840
That we can

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.840
Very clear

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.840
Coherence emission and incoherence emission

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840
That

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.840
I hope

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.840
These advantages

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.840
Tell everyone that we are developing

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.840
This set of theory

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.840
Very reliable

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.840
Method to deal with

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.840
Quantum interaction

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.840
But this method

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.840
There are many problems

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.840
This method

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.840
We haven't thought about it yet

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.840
This

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.840
Quantum motion

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.840
Our current material

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.840
Very simple material

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.840
Very simple

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.840
From the perspective of a chemist

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.840
We are

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.840
We hope

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.840
At least

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.840
Chemistry

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.840
Potential energy

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.840
Put in

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.840
Put in

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.840
Non-adiabatic dynamics

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.840
Different behaviors

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840
This is a

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.840
Suitable direction

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.840
Another question mark

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.840
Can we get

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:00.840
Photon content detection

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.840
Because there are

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.840
The second point and the third point

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.840
Very similar

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840
Anti-function

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.840
Because

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.840
There is another big feature

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.840
I haven't covered yet

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840
Three-wind

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.840
Photon content detection is different

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840
Because

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.840
It releases light

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.840
Order of relationship

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.840
Every light

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.840
For example, it

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.840
It releases the first

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.840
The next one may be very close to it

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.840
That

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.840
The first one

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.840
It must be very far away

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.840
It can't release a light right away

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.840
So when you measure

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.840
The statistical value of light

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.840
You will find

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.840
F light may be

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.840
In line with

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.840
Poisson distribution

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.840
Then T light

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.840
It is in line with sub-Poisson distribution

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.840
So they

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.840
The statistical value of light will be different

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.840
Here

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.840
We haven't tried it yet

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.840
Of course

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840
There is no light inside

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.840
Can we get similar

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.840
Finally

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.840
There is a

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.840
If our light is not

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.840
Not

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.840
Not at zero

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.840
There is a thermal distribution

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.840
Then we

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.840
Can we

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.840
In Mixed quantum classical

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.840
Get detail balance

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.840
Or we may

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.840
Violate detail balance

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.840
The last question

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.840
It's actually a very important question

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.840
In many systems

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.840
For example, you put a two-level system in the cavity

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.840
Its spontaneous emission rate

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.840
May be changed

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.840
It may no longer be in line with

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.840
Freemius golden rule rate

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.840
Its spontaneous emission rate

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.840
Because of the cavity

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.840
Strong interaction

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.840
Caused

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.840
It

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.840
The emission frequency will change

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.840
What about our method now

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.840
Based on Freemius golden rule rate

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.840
So it may not be in line with

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.840
So this is also a

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840
It may be necessary to consider

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.840
Then

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.840
Then we do

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.840
Method

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.840
Method development

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.840
Method development

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.840
For people

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.840
The most common thing we do

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.840
We have created a new toy

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.840
It's

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.840
We want to use it in many places

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.840
Many people hope to use it

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.840
In many places

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.840
For us

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.840
A very important question

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.840
When will it break down

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.840
This is the most important thing we want to know

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.840
The most important thing we want to know

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.840
When does it not work

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.840
That

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.840
Of course there are many

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.840
Application

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.840
These things are all

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.840
We hope to push it to

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.840
Other

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.840
Light or

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.840
Spectroscopy group

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.840
Let them try

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.840
Can we

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.840
Use the same method

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.840
Look at

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.840
We put

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.840
Chemical reaction into a cavity

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.840
It may be because of the interaction with light

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.840
To change

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.840
Its vibrational

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.840
Energy level

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.840
Because of the change in the vibrational energy level

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.840
It may have different

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.840
Reaction pathway

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.840
So it will have different chemical reactions

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.840
This is also

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.840
This is a thing we can do

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.840
A direction

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.840
Another application in the middle

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.840
Is a new theory

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.840
It's called

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.840
Model spectroscopy

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.840
Then

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.840
In this model spectroscopy

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.840
I use

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.840
Classical source

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.840
Generate quantum light

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.840
Then use this quantum light

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.840
Different light statistical properties

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.840
To

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.840
Hit the target

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.840
Then

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.840
I can see

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.840
This

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.840
Target for different

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.840
Photon statistics

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.840
Behavior

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.840
This is a

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.840
New thing

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.840
But this thing

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.840
There is no implementation

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.840
But in theory

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.840
Many people

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.840
Pursue this direction

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.840
Finally

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.840
A very

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.840
In device and material science

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.840
A very useful application

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.840
Conductance enhancement

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.840
Application

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.840
This

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.840
Conductance enhancement

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.840
Can use

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.840
Cavity

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.840
Can use

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.840
This method

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.840
We hope to use this method

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.840
To

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.840
Understand why

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.840
Conductance enhancement

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.840
Will happen

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.840
Finally, I would like to thank

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.840
My

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.840
Professor

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.840
This

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.840
Old man

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.840
Not old

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.840
My

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.840
Advisor

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.840
And

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.840
I've been

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.840
Half year

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.840
Visiting scholar

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.840
Half year

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.840
Visiting scholar

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.840
Maxine

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.840
A professor

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.840
Now

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.840
This method

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.840
Generate

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.840
Three dimension

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.840
This method

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.840
I have a

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.840
Electronic system

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.840
There is a

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:56.840
Classic electronic system

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.840
Maxine is a classic electronic system

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.840
Expert

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.840
This theory

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.840
With

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.840
Very

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.840
Mature

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.840
Combination

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.840
Tao Li

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.840
A researcher

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.840
He is

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.840
We did a lot of work together

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.840
Finally, I want to thank

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.840
Ted

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.840
Organize

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.840
Let me have a chance

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:28.840
Share with you

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.840
Thank you

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.840
Thank you

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.840
Thank you

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.840
Any other questions

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.840
No

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.840
Hey everyone

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.840
No one has a special question

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.840
Hey

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.840
Let me ask

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.840
One is what we are looking at

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.840
The problem is good

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840
When we look at it recently

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.840
I

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.840
What are you doing

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.840
Light

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.840
This kind of

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.840
Interaction

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.840
In the semiconductor

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.840
In the semiconductor

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.840
This kind of

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.840
We are looking at

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.840
In addition to

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.840
Like you now

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.840
Are concerned

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.840
Light in classical way

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.840
Electromagnetic wave

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.840
If

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.840
So we do

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.840
We do more

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.840
That

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.840
So

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.840
It depends on

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.840
Light itself

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.840
Characteristics

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.840
One we are looking at recently

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.840
I

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.840
Just

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.840
Is

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.840
This kind of thing

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.840
I'm thinking

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.840
If there is

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.840
Although at the beginning

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.840
But

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.840
Light

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.840
Is recently

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.840
I think it's a hot topic

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.840
One

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.840
Have you ever thought about it

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.840
His whole disease

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.840
He is also a

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840
That one

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.840
Border

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.840
One of the conditions

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.840
Square

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Light

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.840
This slope

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.840
It's different from the circle

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.840
Not the same

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.840
In addition to the disease

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.840
There is a good moment

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.840
That you

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.840
This may be

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840
Maybe you are now

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.840
It may not be the same

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.840
But I want to say

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.840
You can analyze it

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.840
Light

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.840
For

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.840
Maybe

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.840
Interaction between molecules

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.840
Interaction with any

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.840
Interaction

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.840
How does it react

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.840
I think

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.840
This

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.840
I am not a scholar

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.840
These things are a bit difficult

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.840
I

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.840
I am now

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840
I am now

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.840
What they are doing

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.840
Very confident

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.840
I have

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840
FDTD

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.840
These good

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.840
Classical electromagnetic

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.840
That

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.840
Basically

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.840
What he does now

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.840
For

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.840
Different polarization

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Can be done

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840
I think

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.840
If he does this

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.840
I think it should be

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.840
The problem you are thinking about is helpful

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.840
Great

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840
Let's pay attention to this

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.840
Professor

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.840
I have a question

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.840
Ok

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.840
This is

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.840
This is my long-standing question

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.840
I want to know when it will happen

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.840
Melo

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.840
When will it happen

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.840
Outer tongue splitting

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840
Then

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.840
What is your second

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
Outer tongue splitting

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.840
Oh

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.840
Then

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.840
I know it's probably

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.840
Only in molecules or

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.840
Molecular system

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.840
But in

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.840
Acetone system

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.840
Outer tongue splitting

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.840
Then

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.840
Do you know the specific reason

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.840
I don't know the specific reason

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.840
What is it

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.840
Because my understanding of it is the same as yours

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.840
It's in

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.840
Molecule

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.840
In the molecular system

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.840
It will be

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
The other one is in

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.840
Yeah

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.840
I still have to learn these things

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.840
I haven't

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.840
I probably do this

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.840
About a year and a half

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840
Ok

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.840
I still have a lot to learn

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.840
Ok

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.840
The other thing is

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.840
Outer tongues and

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.840
What is it

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.840
It's called

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.840
EIT

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Electronic

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840
Transparency

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.840
What's the difference between these two

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.840
Transparency

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.840
I really don't know

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.840
Ok

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.840
Out of my

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.840
You may ask

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.840
Ted may not know

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.840
I remember EIT

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.840
I remember EIT and

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.840
It seems to be different

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.840
EIT seems to be more in atoms

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.840
But I actually don't remember

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.840
Ah

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.840
EIT

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.840
EIT and

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.840
The effect of outer tongues looks the same

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840
But it's completely different from molecular splitting

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.840
Molecular splitting you will see

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.840
There are three states

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.840
You see two states in outer tongues

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.840
I forgot

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.840
Sorry

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.840
It's okay

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.840
But I think this is a pretty interesting question

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.840
I think I should

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.840
I should use

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Because EIT is basically

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.840
The first thing we try

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.840
Let's try to break down

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840
This method

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.840
See if our method will break down here

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.840
It's actually pretty good

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.840
So I was thinking

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.840
Maybe our next project will use EIT

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.840
Ok

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.840
Another thing

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.840
You said you add

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.840
You add fluctuation in the electric field

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.840
Then

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.840
Add fluctuation in the classical field

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.840
Then let it be

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.840
Looks like there is

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.840
Spontaneous emission

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.840
Which electric field are you in

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.840
Is it driving force

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.840
Do you add fluctuation in the emission field

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.840
No, I'm in the radiation field

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.840
Add fluctuation

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.840
What about driving field

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.840
We still treat it as

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.840
It's a

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.840
Electric field running past

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.840
Just say

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.840
You can break it down

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.840
But this

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.840
If you are in

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.840
Emission

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.840
Add fluctuation in radiation

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.840
Then

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.840
You said your addition

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.840
You just assume

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.840
It's on time

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.840
Don't run on time

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.840
Then at a certain random time

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.840
You just let it change

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.840
Phase

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.840
Then

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.840
This thing seems to be with

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.840
Is two dimensional

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.840
Spectroscopy

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.840
The method they use

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.840
Very similar

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.840
Do you say pump probe

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.840
In two dimensional

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.840
Spectroscopy

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.840
They have

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.840
Another one called

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.840
Another one called

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.840
There are two components in

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.840
One is called

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.840
Free induction decay

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.840
The second one is

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.840
Phonon scattering

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.840
Or scattering of other things

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.840
Then

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.840
The second one

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.840
Their assumption

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.840
They brought in

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.840
Model method

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840
In the radiation field

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.840
Add a random

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.840
Phase jump

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.840
So these two things

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.840
Is it the same

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.840
Actually different

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.840
A little different

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.840
Just say

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.840
OK

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.840
I want

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.840
Just

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840
I want to say one thing

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.840
Because i'm not really

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.840
I'm not really

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.840
I'm not really

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.840
Add a random phase

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.840
I'm adding a random phase

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.840
In

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.840
In

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.840
Two level system

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.840
Then this two level system

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.840
Random phase will react to electric field

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.840
So i'm not really

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840
Add to electric field

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.840
That way

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.840
There are two benefits

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840
Because

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.840
My

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.840
It is natural

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840
There are two benefits of this method

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.840
The first benefit is

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.840
Because my two level system

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.840
Also need this defacing

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.840
It also needs

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.840
This little defacing

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840
Correct

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.840
Its fluctuation

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.840
It also needs this thing

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.840
That

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.840
From

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.840
Then the other benefit is

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840
Because i'm

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.840
Put

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.840
There is actually a

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.840
Difficulty point is because I put

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.840
I want to put this

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.840
Add a little fluctuation

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840
I can't just add it

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840
Add to a certain place

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.840
It just caused it

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.840
Self-interaction will destroy the whole system

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.840
That

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.840
So it will have a

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.840
Specific method

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.840
Add it to a correct place

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.840
That

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.840
This thing

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.840
Because

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.840
Because

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.840
Because this field

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.840
It's not like it's not just a point

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.840
It's a whole space

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.840
And it has to meet some basic

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.840
For example, it can't go beyond the speed of light

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.840
I can't put a field

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.840
Suddenly add to a place beyond the speed of light

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.840
Right

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.840
So

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.840
We try not to add directly

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840
On the field

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.840
So when we design this method

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.840
We put

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840
This fluctuation is added to the two-level system

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.840
Let the two-level system

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.840
Naturally generate this fluctuation

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.840
OK

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.840
There is a more detailed question

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840
I want to know

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.840
Why

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840
Classical

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.840
Just

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.840
Quantum matter and classical

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.840
Field

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.840
That

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.840
Inside the model

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.840
Only when

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840
Just when

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
That is

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840
Low

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.840
Low 0

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.840
Low 1 is

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.840
There will be no emission

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840
I always thought

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840
There will be no emission

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.840
OK

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.840
Thank you for asking this question

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.840
Because

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.840
Because of my time

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.840
I missed a part

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840
That's it

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.840
Here

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.840
Here

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.840
Mixed quantum classical

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.840
Here

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.840
It's not pure

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840
Pure

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.840
The most basic

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.840
Mixed quantum classical

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.840
There is a

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840
Mixed quantum classical

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840
I am in this

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.840
This

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.840
In this

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.840
Two-level system

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840
Classical

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.840
Field

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.840
Will also

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.840
Self-interact to two-level system

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.840
Let it decay

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.840
So

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.840
This is already a non-linear system

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.840
So you see these

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840
These red lines are not a simple

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.840
A simple

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.840
Exponential decay

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.840
OK

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.840
It is a

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.840
I will keep myself

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.840
Self-interact

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.840
So

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.840
There will be some decay

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.840
Basically

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.840
Here

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840
This is one of our recent papers

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.840
Its point is

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840
This is the most basic

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.840
Mixed quantum classical

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.840
Can get some

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
Partially correct

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840
Some spontaneous emission

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.840
But it won't get all

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.840
Spontaneous emission

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840
Sorry, you can go to the front page

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840
Let me see what is called

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.840
Oh

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.840
You said

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.840
Its equation

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.840
I didn't write it out

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840
OK

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.840
I can

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.840
I can give you

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840
Our paper

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.840
On the paper

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.840
I can check it myself

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.840
Because I didn't

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.840
Write it all out

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840
It's a bit complicated

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Thank you

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.840
You're welcome

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.840
OK

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.840
Other listeners have no questions

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.840
Want to discuss

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.840
OK

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840
If you don't have any questions

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.840
That's all for today

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.840
Thank you

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.840
Thank you

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.840
OK
