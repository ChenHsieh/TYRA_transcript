0	20000	Hello, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Lin Yuwei from UC Irvine.
20000	30000	Our guest for today's TerraTalk is Lu Kefan, a Ph.D. student at Fairbanks University of Alaska.
30000	36000	His field of research is very interesting. It's about Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.
36000	48000	He also worked as an intern at the Department of R&D at Fairbanks University of Alaska.
48000	52000	He also taught for 3 and a half years.
52000	56000	He is expected to graduate next spring.
56000	61000	You can visit his defense course and watch the aurora.
61000	65000	Let's welcome Lu Kefan.
65000	69000	Thank you, everyone.
69000	73000	I don't want to bore you.
73000	77000	Plus, no one knows about this field.
77000	85000	So, I'll introduce the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.
85000	99000	I'll talk about my field of research.
99000	103000	I'll also talk about my field of research.
103000	111000	I'll also talk about my field of research.
111000	127000	At the beginning, we saw a video.
127000	135000	It's a popular video on social media.
135000	139000	It tells us how to reduce this year's sea ice.
139000	145000	It's about how to save the Arctic, the Earth, and the environment.
145000	147000	It's a similar title.
147000	155000	For me, the video's demand is correct.
155000	161000	But every time I see a similar video, I have to be careful.
161000	165000	What does the color in the video represent?
165000	173000	You may think that the white part is the size of the ice.
173000	181000	But in fact, this video is from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.
181000	185000	It calculates the age of the ice.
185000	189000	That is, the length of time the ice stays in the ocean.
189000	197000	Why do we look at the age of the ice?
197000	205000	Generally speaking, we will divide the ice into one-year ice or multi-year ice.
205000	207000	One-year ice is the gray part.
207000	211000	You can see that it fluctuates a lot every year.
211000	215000	Because it melts in summer.
215000	221000	When the sea water reaches the freezing point, it freezes again.
221000	227000	In fact, the thickness of the sea ice has nothing to do with its age.
227000	231000	The average thickness of one-year ice is about 2 to 3 meters.
231000	235000	Multi-year ice is the ice that has not completely melted in summer for more than a year.
235000	239000	Its thickness is actually about 3 meters.
239000	251000	The thickness of one-year ice or multi-year ice may be more than 5 meters.
251000	255000	So when you see a video like this, especially a large-scale video,
255000	261000	Because the thickness of the sea ice is very difficult to measure in the air.
261000	263000	So if you see such a large-scale video,
263000	267000	It is usually not discussing the thickness of the sea ice or its size or volume.
267000	273000	Next, let's look at the winter of 2016.
273000	275000	Take a closer look at the gray part.
275000	277000	For example, as I just said,
277000	279000	One-year ice is also 3 meters.
279000	281000	Multi-year ice is also 3 meters.
281000	285000	Then you will see that the whole piece is white.
285000	289000	Even the east coast of the United States still has sea ice.
289000	295000	Then visually, you will not feel so deeply that our sea ice is declining.
295000	297000	You will not feel that terrible.
297000	303000	But NASA made this video is not to intimidate everyone.
303000	307000	This video has several points.
307000	319000	The first is that we can see that most of the sea ice will flow out of the Atlantic coast.
319000	321000	This is the first point.
321000	327000	The second point is that if we look closely at the gray area,
327000	329000	Or look at the statistics next to it,
329000	337000	In the summer, the gray area is the part of one-year ice.
337000	339000	Indeed, there is a gradual decrease in the trend.
339000	341000	I will say that it is a decrease in the trend,
341000	345000	It's not that it's really decreasing every year.
345000	349000	It's because it's really decreasing every summer.
349000	353000	But overall, it has been gradually decreasing in the past 40 years.
353000	357000	The countries that are concerned about the research of the Arctic Ocean
357000	363000	There are mainly neighboring eight countries, including the United States, Greenland, Iceland,
363000	367000	Then the Nordic countries and Russia.
367000	369000	In addition to these neighboring eight countries,
369000	377000	There are some countries such as Europe, Germany, France, East Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China.
377000	381000	The reason why they are so concerned about the research of the Arctic Ocean is because
381000	385000	Everyone wants to take advantage of the summer when there is no ice.
385000	389000	Take advantage of the fishing rights and navigation rights in the Arctic Ocean.
389000	393000	So these distant East Asian countries,
393000	395000	Once they can use this red line,
395000	399000	This red line is the Arctic Ocean's North East Line.
399000	401000	It is now being used.
401000	407000	If East Asian countries use the North East Line to travel by sea,
407000	409000	If you send something to Europe,
409000	413000	Its navigation will be about one-third of the way to the south.
413000	417000	So for them, the melting of the summer ice,
417000	421000	Or the gradual decrease in the area of ​​ice,
421000	427000	For some countries, it's not entirely a disaster or a bad thing.
427000	429000	Or something you want to avoid.
429000	433000	Not to mention the United States, Norway, and Russia.
433000	441000	There are very large drilling projects along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.
441000	445000	Or mining natural resources.
445000	447000	It's not like what you see.
447000	455000	Greenpeace has tried to ban drilling in the Arctic Ocean.
455000	457000	And then they won.
457000	459000	It's not like that.
459000	461000	The reason why Shell stopped drilling in the Arctic Ocean
461000	465000	It's because they hired a lot of scientists to do research.
465000	469000	And then they found out that if they were to deal with the subsequent oil and gas problems,
469000	471000	And to strengthen the ecological balance,
471000	477000	They didn't lose any profits.
477000	479000	That's why they decided to withdraw.
479000	481000	But in addition to Shell,
481000	483000	There are a lot of oil companies in the United States.
483000	485000	Like ConocoFlips or BP.
485000	489000	They continue to drill along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.
489000	493000	Not to mention that the entire north coast of Norway is a drilling platform.
493000	495000	What about these countries?
495000	501000	Their attitude towards the reduction of sea ice is
501000	511000	Treat it as a natural phenomenon that is already happening and is almost impossible to reverse.
511000	517000	Their research focuses on how to deal with what has already happened.
517000	531000	For example, researchers from Alaska and Norway are now working on improving the shape of the oil platform.
531000	535000	Because we see that if there is less sea ice, the flow of the sea will be strengthened.
535000	537000	But there will still be some floating ice stuck on the coast.
537000	541000	These floating ice will be affected by the strong flow of the sea.
541000	543000	And then it will hit the oil platform.
543000	545000	And then it could cause a public safety accident.
545000	551000	So they want to improve the oil platform to reduce the slowdown of floating ice collision.
551000	553000	Or like the East Asian countries I just mentioned,
553000	559000	They are constantly studying when to enter the Arctic Ocean.
559000	567000	Which route to take to avoid aftershocks and shipwrecks.
567000	575000	For example, Alaska's King Crab is very famous.
575000	579000	As the sea ice retreats, the water temperature will change.
579000	583000	So we find that the King Crab is gradually moving north.
583000	591000	At this time, they have to consider whether to change the target species or change the area and timing of the King Crab.
591000	597000	These are all countries that are now working on Arctic research.
597000	611000	They are not completely treating it as a disaster to avoid.
611000	617000	Or try to recover to the original sea ice situation.
617000	627000	From this animation, we can get a lot of information.
627000	641000	A lot of sea ice is flowing out of the Atlantic Ocean.
641000	651000	This can be seen from the ocean flow cycle of the Arctic Ocean.
651000	661000	There is a lot of Atlantic Ocean water flowing from the Atlantic Ocean of the Arctic Ocean.
661000	669000	Because of the force of gravity, the King Crab will move along the right bank of the Arctic Ocean.
669000	673000	The Atlantic Ocean has an opening, and the Pacific Ocean also has an opening.
673000	677000	Why didn't the King Crab flow out of the Pacific Ocean?
677000	683000	This is because the opening of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow.
683000	689000	The width of the opening is about 100 to 200 kilometers.
689000	695000	The depth of the opening is about 30 to 50 meters.
695000	703000	The depth of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is about 200 to 300 meters.
703000	709000	So once the Atlantic Ocean enters the Arctic Ocean, it is difficult to flow out of the Pacific Ocean again.
709000	715000	At the same time, there is also water flowing from the Pacific Ocean.
715000	721000	So the King Crab will continue to move along the right bank of the Atlantic Ocean.
721000	731000	The King Crab will continue to move along the right bank of the Atlantic Ocean.
731000	733000	This is the first reason.
733000	737000	The second reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.
737000	743000	The second reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.
743000	749000	The first reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.
749000	755000	Continue to the third reason.
755000	761000	The third reason is that the King Crab became very wet from the air.

1637000	1649000	The bottom of the ice water is a large layer of ice with a very high salinity of about 33 degrees.
1649000	1656000	The reason why it is called winter water is because when the sea water freezes, it releases a lot of salt.
1656000	1662000	After the salt has melted, it enters the sea water, which makes the sea water very heavy.
1662000	1668000	After the sea water freezes, it sinks to the bottom, leaving a large amount of high salinity and very cold water.
1668000	1675000	The water temperature is close to 1.8 degrees in the sea water.
1675000	1681000	This winter water stays at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean for a long time this year.
