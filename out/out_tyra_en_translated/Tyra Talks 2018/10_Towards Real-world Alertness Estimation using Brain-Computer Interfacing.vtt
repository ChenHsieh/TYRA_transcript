00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
I am today's host, I am Hong Shaoming, I am now working in California as a postdoctoral researcher.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Without further ado, let's introduce today's speaker, Dr. Wei Qunshu.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Dr. Qunshu graduated from the College of Electrical Engineering, and stayed in California to study electrical engineering.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
After graduating, he went to UCSD to study biotechnology, and his professor is Professor Zong Ziping.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
He is mainly interested in using the perspective of engineering to use brain-to-brain meetings to study human behavior.

00:40.000 --> 00:53.000
Over the past few years, he has published nearly 10 conference papers and two journal papers.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Without further ado, let's listen to his presentation.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
The title is Towards Real-World Awareness Estimation Using Brain-Computer Interface.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Let's welcome him.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Thank you Shaoming for the introduction.

01:09.000 --> 01:25.000
Today, I will introduce how we measure brain activity and monitor our alertness using a brain-computer interface.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
We can easily have a discussion.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
First, I will briefly introduce the brain.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
Our brain is a tube of about 3 pounds, about 1,000 grams.

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
The outermost part of the brain has many folds.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
These folds are composed of many neurons in the brain.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
There are about 8.6 billion neurons.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
We know that the brain has very strong computing power.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
However, compared to our most powerful computers, its performance is very good.

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
In terms of energy consumption, it is 100,000 times more efficient than a normal CPU.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Therefore, the brain can only operate at 12 to 25 watts.

02:43.000 --> 02:48.000
This wattage is equivalent to the wattage of a light bulb.

02:48.000 --> 02:58.000
So you can imagine that in some comics, when the character thinks of a point, he will draw a light bulb.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
It's actually pretty close.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Because the brain's power consumption is the power of a light bulb.

03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
The structure of the neural network is composed of cells.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
There are many vectors.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
The vector part collects information from other neural networks around it.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
After the information is compiled into the neural network, it will decide whether to power up.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
If you want to power up, you can use the axis.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Then you can power up to other neural networks.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
In this way, complex networks can be used to control the whole person.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Here is a brain signal that I use more often.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
It's called a brain wave.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's EEG.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Many people have been exposed to EEG.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
Especially when a newborn is born, we often do a brain test to see if his vision or hearing is normal.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
How does EEG occur?

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
There are many neural networks in our brain.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Especially the skin.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Many neural networks are arranged.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
There are some rules in the structure.

04:19.000 --> 04:28.000
The arrangement of the rules allows the neural network to have an additional effect when it is powering up.

04:28.000 --> 04:39.000
The change in the electrical field can be so great that you can feel the change in the electrical field outside the scalp.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.000
The change in the electrical field becomes our brain wave signal after some processing.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt me.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Our brain wave signal is...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I have a question.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
There is a line below.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
BlueJeans meeting is sharing your screen with bluejeans.com.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
You have to press the hide button.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, okay.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Or you can block it a little bit.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm sorry.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
You can continue.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Thank you.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Okay.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Let's continue.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
This is the brain wave signal.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
It is a real-time signal.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
You can see that it is like a time series.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
It is a time series.

05:31.000 --> 05:41.000
In order to measure the whole brain, we will try to arrange electrical fields outside the scalp.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
So we will have a lot of brain waves on both sides at the same time.

05:47.000 --> 05:56.000
We will analyze the energy of brain waves in terms of frequency.

05:56.000 --> 06:04.000
The frequency depends on whether the signal is fast or slow.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
The high frequency is the fast part.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
The low frequency is the slow part.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
So we will divide delta.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
It is a low frequency activity of less than 3.5 Hz.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
It is a very slow vibration.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
If you go higher, it will be divided into theta wave, alpha wave, or beta wave.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
The higher the frequency, the faster the vibration.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Our brain can be divided into different bands.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
By observing the energy of the band, we can get a lot of information.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
Let me introduce the location of the channel of the brain.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
It has a standard way of dividing.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
The name of the channel is divided into points.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Frontal is the channel at the beginning of F.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Central is the channel at the beginning of C.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
Central parietal is the channel at the beginning of O.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
Occipital is the channel at the beginning of O.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
We can do this frequency analysis for each channel.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
We can combine the change of time with the change of frequency.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
We can see the energy of different bands over time.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
This can tell us a lot of information about the state of this person.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
We can design experiments to see if the brain changes.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
We can find some characteristics in different states.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Reflect the brain in different states.

08:04.000 --> 08:12.000
The brain interface is where we read the signals of the brain.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
Then we go through some signal processing, including frequency analysis.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
Or you can use a lot of other different signal processing methods to get different characteristics.

08:26.000 --> 08:35.000
Then we use the processed signals to make it recognizable.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Then we can convert it into some commands to control.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
For example, a mechanical arm or a wheel or a mouse cursor.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Or to input text or some messages.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
We call this the brain computer interface.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
In short, it's BCI.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
What can BCI do?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
As I just said, it can convert into commands.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
So when we play video games, we can use it to control the movement of your character.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Of course, including the wheel and the mechanical arm.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
Of course, it can also be used to monitor a person's cognitive state.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Including whether you want to sleep.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
This extends to my main area of expertise.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Monitoring the level of awareness.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
The level of awareness is related to drowsy driving.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
A lot of people fall asleep while driving.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
This news happened on July 18th.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
It was only recently that a drowsy driving incident occurred.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So it's not a big deal.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It's not a big deal.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It's not a big deal.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
It's not a big deal.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It's not a big deal.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's not a big deal.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It's not a big deal.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's not a big deal.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
elections

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
elections

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
elections

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
elections

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
elections

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
elections

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
elections

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
elections

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
keywords

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
keywords

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
So he can't hear the headphones, can he?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I didn't hear it.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Oh, no.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Let's see.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I can't.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Can you play it on your computer?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Can you hear me?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Can you hear me?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Can you hear me?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Yes.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I can hear you.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Can you hear me?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Max.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And then after 11 hours a day, we have to shut down

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and have 10 hours of sleep.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Truck drivers are also required to take a 30-minute break

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
during their first 8 hours of driving.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
All of this needs to be recorded

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
in logs like these,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
which are now mostly computerized.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
We now have to carry electronic recording devices

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
on our vehicles.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Rio says his students learn to make driving plans

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
to avoid getting fatigued,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
and they're encouraged to stop to power nap

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
or just stretch their legs.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
It gives you more stamina.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
You're more alert, because when you're not alert,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
you know, you can't make good decisions.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
And that's what truckers like Rudy live by.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I start closing, you've got to pull over

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
and take a nap.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
GoMana, eight news now.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
says drowsy driving

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
causes up to 1.2 million crashes

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
every year in this country,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That's nearly twice as many

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
as distracted driving.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Okay.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
So,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
this is a recent

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
drowsy driving incident.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
As you saw in the video,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
a truck hit

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
a construction vehicle

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
caused

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
two deaths and three injuries.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Drowsy driving can cause

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
up to 1.2 million

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
crashes every year,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
and it kills

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
between 5,000 and 8,000 people.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
So if we can avoid

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
drowsy driving,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
if we can effectively monitor

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
drowsy driving

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and manage it,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
maybe we can avoid

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
the death and injury

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
caused by this.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And then,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
in the news,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
it was mentioned that

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
if you find your eyes

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
blind,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
you should stop driving.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
But I also discussed with

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Shaoming last time

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
whether to use

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
eye or blink

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
to do

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
this alertness monitoring.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
But there is a question

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
that is,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
is there a way to

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
catch it

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
before it closes

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
its eyes

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and put it in the car?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
This part may want to

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
use brainwaves to

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
break through this problem.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
If we use

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
the brain interface to do

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
this alertness monitoring,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
we will first

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
measure its brainwaves

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
from the driver.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
After we get this EEG signal,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
after some processing,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
we use machine learning

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
to build a model

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
that can turn the EEG

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
data into

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
alertness.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
After we know its alertness,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
we can try to

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
give it some feedback.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
For example, we can wake it up,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
or we can

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
let the car

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
stop driving

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and stop by the road,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
or force it to rest.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
There are some ways to intervene.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
My research is

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
mainly about

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
how we deal with this signal,

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
how we build a

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
machine learning model,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
and how we can

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
monitor the alertness

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
very well.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Then we can

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
accurately determine

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
whether to make some interference.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I have a question.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I want to

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
clarify a little bit.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Do you mean

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
that your research is

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
a state of

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
mental relaxation

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
or a state of real sleep?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It's a state of

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
waking up

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
to almost falling asleep

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
before you really

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
fall asleep.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I didn't study

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
the state of the brain

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
after falling asleep,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
because I want to catch

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
it before I fall asleep.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
In fact,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I have

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
driving experience,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and I know

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
that my eyes were open at that time,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
but the image

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
was already

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
blurred and black,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and I was not looking at the road.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I was a little out of my mind,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
and then I suddenly woke up,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
and I felt a little

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
shaky.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
So you have to catch

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
the time point

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
before you fall asleep.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
It depends on

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
when you can't support

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
the alertness.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I have another question.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You are now

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
identifying a signal,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
and you think

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
this signal is

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
the state you are talking about.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Do you have a contrast group?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
For example, you track his eyes,

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
and then I define

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
the behavior of the eyes,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
which is to fall asleep.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Then I look for

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
a corresponding brain wave,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
or I ask the subject to write

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
that I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
What is your calibration?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
This question is very good.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
How do we define

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
the so-called alertness?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm going to talk about it next.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Because we think

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
alertness is related to your reaction time.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
So we use

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
reaction time to

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
give us an objective

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
measurement method.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Just like you said,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
using the eyes or

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
the way the subject responds.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The part of the eyes

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is that the activity of the eyes

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
is also a physiological signal.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
So whether he can react directly

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
to this behavior

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
is another experiment.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
His role and brain wave

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
are the same.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It just depends on which physiological signal

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
makes it easier for us

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
to be more accurate

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
to determine

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
whether it is

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
alert or not.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Subject report

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
is an objective determination.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
The subjective determination

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
will have some

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
deviation.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
That is, the word

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
reported by the subject

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
cannot express

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
the state he just experienced

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
very objectively.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Many researchers

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
think that the more objective

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
determination method is to look at

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
his reaction time.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Next,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I will talk about how we

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
measure brain waves and

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
his reaction time.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Finally, I will talk about

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
how to define

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
alertness.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Does this answer your question?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Yes, thank you.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Thank you.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I will talk about

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
the experiment we did

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and how to get the data we want.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
We put the subject

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
in a simulated

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
driving car.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The car has a

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
circular projection screen.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
The car is

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
on a dynamic platform,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
so driving in it

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
is to simulate

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
the real driving situation as much as possible.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
This is a device

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
in the brain center

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
of the University of Transportation

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
In this experiment,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
we are doing

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
road maintenance

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
tasks.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Road maintenance

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
means that the subject

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
must maintain the car

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
on the road.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
We will

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
automatically make the car

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
lean, forcing

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
the subject to

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
adjust the direction of

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
his car from time to time.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
The scene is

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
on a straight

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
highway,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
but the car

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
will tilt to the left

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
or to the right.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
The car will tilt once every 6-10 seconds.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
The subject

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
will feel that the car is

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
tilted,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
move the steering wheel

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
to guide the car.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
We will see

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
when the car

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
moves the steering wheel

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
after it is tilted.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
This is the reaction time.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Every 6-10 seconds,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
we can measure the reaction time.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
In the end, we hope

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
to predict the

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
reaction time

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
after the

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
brain wave

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
before the tilt.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
This is the

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
role of prediction.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Next, I will talk about

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
how to deal with

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
the prediction of

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
the alertness.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Every 6-10 seconds,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
we will have a response time

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
sample.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
On the y-axis,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I draw the reaction time.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I go to log.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
On the horizontal axis,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I draw the time.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
The unit is divided.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
This is the length

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
of the whole experiment.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The length of the experiment

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
is not certain.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
This is shorter,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
it is only 45 minutes.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Most experiments

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
take more than an hour.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
About an hour and a half.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Sometimes we will

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
ask the same subject to

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
come back and do it.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Let me see.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
We finally collected more than 30 subjects.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
There are

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
5, 6, 10

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
driving

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
experiment data.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Let's talk about

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
each point.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's the RT we just measured.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
10 to the power of 0 is about 1 second.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
When he wakes up,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
he can get the car back

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
to normal.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
After a while,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
his condition is not good.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
After his alertness began to decline,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
we will see some longer

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
response time.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
In fact, the reaction is that

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
his alertness becomes worse.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
We have to deal with

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
this RT data.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Because RT is

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
not a range.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Only one side has a range.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
The other side has no range.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Let's do a regularization first.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Change it to a value of 0 to 1.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
The way to regularize it

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
is to use its

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
cumulative distribution function.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Map it

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
to a

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
range value.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Then

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
let's do a

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
smoothing here.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
For smoothing, I use a 90-second

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
moving window

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
to make the

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
data look more dynamic.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
We turn it

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
into a smoother value.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
This part is because

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
RT only samples

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
once every 6 to 10 seconds.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
If you

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
use too high quality

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
to look at this data,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
it is more meaningless.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
If we use a smoothing,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
we can get rid of

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
some of the

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
inaccuracies of this data itself.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So we use

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
this

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
alertness deficit index

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
which is an index

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
that lacks attention.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We use it as

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
a ground truth

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
in our behavior.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Does anyone have any questions?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Let's assume that

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
RT directly reflects

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
the level of alertness.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Yes.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
RT becomes alertness

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
should be one of the factors.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Yes.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
So it depends on the

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
design of the experiment.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
In addition, let's assume that

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
in our experiment design,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
the part that affects RT

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
is only drowsiness.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
We try to

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
eliminate other factors

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
that may affect RT.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Because

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
similar paradigms

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
in the experiment

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
are also used

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
to study

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
mind-wandering.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Mind-wandering and

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
alertness are related

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
but not exactly the same.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
For example, your subject

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
starts to think about other things

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
and his RT becomes worse.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
In your definition,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
it is a lack of alertness.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Yes.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It is acceptable.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So our alertness

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
is based on

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
the alertness defined by RT.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Yes.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Because the subject does not react

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
like you said,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
he may be thinking about other things.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Of course,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
the instruction of our experiment

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
is to teach them to focus.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Yes.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
What we can do is

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
only up to here.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
It may affect your

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
EEG data later.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Imagine that there are three reasons

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
why his RT becomes worse.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
You will catch three patterns.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
The three patterns

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
may be different.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
For example, when you train the data,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
the accuracy will be lower.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Because your data is not high enough.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Sometimes it is because of A,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
sometimes because of B,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
sometimes because of C.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It is impossible to be completely correct.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Just like what you said,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
mind-wandering,

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
we can't control it.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
However,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
when RT becomes longer,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
it becomes quite long.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
For example, 5 seconds.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
If he is thinking about other things

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
for 5 seconds

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
without following our instructions

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
to guide him,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I don't know what to do.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
OK.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
What you see

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
is the real

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
death.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Some trials,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
like what you said,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
may be due to other factors

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
or some miscommunication.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
This part

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
cannot be ruled out.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
OK.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
If your task

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
can separate

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
different things that affect RT,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
your model

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
will be cleaner.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
This is an ideal situation.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Of course,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
we can't cover

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
so many different factors at the same time.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yes.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
So,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
in terms of brain science,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
we often have this problem.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
We can't control what the subject is thinking.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
That's right.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It's a bit awkward.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I have a different idea

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
about brain science.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
OK.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
If you want to

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
throw data to machine learning,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
if there are three reasons,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
whether he wants to sleep

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
or something else,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
your algorithm

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
may be persuaded

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
to identify

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
three different reasons.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
But for whatever reason,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
it will

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
indicate that

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
you are lying.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Isn't that right?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It's possible.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
So, in the end,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
his algorithm

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
can avoid

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
the longer RT time

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
for whatever reason.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I think we should

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
go back to the original question.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
What do you want to detect?

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
For example,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
if you want to promote a policy,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
you want to avoid

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
drowsy driving.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
This whole thing is set up

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
for drowsy driving.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
But later I found that

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
the other important factor

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
that affects their driving

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
is mind-wandering.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Even if you can detect

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
mind-wandering at the same time,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
when you make a policy,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
these two are completely different.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
How do you avoid A and avoid B?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
In the end,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
from the point of view of brain science,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
what happened during that time?

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
That's the reason

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I asked this question.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I think it's possible.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
When you make a machine learning,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
it can identify all patterns

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
as a lack of awareness.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
This is also possible.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Like what

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Yen-Yung mentioned,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
if I use machine learning,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
it will learn

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
the relationship between data.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Then you get

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
an overall

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
influence

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
of R&D.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
I don't know what it is.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
In addition,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
we just

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
discussed that

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
different

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
cognitive

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
phenomena can be

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
disassembled.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
It can be seen independently.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Or there are some interactions

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
between them.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
If

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
we want to

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
use our data

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
to disassemble different

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
cognitive states

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
on this RT,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
in fact,

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
there is no way to

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
just use one experiment.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
It may be necessary to

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
do different experiments

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
to estimate

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
what will happen.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
In our case,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
we try to say

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
that there is only one

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
influence.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
But we can't guarantee.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
If we say that 90% of

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
our trial

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
is based on

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
our imagination,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
because we

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
let it do it

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
after lunch.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
We asked it to

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
drive the highway.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
We hope to

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
let it sleep

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
in this way.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
At least

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
in this process,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
it is closer to

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
what we want it to

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
trigger.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Is that OK?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
My question

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
has been answered.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
OK.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I will talk about

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
this later.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
This is very troublesome.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Many cognitive states

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
do not have a good

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
objective definition.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
In the future,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
whether it is a brain interface

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
or cognitive science,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
this is a big problem.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Let me

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
continue my research.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
OK.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
As I said,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
our brain wave can be

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
divided into different

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
characteristics.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Here I list

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
some of my

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
processing processes.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
EEG will

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
do a

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
re-referencing

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
for different channels.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Here we

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
take

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
the EEG of

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
all channels to

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
reduce their overall average.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
This can remove some

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
impurities.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Then we do

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
bandpass filtering.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
The EEG

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
is limited to

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
50 Hz or less.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Some low frequency

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
waves may

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
come from

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
moving around

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
the device itself.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
We will use

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
1 to 50 Hz

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
or more

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
to filter the EEG

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
and get

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
something that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
really looks like EEG.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
But there are still a lot of artifacts.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Downsampling

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
reduces our computing time.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Then we do

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
subbandpass filtering.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
We divide the EEG

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
into different brainwaves.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Here are some examples.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Fast and slow.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
They are from delta,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
zeta, alpha to beta.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Then we take

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
their energy

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
and do a smoothing.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
We use

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
90-second

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
moving window

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
to smooth

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
the EEG

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
and get our data.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Now we have

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
the brainwave energy

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
and the alertness index.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Now let's

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
compare the two.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
The y-axis

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
represents

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
the EEG energy.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
The x-axis

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
represents the alertness

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
index.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The x-axis

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
is the slow

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
reaction time.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
The y-axis

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
represents the EEG energy.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Here are

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
delta, zeta, alpha, beta.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I have

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
several channels

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
with frontal

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
and central.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Z is the

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
midline.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
The middle of the front,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
the middle of the middle,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
the middle of the parietal,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
and the middle

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
of the parietal.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
In these positions,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
the EEG energy changes

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
in different channels

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
are related to

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
alertness.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Delta is a positive

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
channel. 0.77

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
is a positive channel.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Alpha is a

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
negative channel,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
negative 0.28.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
When

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
alertness decreases,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
the channel

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
will decrease.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
This part

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
has a variability.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Everyone

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
does it every time.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
The relative situation

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
will be different.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Here I use

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
a distribution map

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
with relative

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
details to see

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
the relationship

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
between the brain wave

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
and the alertness.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
The red is the positive channel,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
the blue is the negative channel.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Most of the delta

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
is positive,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
and the beta

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
is negative.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
This graph

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
shows the results

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
of the brain wave and alertness

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
in this experiment.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
This graph

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
will change

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
with time.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
This part is to be discussed first.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
If you take the brain wave

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
to make a frequency map,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
does it have 4 peaks

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
in this alpha,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
beta,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
theta,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
and delta?

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Or is it a smooth

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
continuous frequency map?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
If you

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
look at the frequency,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
it will have

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
1 over f

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
distribution.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
1 over f

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
looks like a

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
decline

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
curve.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
The brain wave

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
has a higher

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
low frequency energy

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
and a lower high frequency energy.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So cutting the alpha, beta,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
theta, delta band

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
is basically just

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
cutting a continuous frequency map

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
into 4 pieces.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Yes, but sometimes

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
there will be some peaks.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Although it is 1 over f,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
the overall distribution is 1 over f.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
We call it

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
pain noise,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
one of the noise.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
But sometimes

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
the overall distribution

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
will have some small peaks.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Because sometimes the brain

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
can have a strong alertness

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
such as alpha.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Alpha is when you close your eyes

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
and especially

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
the back part

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
will start to vibrate

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
about 10 Hz.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
At that time,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
there is a small peak

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
on the curve of

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
1 over f.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
It looks a bit like this.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
What I'm thinking is

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
if your energy spectrum

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
does not have a peak,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
if you cut it into 4 pieces

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
and then divide it into

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
these 4 groups of data

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
to do machine learning,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I don't think it will enhance

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
the effect of machine learning.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Because it may be

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
on the edge of the band

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
that you cut.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
But if you have a peak

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
in alpha today,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
you separate alpha

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and other

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
data to do

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
machine learning training,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I think it will have a more obvious effect.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
That's why I asked this question.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I understand what you mean.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
So if you use

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
some really meaningful band

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
to do

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
machine learning,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
the effect will be

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
better.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Yes, I agree with you.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You must put a lot of

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
impurities into it.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
But because

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
the problem I'm going to solve later is

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
how do I say it?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I can't give up on each one.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Because each one has

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
mutational problems,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
so each one sometimes

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
becomes the best feature

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
that appears on top.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
there's no way

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
to narrow it down

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
to a better feature.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I have to

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
use so many features.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
That's the situation.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
OK, thank you.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
OK.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I'm going to talk about

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
machine learning.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It's a regression problem.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Because I want to

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
predict

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the change of

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
the alertness

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
index.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
It's a continuous value.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The output of the model

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
must be a continuous value.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It must be close to this value.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I just did some

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
processing.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
It's the same here.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Then I put the energy of the brain wave

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and the reaction time

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
recorded by our experiment

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
in the

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
processed alertness

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
index into the model.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Then I train it.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Then I get a

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
regression model.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
It can turn the brain wave

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
into the alertness index we estimated.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
But there's a problem.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I've been talking about it.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Human variability.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
We will

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
divide it into

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
inter-subject or intra-subject.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Inter-subject and subject

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
have some variability.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I want to invite you

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
to do an activity.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
The dancer you see now

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
is teleporting.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Just make a sound.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I can see both sides.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
So you can see this

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
and that.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I can see what I want to see.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I've seen this picture so many times in my life.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But I can only see one side.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
I don't know why.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I really want to see the other side.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Some people see the retrograde

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
and some people see the subject.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Some people want to see

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
what they want to see.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I also

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
want to see the other side.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Then I go to see it.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
It will follow my

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
direction.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
This part is

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
the same stimulus to

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
different people.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Our brain

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
will react differently.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
This is just an example.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It tells you that

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
everyone's brain is different.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Our brain

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
will react differently

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
to the same stimulus

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
at different times.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The brain wave change

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
related to the brain wave

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
is actually the same.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Different people are different.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
A person does the experiment

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
on a different day.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Here I put my data.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I gave an example.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I just said

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
to use the distribution of correlation

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
as a relationship

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
between the brain wave and the alertness

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
of a certain experiment.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Here I have a S5-1,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
which is the fifth subject.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Do the driving experiment.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
The correlation we get is like this.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
There are three reds here.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
From Theta to Alpha

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
to Beta

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
are all positive.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But this is

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
the second time he did it.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The second time he did it.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
We see that it's completely different.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Delta is positive.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
The other three are negative.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Even Alpha is negative.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
If we use his first experiment

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
to train our model,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
we will find that

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
the effect will be very poor

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
the second time.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
But we did a lot of experiments.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
We recorded a lot of people.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
For example, the 41st subject

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
when he did it for the fifth time,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
he had this pattern.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
It's very similar to subject 5.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
So different people

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
have similar reactions

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
on the brain wave we want to look at.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
If so,

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I can take the data

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
of subject 41

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
for the fifth time

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
to train a model.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
If we use it for the second time

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
of subject 5,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
the effect will be very good.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Of course, this is what we can do

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
after the test.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
This session is very similar to this session.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
But we can't

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
When subject 5

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
comes, we have a way

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
to know that we want to use

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
the model of subject 41 to give it.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
That is a

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
engineering challenge

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
or a scientific challenge.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
How do we do this?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I want to ask a question.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Sorry.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I want to ask a question.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
The time they do the experiment

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
is probably fixed.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Like you said, after lunch.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
The time

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
is probably fixed.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Yes.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
This looks

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
a bit like

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
the problem I just mentioned.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
There may be different factors.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
The brain activity

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
between different sessions

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
may be different.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Yes.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
For example,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
if you want to measure drowsiness,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
your second session of subject 5

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
is similar.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Yes.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
In other words,

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
if you can have another task

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
or a subjective report

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
to verify

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
what happened in each session,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
you may be able to

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
go back and say that

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
this brain wave is more like

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
A or B or C.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Yes, this is what I want to do.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Is there anything else

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
we can measure

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
faster?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Then we can know

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
that this should be

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
similar to the previous session.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Then we can use it.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Next,

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
I will develop this.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
OK.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
The actual operation may be more complicated than this.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
In other words,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
my brain activity of drowsiness

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
is similar to

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
your brain activity of mind wandering.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
There is a relationship between

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
brain state and brain state.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
It may be like this.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Everyone may have a different brain state.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Of course,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I have a brain state

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
corresponding to

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
the brain activity of mind.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
But it doesn't mean

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
that everyone's brain state

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
is similar.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I don't know.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That may be the actual difficulty.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It feels like it can be done.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Of course,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
it's good.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
But we can't

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
analyze other factors

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
in this experiment.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It's a pity.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Next,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I will deal with

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
the relationship

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
in a data-driven way.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
OK. Thank you.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I have a question.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
This page.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I want to ask

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
about the black dots

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
on the image.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
The black dots are the

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
corresponding probes

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
of the hat.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
But the hat is actually

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
a spatial distribution of the sphere.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
It's not a flat 2D circle.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Yes.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
How did you

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
project the image

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
from the spatial distribution of the sphere

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
to the image you drew now?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Or is it just a visual image?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Do you preserve

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
the distance between each dot?

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Is it a specific

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
projection like a map?

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Or do you arrange it one by one?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
This value

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
is only used in visualization.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
So if the relationship is distorted,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
it won't affect much.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Because I...

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
You only take

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
exactly the position above.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
OK.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Like this is 30 channels.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
So I only have those 30

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
channels of data.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And what happens in the middle?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
That's all visualizations.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
They are inserted

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
and projected.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I want to tell you about this.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
What I was thinking is

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
if you process the data like this

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
and then throw it away,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
it sounds like you will re-weight

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
the effect of each data.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
And it may smear

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
what's physically happening in your brain.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I don't know what you mean.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
OK.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
This is purely visualization.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
OK. Thank you.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Like you said, some people

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
use mapping as data.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And I don't like it.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Because it's like a problem.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
So we just talked about

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
how to find

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
a model that is similar to

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
the new people in the database.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
What's the advantage of this?

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We call it Subject Transfer.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
It transfers the model

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
from one person to another.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
The advantage is that

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
we used to say

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
we try to collect

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
each person's data,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
brainwaves and behaviors.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
We try to collect more data

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
to build a model.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
We believe that it will have a good performance

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
for the same person.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
We call it Self-Decoding.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Because of some variability,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
it often fails.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
So we want to use

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Subject Transfer.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
We use a small amount of data

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
as an indicator,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
as a brain signature.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Then we can

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
find a suitable model

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
from our database

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
and use it.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Then we can start

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
to detect

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
its alertness level.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
What should we use

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
for this

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
relatively small amount of data?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
What I'm talking about

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
is

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Baseline Activity.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Baseline Activity

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
is a standard state.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Baseline Activity

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
can also be called

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Task Activity

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
or Task Free Activity.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
It means that

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
this subject is not doing anything

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and it has nothing to do with your task.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Then the brain activity at that time.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
In the past, there were many studies

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
to see

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
when the brain was not doing anything,

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
the brain's

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
existing activities

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and the specific activities

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
after you really gave it a task.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Is there any connection?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
On the brain wave,

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
we found that

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
from RESTing data,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
you use ICA

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
to look at

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
some

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
decomposed

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
component activity.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Then you can use that

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
to help it in the action

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
imagination of this specific task.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
You can find it

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
from RESTing data

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
to find out the pattern

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
of its action imagination.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
When a person is not doing

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
action imagination,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
his data can tell you

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
what his pattern looks like

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
when he is doing action imagination.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
In addition, there is RESTing data

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
to predict

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
the performance of the brain interface.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Because not everyone

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
can master

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
how to use the brain interface.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
RESTing data

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
can tell you

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
if this person is suitable for using the brain interface.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Another study

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
is from RESTing.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
This is MRI data,

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
fMRI data.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
It predicts

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
from RESTing fMRI

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
that under a specific

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
cognitive task,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
the activation mapping is like this.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
There is a lot of evidence

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
that your RESTing

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
data and your

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
task data

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
are related.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Back to

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
how we choose the right model,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I thought

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
if we use a small piece of RESTing data,

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
we can find the right model

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
for the new person.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Here I think

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I have a lot of models

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
from the past

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
experiments.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I have built a lot of models.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
The new person

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
is called Target Subject.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Then we record a baseline.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
This is recorded

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
in the alert situation.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
That is to say,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
this person

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
in our

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
simulation driving

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
simulation car

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
is not moving,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
he is not turning the steering wheel,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
he is not doing anything,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
the car is moving forward,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
he doesn't have to do anything,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
the data during that time,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
we treat it as a brain signature.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
We use this to estimate

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
who is more like

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
the new person

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
and the model in the original database.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
We do a sequence

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
for this model,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
and then do a fusion,

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
which is to combine those models

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
and outputs together.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Finally, we do a recalibration,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
because sometimes

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
there are some offsets.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Finally,

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
we can give this subject

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
to estimate his alertness.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Any questions?

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Can you explain

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
the pairing process again?

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
OK.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
How do you find

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
a person

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
to pair with

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
a car make a session?

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
OK.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I have

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
a backup slide here.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
For the new person,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I will have his baseline data.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
It is

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
his energy in different

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
bands and in different locations.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
We use this to compare

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
the data of all other people

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
in my database.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Then I estimate his similarity.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I use this similarity

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
to assume that

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
if he is

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
in the baseline state,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
the pattern of these two people is similar,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
then I believe

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
their EEG alertness

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
model will be very similar.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
That's how I do it.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
OK.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
In other words,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
you just showed us

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
a session.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
According to this model,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
their default baseline

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
activity should be very similar.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Yes.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
OK.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Thank you.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
I have a post-trial analysis here.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
In other words,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
we use baseline activity

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
to predict the similarity.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Is it really their similarity?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
The real similarity here

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
is that I put

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
a model of a person

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
and a session

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
to use the data of another person.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Then look at their

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
performance afterwards.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
There is a real similarity

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
offline.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I also use baseline activity

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
to estimate their

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
subject-subject similarity.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Then I predict

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
the performance

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I can get.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I found that these two things

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
are quite similar.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
You can see a correspondence here.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It's actually the same as what I predicted.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
There is an accuracy here.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
If I use this,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I can do what I just did.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
It means that at least

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
part of my assumption is correct.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Because of this,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
we can look at

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
our prediction

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
results.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
The black line here

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
is the change of time

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
in the entire experiment.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
It's a black line.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
The result we predict

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
is to get close to this black line.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
We can see that

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
the relevant details of different

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
curves can express

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
how accurate we predicted.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
The blue part here

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
is the traditional way.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Each subject uses

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
the data he has recorded

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
to train a model

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
to look at his prediction results.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
The red line is

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
the method I just mentioned.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
We look at a small section

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
of baseline activity.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
We use other people's models

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
to predict his alertness.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You can see that

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
on this example,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
red is better than black.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
This is their curve.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
They are related to

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
the actual ground truth here.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
On this example,

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
the method

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
of subject transfer

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
is slightly better.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I have a small question.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
This concept

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
is like a donation, right?

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
If you can

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
find a group of people

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
whose genotype

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
or model

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
is similar to yours,

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
can you use this method

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
to match

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
their data?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Yes.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
OK.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
In other words,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
you can only do

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
a few hours.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
If you use this method,

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
you can use

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
an infinite amount of data.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
If you recruit a lot of people,

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
a lot of people can match.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
The data pool will keep increasing.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
That's right.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Thank you.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
I have a question.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
The picture in the front page

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
is the actual.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
No, the next page.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Yes, the next page.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
This is

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
a different way

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
to do it.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Now you draw a line.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
But if

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
you divide your data

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
a little bit,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
it's a bit like

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
repeating the same thing

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
500 or 1000 times.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Your prediction

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
will be a little bit different every time.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Then you can put your

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
red line into a red band.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Do you know what I mean?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
There is an error.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Yes, the range of the band

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
is basically

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
the range of uncertainty

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
of your model.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
OK.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
So every time you run,

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
it will be a little different.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
Did you hear that?

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
So every time you run,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
it will be a little different.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Yes, so I'm curious.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Except for the line you show now,

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
the uncertainty

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
behind each line

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
may not be the same.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
For example,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
predictability is particularly good

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
in this specific case.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
It may actually be fluctuate up.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
But the band is actually very wide.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
So it may not be particularly good.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Oh.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
This is a good question.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Because usually

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
if you plot this prediction,

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
you will plot 95% confidence interval.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
He is actually talking about this thing.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
You should plot this thing out.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
OK, got it.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Yes.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
But I see that it's a lot.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I probably feel that

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
there should be nothing to argue about.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It should be effective.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
But if it's very close,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I'll be more curious.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
This is better than that.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I might want to see the error bar.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Oh, got it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yes, this is good.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I should be able to put that

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
confidence interval

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
in as well.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Because I just want to compare

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
their correlation.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Then I just draw the line.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So if I draw the curve,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I can have a better

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
better than

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
better

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
measure to see

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
their performance.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Yes, that's what I think.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Because I think if you have an error bar,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
you can clearly say this is better, this is worse.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Yes, but

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
if you just want to show features,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
it looks like they all work.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And they all work pretty good.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I think.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
OK, got it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Because the way I compare here

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
is that every time

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I go to see the correlation

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
of different methods.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And for different people,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I compare their correlation

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
and then

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
conclude which method

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
is better.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
This is my current approach.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It's simpler,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
but it might not be the best.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Hello?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Yes, if we have a better

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'll ask you again.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
OK.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
We can discuss later.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
OK, thank you.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
OK, I'll continue.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
OK, so just now

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I used the correlation to see

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
different methods

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
and their overall performance.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Here I just put all

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
the subjects I tested

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
together.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Just now Shaoming mentioned

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
that my data increase

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
will be good.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So I went to test

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
if the size of my database

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
just now

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
is different.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The way I did it

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
is that I cut off

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
some data

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
from my database.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Randomly cut off some data

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
and use the subject as a unit.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I'll see if my method performance

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
will increase

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
when the subject increases.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Y-axis is the average

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
correlation coefficient.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Blue is the traditional method.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Use your own data

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
to train a model.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Red is our

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
method of subject transfer.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Grey is the same

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
subject transfer, but without

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
our baseline activity

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
to choose those models.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You can see that

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
our method

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
will increase

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
when the size increases.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But if you don't use

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
the baseline correction,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
it will be a little worse.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
A little worse.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Then continue to talk about

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
the next picture.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I will compare

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
if we do this,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
will the calibration time be reduced?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Traditionally, you have to

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
record your own data.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
If we want to record

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
the alertness to become drowsy,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
it takes a long time.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Traditionally, it takes a long time

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
to get the data you need.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
This will cause

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
a long calibration time.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Our new method is to

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
use baseline activity.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It's easy to get baseline activity.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Just don't move.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Less than two minutes of data

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
The past method

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
is about 18 minutes.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
There is no difference.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
My conclusion

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
is that I can reduce it

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
from 18 minutes to

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
less than two minutes.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
In terms of calibration reduction,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
subject transfer can give us this effect.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
In this case,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
we really need to use our brain

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
to predict alertness.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
It will be much better

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
if we use our brain to

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
predict alertness.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
There is another question

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
that people often ask.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
This hat looks like this.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
No one wants to wear it.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Is there a better way

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
to measure our brain?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I was thinking

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
that when we measure our brain,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
hair is a big problem.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
If we avoid hair,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
we can use some simple devices.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
We can also use

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
these sensors

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
on our skin.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
If we can use these

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
to measure our brain,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
more people will be willing to use it.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You don't have to damage your hair.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
It won't be uncomfortable.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I tested that

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
if I only use the front ear and

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
these channels next to the ear,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
there are only six channels.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Can I use these six channels

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
to make a comparison

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
with the two heads

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
with 32 channels?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I found that

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
if you only use the channels

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
without hair,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the classification accuracy

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
can be the same

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
as the classification

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
with all channels.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
There is no significant difference.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So we can actually

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
use the BCI

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
on alertness

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
or these channels

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
with no hair.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
This way,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
our device can be more convenient.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Here are some problems

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
that we need to solve

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
when we really want to use it.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The first one is

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
to reduce the calibration time

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
by using subject transferring.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Here we verify that

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
we don't need to use so many channels.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
We can do this

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
with only one channel.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Here is a demonstration

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
of how our future

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
system will work.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
We just mentioned

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
that we use response time

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
as a ground truth

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
for our alertness.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
To be more precise,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I plan to use the distribution

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
of response time

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
as alertness

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
to define our alertness.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
So if your distribution is shorter

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and the peak

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
is shorter,

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the y-axis is

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
the response time

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and the unit is the second.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So if this is a very narrow distribution,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
it is a better alertness.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
If the distribution

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
is very wide,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
it is easier to have

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
a longer response time,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
which is a bad alertness,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
and then

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
here is

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
a demonstration

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
that my black line

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
is my now,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
and then I use

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
the previous

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
brainwave data

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
to predict that

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
from now on to 90 seconds,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the distribution of

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
response time

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
is a

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
thing that

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
will change

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
over time.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Then

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
when this time

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
passes, I can use some

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
offline tests

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
to see

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
if my response time

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
really falls

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
at a relatively high rate.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
These white dots

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
are the response time

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
that we draw

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
based on

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
this, and you can play it a little bit.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
OK, so you can see

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
that now this is

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
its distribution is

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
narrower, so the color here is

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
also more obvious, and then this is

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
the response time we actually recorded.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It is easier to fall

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
within this range,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
in a better state of

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
alertness, and then

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
as time goes by, we can see that

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
this person's

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
distribution keeps drifting

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and then finally becomes wider,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
which means that

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
he is not in a good condition.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I'm starting to

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
sleep.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Like this,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
it's

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
like this,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
it's

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
like this,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
its distribution has become wider,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
and then this side is also blurred.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Then you can also see that

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
there are some

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
long response times,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
which means that

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
our prediction is roughly

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
real data

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
to verify that this prediction

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
is correct.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
It will keep going.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
This is a bit

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
like a weather forecast,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
we go to its learnings to make a forecast.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Does anyone have any questions here?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Sorry, this forecast is

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
a few seconds ago, I might have missed it.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
OK, this black line is now,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
so I'm going forward

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
to predict 90 seconds,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and within 90 seconds, its probability distribution is here.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Yes, so let's see

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
that I predicted like this in the front,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
and then the real response time

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
is it just below the one I just predicted?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
OK, OK.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
This is the distribution I just predicted.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Then I

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
plan to continue

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
to do it.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I hope that this thing can really

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
be used in

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
many applications.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
In addition to driving,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
many jobs that require

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
attention and focus

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
may be able to use this thing.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
In addition, I also want to

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
use this thing to see

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
if there is a way to

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
actually see if our brain

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
uses

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
the change of

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
learning

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
to see if it has anything to do

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
with learning.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Or we can look at

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
ADHD or other

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
more specific people,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
are they different

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
from normal people

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
in this part of

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
learning?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Take learning as a tool

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
to see if

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
different groups

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
have different differences.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
I would like to thank

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
many people and the lab

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and my funding is mainly

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
sponsored by Lu Jun.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Thank you all.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Thank you, thank you.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And applause, great.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Do you have any questions?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You can ask now.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Questions.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
There are some comments.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
The first one is a small question.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You said it was sponsored by Lu Jun,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
is it the United States?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
The project sponsored by

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Lu Jun in the United States.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I'm just curious.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Are you an American?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
No,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
this project

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
is not sensitive.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So it can

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
have a project

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
with many schools

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
to help Lu Jun do things.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
He donated money to many schools

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
to help him do things.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
This project mainly wants to

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
look at the brain interface

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
and how to use

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
sound science

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
in some situations.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I see.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
At least in physics

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
or astronomy,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
if there is

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
military sponsorship,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
they usually have a lot of

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
work to do.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Who is your nationality?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
What is your nationality?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
What is your background?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Yes, they have a lot of projects

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
that require citizenship.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
The unit that gave us the money

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
requires you to be a citizen

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
to work there.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Even PR is not allowed.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I see.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I have something

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
that I find interesting.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I think

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
if I were to do something

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
in the future,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
for example,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
this person has started to hallucinate.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
We all have this experience.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You sit next to a co-driver

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
and the driver starts to hallucinate.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
You say, hey, don't sleep.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But the idiot

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
wakes up and brakes.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It's actually very dangerous.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
So I think

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
the reaction of Awakening

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
to make this whole thing

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
a complete and useful thing

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
is a very important part, I think.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Yes, well said.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yes, we also saw

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
that if it was

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
during sleep,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
we used sound to wake him up

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
to see if it was useful

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
after waking him up.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But we didn't really see

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
what you said.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Braking randomly.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Yes, but I think it's possible.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Yes, it's possible.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Yes.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
That's my suggestion.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I have two questions.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Okay, I have two questions.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The first question is

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
related to your hardware.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You mentioned that

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
if you only use a few channels

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
without covering the hair,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
the effect is the same.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Do you use dry electrodes

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
to measure signals?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
In my research,

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
I use the same electrodes

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
for all of them.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
They're all wet electrodes.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I just look at the results

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
from different locations.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Because I have to compare,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I still use the same method

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
to measure.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Because I actually

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
went to San Diego a few years ago

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
and he showed us

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
his lab

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
using the dry electrodes

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
for baseball caps.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Baseball caps?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Baseball caps are the most primitive form.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
But they mainly

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
turn electrodes into dry electrodes

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
so they don't need to be covered.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
So I'm curious

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
about your current experiment.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Is there anyone

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
still using dry electrodes?

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Or most of them are still covered?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
In fact, dry electrodes

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
are becoming more and more popular.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Because people find it useful.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
It takes less time.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
subjects like it more.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
But it's not necessarily more comfortable.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Because dry electrodes

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
usually need

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
some special design

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
on the hair

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
to pass through the hair.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
So a lot of dry electrodes

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
make some corners,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
deep corners,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
and longer hair.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So it's not comfortable to wear for a long time.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So I specialize in

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
the part without hair

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
because there are a lot of

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
choices for the sensor

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
because it doesn't need to deal with hair problems.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And for the

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
adhesive type,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
it's better for

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
long-term measurement.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Because most people

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
wear dry electrodes

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and they start to feel pain

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
after a few hours.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Okay.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
My second question

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
is a bit of a disaster question.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Most of the BCAAs I've seen

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
are taken signals from the brain

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and transmitted to the computer

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
for related processing

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
or other applications.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
But is it possible that

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
in the future, or is there anyone

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
who is already doing it?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
It's a bit like the opposite.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
So the BCAAs are being taken signals

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and transmitted to the human brain

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
to try to manipulate human behavior.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Yes.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
There are a few non-BCAAs.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I'm talking about non-BCAAs

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
because BCAAs are directly

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
transmitted to the computer.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Non-BCAAs

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
have a kind of TMS,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
which is a pass-through magnetic field.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
It uses a very strong magnetic field

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
to try to

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
trigger

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
brain activity

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
in a certain area.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
At the moment,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
we know

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
that

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
the doctor

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
can look for

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
the magnetic field

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
in a certain area

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and your hand will move.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
this thing

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
hasn't been

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
fully studied.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So what changes

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
can it cause?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
There is not much

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
relevant evidence at the moment.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
So it's still under development.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Can I say something?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Yes.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Someone in our lab has done this.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I haven't done it myself.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
But basically,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
it's close to a one-to-one response.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
For example, if you stimulate

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
the visual cortex,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
some people will see crossfade,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
which is a flash.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
As mentioned earlier,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
if you stimulate the motor,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
it will move in a certain area.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
You can find out which finger moves.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
For example, if you stimulate a certain area,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
it will map out

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
which finger moves.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
For hearing,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
relatively few people

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
have done it.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
For example, compared to EEG or MRI,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
a group of people

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
have been doing TMS research.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
There are also TDCS, TACS, etc.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Do you have any other questions?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I'm going to ask a question.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Wait a minute.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I don't have a question.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I just want to say

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I want to stop recording.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
But you can

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
continue.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
