00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello everyone, I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.

00:09.000 --> 00:23.000
We are very honored to invite Zhang Fengxun today. He is currently a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Michigan University.

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
His current major is Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, and has recently been renamed Sustainable Development Studies.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
Before coming to the United States as a doctoral candidate, Fengxun studied in the Department of Insectology at the University of Taiwan.

00:39.000 --> 01:00.000
He wrote a small paragraph about his own self-introduction. He is a community ecologist.

01:00.000 --> 01:16.000
What he wants to understand is the interaction between species and the environment in which we humans exist.

01:16.000 --> 01:26.000
In addition to ecology, he likes comedy, baseball, his home, and Taiwan.

01:26.000 --> 01:45.000
Today's speech is different from the past, because we think that in addition to sharing his own research points and results, we hope that he can share more information.

01:45.000 --> 01:56.000
Of course, we are very fortunate that Fengxun attended this year's annual meeting of the American Ecological Association a few weeks ago.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
The annual meeting of the American Ecological Association is one of the largest in the world and attended by many people.

02:01.000 --> 02:15.000
From his point of view, what important information is there at this year's annual meeting, and what breakthroughs are there in this area that are worth highlighting?

02:15.000 --> 02:28.000
Let's welcome Fengxun with a round of applause.

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
Fengxun is not a formal Chinese name, but deals with issues such as sustainable development.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
What is special about our association is that it is not the same as the ecological association we are familiar with.

03:03.000 --> 03:14.000
Generally, the ecological association is based on basic science. We want to know the cause of a phenomenon, the evolution of species, and so on.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
However, our association now thinks that we only understand these things, which is like being in an academic ivory tower.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
In fact, this is not helpful for the development of ecology, so they think we should solve the problem more actively.

03:29.000 --> 03:40.000
That is to say, how do we solve the problem of applying the ecological theory we already know to the major changes in the environment that we humans are facing now?

03:40.000 --> 03:52.000
Or how do we make these relatively terrible extreme climates and other phenomena less common or milder?

03:53.000 --> 04:16.000
This is my background, and what I want to share with you today is that I went to the US Ecological Annual Conference two weeks ago to participate in the conference.

04:16.000 --> 04:31.000
I would like to share with you what I have seen, what I have played, and what I have thought.

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
I would like to introduce ESA, which stands for Ecology Society of America.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
In fact, each country has its own ecological association, and Taiwan also has one.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
However, ESA's annual meeting should be the largest in the world.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
This year, more than 4,000 people participated in the conference.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
I also went to talk to people after the conference.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I asked them about the situation in Europe.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
They said it was much smaller, maybe less than 2,000 people.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
This is the biggest conference in the world, and I think it is also the most complete conference in terms of discussion issues.

05:18.000 --> 05:29.000
The disadvantage is that there are too many people, and you can't get to know everyone, and you can't have a very in-depth conversation with everyone.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
So if your social skills are not good, you will be like me for a long time and don't know what to do.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I can only find someone to talk to.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
So it's a good opportunity to practice talking to people.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
This is a side effect.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Anyway, this is ESA's brief introduction.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
I went to the conference two weeks ago.

05:54.000 --> 06:03.000
Because I don't really know what everyone's background is, I will first introduce what ecology is.

06:03.000 --> 06:23.000
If you google ecology or go directly to wiki, they will tell you that this is a choice between biological interaction and biological organism interaction with the environment.

06:23.000 --> 06:36.000
In short, I want to learn how two organisms interact, including how we grab food, how we eat each other, how we help each other, and how the environment affects our relationship with each other.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
All the discussions about this are ecological issues.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
I don't think anyone will know what I'm talking about, because it's too abstract.

06:46.000 --> 06:59.000
So when we talk about ecology, we immediately think of the existence of hierarchy.

06:59.000 --> 07:14.000
Just like when we were in high school, we learned that the human body is made up of cells, and the cells make up the tissues, and the tissues make up the organs, the circulatory system, and the individual.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
So in fact, ecology has a similar hierarchy.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
From the smallest organism, which is a biological individual, to the vast majority of these biological organisms, which you can see in the picture below.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
This should be a geoduck, I don't know what to draw.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Then with a group of geoducks, they are all the same, a group of geoducks.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Then it becomes a population ecology.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
Then if you go up, in addition to this geoduck, there may be geoducks, snakes, eagles, other animals, trees, grass.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
There are different kinds of animals living in the same time and space.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
This forms a community, a group.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
In short, many kinds of animals live in the same place.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
This is called a community ecology.

08:08.000 --> 08:19.000
If we enlarge the scope a little more, for example, we want to know that in addition to so many kinds of animals, where do they get the energy they need?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Where do their excrements go?

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
What kind of changes did their excrements make to the non-biological environment?

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Then it becomes an ecosystem.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
An ecosystem is a system.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
The whole thing, biological and non-biological, all come together and become an ecosystem.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Then there are people studying ecosystem ecology.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Then to a bigger point is the biosphere.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
I think this is a whole planet.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
It's not a very meaningful classification.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
But if you insist on expanding, it becomes a whole planet.

09:00.000 --> 09:09.000
Then these levels, each level has its own questions to explore.

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
For example, people who study individual creatures will want to know how a creature grows.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
How do I react to the environment and so on?

09:24.000 --> 09:33.000
Then the population ecology of the ecosystem is that I want to know why this species is sometimes more and sometimes less.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
For example, the evaluation of fish resources is one of the important parts of the population ecology.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
For example, in Taiwan, I want to know how many fish I can catch this year.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
When should I catch it? When should I not catch it?

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
This is the question that the population ecology has to answer.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
The community ecology is like I just said.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Different interactions between different species.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
So the most critical question is why there are so many species in the world.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
How do so many species live together in this world?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Then it becomes so many species on the Internet.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
What impact does the environment of non-living things in this world have?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
This is the ecosystem ecology.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
This is roughly the hierarchy in ecology.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
I identify myself as a community slash a little ecosystem ecologist.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
What I'm interested in is that I want to know how each species interacts with each other.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
What impact do they have on the environment?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Or to be more direct with people.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
There are many species in this system or in this natural environment.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
What impact does it have on me?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
What does it matter to me?

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Then talk about community ecology or ecosystem ecology.

11:04.000 --> 11:11.000
A question that everyone will ask is why there are so many species in this world.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
This is a very, very old question.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
It's also very old and very important.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
It's also a question that we haven't answered in 100 years.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Because from the very beginning of 19

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
I want to explain why there are so many species of people.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
I have written here that it is Brunel.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
Then I put a table on the right for everyone to see.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
When we want to answer this question,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
I want to know why there are so many species.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
What is the evolution of ecologists' ideas from the past to the present?

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
In short, I think it can be divided into two periods.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
The first period.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
The reason I'm talking about this now is because this question is very difficult to answer.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
And it's also very important.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
So now a lot of ecological research is actually inseparable from

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
The most fundamental question I'm asking now.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Why are there so many species?

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Then when we answer this question,

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
For ancient ecologists,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
The way we try to answer is

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I think it's a turnip, a pit, this method.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
In other words, how many resources can be used in the world?

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
Or how many niches can be occupied by species?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Then we should have seen so many species.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
So including Grinnell, including Elton,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
These are all very famous ecologists.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
They all proposed various ideas about niches or ecological hypocrisy.

12:55.000 --> 13:01.000
I will not explain their ideas one by one.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
In short, the concept of this niche is a turnip, a pit.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Until about 2000,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
The previous idea was that a turnip, a pit.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
At most, the environment changes.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Then create different turnip pits.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
So there are different species.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Sometimes the turnip pit is big, sometimes the turnip pit is small.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
The density of species will be high.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
The density of species will be low, etc.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
So different species can coexist together.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Until about 2000,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
There was a man named Steve Hoppe.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I don't know what his idea was.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
But he proposed a theory.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
There is no turnip, a pit.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Everything is random.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
He proposed a neutral theory.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
We see so many species.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Is it because of a random phenomenon?

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
The most classic example is that he took a long-term experimental observation station.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Then he went to study the changes in the composition of the species in the experimental observation station, etc.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Then he found that he could use a random model.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Make a random mathematical model.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
You can predict the changes in the composition of long-term species.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
The prediction is not bad.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Then he proposed a theory.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
There are so many species in the world.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's not a turnip, a pit.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
There is a big species pool over there.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
In this species pool,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
ABCD may appear this year.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
EFGH appeared this year.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
ABEH appeared the following year.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
He went on like this.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
After this neutral theory was proposed,

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
everyone thought that we had been faking for almost 100 years.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
So there was another man named Peter Chesson.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
The fourth bullet point.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
He proposed another theory.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
We call it Modern Coexistence Theory.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
He proposed this theory.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Under this framework,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
neutral theory is just a special case under this framework.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
In other words, Peter Chesson's framework

15:15.000 --> 15:24.000
includes the theories we know so far.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
He wanted to make a big framework

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
to tell us that different communities, different natural environments,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
we will see different species.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Because there are different mechanisms behind it.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
So he proposed a fluctuation-independent mechanism.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
The first part of his modern theory is that

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
when the environment has reached a balance,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
how many species will exist here

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
determines how much the resources used by these species are different

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
compared to the ability of their resources to interact.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
How much difference does their ability make?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
This is called stabilizing.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
For example,

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
if I love to eat apples and he loves to eat oranges,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
then I will eat my apples well,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
and he will eat his oranges well.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
If not, we can coexist in this world without any problems.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
Then the concept of using different resources

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
is called stabilizing.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Another one is that we both love to eat apples,

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
but my speed of eating apples is about the same speed as yours.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
So we fight fiercely.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I take a bite, you take another bite.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I take another bite, you take another bite.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
So we keep fighting each other.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
So no one can kill each other.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
So we can coexist in this world very tightly.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
This is a mechanism of equalizing.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Under this framework,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
the neutral theory I just mentioned

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
is an extreme state of equalizing.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Everyone is the same.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
No one can kill another person.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So there are a bunch of species in this world

17:13.000 --> 17:20.000
fighting each other here.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
So far,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
everyone seems to be a little satisfied.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I think it's not bad.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
We can use this big framework

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
to explain why we can see so many different species.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
But in fact,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
current ecologists

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
can't understand these theories of Jason.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
On the one hand,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
it seems that we are enough here.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
We just need to know

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
that everyone fights each other fiercely,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
or that everyone uses different resources.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
You can explain

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
why there are different species here

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
and then continue to extend.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
But when some current theoretical ecologists

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
continue to dig Jason's framework,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
they will find that there is actually another mechanism,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
which is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism.

18:15.000 --> 18:23.000
The reason why this mechanism allows species to coexist

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
is because it feels that the environment is constantly changing.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
So the system can't reach a balance

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
or is on the way to a balance.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
So since we are still in a state

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
where the environment is constantly changing,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
what we know now

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
is that when we see these species,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
we can't use these theories

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
that we have obtained

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
in a balanced state

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
to explain why we see these now.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Of course, this is difficult

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
because we don't know

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
whether the natural environment we live in

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
has reached a balance

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
or has not reached a balance.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
So I think this is a big question.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
This is also the first thing I saw

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
and I think it may be a topic

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
that many ecologists will start to study in the future.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
How to quantify a system

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
has it reached a balance

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
or has it not reached a balance?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
If it has not reached a balance,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
it is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
How do we quantify these mechanisms?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
How do we use these mechanisms

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
to explain how many different creatures

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
I see in this system now?

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
In the fluctuation-dependent mechanism,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
the main core is that

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
the environment is constantly changing.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
So when the environment is constantly changing,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
if I like low resources,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I can live a good life.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
When in low resources,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I can find a way to get rid of people.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Another person may be

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
when in high resources,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
he will find a way to get rid of me.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But because the environment is constantly changing,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
we have to

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
adapt to the environment.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
This is the concept.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It's not like what I eat,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
what you eat,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
and stay in a very stable state.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Now the environment is changing,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
and we have our own density.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
There may also be feedback back to the environment.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
This is the storage effect

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
If you are interested,

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't know if you are interested.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
If you are interested, you can go and see

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
this paper I wrote.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I think he wrote it very well.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Then there is a sentence

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
in a relatively flat language

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
that tells us what the whole

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Coexistence Theory is talking about.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I'll give you an example here.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
What is a fluctuation-dependent mechanism?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
This paper is also a good one.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Sorry, the resolution is not very good.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
This is a new paper that came out recently.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
In this paper,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
he wants to prove one thing.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Storage effect and relative non-linearity

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
These two fluctuation-dependent mechanisms

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
is the reason for the coexistence of two species.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
You can see panel A and B.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
Different colors represent the density of different species.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Yellow is one, blue is another.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Then the background is either white or light,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
or gray represents the richness of resources.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
The background is dark or light,

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
which represents the richness of resources.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So we can see from panel A and panel B,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
when there is less resource,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
it is not so dark.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Yellow wins.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
On the other hand, when it's darker,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
in panel C,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
blue wins.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
But when we get to panel D,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
he deliberately adds resources in that system.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
Sometimes this system has a lot of resources,

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
and then sometimes he takes the resources away,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
and then he adds resources and takes them away.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
It creates a human-made fluctuation.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
When we see a human-made fluctuation,

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
yellow and blue can coexist.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
No one can eliminate anyone.

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
For example, this is the first real experiment proof.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Of course, everyone does this kind of experiment.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
But this paper has a special point.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
In addition to telling you that you can really coexist,

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
it really uses a mathematical model to really quantify

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
how much storage effect I can have,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
how much relative non-inheritance.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
So let everyone know that there are really two kinds of

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
environmental changes

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
that allow species to coexist.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It's not just that we want to say,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
because of environmental change,

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
everyone has different levels of resources,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
so of course we can coexist.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
This kind of verbal argument is right.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
So this is the first one.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
I think it's a pretty eye-opening study.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Then at the seminar,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I also saw a few talks,

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
so I tried to quantify

23:47.000 --> 23:52.000
why species can coexist in changing environments,

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
and what is the mechanism behind their coexistence.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Is everyone suitable for different environments?

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
Or is the environment I affect affecting me?

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
This is the first highlight I saw at this conference.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
I have a question.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
So you're showing this now,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
for example, there are two species of yellow and blue.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yellow and blue species.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Both of them have a feature,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
which is that you can see the peak at each point.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
That is, the slope is very large.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
So it means that these two species themselves

24:34.000 --> 24:41.000
have a very small response time scale to change.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Maybe less than a day.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
But if you look at the D-panel in the lower right corner,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
it's like external excitation.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
That is, their environment changes,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
their scale is ten days, five days,

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
a few days, a few days, a few days.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
That's the width of black and white.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
So the time scale of the species system

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
and the time scale of excitation are very different.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
So you can see this phenomenon very clearly.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
But if today the species must use

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
about the same time,

25:19.000 --> 25:25.000
or even longer, to respond to external excitation,

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
then the whole model will fail.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Because it may not have time to reach the next state.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
The environment has changed again,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and then it will collapse in the end.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
It's a mess.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Yes, it's possible.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
So what I'm talking about now,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
this fluctuation-dependent thing,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
is actually what you're talking about.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
It's a relative concept.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
If the environment is changing,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
it must be fluctuation-dependent.

25:49.000 --> 25:57.000
It can be said that my own life cycle is very short.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
So even if the environment changes once a year,

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I have already given birth dozens of times a year.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Yes, I have reproduced dozens of times.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
So the change in the environment is meaningless to me.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
So I just said that in a system,

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
now we want to answer this question.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Ecologists,

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
the first difficult point is

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
that we have to identify the change in the environment

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
for the life cycle of my species.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
In terms of life cycle,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
is it dependent or independent?

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
If it is dependent,

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
if it is fluctuation-dependent,

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
we can then ask

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
which mechanism is it?

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Does this answer your question?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Oh, thank you.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Yes.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Okay,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
next, like I just said,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
this is a very old question.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It's so old that

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
some people don't want to answer this question anymore.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
So everyone started to ask this question

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
in another way.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Now there are so many species in this environment.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
So then,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
the question just answered is

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
why does this environment

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
allow me to see so many species?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But now,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
everyone may find it boring,

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
so ask it the other way around.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
So many species,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
what impact will it have on this environment?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
This question

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
or this question

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
is actually not something that happened recently,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
but it suddenly became obvious.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
It probably started in the late 1990s.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
There was a person in Europe

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
who did a project called Ecotron.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
In other words,

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
it's probably like...

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
I don't know if everyone knows

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
that there is a kind of...

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Give you a glass ball,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and then there is grass inside.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
There are different kinds of grass,

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
and then there are some moss,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
something wet,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
like a planet.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Ecotron is very similar to that concept.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
It's a microcosm.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Their idea is that

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
the more species there are in this microcosm,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
the more biomass I will see.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
I can see the more creatures in it.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
It started this

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning Branch.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Biodiversity

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
How does it affect the function of this system?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Function means

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
what is the production volume of this system?

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
How efficient is this system

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
with the nutrient salt?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
The most famous one

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
will be brought to everyone.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
It's in Minnesota.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
There is a person

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
who is the first person

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
to really do this large-scale experiment.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
You can see it in the picture on the left.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
It's called Seagull Creek.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
It really digs a piece of land

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
and plants this grass.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
You can see a plot.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
There may be five kinds of grass in this plot.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
There is one kind of grass in another plot.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
There are several kinds of grass in a plot.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
It goes down like this.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Or in Germany,

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Jena Experiment

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
also does similar things.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
There are different kinds of grass

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
in each block.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
When I have a lot of grass,

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
does this grass

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
use different resources

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
in order to survive?

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
In total,

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
I can take more resources

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
from the environment.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
As I just said,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
there is a concept of a radish pit.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
The whole pit is full.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
We take a lot of resources

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
from the system.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
A lot of biodiversity grows out of it.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
This kind of research

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
has been done for more than 10 years.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
We have now discovered

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
a general pattern.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
When we see a lot of species

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
in an environment,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
when biodiversity increases,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
when X goes to the right,

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
we see that those functions

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
will increase.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
How much resources can we take away?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
How much biodiversity can we produce?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
We all see a function

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
that increases but saturates.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
This is the knowledge we know now.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
However,

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
the knowledge we have now

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
is all based on grass experiment.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
This is the grass experiment

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
I just showed here.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
We all plant grass

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
or raise a certain

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
nutrient-based organism.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Then we find that

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
the nutrient-based organism functions well.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
However,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
this is not enough.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
In our world,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
it is impossible to have only grass.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
At least there are humans.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
At least insects eat grass.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Rabbits eat grass.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Lions eat rabbits.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
There are many different kinds of life.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Now,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
there are a few questions

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
that ecologists want to continue to explore.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
The first is

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
the function of these ecosystem.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
For example,

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
the production of biomass, etc.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Is it related to

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
what we need in this world?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
This is the first one above.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
How do we put these functions

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
and services

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I will talk about what service is later.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Service is the function we need.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
How do we put these two things together?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Otherwise, people will think that

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
our ecological system is

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
locked in a academic ivory tower.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
Purely understand the phenomenon of the natural environment

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
and then it's over.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
No more.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Everyone hopes that

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
we ecologists can contribute to

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
some changes in the environment, etc.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
This is the first

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
ecologicalists

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
want to continue to study.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Next is what I just said.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
All the knowledge we learn now

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
is very flat.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Or the same nutrient class.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
But the natural environment

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
is a very three-dimensional state.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So should we

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
put the natural environment

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
into a very three-dimensional state?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
The third one is

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
how can we predict accurately

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
or accurately

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
when the environment changes

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
to reflect

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
how many species will be left now.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
How many species will be left

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and how many functions

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
will be left, etc.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
So these three are from

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
The three branches

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
I think are ecological systems.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
I can't say it's obvious,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
but a lot of people are doing it.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Now I'm going to talk about the first one.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
What is ecosystem services?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
These services mean

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
all people

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
live in this world

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
and learn about these

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
functions,

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
patterns,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
all the things you need.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
And then,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
I remember it was the UN

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
or something.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
The report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
At that time, it was clearly defined

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
that our current ecosystem

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
is actually the whole earth.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
These services

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
are provided to people.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
There are these four categories,

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
supporting provisioning,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
regulation, and culture.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
The first few are easier to understand.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Supporting services

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
that support the operation of the earth.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
For example, the cycle of nutrients.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You may have learned

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
that in biology,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
we learn about the water cycle,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
the egg cycle, the carbon cycle,

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
the carbon cycle, and so on.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Or how much

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
production

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
can be used by us, etc.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Then these will support

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
how much food can we eat,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
the water cycle,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
because of the water cycle,

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
how much clean water

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
can be used by us.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
This is provisioning.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Or when we want to manage

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
a system,

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
we don't want to have too many pests.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
We want to maximize,

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
for example, maximize the number of corn.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
We don't want too many corn pests.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
The number of pest control

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
is the regulation services.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
These three are relatively easy to understand.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I think,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
and it is also now

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
a big problem for ecologists.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
We call it cultural services.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
What I wrote here is

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
you can think of everything

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
related to culture.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
These are from the natural environment.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
You get these ideas.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
You get these inspirations.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
You get these education.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
You get to learn.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
But as long as it's related to the environment,

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
it's not that kind of

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
ugly.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
You don't have it.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
If you don't have it,

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
you won't die.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
But you will live unhappily.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
These things are called culture.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
So some people say

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
because nature is beautiful,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
it's too beautiful.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
So we can't maximize it.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
We can only rely on the beauty of our inner self

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
to appreciate nature.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Then there are other people who say

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
that this is meaningless.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I say what you say is beautiful.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I can also say

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
that there is nothing in the world that is the most beautiful.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
So how do we quantify

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
the services of these ecosystems,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
especially the services of culture?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
This is something that some people

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
are trying to figure out now.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
And that part of people

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
includes a lot of economists.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Because economists are very...

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I think

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
they are very good at estimating

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
the value of this thing in the market,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
and then how to trade it.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
So some people will think

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
that we will quantify these services.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
For example,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
a piece of clean water

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
is worth 2.5 million.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Then a big clean swimming pool

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
is worth 2.5 million.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
A big clean swimming pool

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
is worth 10 million.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I don't know.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Just try to quantify it

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
or find a way to...

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I can't say that this can be traded,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
but use money to quantify it

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
so that we can do better management, etc.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Or we can use money

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
to quantify

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
almost everything in the world

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
in a system of communication.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
This is the second thing I think

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
that eco-scientists are facing now.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
This is also a problem

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
that some scholars

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
who are not trained in ecology

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
want to help us solve.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
How to quantify ecosystem services,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
especially these services

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
related to culture.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Even when I was at this conference,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
there was a special workshop.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
There were quite a few participants.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Almost 100 people.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Almost 100 people were discussing

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
ecosystem services.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
This is the second thing

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
that I think is pretty cool.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Okay.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
Next,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
I just said

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
that when we understand

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
biodiversity,

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
what we understand now

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
is relative to others.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
When we understand

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
the impact of biodiversity

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
on the environment,

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
our understanding

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
of biodiversity

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
is relative to others.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
So probably after 2005 and 2007,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
some people started to think

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
that biodiversity

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
should be said

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
that the natural environment

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
is a very three-dimensional state.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
We should not only consider

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
the same nutrient class.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
We should consider

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
all nutrient classes.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
So there are some studies

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
that are also going to do

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
pest control.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Biological control.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
These studies on biodiversity

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
will think that

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
they first thought that

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
if I want to control a pest,

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
for example, this soil.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
We want to control this.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
This should be considered

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
a insect.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I don't know what kind of insect this is.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Anyway, it's a pest.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
We want to control

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
the number of pests.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Then we should put

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
a kind that will eat it

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
at the bottom.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Or is it better to put

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
everything in?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
How should it be put

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
to let the number of pests

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
be suppressed to the minimum?

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
At the beginning,

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
when we consider

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
a lot of different nutrients

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
and a lot of different

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
nutrient classes,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
the biodiversity we knew

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
would really affect

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
the ecosystem function.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Does this still exist?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
This is the initial idea.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Until recently,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
there have been more researchers

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
who have invested in this research.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Then we will think that

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
in addition to different

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
biological classes,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
should we think of the

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
whole environment as a

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
network?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It's a concept of a food network.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
There are a lot of food networks.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
There are a lot of species

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
that exist in this system at the same time.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Then everyone eats each other.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
Everyone grabs food from each other.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
This research can actually

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
involve a debate

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
from a long time ago.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Everyone will ask

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
what kind of network

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
and what kind of food network

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
is the most stable state.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Before the emergence of

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Function

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
everyone started to ask

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
what kind of food network

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
is the most stable.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
At that time,

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
the pure research was

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
purely thinking about

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
how to prevent

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
this food network from crashing.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Maybe everyone is very good at connecting.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Connectedness is very high.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
Everyone is in a small group.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
It's very close to each other.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Then the small group and the small group

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
are not so close to each other.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
How do these attributes of

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
each network

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
affect the stability of

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
the entire network?

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Then put this idea

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
into the idea of

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Function.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Everyone will start to think that

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
since each network

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
has different attributes,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
different characteristics,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
then in the state of different characteristics,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
will there be different

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
food networks with different characteristics?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
There will be different functions.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
For example,

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
this opinion paper

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
is not a real data paper.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
It provides an idea

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
that when different food networks

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
have different attributes,

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
different characteristics,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the energy flux

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
is not discussing

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
whether the entire network

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
will crash easily.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
What we are discussing now is

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
how much energy flows in

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
and how much efficiency

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
flows out in the end.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Everyone started to ask this question.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Theoretically,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
these are some of the network attributes.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
How does it affect

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
the function of this part?

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
This question is

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
the question I am most interested in

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
asking in the future.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
At the end,

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
I will talk about

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
my own research.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It's very simple.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
My own research

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
is very related to

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
the question

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
that some ecologists

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
are starting to ask.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
How do different network attributes

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
affect the function of this network?

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
This research,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I haven't seen it yet.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I think it's fun and cool,

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
but I haven't seen

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
too much

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
real data

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
doing this.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Now it's mainly

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
a very theoretical research.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
In other words,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
we have to use a more three-dimensional

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
way to understand

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
how diversity affects

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
the function

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
of the entire ecosystem.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
We are still in a

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
theoretical stage.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Theoretically,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
this full web,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
everyone is very tight-knit,

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
or everyone's interaction is very strong.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I might see this kind of function.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Theoretically,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
because

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
this can't be blamed on ecologists,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
because I really want to quantify

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
a full web.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
It's actually not easy.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Of course, many people are already doing full web.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But what everyone does is

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
for example,

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
fish in a lake,

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I want to open his stomach

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
and see what kind of small fish and shrimp he ate.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
In my own words,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
A fish ate

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
C, D, E shrimp,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and so on.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Use various methods to see

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
what kind of things a species eats,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
or if there are any

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
different species

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
eating and eating each other.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Use different microscopes,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
or like I just said,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
God content research.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
We can't blame

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
that we don't have enough

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
empirical data,

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
but this empirical data is not easy to get.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
So everyone will start to

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
dilute, for example,

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
we use

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
the size of the organism

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
to decide,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
to estimate what he will eat.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Because for example,

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
a fish,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
a goldfish,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I mean the goldfish in the aquarium,

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
he may eat a shark.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
So we can use its size

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
to estimate what kind of food

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
a goldfish can eat.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Then use the size of the organism

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
and

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
the size of the organism

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
such a trait

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
to help each species

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
what kind of food

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
it may have.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Then build a

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
more realistic,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
not so theoretical food network.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Then we use some attributes of this food network

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
to see what the function of this food network is.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
But it's the same,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
it's still built on a theory

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
that small fish can't eat big fish.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
So it's not necessarily

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
that this is the most perfect food network.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
It's just that

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
the biologists are starting to think

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
how to answer this question.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Including myself, I also think

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
this is the next topic

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I want to continue

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
to study.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
After finishing

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
these chapters of my Ph.D.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I want to do some research.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
I've been

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
talking to

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
the people at the conference,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
including some biologists

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
from France or Germany.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
They all say they have

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
a huge greenhouse effect.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Like what I just said,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I want to make it three-dimensional,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
like what you can see

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
on this picture.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
There are a lot of things like a greenhouse.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Different food networks

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
are made up of different greenhouses.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Like the German

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
IDIV,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I think that organization is really cool.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
First, they have a lot of money.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Second, the topics they study

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
are all my friends.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I like them a lot.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
They seem to have a lot of future ideas.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
This is my second

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
conference.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I think it's worth sharing

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
what biologists are thinking

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
about.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Third,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
this research

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
was done by

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
my former teacher,

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Sutiara.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
She's my teacher.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
But she doesn't know

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
much about math.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Anyway,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
biologists want to

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
do this kind of research.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
We're all looking for a cause-and-effect relationship.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
For example,

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
why are there so many

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
species in the world?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
What's the reason?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
We saw this result.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Why are there

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
so many species?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Why do we get

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
these functions?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
The reason is that there are so many species.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
The result is that there are these functions.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
But in addition to

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
actually doing experiments,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
for example, like I just said,

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
it's hard to really

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
quantify

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
the cause-and-effect relationship

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
of a phenomenon

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
other than

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
the cause-and-effect relationship.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Sutiara

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
doesn't know much about math,

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
so

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I just made it up.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It's based on

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
this theorem,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
the Taken's theorem,

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
to develop a set of

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
mathematical models

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
or a set of

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
statistical methods.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
We should talk about statistical methods.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It can measure

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
the impact of

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
a population

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
on another population.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
It can use the relationship of time series

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
to know if a population

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
has a direct impact on another population.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
For example,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
this is the most common example.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Red and blue

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
are two species.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
So at the time of A,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
red and blue have a strong

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
relationship.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
According to our

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
theory,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
red is the cause of blue,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
blue is the effect of red,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
or vice versa.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
But when we get to B,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
we find that

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
their relationship is opposite.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
It's negative.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
So we say,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
if red increases,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
let blue decrease,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
or vice versa.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
We use this correlation

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
to infer the causality.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Red and blue have nothing to do with each other.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
So we find that

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
red and blue have no causality.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
However, these two time series

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
are written from the

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
mathematical formula above.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
In other words,

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
red and blue, x and y,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
have a causality.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
But in our traditional

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
ecological research,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
if we just do a bunch of correlations

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
or don't do experiments,

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
we can't know

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
the causality of

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
red and blue, x and y.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
However,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
using this method,

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
cross-mapping,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
we can know

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
the causality of

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
red and blue.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
I mentioned this method

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
because I saw

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
the experiment room

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
this year.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
The experiment room is not that big.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It's just four or five people.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
They came to give a talk.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Almost everyone came to give a talk.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
It seems to me

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
that this method

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
has been developed successfully.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Let's use it.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
It's a kind of

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
declaration

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
of significance.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
A few years ago,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
when I went to

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
ESA,

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
there were some

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
collaborators.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
However,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
it's not like this year.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Almost the whole experiment room

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
came to give a talk.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Ecologists, let's use CCM.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Let's use this method.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Let's not do correlations.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Let's not do x and y.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Let's use CCM.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Let's try to collect

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
time series data

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
to know who is the cause and who is the cause.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
It's a kind of

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
declaration.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I think it's great.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Actually, ecologists are not that smart.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
To be honest,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I decided to study ecology

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
because my math is not good enough.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I can't study physics.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I can't study chemistry.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
I don't like to study humanities.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
So, I decided to study biology.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I was happy to see the biology

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
running around.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I'm not good at math.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I'm not sure

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
if this method

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
will work.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I'm not sure.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
This method

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
requires a good time series.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
As you know,

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
in the current

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
scientific research environment,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
every project,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
every grant

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
may take 3 to 5 years.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Maybe 10 years.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
It's a good time series.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
3 to 5 years.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
3 to 5 years time series may not be long enough

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
to do CCM.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
To do convergence cross mapping.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Next,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
what I just said,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I just wrote

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
A detects an impact

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
on another population.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
In other words,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
if A's impact on B is

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
C's impact,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
which is indirect,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
then we get

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
A, B, C, these three time series.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It's possible for me to catch

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
A's impact on B.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
But this impact is actually through C.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
It's not A's direct impact on B.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
In other words,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
this method is not omnipotent.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
I can only tell you

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
who might affect who.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
But whether this impact is

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
a direct impact, I can't be sure.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
In other words,

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
CCM, although it's powerful and cool,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
it can let us know the causality.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
But it still can't let us know

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
the real causal relationship.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Is the causality

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
direct?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
So this method

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
still has some shortcomings.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
But I think

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
it's already

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
a great way

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
to let everyone

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
who has a time series

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
to try to answer the questions

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
they want to answer.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Some more traditional

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
correlation analysis.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
This is probably the last one.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Is the last one a summary?

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I don't know.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I just summarized everything

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I just said.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
In short, we still have to ask

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
the most classic question.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
How do species coexist?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Why are there so many species?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
And now

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
a way to

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
answer this question.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
We have to consider environmental changes.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Use fluctuation-dependent

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
mechanisms to explain species coexistence.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
After species coexistence,

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
we are

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
trying to

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
solidify our understanding of biodiversity.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
And

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
find a way to know

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
what impact

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
biodiversity

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
has on

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
the environment

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
we live in.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
For example, how much food can we eat?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
This kind of question.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Next is

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
causality inference.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
We really want to know

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
some causal relationships.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Through time series analysis,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
we want to know causal relationships.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Finally, ecosystem services.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I think it's a very

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
mysterious term.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I really think that Schneider University

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
seems to love this term.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
We want to use ecosystem services

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
to manage our...

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I forgot where it is.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Anyway, it's a country in South America.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I heard in the workshop

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
that our government is trying to

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
push the concept of ecosystem services.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
We want to use the concept of ecosystem services

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
to manage the natural resources

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
of our country.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
I think

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
these are some interesting topics.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
After participating in this meeting,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I saw some interesting topics.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I want to

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
learn more about

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
the impact of

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
network

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
diverse ecosystem functioning.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Lastly,

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I think

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I don't know if this is a question

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
or a concern.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
If you know a little bit about

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
ecosystem services,

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
you will know that

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
there are so-called

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
theoretical ecologists and

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
empiricists.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Some people's research is

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
a computer or a pile of paper

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
with a pile of equations

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
or a framework.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
For example, I just talked about Peter Chesson

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
who proposed the Modern Consistent Theory.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Some people think

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
it's meaningless to just think about it.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I need to do experiments.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
These two

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
I can't say two sides.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
The communication between

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
these two ecologists

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
is not so smooth.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
I think

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
maybe some people think it's not bad.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
I don't think it's that smooth.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Because theoretical ecologists

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
are too smart

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and empiricists

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
may not be able to keep up with their ideas.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
On the other hand, empiricists

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
think we are materialistic enough.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Theoretical ecologists

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
think we are materialistic.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
The other people are empty-handed.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
So I think the communication between

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
these two sides needs

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
a strong theory.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Then I will do experiments

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
with these ecologists

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
to build a bridge of friendship.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Otherwise,

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I've been thinking about

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
the mechanism of fluctuation-dependent

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
and how to influence co-existence.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
It's meaningless if you can't do experiments.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Or

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
the most obvious example is

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I did a theoretical model

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
and one of my

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
committee members said

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
is it useful to do so many theories?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Can you really do experiments

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
to verify your model prediction?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
So my second chapter

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
is to do experiments

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
to see if the predicted results

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
can be seen

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
in real life.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
It's like a debate.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
It's like a civilized blind date.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
This is what I want to say today.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
This is what I want to say today.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
What I saw at this conference

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
and what I think

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
ecologists are thinking about.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Is there any time left?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Actually,

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
it's about time.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
But we can ask questions.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Before asking questions,

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
let's turn on the microphone

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
for two seconds.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Thank you, Feng Xun,

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
for the speech.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I don't know if you have any questions

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
or comments.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I have a similar question

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
or a comment.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You mentioned

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
network analysis

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
and causality interference.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
You mentioned

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
time series analysis.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
These two technologies

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
are very useful

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
in physics.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
They are very useful

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
in physics.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
They are very useful

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
in physics.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
In fact,

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
they are widely used.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But I think

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
the biggest problem is

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
that

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
physicists' habits.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
For example,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
there are water molecules in the water.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
There are one or two water molecules in the water.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I don't know how to use

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
ten water molecules.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
The computer can't predict.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
So I use one water molecule

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
and one water molecule.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
So I use water molecules

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
and one water molecule

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
to check the phenomenon.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Then I said

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
that my model

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
would have such a phenomenon.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Then I went for experiments.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Then I said I understood

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
the flow of water.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I think this

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
can be delineated.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Assuming things can be delineated

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
in a condition

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
like a time series,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
it would be more interesting.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Otherwise,

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
physicists say

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
they can calculate one by one,

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
but they can't do fluid mechanics.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Then I said I would leave it to the computer.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Then I asked the computer

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
to do a large-scale

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
numerical simulation

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
to simulate some strange phenomena.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
If the experiment can't be done,

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I said the experiment wouldn't be done.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
But it doesn't mean it's wrong.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Because in the real world,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
water is still flowing.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
This kind of research

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
and operation

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
is actually very difficult

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
for a system

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
with complex variables.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
So let's go back

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
to the biological ecosystem.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Of course,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
you can say

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
it's easy to issue a paper.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I just need to build up the model

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and let the computer calculate it.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
In the end,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
you still have to go back

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
to whether you can explain

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
what happened in this world

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
and whether you can do experiments to verify it.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But there will be a lot of difficulty in the middle.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Then it becomes

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
a very interesting thought study.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But it's hard to say

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
if it has an impact on the learning itself.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I totally agree.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
If I remember correctly,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
the talk of the person next week

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
is similar to what you just said.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's about building a climate model

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
or a water texture model

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
to understand

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
some of the changes

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
in the environment, etc.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
That's a very popular question

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
for some ecologists

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
right now.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Because, as I just said,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
we want to know how to face this world.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So if I can

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
use a digital simulation

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
and I know

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
that the temperature here is one degree higher

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
than the temperature in a black box,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I don't know what's going on.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Anyway, the sea level will rise by 50 meters.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I feel very happy.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
If the prediction is accurate,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I feel happy.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But some ecologists

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
think that

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
it's like doing

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
big data analysis.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
You don't know what's going on at all.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
You only know one cause and effect.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
So I think

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
this is a

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
question that depends on

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
what you want to answer.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
If you really just want to solve an environmental problem

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
or a human survival problem,

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
you can do a data analysis

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
and I can come up with

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
an effective solution,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
that's great.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But if I just want to increase my knowledge,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I think knowledge is the most important thing.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
This is very meaningful to me.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
This is why I don't

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
like

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
big data analysis

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
or environmental studies.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
That's the reason.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
In fact,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
there are some people

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
in the conference

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
who are trying to

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
use CtS

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
to collect

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
more data

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
to understand environmental changes.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I don't think

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
they have a good enough

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
theoretical foundation.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I don't pay

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
too much attention to what they are doing.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Thank you.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Do you have any questions?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
If you have any questions

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
or comments,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I'll tell you.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
The links of

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Taira's website and

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Taira's conference

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
are in the chat.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
If you are interested,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
you can check it out.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You can see what Taira

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
wants to do,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
how to join,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and what other

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
academic lectures

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
we will have next year.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
You can see next year's lecture

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
at the end of the year.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
If you are interested,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I hope we can

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
connect more people

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
from all over the world

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
to share resources.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
The more people join,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
the more powerful it will be.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
The link is in the chat.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
You can check it out.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Do you have any questions?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
If you are interested,

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
you can contact

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
or discuss with

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Taira's website.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
The link is in the chat.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
On the right,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
there is a list

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
of members.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
If you click

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
on Taira's name,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
there should be an email.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
No?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Okay.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
We didn't write it down.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Sorry.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If you are interested,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
you can contact

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Taira.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
We can help you.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Taira's email is

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Or you can

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
write her email

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
on the screen.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Okay.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
That's all for today.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Let's give it up

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
for Taira.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Thank you.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I'm going to

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
stop recording.
