0	20000	Hello, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Lin Yuwei from UC Irvine.
20000	30000	Our guest for today's TerraTalk is Lu Kefan, a Ph.D. student at Fairbanks University of Alaska.
30000	36000	His field of research is very interesting. It's about Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.
36000	47000	He was a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University. He was also an intern at ZTE.
47000	51000	He was a Ph.D. student for three and a half years.
51000	56000	He is expected to graduate next spring.
56000	61000	You can visit his defense course and see the aurora.
61000	64000	Let's welcome Lu Kefan.
65000	67000	Thank you, everyone.
67000	85000	I don't want to bore you, so I'll introduce the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.
85000	104000	I'll talk about my field of research.
104000	111000	At the end, I'll talk about my work in the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.
112000	126000	At the beginning, we saw a video.
126000	134000	It's a popular video on social media.
135000	139000	It tells us how to reduce sea ice in recent years.
139000	146000	It's about saving polar bears, protecting the earth, reducing carbon, and protecting the environment.
146000	148000	It's a similar title.
148000	155000	For me, this kind of video doesn't have a wrong direction.
155000	161000	But from a scientific point of view, we have to be very careful when we see a similar video.
161000	165000	What does the color in the video mean?
165000	173000	I think you may intuitively think that the white part is the size, volume, or thickness of the ice.
174000	182000	But in fact, this video is from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.
182000	190000	It calculates the age of the sea ice, which is the length of time the sea ice stays in the ocean.
191000	195000	Why do we look at the age of the sea ice?
195000	204000	In general, we will divide the sea ice into one-year ice or multi-year ice.
204000	207000	One-year ice is the gray part.
207000	211000	You can see that there is a big shock every year.
211000	214000	Because it melts in summer.
214000	220000	In winter, when the sea water reaches the freezing point, it freezes again.
220000	226000	In fact, the thickness of the sea ice has nothing to do with its age.
226000	231000	The average thickness of one-year ice is about 2 to 3 meters.
231000	238000	The thickness of multi-year ice, which is the ice that has not completely melted in summer for more than a year, is actually about 3 meters.
238000	251000	The thickness of one-year ice or multi-year ice may be more than 5 meters.
251000	255000	So when you see a video like this, especially a large-scale video,
255000	260000	Because the thickness of the sea ice is very difficult to measure from the air,
260000	267000	So if you see such a large-scale video, it is usually not discussing the thickness of the sea ice, its size, or volume.
267000	273000	Next, let's take a look at the winter of 2016.
273000	275000	Take a closer look at the gray part.
275000	280000	For example, as I just said, one-year ice is also 3 meters.
280000	282000	Multi-year ice is also 3 meters.
282000	285000	Then you will see that the whole piece is white.
285000	288000	Even the east coast of the United States still has sea ice.
288000	295000	Then visually, you will not feel so deeply that our sea ice is declining.
296000	303000	But NASA made this video not to intimidate everyone.
303000	307000	This video has several points.
307000	318000	The first point is that we can see that most of the sea ice flows out of the Atlantic coast.
319000	321000	This is the first point.
321000	326000	The second point is that if we look closely at the gray area,
326000	329000	Or look at the statistics next to it,
329000	336000	In the summer, the gray area is the part of one-year ice.
336000	339000	Indeed, there is a gradual decrease in the trend.
339000	345000	Then I would say that it is a decrease in the trend, not that it is really decreasing every year.
345000	352000	But overall, it is gradually decreasing in the past 40 years.
352000	360000	The countries that are concerned about the study of North America are the neighboring eight countries,
360000	367000	Including the United States, Greenland, Iceland, the Nordic countries, and Russia.
367000	370000	In addition to the neighboring eight countries,
370000	377000	There are also countries such as Europe, Germany, France, East Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China.
377000	382000	The reason why they are so concerned about the study of North America is because
382000	390000	Everyone wants to take advantage of the lack of ice in the summer to use the fishing rights and navigation rights in the Arctic Ocean.
390000	395000	So these far Eastern Asian countries can use this red line,
395000	399000	This red line is the Arctic Ocean's North East Line,
399000	402000	It is now being used.
402000	409000	If the East Asian countries use the North East Line to travel by sea to send goods to Europe,
409000	414000	Its navigation will be only one-third of the way to the south.
414000	421000	So for them, the melting of the sea ice in the summer or the gradual reduction of the sea ice area,
421000	429000	For some countries, it is not entirely a disaster or a bad thing or something they want to avoid.
429000	441000	Then there is no need to say that the United States, Norway, and Russia have very large drilling projects along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.
441000	446000	It's not like what everyone sees.
446000	456000	Greenpeace has previously stated that they have used a method to prohibit Shell from drilling oil, and they have won.
456000	458000	It's not like that.
458000	466000	The reason why Shell stopped drilling oil in the Arctic Ocean is because they hired a large number of scientists to do research,
466000	473000	They found that if they wanted to deal with the subsequent oil problems and consolidate the ecological balance,
473000	480000	The investment and their income were not worth it, so they decided to withdraw.
480000	487000	But in addition to Shell, there are quite a few oil companies in the United States, such as ConocoFlips or BP,
487000	494000	They continue to drill oil along the coast of the Arctic Ocean, and there is no need to say that the entire north coast of Norway is a drilling platform.
494000	511000	These countries' attitude towards the reduction of sea ice is to treat it as a natural phenomenon that is already happening and is almost impossible to reverse.
511000	518000	Their research focuses on how to deal with what has already happened.
518000	531000	For example, researchers at the National Institute for Oil and Gas Engineering in Austria and Norway are now working on improving the shape of the drilling platform.
531000	538000	Because we see that if there is less sea ice, the flow of sea will be strengthened, but there will still be some floating ice stuck on the coast.
538000	547000	After these floating ice are affected by strong sea currents, they will hit the drilling platform, which may cause public safety accidents.
547000	552000	So they want to improve the drilling platform to reduce the slowdown of floating ice hitting the sea.
552000	568000	Or like the East Asian countries I just mentioned, they are constantly studying when to enter the Arctic Ocean and which route to take to avoid aftershocks and shipwrecks.
569000	575000	For example, we know that the Arctic Ocean is very famous.
575000	579000	As the sea ice retreats, the water temperature will also change.
579000	583000	So we find that the Arctic Ocean is gradually moving northward.
583000	592000	At this time, they have to consider whether to change the target species or change the area and timing of the Arctic Ocean.
592000	597000	These are all countries that are now working on Arctic research.
597000	618000	They are not completely treating the Arctic Ocean as a disaster to avoid or try to restore to the original state of sea ice.
619000	642000	From this animation, we can see that a lot of sea ice flows out of the Atlantic Ocean.
642000	669000	For this reason, we can see that a lot of Atlantic Ocean water flows from the Atlantic coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean.
669000	689000	This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
689000	717000	The opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
717000	732000	Therefore, Atlantic ocean water continues to flow from the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean to the north coast of Canada.
732000	757000	This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
757000	777000	This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
777000	802000	This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
802000	830000	This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
832000	857000	This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.
