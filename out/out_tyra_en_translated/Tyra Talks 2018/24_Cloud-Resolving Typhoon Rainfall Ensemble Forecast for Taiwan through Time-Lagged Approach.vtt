00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Welcome everyone to today's Terra Talk.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Today is the whole summer vacation of Terra.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Because we did not plan for the summer vacation at the beginning of this year.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Because there are a lot of people joining this year.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
So we arranged a new session during the summer vacation.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Today is the first speaker, the speaker of the summer vacation program.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Today's speaker is Chen Xinhao.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
He graduated from the Department of Atmospheric Engineering of NTU.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
He is currently a doctoral student in the Department of Atmospheric Engineering of NTU.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
He is about to graduate.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Wait a minute.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
His interest is mainly in the hot zone area,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
which is near Taiwan.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
This is the analysis and simulation of the diagnosis of the weather phenomenon to the mid-level.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Then there is a special thing that everyone in Taiwan is very familiar with.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Disastrous weather such as typhoons or heat currents after noon.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
In terms of method, it is mainly used for numerical and weather forecasts.

01:06.000 --> 01:15.000
Then he can provide this simulation to give a fixed amount of precipitation forecast and assessment.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
In addition to the research part, Chen Xinhao is a very good friend of mine for more than 10 years.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
We were classmates of the Taita Bicycle Club.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
He had a very famous feature when he was on the club.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
He is a human weather forecaster.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It is very important to the bicycle club.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
So let's listen to him today.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
How did he become an atmospheric scientist from a human weather forecaster?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
The method of numerical simulation.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
The topic he often tells us is

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Medium-Range Cloud Resolving Typhoon Rainfall Ensemble Forecast for Taiwan Through Time-Lagging Approach.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
This topic is very long.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
So I hope Xinhao can tell us what his Chinese vocabulary is.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Without further ado, let's applaud and welcome him.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Hello everyone.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I am Chen Xinhao, the speaker today.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
You can call me Guige.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Maybe because when I report to the police,

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
The main setting is related fields of research.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
So if there is something in the middle that you can't understand,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
You can interrupt and ask.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Because today I will report to the previous seminar.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Then I will explain the name a little bit.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
The topic I want to talk about today is

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Medium-Range Cloud Resolving Typhoon Rainfall Ensemble Forecast for Taiwan Through Time-Lagging Approach.

02:43.000 --> 02:51.000
This is what he came up with after I came in from the PhD class.

02:51.000 --> 03:03.000
For Taiwan, there is a new typhoon forecast strategy.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Okay, I don't care.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Let's start with the first one.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
In our country, typhoon and rainfall are extremely low.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
Every year, there will be a large loss of all kinds of life.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Typhoon is the main cause of Taiwan's drop in water.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
This is the typhoon in 2016.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
From 26th to 29th.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
This is the drop in water for 26 hours.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
The amount of wind and rain they bring can be compared to Taiwan.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.000
Anyway, the typhoon is an important drop in water in Taiwan.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
In addition, Taiwan is different from other places.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Taiwan is not a high mountain.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
When the typhoon passes, it will cause a terrible drop in wind and rain.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Taiwan also has a lot of people living in the mountains because of the underground population.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
The map is a map of Taiwan's geography.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
The black spot is the location of the Yuliang Station in Taiwan.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Because of the high mountains and the people living in the mountains,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
These two characteristics of Taiwan cause the typhoon forecast.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
The maximum drop in water will be higher than other places.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
For example, mainland China.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
These big countries will have a higher drop in water.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
In the past, it was thought that the forecast limit was about three days.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
It is generally thought that the area model forecasts more than 72 hours for numerical weather.

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
The following results are low in reference value.

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
Wang Teng conducted an 8-day drop in water forecast in cloud analysis mode.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
We evaluated five typhoons in 2002 and two typhoons in 2013.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
There are a total of six typhoons.

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
We found that the drop in water forecast is different from the above past.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
We found that the drop in water forecast may be in 8 days or 4 days, 6 days, or 3 days.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
These 10 days make a reference value drop in water forecast.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
There is a conclusion in this paper.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Our path is different.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
However, the drop in water forecast is still useful.

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
This paper is to break down the past.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
Let me briefly introduce the current detailed forecast method.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
The blue dot is the start time.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
The blue dot is the start time.

06:20.000 --> 06:34.000
The method of forecasting more than 10 years ago is to forecast 72 hours before the start time.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
The current detailed forecast method is based on different physical parameters.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
Based on different physical parameters, there are different rules.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
Then make about 20 to 30 conditions and forecast for 3 days.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
The drop in water time for this target will be about 20 to 30 days.

07:03.000 --> 07:15.000
The picture on the bottom right is a detailed forecast result for the 2013 Kaohsiung typhoon.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
The blue dot is a detailed member.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
The forecast is different.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
The middle is a detailed black line.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
The result of the current detailed forecast is like this.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
Let me briefly introduce the difference.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
As mentioned earlier, they divided all the calculation resources into 20 parts.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
The concept of the difference in detail is that I put 20 parts of the forecast resources in the same place.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Then I increase the frequency and increase the forecast range.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I only run single mode.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
And I have a forecast of 8 days.

08:11.000 --> 08:19.000
Then every 6 hours, the start time will increase by about 6 hours.

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
In this way, there will be more than 20 members for the target time.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
This is the difference in detail.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
It's a little different from the current forecast.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
Because it's regional mode, the maximum level is the same.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
There are also 24 members.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The forecast range is about this.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Then the X-17 forecast.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
The cloud analysis X-17 forecast.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
The forecast range is about the red box.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Then the distance between the two networks.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Its resolution is higher.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
The forecast range is larger.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
The length of the forecast is also longer.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I forgot to show my little arrow.

09:17.000 --> 09:25.000
The members of Ensembl will be used in a while.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
And the calculation resources they use are about 1500 core systems.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
It's all about 1500 core systems.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
In other words, it can do this.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
I raise the resolution.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I raise the forecast range.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
The length of the forecast is also longer.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Then there are about the same number of members.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Then use the same data.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
In the model, we use the Japanese National University developed

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
X-17 forecast mode.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
It is a non-linear model.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
The key is that there is no linearization.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
The original physics is the same process.

10:20.000 --> 10:28.000
On the right is the conversion method of its six waterfalls.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
There are all kinds of models.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Hello, Gui, can you hear me?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
The first example I explain is that.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
In 2013.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
The bottom left is the final path of the Central Meteorological Bureau.

10:47.000 --> 10:56.000
The red box is the original X-17 forecast range.

10:56.000 --> 11:05.000
The top right is the observation waterfall from August 29th to 30th.

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
The bottom right is the forecast a few days ago.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
It's about this time, the observation time.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
The color bar is the waterfall.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
You can see that after the meteorological conditions are strong.

11:27.000 --> 11:37.000
The path is very similar to what it did a day ago.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
Its strength is weak.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
But it is a strong deterrent.

11:49.000 --> 11:58.000
This picture is the forecast from August 22nd.

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
For the target time, from August 29th to 30th.

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
You can see that the forecast can be calculated from August 22nd.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
When the meteorological conditions are weak.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
You can tell the disaster prevention unit.

12:20.000 --> 12:29.000
There may be more than 311 waterfalls in the south.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Maybe you don't know 311.

12:32.000 --> 12:40.000
311 is about the same size as Yanda Waterfall in Pingting.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Because the weather conditions are different.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
The weather forecast is different.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
So the result is good or bad.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Some results are better.

12:56.000 --> 13:06.000
Some results are not the observed weather forecast.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
So the meteorological conditions will be observed.

13:13.000 --> 13:22.000
After August 24th, the meteorological conditions will be observed.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
The meteorological conditions will be observed.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
This method is based on.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Before a lot of days.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
It can provide the meteorological conditions of the disaster prevention unit.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Provide meteorological conditions.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Then it will be on August 26th.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
On August 18th.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
It will be 5 kilometers below zero.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
24 members.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
It will provide.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
This is their detailed frequency.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
The detailed frequency of 24 members.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
After 24 reports.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Add their water.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Then.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
They are like this.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
The other is the poured water.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Although the progress is similar.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
But the results are different.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Then.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Yes.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Add.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Hello.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Hello.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Then.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
In the last few days.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Add water.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
More and more.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Then this is.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Meteorological weather forecast.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
For a strong typhoon.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
On the 29th and 30th.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Then the lower right corner.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
This is.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
You can see.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
No. 22.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Black.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
No. 23.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Green.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Different time.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Hello.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Did you hear that?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Typhoon warning.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Then black.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
This is.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Joint.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
With us.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Complete.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
They made it.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Best warning.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Before.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Then.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
The above group.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Is.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
No. 22.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
No. 22.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
No. 22.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Their.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Forecast.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
For this forecast.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
The water situation.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Ok.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Then.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
You may say.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Ok.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Give me so many situations.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Then how do I use.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
The water system.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Ok.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
From the water system.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
We can see.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
This refers to.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
The leftmost.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
This is the leftmost.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Then this is the leftmost.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Then the largest.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Then.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Typhoon.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Out.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
There is also.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
The most famous.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
There will be the most famous.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Then.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
There is also.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Of course.

The error will be magnified.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Then.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
5km

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
24 layers

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Every importance

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Besides

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
We just mentioned

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Temperature drop in 24 hours

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
If I put the drop in time

21:28.000 --> 21:29.800
up to 48 hours

21:29.800 --> 21:31.800
In fact, the Kangrui Typhoon

21:32.800 --> 21:34.800
Drop in 48 hours

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
Then we color bar

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
300 to 1500

21:38.800 --> 21:40.800
Then its value is about

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
700 or so

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
742

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
That

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
I don't know if this typhoon

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
Do you have any impression

21:46.800 --> 21:47.800
This typhoon is

21:48.800 --> 21:50.800
Lai Ching-Ting's mayor

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
When he was the mayor

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
He was in Tainan

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
He used to

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
Before this typhoon

21:57.800 --> 21:59.800
He was called God Lai

22:00.800 --> 22:01.800
Then

22:01.800 --> 22:03.800
Then

22:03.800 --> 22:05.800
His god place

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
It's written on it

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
I think I'm going to take a vacation

22:08.800 --> 22:09.800
Then Ching-Ting said

22:09.800 --> 22:10.800
I don't want to take a vacation

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
Then

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
Then the next day

22:12.800 --> 22:13.800
No wind, no rain

22:13.800 --> 22:15.800
He became God Lai

22:15.800 --> 22:16.800
What about this typhoon

22:16.800 --> 22:18.800
He did the same thing

22:18.800 --> 22:22.800
Then he fell from the mountain

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
I don't know if you have any impression

22:23.800 --> 22:25.800
On this matter

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
This typhoon

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
Then this typhoon in Tainan

22:27.800 --> 22:29.800
It's raining a lot

22:29.800 --> 22:30.800
Then salt water

22:30.800 --> 22:31.800
Then

22:32.800 --> 22:34.800
Lai Ching-Ting insisted

22:34.800 --> 22:35.800
You have to go to work

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
So

22:36.800 --> 22:38.800
It's pretty bad

22:38.800 --> 22:39.800
it is good

22:39.800 --> 22:40.800
That

22:40.800 --> 22:41.800
So

22:41.800 --> 22:43.800
The precipitation in 48 hours

22:43.800 --> 22:45.800
It's the same on August 23

22:45.800 --> 22:46.800
That is

22:46.800 --> 22:47.800
Six days ago

22:48.800 --> 22:49.800
He can have

22:49.800 --> 22:51.800
Precipitation

22:51.800 --> 22:52.800
Then

22:52.800 --> 22:53.800
Of course

22:53.800 --> 22:54.800
Some precipitation

22:54.800 --> 22:55.800
Some precipitation

22:55.800 --> 22:57.800
Have been grasped

22:57.800 --> 22:59.800
The one who ran away in the middle

22:59.800 --> 23:01.800
Did not grasp

23:01.800 --> 23:02.800
Precipitation

23:02.800 --> 23:04.800
But he had a trend

23:04.800 --> 23:05.800
Uh

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
Excessive at first

23:06.800 --> 23:07.800
Then again

23:07.800 --> 23:08.800
Uh

23:08.800 --> 23:10.800
The big environmental trend is

23:10.800 --> 23:13.800
This typhoon may not affect Taiwan

23:13.800 --> 23:15.800
But gradually came back

23:15.800 --> 23:16.800
Tell him

23:16.800 --> 23:17.800
Oh, this typhoon

23:19.800 --> 23:21.800
May really affect Taiwan

23:21.800 --> 23:23.800
Then

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
A day ago

23:25.800 --> 23:27.800
Three days in advance

23:27.800 --> 23:28.800
And tell you

23:28.800 --> 23:29.800
Uh

23:30.800 --> 23:31.800
Typhoon

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
It looks like this

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
Then

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
Typhoon

23:34.800 --> 23:35.800
Here

23:35.800 --> 23:36.800
More than 200

23:38.800 --> 23:39.800
That

23:39.800 --> 23:40.800
His shortcoming is

23:43.800 --> 23:44.800
Your mechanism

23:44.800 --> 23:45.800
Can't grasp

23:47.800 --> 23:48.800
Then he can't

23:48.800 --> 23:49.800
In many days

23:49.800 --> 23:50.800
Provide

23:50.800 --> 23:51.800
Uh

23:51.800 --> 23:52.800
The trend of precipitation

23:52.800 --> 23:53.800
Uh

23:54.800 --> 23:55.800
It's raining

23:55.800 --> 23:56.800
It's raining

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
Gradually

23:57.800 --> 23:58.800
Uh

23:58.800 --> 23:59.800
One by one

23:59.800 --> 24:00.800
It's raining

24:01.800 --> 24:02.800
I think the model

24:02.800 --> 24:04.800
Should go in this direction

24:04.800 --> 24:05.800
I think he

24:05.800 --> 24:06.800
He can't provide such

24:07.800 --> 24:08.800
Uh

24:11.800 --> 24:12.800
That two days

24:13.800 --> 24:14.800
Result

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
Can

24:16.800 --> 24:17.800
That is

24:17.800 --> 24:18.800
Five or six days ago

24:18.800 --> 24:19.800
Provide such precipitation

24:19.800 --> 24:20.800
Then

24:20.800 --> 24:21.800
Then

24:21.800 --> 24:22.800
The typhoon

24:22.800 --> 24:23.800
Three or four days

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
Provide such precipitation

24:24.800 --> 24:25.800
One or two days

24:25.800 --> 24:26.800
Uh

24:26.800 --> 24:27.800
Collect

24:27.800 --> 24:28.800
Should be

24:28.800 --> 24:29.800
Five kilometers per hour

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
Twenty-four meters

24:30.800 --> 24:31.800
He

24:31.800 --> 24:32.800
There is no way to go

24:32.800 --> 24:33.800
That

24:33.800 --> 24:34.800
If for

24:34.800 --> 24:35.800
It will rain for three days

24:35.800 --> 24:36.800
Uh

24:36.800 --> 24:37.800
The example I chose here is

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800
Typhoon Morak

24:38.800 --> 24:39.800
That

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
Morak is a typhoon

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
He actually

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
In 2019

24:43.800 --> 24:44.800
Typhoon

24:44.800 --> 24:45.800
The typhoon

24:45.800 --> 24:46.800
Uh

24:46.800 --> 24:47.800
The most famous thing

24:47.800 --> 24:48.800
Is

24:48.800 --> 24:49.800
In the small village

24:50.800 --> 24:51.800
Right

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
That

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
What about this method

24:53.800 --> 24:54.800
Uh

24:54.800 --> 24:55.800
But

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
Let's talk about it first

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
This technology

24:57.800 --> 24:58.800
There was no such thing at that time

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
And

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
There was no such thing at that time

25:00.800 --> 25:01.800
Calculation resource

25:02.800 --> 25:03.800
Now this

25:03.800 --> 25:04.800
Calculation resource

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
Gradually increasing

25:06.800 --> 25:08.800
He can use this way

25:09.800 --> 25:10.800
That

25:11.800 --> 25:12.800
If

25:12.800 --> 25:13.800
I

25:13.800 --> 25:14.800
I am

25:14.800 --> 25:15.800
Only three days

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
If this typhoon

25:17.800 --> 25:18.800
Just three days

25:18.800 --> 25:19.800
That is

25:19.800 --> 25:20.800
He can't provide

25:21.800 --> 25:22.800
Everyone is

25:22.800 --> 25:23.800
Oh

25:23.800 --> 25:24.800
He must be

25:25.800 --> 25:26.800
After it started

25:26.800 --> 25:27.800
He told me

25:27.800 --> 25:28.800
Oh this mode

25:28.800 --> 25:29.800
Three days

25:30.800 --> 25:31.800
He rained

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
Will

25:32.800 --> 25:33.800
Become

25:33.800 --> 25:34.800
How

25:34.800 --> 25:35.800
This typhoon

25:35.800 --> 25:36.800
Observed in

25:37.800 --> 25:38.800
Taiwan's Zhongpu Mountain Area

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
More than 1,500 kilometers

25:40.800 --> 25:42.800
The value is about 2,000

25:43.800 --> 25:44.800
But

25:44.800 --> 25:45.800
If I forecast eight days

25:46.800 --> 25:47.800
There is a way

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
For the next three days

25:49.800 --> 25:50.800
Preliminary forecast

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
That

25:52.800 --> 25:53.800
Because my show in front

25:54.800 --> 25:55.800
He is a weather forecast

25:55.800 --> 25:56.800
With five kilometers

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
That now

25:57.800 --> 25:58.800
I can't fix it

25:58.800 --> 25:59.800
Because they

25:59.800 --> 26:00.800
Can't do it

26:01.800 --> 26:03.800
If he only forecasts three days

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
Then

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
Here's a little conclusion

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
Is

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
In general

26:07.800 --> 26:08.800
He is a weather forecast

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
Can be called

26:09.800 --> 26:10.800
The current weather forecast

26:11.800 --> 26:12.800
Earlier

26:12.800 --> 26:13.800
Provide

26:13.800 --> 26:14.800
Damage

26:14.800 --> 26:15.800
That's it

26:16.800 --> 26:17.800
If the rainfall

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
The rainfall time

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
Longer

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
One day

26:20.800 --> 26:21.800
Half a day

26:21.800 --> 26:22.800
Two days

26:22.800 --> 26:23.800
Three days

26:23.800 --> 26:24.800
So if the rainfall time is long

26:24.800 --> 26:26.800
It increases the possibility of dust

26:26.800 --> 26:27.800
That way

26:27.800 --> 26:28.800
Just call

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
Current

26:30.800 --> 26:31.800
More useful

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
Then

26:35.800 --> 26:37.800
I want to talk about another typhoon

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
Is the Subing typhoon

26:39.800 --> 26:40.800
That

26:40.800 --> 26:41.800
Hello

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
The typhoon

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
In

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
Because

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
I

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
Can you hear me

26:49.800 --> 26:51.800
This is a strong typhoon

26:51.800 --> 26:52.800
Then

26:53.800 --> 26:54.800
Observation room

26:55.800 --> 26:56.800
24 hours

26:56.800 --> 26:57.800
Then he is very powerful

26:57.800 --> 26:58.800
Is in

26:58.800 --> 26:59.800
Uh

26:59.800 --> 27:00.800
Hsinchu Miaoli Mountain Area

27:00.800 --> 27:01.800
About 1500

27:01.800 --> 27:02.800
800

27:02.800 --> 27:04.800
876 meters

27:04.800 --> 27:05.800
About water

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
That

27:10.800 --> 27:11.800
This typhoon

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
His strength is stronger

27:13.800 --> 27:15.800
Then he can be in 20 hours

27:15.800 --> 27:16.800
More than 800 meters

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
Water

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
Then

27:19.800 --> 27:20.800
What's next

27:20.800 --> 27:21.800
Just tell everyone

27:21.800 --> 27:22.800
Uh

27:22.800 --> 27:23.800
His name is

27:23.800 --> 27:24.800
M01 M02

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
Is

27:26.800 --> 27:27.800
Uh

27:27.800 --> 27:28.800
Uh, let me mention it first

27:28.800 --> 27:29.800
Because we

27:29.800 --> 27:31.800
The laboratory also provides

27:33.800 --> 27:34.800
TTFR

27:34.800 --> 27:37.800
Typhoon flood research center

27:37.800 --> 27:38.800
Then they

27:38.800 --> 27:39.800
In charge of running this

27:40.800 --> 27:41.800
Typhoon forecast

27:42.800 --> 27:43.800
They have members

27:43.800 --> 27:44.800
Then

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
Every school has to provide

27:46.800 --> 27:47.800
Not every school

27:47.800 --> 27:48.800
Must provide

27:48.800 --> 27:49.800
Some schools are interested

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
Will provide some

27:50.800 --> 27:51.800
Typhoon results

27:51.800 --> 27:53.800
Then put it in this

27:53.800 --> 27:54.800
Then for everyone's reference

27:55.800 --> 27:56.800
That

27:57.800 --> 27:58.800
Simply put

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
This is the typhoon forecast

28:00.800 --> 28:01.800
M01

28:01.800 --> 28:02.800
M02

28:03.800 --> 28:04.800
Then

28:04.800 --> 28:05.800
Uh

28:06.800 --> 28:08.800
Shida also provides a member

28:08.800 --> 28:09.800
M17

28:11.800 --> 28:12.800
That

28:12.800 --> 28:13.800
Basically he

28:13.800 --> 28:14.800
Every member is

28:14.800 --> 28:15.800
5 km

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
But only M17

28:18.800 --> 28:19.800
With me below

28:19.800 --> 28:21.800
This is the typhoon forecast

28:21.800 --> 28:22.800
Made

28:22.800 --> 28:23.800
Typhoon forecast

28:23.800 --> 28:24.800
That can be seen

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
Uh

28:25.800 --> 28:26.800
In fact, every result

28:27.800 --> 28:28.800
The situation is different

28:30.800 --> 28:31.800
Then my red box

28:31.800 --> 28:32.800
Is

28:32.800 --> 28:33.800
Means

28:33.800 --> 28:34.800
Uh

28:34.800 --> 28:36.800
Typhoon

28:36.800 --> 28:37.800
More than 700

28:37.800 --> 28:38.800
More than 700

28:39.800 --> 28:40.800
Because

28:40.800 --> 28:41.800
I'm in a lot of

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
I also talked about it in my video

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
Taiwan because of heavy rainfall

28:45.800 --> 28:46.800
Mountain area

28:46.800 --> 28:47.800
So

28:47.800 --> 28:48.800
The water level

28:48.800 --> 28:49.800
Exploded

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800
Very serious

28:51.800 --> 28:52.800
For example, if my water level

28:52.800 --> 28:53.800
Exploded 310

28:53.800 --> 28:54.800
That

28:54.800 --> 28:55.800
Everyone knows

28:55.800 --> 28:56.800
That is probably

28:56.800 --> 28:57.800
Go down

28:57.800 --> 28:58.800
Go down the mountain area

29:00.800 --> 29:01.800
But if the mountain area

29:01.800 --> 29:02.800
700-800 meters

29:02.800 --> 29:03.800
Down

29:03.800 --> 29:04.800
Water

29:04.800 --> 29:05.800
That might be

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
A disaster

29:08.800 --> 29:09.800
That is

29:09.800 --> 29:10.800
That

29:10.800 --> 29:11.800
5 km resolution

29:11.800 --> 29:12.800
Can be calculated

29:12.800 --> 29:13.800
That is

29:13.800 --> 29:14.800
About 24 members

29:16.800 --> 29:17.800
More than two-thirds

29:17.800 --> 29:18.800
Did not explode

29:18.800 --> 29:19.800
Uh

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
Water level

29:20.800 --> 29:21.800
But in 2.5 km

29:23.800 --> 29:24.800
Members

29:24.800 --> 29:25.800
Just

29:25.800 --> 29:26.800
There is a way to explode

29:28.800 --> 29:30.800
That is also for this typhoon

29:31.800 --> 29:33.800
Just change different timing

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
Then my initial time

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
Is always

29:36.800 --> 29:37.800
In

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
Close

29:39.800 --> 29:40.800
This observation time

29:41.800 --> 29:42.800
So

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
You can see that

29:43.800 --> 29:44.800
Is

29:44.800 --> 29:45.800
The result will be more and more

29:45.800 --> 29:46.800
Closer observation

29:48.800 --> 29:49.800
But one thing

29:49.800 --> 29:50.800
Has not changed

29:50.800 --> 29:51.800
Uh

29:51.800 --> 29:52.800
5 km resolution

29:52.800 --> 29:53.800
Members

29:53.800 --> 29:54.800
N01 N02

29:54.800 --> 29:55.800
And so on

29:56.800 --> 29:57.800
Then in addition to N17

29:57.800 --> 29:58.800
They explode

29:58.800 --> 29:59.800
This kind of

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
possibility

30:03.800 --> 30:04.800
Not so much

30:05.800 --> 30:06.800
Then he

30:06.800 --> 30:07.800
This explosion

30:07.800 --> 30:08.800
Strange

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
I do not know why it looks like this

30:10.800 --> 30:11.800
933

30:12.800 --> 30:13.800
It looks like this

30:16.800 --> 30:17.800
Then the time of the experiment

30:18.800 --> 30:19.800
The same is 2.5 km

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
He can master the water level

30:21.800 --> 30:22.800
That

30:22.800 --> 30:23.800
5 km members

30:23.800 --> 30:24.800
There is no way

30:25.800 --> 30:26.800
But the time of the experiment

30:26.800 --> 30:28.800
Everyone is getting closer

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
But

30:30.800 --> 30:31.800
Now there should be half

30:31.800 --> 30:32.800
Explode the water level

30:32.800 --> 30:33.800
That

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
Then everyone thinks

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
Oh

30:35.800 --> 30:36.800
We may

30:36.800 --> 30:37.800
Really

30:37.800 --> 30:38.800
Will be so much

30:42.800 --> 30:43.800
Then I am here as a lady

30:43.800 --> 30:44.800
Is

30:44.800 --> 30:45.800
There are two sentences

30:45.800 --> 30:46.800
I said before

30:46.800 --> 30:47.800
That

30:47.800 --> 30:49.800
Because my understanding is improved

30:50.800 --> 30:51.800
Can explode the water level

30:53.800 --> 30:54.800
That

30:54.800 --> 30:55.800
These things are

30:56.800 --> 30:57.800
Uh

30:57.800 --> 30:58.800
What I did a few years ago

30:58.800 --> 30:59.800
That

31:00.800 --> 31:01.800
He is

31:01.800 --> 31:02.800
Will be a

31:02.800 --> 31:03.800
Effective way

31:03.800 --> 31:04.800
But he also has a

31:05.800 --> 31:06.800
Uh

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
The problem is

31:07.800 --> 31:08.800
Say

31:08.800 --> 31:09.800
Hey

31:09.800 --> 31:10.800
That

31:10.800 --> 31:11.800
I just talked a lot

31:11.800 --> 31:12.800
That is to say

31:12.800 --> 31:13.800
Oh

31:13.800 --> 31:14.800
If it's on the left

31:14.800 --> 31:15.800
The water level is

31:15.800 --> 31:16.800
That

31:16.800 --> 31:17.800
On the right

31:17.800 --> 31:18.800
The water level is

31:18.800 --> 31:19.800
That

31:19.800 --> 31:20.800
Before I have this black observation

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
Before

31:21.800 --> 31:22.800
How do I know

31:23.800 --> 31:24.800
The path is right

31:24.800 --> 31:25.800
Which path

31:25.800 --> 31:26.800
Your reference value is higher

31:27.800 --> 31:28.800
Then you tell me

31:28.800 --> 31:29.800
Say

31:29.800 --> 31:30.800
Oh

31:30.800 --> 31:31.800
So recently

31:31.800 --> 31:32.800
The trend is

31:32.800 --> 31:33.800
The more to the middle

31:34.800 --> 31:35.800
The more to the back

31:35.800 --> 31:36.800
The closer the time

31:36.800 --> 31:37.800
The water level

31:37.800 --> 31:38.800
The closer

31:38.800 --> 31:39.800
Will be more like

31:40.800 --> 31:41.800
So

31:41.800 --> 31:42.800
I'll just watch the last one

31:44.800 --> 31:45.800
So

31:45.800 --> 31:46.800
What I'm doing now

31:46.800 --> 31:47.800
That is

31:47.800 --> 31:48.800
Uh

31:48.800 --> 31:49.800
If the observation comes in

31:51.800 --> 31:52.800
I use

31:52.800 --> 31:53.800
Machine learning method

31:53.800 --> 31:54.800
He can judge that

31:55.800 --> 31:56.800
Hey

31:56.800 --> 31:57.800
On the left

31:57.800 --> 31:58.800
These exposed

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
Observation

31:59.800 --> 32:00.800
Far

32:00.800 --> 32:01.800
So they

32:02.800 --> 32:03.800
Uh

32:03.800 --> 32:05.800
The machine will learn

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
Oh

32:06.800 --> 32:07.800
Their credibility

32:07.800 --> 32:08.800
Lower

32:08.800 --> 32:09.800
That

32:09.800 --> 32:10.800
These on the right

32:10.800 --> 32:11.800
The credibility is lower

32:11.800 --> 32:12.800
That

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
The method I use now

32:13.800 --> 32:14.800
Can give

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
He

32:15.800 --> 32:16.800
Every

32:16.800 --> 32:17.800
Pre-report member

32:17.800 --> 32:18.800
His

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
Uh

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
Water level score

32:21.800 --> 32:22.800
That is to say

32:22.800 --> 32:23.800
Hey

32:23.800 --> 32:24.800
I 2618

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
This report

32:25.800 --> 32:26.800
His water level score

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
May be

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
70 points

32:28.800 --> 32:29.800
This may be

32:29.800 --> 32:30.800
60 points

32:30.800 --> 32:31.800
That

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
May be too far

32:32.800 --> 32:33.800
Because he is too far from the observation

32:33.800 --> 32:34.800
So he

32:34.800 --> 32:35.800
Water level score

32:35.800 --> 32:36.800
With

32:36.800 --> 32:37.800
2 points

32:37.800 --> 32:38.800
Something like this

32:38.800 --> 32:39.800
Let's make an example

32:40.800 --> 32:41.800
That this is

32:41.800 --> 32:42.800
What I'm doing now

32:42.800 --> 32:43.800
That

32:45.800 --> 32:46.800
Uh

32:46.800 --> 32:47.800
Because

32:47.800 --> 32:48.800
Because machine learning

32:48.800 --> 32:49.800
He needs more

32:52.800 --> 32:53.800
Cases

32:53.800 --> 32:54.800
So

32:54.800 --> 32:55.800
I have run a lot of

32:55.800 --> 32:56.800
Is

32:56.800 --> 32:57.800
Recently

32:57.800 --> 32:58.800
Keep running

32:58.800 --> 32:59.800
Run more cases

32:59.800 --> 33:00.800
Want to give

33:00.800 --> 33:01.800
Uh

33:01.800 --> 33:02.800
Computer

33:02.800 --> 33:03.800
More things to learn

33:03.800 --> 33:04.800
Recently

33:04.800 --> 33:05.800
Keep doing

33:05.800 --> 33:06.800
Such a thing

33:06.800 --> 33:07.800
That

33:10.800 --> 33:11.800
That why

33:11.800 --> 33:12.800
Uh

33:12.800 --> 33:13.800
What is that

33:13.800 --> 33:14.800
Why

33:14.800 --> 33:15.800
The machine's forecast can't do this

33:16.800 --> 33:17.800
Because they

33:17.800 --> 33:18.800
No

33:19.800 --> 33:20.800
Six days ago

33:20.800 --> 33:21.800
No five days ago

33:21.800 --> 33:22.800
No four days ago

33:22.800 --> 33:24.800
The captain is three days

33:24.800 --> 33:26.800
So they can't

33:26.800 --> 33:27.800
Use this method

33:27.800 --> 33:28.800
To support the forecast

33:28.800 --> 33:29.800
Then give out

33:29.800 --> 33:30.800
Each

33:30.800 --> 33:31.800
Score

33:32.800 --> 33:33.800
That

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
The last one

33:34.800 --> 33:35.800
Is

33:35.800 --> 33:36.800
Because we

33:36.800 --> 33:37.800
This method has

33:37.800 --> 33:38.800
Past

33:38.800 --> 33:39.800
Forecast results

33:39.800 --> 33:40.800
So we can use

33:40.800 --> 33:41.800
Objective method

33:41.800 --> 33:42.800
To

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
Guide us

33:43.800 --> 33:44.800
That

33:44.800 --> 33:46.800
My report today

33:46.800 --> 33:47.800
Is

33:47.800 --> 33:48.800
Probably this

33:48.800 --> 33:49.800
About this

33:49.800 --> 33:50.800
Then

33:51.800 --> 33:52.800
Uh

33:52.800 --> 33:53.800
Just

33:53.800 --> 33:54.800
Report to everyone

33:54.800 --> 33:56.800
I don't know if everyone has any questions

33:56.800 --> 33:57.800
Like this

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
Can you hear me

34:09.800 --> 34:11.800
Can anyone hear me

34:14.800 --> 34:15.800
Oh

34:15.800 --> 34:16.800
Can hear

34:18.800 --> 34:19.800
I found a very serious problem

34:21.800 --> 34:22.800
Because

34:22.800 --> 34:23.800
Without turning on

34:23.800 --> 34:24.800
He didn't

34:24.800 --> 34:25.800
No

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
No sound

34:26.800 --> 34:27.800
So I just

34:27.800 --> 34:28.800
If you didn't speak

34:28.800 --> 34:29.800
I didn't hear it

34:29.800 --> 34:30.800
Oh ok

34:30.800 --> 34:31.800
So you can hear it now

34:31.800 --> 34:32.800
Yes yes I can hear it now

34:33.800 --> 34:35.800
I don't know if you interrupted me in the middle

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
Have

34:36.800 --> 34:37.800
I tried a few times

34:37.800 --> 34:38.800
But it doesn't matter

34:38.800 --> 34:39.800
I just want to ask a question

34:39.800 --> 34:40.800
That

34:40.800 --> 34:41.800
Ok

34:41.800 --> 34:42.800
Does everyone have a question

34:45.800 --> 34:46.800
If there is no problem

34:46.800 --> 34:47.800
I ask one first

34:47.800 --> 34:48.800
Just

34:48.800 --> 34:49.800
You are running this

34:49.800 --> 34:50.800
Ensemble time

34:50.800 --> 34:51.800
You said you ran

34:51.800 --> 34:52.800
More than 20

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
More than 30

34:53.800 --> 34:54.800
Their

34:54.800 --> 34:55.800
Initial conditions

34:55.800 --> 34:56.800
Is it all

34:56.800 --> 34:57.800
Is it exactly the same

34:57.800 --> 34:58.800
Or

34:58.800 --> 34:59.800
You will use some

34:59.800 --> 35:00.800
For example, observe

35:01.800 --> 35:02.800
The actual inaccuracy

35:02.800 --> 35:03.800
Go

35:03.800 --> 35:04.800
Go

35:04.800 --> 35:05.800
That is to say

35:05.800 --> 35:06.800
To slightly disrupt

35:06.800 --> 35:07.800
His initial conditions

35:07.800 --> 35:08.800
Then let him run

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
You said that way

35:10.800 --> 35:11.800
Is it

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
Oh

35:13.800 --> 35:14.800
Uh

35:14.800 --> 35:15.800
In that way

35:15.800 --> 35:16.800
The difference is

35:16.800 --> 35:17.800
Different

35:19.800 --> 35:20.800
The initial time is different

35:21.800 --> 35:22.800
Because

35:22.800 --> 35:23.800
Uh

35:23.800 --> 35:24.800
To put it simply

35:24.800 --> 35:25.800
Uh

35:25.800 --> 35:26.800
For example, this is the 7th

35:27.800 --> 35:28.800
Assuming it's the 22nd

35:28.800 --> 35:29.800
Okay

35:29.800 --> 35:30.800
After 6 hours

35:30.800 --> 35:31.800
He will have different

35:33.800 --> 35:34.800
That is to say

35:34.800 --> 35:35.800
I

35:35.800 --> 35:36.800
8 o'clock in the morning

35:36.800 --> 35:37.800
Start forecasting

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
Then

35:38.800 --> 35:39.800
This is

35:39.800 --> 35:40.800
2 o'clock in the afternoon

35:41.800 --> 35:42.800
The initial conditions of the two

35:42.800 --> 35:43.800
Is different

35:43.800 --> 35:44.800
So

35:44.800 --> 35:45.800
The result they caused

35:46.800 --> 35:47.800
Is the same

35:47.800 --> 35:48.800
He didn't

35:48.800 --> 35:49.800
Add any

35:49.800 --> 35:50.800
Disturbance

35:50.800 --> 35:51.800
Like this

35:51.800 --> 35:52.800
Oh so you won't say

35:52.800 --> 35:53.800
To slightly disrupt

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
I mean

35:54.800 --> 35:55.800
For example, for example

35:55.800 --> 35:56.800
What is your air pressure

35:56.800 --> 35:57.800
What is the temperature

35:57.800 --> 35:58.800
Then

35:58.800 --> 35:59.800
For example, your air pressure is

35:59.800 --> 36:00.800
1

36:00.800 --> 36:01.800
Oh no

36:01.800 --> 36:02.800
No no

36:02.800 --> 36:03.800
The temperature is 30 degrees

36:03.800 --> 36:04.800
You are 30

36:04.800 --> 36:05.800
Then add a

36:05.800 --> 36:07.800
Random constant

36:07.800 --> 36:08.800
That constant is

36:08.800 --> 36:09.800
Is

36:09.800 --> 36:10.800
For example, minus 0.2

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
Something like that

36:11.800 --> 36:13.800
Then let the random number add

36:13.800 --> 36:14.800
because

36:14.800 --> 36:15.800
Originally you measured

36:15.800 --> 36:16.800
There will be

36:16.800 --> 36:17.800
Uncertainty

36:17.800 --> 36:18.800
Still not

36:18.800 --> 36:19.800
You are

36:19.800 --> 36:20.800
These things are fixed

36:20.800 --> 36:21.800
Is a very certain number

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
Enter

36:22.800 --> 36:23.800
Yes

36:23.800 --> 36:24.800
What is the number it predicts

36:24.800 --> 36:25.800
I put it in

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
Just like this

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
Because

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
Because because

36:28.800 --> 36:29.800
Because one

36:30.800 --> 36:31.800
Run a round every six hours

36:31.800 --> 36:32.800
So i don't need

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
Do

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
Such action

36:35.800 --> 36:36.800
That

36:36.800 --> 36:37.800
Typical ensemble

36:37.800 --> 36:38.800
He

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
Can use this technology

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
That

36:41.800 --> 36:42.800
The result

36:44.800 --> 36:45.800
The result is

36:46.800 --> 36:47.800
Some of them

36:47.800 --> 36:48.800
Members are

36:48.800 --> 36:49.800
Use this method

36:49.800 --> 36:50.800
This method

36:51.800 --> 36:52.800
Made

36:52.800 --> 36:53.800
Uh-huh

36:56.800 --> 36:57.800
Then

36:57.800 --> 36:58.800
Yes

36:58.800 --> 36:59.800
I have another question

36:59.800 --> 37:00.800
Just

37:00.800 --> 37:01.800
There was a show in front of you

37:01.800 --> 37:02.800
Say

37:02.800 --> 37:03.800
You are now

37:03.800 --> 37:04.800
Typically running these things

37:04.800 --> 37:05.800
Are using

37:05.800 --> 37:06.800
One or two thousand cores

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
right

37:07.800 --> 37:08.800
Correct

37:09.800 --> 37:10.800
OK

37:10.800 --> 37:11.800
That

37:12.800 --> 37:13.800
You think

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
This

37:14.800 --> 37:15.800
Computation

37:15.800 --> 37:16.800
This hardware

37:16.800 --> 37:17.800
Restriction

37:17.800 --> 37:18.800
Is

37:18.800 --> 37:19.800
Is

37:19.800 --> 37:20.800
Main

37:20.800 --> 37:21.800
Accuracy

37:21.800 --> 37:22.800
Restriction

37:22.800 --> 37:23.800
Just say

37:23.800 --> 37:25.800
For example, I will give you 5000 cores

37:25.800 --> 37:26.800
Can you do it

37:26.800 --> 37:27.800
Obviously better

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
Uh

37:30.800 --> 37:31.800
Mainly

37:31.800 --> 37:32.800
Maybe this model

37:32.800 --> 37:33.800
He wrote

37:33.800 --> 37:34.800
Is that

37:34.800 --> 37:35.800
He

37:35.800 --> 37:36.800
Must be distributed

37:36.800 --> 37:37.800
1500

37:37.800 --> 37:38.800
After parallel computing

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
He has to combine again

37:42.800 --> 37:43.800
Just take it apart

37:43.800 --> 37:44.800
And stick it up

37:44.800 --> 37:45.800
Is that he will divide

37:45.800 --> 37:46.800
These two actions

37:46.800 --> 37:47.800
Uh-huh

37:47.800 --> 37:48.800
That

37:48.800 --> 37:49.800
1500

37:50.800 --> 37:51.800
Core

37:51.800 --> 37:52.800
When you want to stick it up

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
Is actually

37:53.800 --> 37:55.800
It also takes a lot of time

37:55.800 --> 37:56.800
Uh-huh

37:56.800 --> 37:58.800
Let's say it becomes 5000

37:59.800 --> 38:00.800
Maybe he is

38:01.800 --> 38:02.800
Parallel computing

38:02.800 --> 38:03.800
He will double

38:03.800 --> 38:05.800
But he is stuck

38:05.800 --> 38:06.800
May increase

38:06.800 --> 38:07.800
Much

38:10.800 --> 38:12.800
So actually the biggest difference

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
OK

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
So actually the biggest difference

38:15.800 --> 38:16.800
Still your

38:16.800 --> 38:17.800
That

38:17.800 --> 38:19.800
The logic behind that thing

38:19.800 --> 38:20.800
Is your algorithm

38:20.800 --> 38:21.800
Like you want

38:21.800 --> 38:22.800
How do you sign your grid

38:22.800 --> 38:24.800
Then what do you want to resolve

38:24.800 --> 38:26.800
Then how do you arrange your time

38:30.800 --> 38:31.800
I

38:31.800 --> 38:32.800
I think

38:32.800 --> 38:33.800
Just now

38:34.800 --> 38:35.800
Because i don't

38:36.800 --> 38:38.800
I have no ability to change the mode

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
Then

38:40.800 --> 38:41.800
So my current use

38:41.800 --> 38:42.800
Test result

38:42.800 --> 38:44.800
Probably use this

38:44.800 --> 38:45.800
Core number

38:45.800 --> 38:46.800
He is

38:46.800 --> 38:47.800
Uh

38:47.800 --> 38:49.800
In the forecast result

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
With

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
The time of use

38:51.800 --> 38:52.800
Is

38:52.800 --> 38:53.800
Is balanced

38:53.800 --> 38:54.800
Because actually

38:54.800 --> 38:55.800
The number of days to forecast

38:55.800 --> 38:56.800
He

38:56.800 --> 38:57.800
Must be

38:57.800 --> 38:58.800
Must be effective

38:59.800 --> 39:00.800
You can't be

39:00.800 --> 39:01.800
Uh

39:01.800 --> 39:02.800
For example, I can

39:02.800 --> 39:03.800
20,000 core

39:03.800 --> 39:04.800
Then run

39:04.800 --> 39:05.800
The range is global

39:05.800 --> 39:07.800
Then the efficiency is super high

39:07.800 --> 39:08.800
But he ran

39:08.800 --> 39:09.800
The typhoon is not raining

39:09.800 --> 39:10.800
Yes yes yes

39:10.800 --> 39:11.800
The typhoon is not raining

39:11.800 --> 39:12.800
Then there is no

39:12.800 --> 39:13.800
No problem

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
He

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
Uh

39:15.800 --> 39:16.800
Is my

39:16.800 --> 39:17.800
My design is

39:17.800 --> 39:18.800
Uh

39:18.800 --> 39:19.800
Stabilize time and efficiency

39:19.800 --> 39:20.800
Then

39:20.800 --> 39:21.800
Uh

39:21.800 --> 39:22.800
Stabilize resolution

39:22.800 --> 39:23.800
Then

39:23.800 --> 39:24.800
Stabilize strength

39:24.800 --> 39:25.800
Then he is

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
I think

39:26.800 --> 39:27.800
After evaluation

39:27.800 --> 39:28.800
I think

39:28.800 --> 39:29.800
Very balanced

39:29.800 --> 39:30.800
A more balanced design

39:31.800 --> 39:33.800
Then increase or decrease

39:33.800 --> 39:34.800
I think

39:35.800 --> 39:36.800
That's what I just explained

39:36.800 --> 39:37.800
Say

39:37.800 --> 39:38.800
Because he needs you

39:39.800 --> 39:40.800
After evenly distributed

39:40.800 --> 39:41.800
He has to be united

39:41.800 --> 39:42.800
Then when united

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
because

39:43.800 --> 39:44.800
Japan

39:44.800 --> 39:45.800
Japan National University

39:45.800 --> 39:46.800
Their design

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
Use a core

39:47.800 --> 39:48.800
To do

39:48.800 --> 39:50.800
Combination action

39:51.800 --> 39:52.800
That

39:52.800 --> 39:53.800
Maybe in the future

39:54.800 --> 39:55.800
Will also

39:55.800 --> 39:56.800
I am

39:56.800 --> 39:57.800
I want to say

39:57.800 --> 39:59.800
I want to talk to them all day

39:59.800 --> 40:00.800
You

40:00.800 --> 40:01.800
It seems like

40:02.800 --> 40:03.800
No

40:03.800 --> 40:04.800
I

40:04.800 --> 40:05.800
I want to talk to them later

40:06.800 --> 40:07.800
OK

40:07.800 --> 40:08.800
Hurry up

40:09.800 --> 40:10.800
OK

40:12.800 --> 40:13.800
Any other questions

40:13.800 --> 40:14.800
I can do

40:14.800 --> 40:15.800
I see

40:18.800 --> 40:19.800
Does anyone have

40:19.800 --> 40:20.800
Any other questions

40:20.800 --> 40:21.800
Because I

40:21.800 --> 40:22.800
In fact, I can ask a lot of questions

40:22.800 --> 40:23.800
I think it's quite interesting

40:23.800 --> 40:24.800
I have a lot of questions

40:24.800 --> 40:25.800
But

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
Let's let others ask

40:26.800 --> 40:27.800
Does anyone have any questions?

40:34.800 --> 40:35.800
No one has a problem?

40:35.800 --> 40:36.800
Or

40:37.800 --> 40:38.800
Or you still can't hear me

40:38.800 --> 40:39.800
Because I can hear it

40:40.800 --> 40:41.800
Yes, because I can hear it

40:41.800 --> 40:42.800
OK

40:43.800 --> 40:44.800
Then I have another question

40:44.800 --> 40:45.800
My question is

40:45.800 --> 40:47.800
About machine learning

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
Yes

40:49.800 --> 40:50.800
I'm not sure you

40:55.800 --> 40:56.800
You are

40:56.800 --> 40:57.800
Someone has a problem

40:57.800 --> 40:58.800
But

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
You speak

41:01.800 --> 41:02.800
I didn't hear you

41:05.800 --> 41:06.800
The microphone is on

41:06.800 --> 41:07.800
But

41:07.800 --> 41:08.800
necessary

41:10.800 --> 41:11.800
The more necessary

41:11.800 --> 41:12.800
The more necessary

41:12.800 --> 41:13.800
In fact, I don't know how to read

41:14.800 --> 41:15.800
OK

41:15.800 --> 41:17.800
Yes, we didn't hear your voice

41:17.800 --> 41:18.800
You can type it

41:28.800 --> 41:29.800
I heard it

41:32.800 --> 41:33.800
I can't hear it again

41:33.800 --> 41:34.800
No sound

41:36.800 --> 41:38.800
I think you can type it

41:40.800 --> 41:41.800
His question is

41:41.800 --> 41:42.800
He asked

41:42.800 --> 41:44.800
Double typhoon forecast

41:44.800 --> 41:47.800
What is the difference between single forecast and double typhoon forecast?

41:51.800 --> 41:52.800
Double typhoon forecast

41:52.800 --> 41:54.800
What is the difference between single forecast and double typhoon forecast?

41:54.800 --> 41:56.800
You said in a forecast

41:56.800 --> 41:58.800
Will there be two typhoons?

42:00.800 --> 42:01.800
I think that's what it means

42:01.800 --> 42:02.800
Yes, he said that's what it means

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
For the model

42:06.800 --> 42:08.800
It's just that the complexity will increase

42:09.800 --> 42:11.800
The forecast time will be a little longer

42:13.800 --> 42:14.800
That

42:16.800 --> 42:17.800
I don't think there's anything wrong

42:21.800 --> 42:22.800
Because

42:22.800 --> 42:23.800
There will be two in the model

42:23.800 --> 42:24.800
Rotating

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
Then they have to

42:25.800 --> 42:26.800
Say

42:26.800 --> 42:27.800
They

42:28.800 --> 42:30.800
The water will rise and move

42:30.800 --> 42:31.800
The air rises and moves

42:31.800 --> 42:32.800
The air rises and moves

42:32.800 --> 42:33.800
It's going to freeze

42:33.800 --> 42:34.800
It will rain after freezing

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
After the rain

42:35.800 --> 42:36.800
It will rise and move

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
Then the water will rise and move

42:38.800 --> 42:39.800
They have been

42:39.800 --> 42:40.800
Calculating this kind of thing

42:40.800 --> 42:42.800
Because there are two typhoons

42:42.800 --> 42:43.800
Inside

42:43.800 --> 42:44.800
So the model is more complex

42:46.800 --> 42:47.800
The forecast time will be longer

42:47.800 --> 42:48.800
but

42:48.800 --> 42:50.800
Almost a little bit

42:50.800 --> 42:52.800
About 10% or so

42:52.800 --> 42:53.800
6 hours

42:53.800 --> 42:54.800
6 hours

42:55.800 --> 42:56.800
That

42:56.800 --> 42:57.800
Will there be any difference?

43:00.800 --> 43:01.800
Yes

43:08.800 --> 43:09.800
OK

43:09.800 --> 43:10.800
He said

43:11.800 --> 43:12.800
I see

43:12.800 --> 43:13.800
Thanks

43:13.800 --> 43:14.800
OK

43:17.800 --> 43:18.800
Does anyone else have any questions?

43:22.800 --> 43:23.800
If not

43:23.800 --> 43:24.800
Today we

43:24.800 --> 43:25.800
Wait a minute

43:25.800 --> 43:26.800
Yes

43:26.800 --> 43:27.800
OK

43:27.800 --> 43:28.800
Please say

43:39.800 --> 43:40.800
He said

43:40.800 --> 43:42.800
The satellite measurement resolution

43:42.800 --> 43:43.800
About how much

43:45.800 --> 43:46.800
Because of the satellite

43:47.800 --> 43:48.800
Simply put

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
How many satellites are there?

43:50.800 --> 43:51.800
One is

43:51.800 --> 43:52.800
Earth satellite

43:52.800 --> 43:53.800
Another one is

43:54.800 --> 43:55.800
Satellite orbit

43:56.800 --> 43:57.800
That

43:58.800 --> 43:59.800
I don't know

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
I don't know

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
I don't know

44:01.800 --> 44:02.800
I don't know

44:02.800 --> 44:03.800
I don't know

44:03.800 --> 44:04.800
I don't know

44:04.800 --> 44:05.800
I don't know

44:05.800 --> 44:06.800
I don't know

44:06.800 --> 44:07.800
I don't know

44:07.800 --> 44:08.800
I don't know

44:08.800 --> 44:09.800
I don't know

44:09.800 --> 44:10.800
I don't know

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
What is the difference?

44:11.800 --> 44:12.800
What about the satellites?

44:12.800 --> 44:13.800
That is to say

44:13.800 --> 44:14.800
The Earth is here

44:14.800 --> 44:15.800
Then he is

44:15.800 --> 44:17.800
Keep going around the earth

44:18.800 --> 44:19.800
Then he

44:19.800 --> 44:20.800
Because it keeps going around

44:20.800 --> 44:21.800
So he flew a long way

44:22.800 --> 44:23.800
I don't know why

44:23.800 --> 44:24.800
Anyway, he

44:24.800 --> 44:25.800
Because of this design

44:25.800 --> 44:26.800
He flew a long way

44:27.800 --> 44:28.800
Then there is another satellite

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
That is the earth

44:29.800 --> 44:30.800
When the earth is here

44:30.800 --> 44:31.800
He is going to

44:31.800 --> 44:32.800
The earth follows

44:32.800 --> 44:34.800
He keeps going around the same place

44:35.800 --> 44:36.800
Then

44:36.800 --> 44:37.800
This one flies higher

44:39.800 --> 44:41.800
Because according to what gravity

44:41.800 --> 44:42.800
Then rotate and so on

44:42.800 --> 44:44.800
This one is higher

44:44.800 --> 44:46.800
That resolution

44:46.800 --> 44:47.800
I personally

44:49.800 --> 44:50.800
In the image

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
How far back to the satellite

44:51.800 --> 44:52.800
Probably

44:52.800 --> 44:53.800
To

44:55.800 --> 44:56.800
It's pretty thin

44:57.800 --> 44:58.800
Then it depends on

44:58.800 --> 45:00.800
When was it produced?

45:01.800 --> 45:03.800
Because like the earth head satellite

45:04.800 --> 45:05.800
Previous

45:05.800 --> 45:06.800
For example, China's wind cloud

45:07.800 --> 45:08.800
Satellite

45:10.800 --> 45:11.800
Then

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
With the latest

45:12.800 --> 45:14.800
Australian space

45:14.800 --> 45:15.800
Is it Australia?

45:17.800 --> 45:19.800
Let's call it the sunny track 8

45:20.800 --> 45:21.800
Then

45:21.800 --> 45:22.800
Their resolution

45:22.800 --> 45:23.800
It's not the same

45:24.800 --> 45:25.800
You have to ask me

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
That number

45:27.800 --> 45:28.800
I personally

45:28.800 --> 45:29.800
Because I am

45:29.800 --> 45:30.800
Touch mode

45:30.800 --> 45:31.800
I didn't touch the satellite

45:31.800 --> 45:33.800
My resolution to them

45:33.800 --> 45:34.800
To what extent

45:34.800 --> 45:35.800
I am

45:38.800 --> 45:40.800
No impression

45:42.800 --> 45:43.800
But if you need

45:43.800 --> 45:44.800
Just

45:44.800 --> 45:45.800
What do you want to see my painting?

45:47.800 --> 45:48.800
I can only insert it for you

45:55.800 --> 45:57.800
But my impression is not too low

45:58.800 --> 45:59.800
That is

45:59.800 --> 46:00.800
Uh

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
Is there a few hundred meters?

46:04.800 --> 46:06.800
Then their resolution is probably a few hundred meters

46:11.800 --> 46:13.800
100 meters or 40 meters

46:13.800 --> 46:14.800
Super cool

46:16.800 --> 46:19.800
So the next question he asks is

46:19.800 --> 46:22.800
So as the initial condition

46:22.800 --> 46:23.800
Data input

46:23.800 --> 46:27.800
Will the resolution be higher than the simulation?

46:28.800 --> 46:29.800
Uh

46:29.800 --> 46:30.800
Right

46:32.800 --> 46:33.800
Oh

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
Correct

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
Because this is actually with me

46:43.800 --> 46:45.800
What I was thinking was a bit similar

46:45.800 --> 46:46.800
What I was thinking was

46:46.800 --> 46:48.800
Because you observe the limit of resolution

46:48.800 --> 46:49.800
So what you know

46:49.800 --> 46:52.800
The limit is actually this big

46:52.800 --> 46:53.800
and so

46:54.800 --> 46:56.800
I think it can be

46:56.800 --> 46:57.800
You input the initial condition

46:57.800 --> 46:59.800
Then put it at this level

46:59.800 --> 47:01.800
Smear it

47:01.800 --> 47:02.800
It's more reasonable

47:02.800 --> 47:03.800
You don't know

47:03.800 --> 47:05.800
Then run a lot of ensembles

47:05.800 --> 47:06.800
Then go and see

47:06.800 --> 47:07.800
Do you have this smear

47:07.800 --> 47:08.800
How much

47:08.800 --> 47:09.800
Influence

47:09.800 --> 47:10.800
But it seems

47:10.800 --> 47:12.800
It will take a lot of time

47:12.800 --> 47:13.800
Yes, there is no way

47:13.800 --> 47:14.800
Do it before the valid time

47:14.800 --> 47:15.800
I guess

47:16.800 --> 47:17.800
Um

47:17.800 --> 47:18.800
What you are talking about

47:18.800 --> 47:20.800
Uh, what the atmosphere is doing is

47:20.800 --> 47:21.800
Data synchronization

47:21.800 --> 47:22.800
Simple

47:22.800 --> 47:23.800
His name is called data synchronization

47:23.800 --> 47:24.800
In other words

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
This is

47:25.800 --> 47:26.800
It's almost the same as what you said

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800
That is

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
Uh

47:28.800 --> 47:29.800
At the beginning of atmospheric simulation

47:29.800 --> 47:31.800
There will be a global

47:31.800 --> 47:32.800
Global mode

47:32.800 --> 47:34.800
Its resolution will be about 20 kilometers

47:34.800 --> 47:36.800
About 10 kilometers

47:37.800 --> 47:39.800
Then it forecasts the whole world

47:40.800 --> 47:41.800
Then

47:41.800 --> 47:42.800
After he ran

47:42.800 --> 47:44.800
It will be based on satellites

47:44.800 --> 47:45.800
And then the radars all over the place

47:45.800 --> 47:47.800
Aerial balloons all over the place

47:47.800 --> 47:49.800
We will be on the ground

47:49.800 --> 47:50.800
A small balloon

47:50.800 --> 47:52.800
Then the blue instrument hanging below

47:52.800 --> 47:53.800
Then up

47:53.800 --> 47:55.800
Then they will collect this vertical

47:55.800 --> 47:57.800
Temperature pressure

47:57.800 --> 47:58.800
Wind speed

47:58.800 --> 48:00.800
He will collect such information

48:00.800 --> 48:01.800
Then go

48:01.800 --> 48:03.800
Tell this global mode

48:03.800 --> 48:04.800
Uh, where am I

48:04.800 --> 48:06.800
What is his observation

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
Then he will follow this observation

48:08.800 --> 48:09.800
Correction mode

48:10.800 --> 48:12.800
Then this global mode

48:12.800 --> 48:15.800
Will be after the calculation

48:15.800 --> 48:16.800
Cut

48:17.800 --> 48:19.800
Send to various places

48:19.800 --> 48:20.800
Then come to the area mode

48:20.800 --> 48:22.800
Like the one I'm using now

48:22.800 --> 48:24.800
This is the area mode

48:25.800 --> 48:26.800
Then his

48:27.800 --> 48:29.800
The resolution will be higher than the global mode

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
20 kilometers

48:35.800 --> 48:37.800
That's what you just said

48:38.800 --> 48:39.800
I think that's it

48:39.800 --> 48:40.800
Then he put

48:40.800 --> 48:42.800
Observation data transmission mode

48:42.800 --> 48:43.800
This thing

48:43.800 --> 48:44.800
It's called data transmission

48:46.800 --> 48:47.800
Hey

48:47.800 --> 48:48.800
Is anyone talking?

48:49.800 --> 48:51.800
No, no, I'm listening to you

48:51.800 --> 48:53.800
Oh, I want to say my microphone

48:53.800 --> 48:54.800
Is it

48:54.800 --> 48:56.800
Because no one is talking

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
So he

48:58.800 --> 48:59.800
The system is closed

48:59.800 --> 49:01.800
No, no, no, no, no, no

49:01.800 --> 49:03.800
OK, that

49:03.800 --> 49:05.800
We have 4 minutes

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
Is there any other question?

49:07.800 --> 49:08.800
Is

49:08.800 --> 49:10.800
Is it just doing numerical?

49:10.800 --> 49:12.800
Or the question of atmospheric

49:12.800 --> 49:14.800
In addition to

49:14.800 --> 49:16.800
In fact, the question we asked should be

49:16.800 --> 49:17.800
Asked almost

49:17.800 --> 49:19.800
So do you have any games?

49:19.800 --> 49:20.800
More scientific questions

49:20.800 --> 49:22.800
Or have their own interests

49:22.800 --> 49:24.800
Just ask

49:24.800 --> 49:26.800
For example, let me show you one.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.800
Just

49:28.800 --> 49:30.800
I am actually curious about one thing.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.800
Is this

49:32.800 --> 49:34.800
This one

49:34.800 --> 49:36.800
Let me talk about the objective prediction.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
Have

49:38.800 --> 49:40.800
How big a chance

49:40.800 --> 49:42.800
Will be adopted by the government

49:42.800 --> 49:44.800
Or they are

49:44.800 --> 49:46.800
Anyway, they are

49:46.800 --> 49:48.800
After reading the data, I still have to tell you

49:48.800 --> 49:50.800
There is no problem with this return screen. We want to build a house.

49:50.800 --> 49:52.800
Or they will really refer to professional advice.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.800
Because

49:56.800 --> 49:58.800
Uh

49:58.800 --> 50:00.800
The disaster prevention units are probably divided into

50:00.800 --> 50:02.800
layers

50:02.800 --> 50:04.800
Is generally in contact with the people

50:04.800 --> 50:06.800
Is the Central Meteorological Bureau

50:06.800 --> 50:08.800
The things that the Central Meteorological Bureau releases to the people

50:08.800 --> 50:10.800
Must be credible

50:10.800 --> 50:12.800
To a certain extent

50:12.800 --> 50:14.800
He can only be released

50:14.800 --> 50:16.800
But

50:16.800 --> 50:18.800
But if you want to fight for validity

50:18.800 --> 50:20.800
Is to become a disaster prevention unit

50:20.800 --> 50:22.800
Then he must have a little understanding of the weather.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.800
For example, he knows

50:24.800 --> 50:26.800
The credibility of the forecast a few days ago

50:26.800 --> 50:28.800
Uh, for reference

50:28.800 --> 50:30.800
How about a few days later

50:30.800 --> 50:32.800
I did this set of things.

50:32.800 --> 50:34.800
Is for the disaster prevention unit

50:34.800 --> 50:36.800
Use

50:36.800 --> 50:38.800
I don't seem to have answered your question.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.800
I think

50:40.800 --> 50:42.800
Are you asking

50:42.800 --> 50:44.800
But my question is more like

50:44.800 --> 50:46.800
That

50:46.800 --> 50:48.800
The chiefs who decided to take a vacation

50:48.800 --> 50:50.800
Does he have a weather forecast?

50:50.800 --> 50:52.800
Or is he just looking at it?

50:54.800 --> 50:56.800
Uh

50:56.800 --> 50:58.800
Basically should have

50:58.800 --> 51:00.800
I know Taipei City has it.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.800
but

51:02.800 --> 51:04.800
I don't think it's safe.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.800
Uh, don't keep talking.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.800
Because we are still recording

51:10.800 --> 51:12.800
That one

51:12.800 --> 51:14.800
A very good question

51:14.800 --> 51:16.800
I think it's very interesting

51:16.800 --> 51:18.800
We all know that you want to run this numerical

51:18.800 --> 51:20.800
You have to enter the initial condition

51:20.800 --> 51:22.800
Then let him propagate

51:22.800 --> 51:24.800
To have a border condition

51:24.800 --> 51:26.800
He just came from the global model.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.800
As I just said a few minutes ago

51:28.800 --> 51:30.800
He is running a global model first.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.800
Then the global model

51:32.800 --> 51:34.800
He is another model

51:34.800 --> 51:36.800
He doesn't need a border condition.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.800
Should be round

51:38.800 --> 51:40.800
He is that

51:40.800 --> 51:42.800
Symmetry

51:42.800 --> 51:44.800
Will be connected

51:44.800 --> 51:46.800
But because of the range

51:46.800 --> 51:48.800
Will grow

51:48.800 --> 51:50.800
He is

51:50.800 --> 51:52.800
Then he needs to be initialized

51:58.800 --> 52:00.800
OK

52:00.800 --> 52:02.800
Let me repeat the question he just asked.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.800
Because I just saw it directly.

52:04.800 --> 52:06.800
His question is actually weather simulation

52:06.800 --> 52:08.800
Do you need a border condition?

52:08.800 --> 52:10.800
Because we actually see it now.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.800
It's all a frame and you have Taiwan.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.800
But if you say

52:14.800 --> 52:16.800
This frame is windless

52:16.800 --> 52:18.800
It's not very reasonable, so this is a pretty good question.

52:20.800 --> 52:22.800
I just told you what the question was.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.800
Ok, now it's just 7 o'clock.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.800
Do you have any questions?

52:30.800 --> 52:32.800
If there is no problem

52:32.800 --> 52:34.800
I will announce it again.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.800
When you clap, you have to turn on the microphone.

52:36.800 --> 52:38.800
Only the speaker can hear

52:38.800 --> 52:40.800
Let's applaud again, thank you Xinhao.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.800
Thank you

52:48.800 --> 52:50.800
Stop recording
