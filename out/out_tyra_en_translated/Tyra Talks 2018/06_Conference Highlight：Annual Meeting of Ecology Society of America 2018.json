{"text": " Hello everyone, I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are very honored to invite Zhang Fengxun today. He is currently a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Michigan University. His current major is Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, and has recently been renamed Sustainable Development Studies. Before coming to the United States as a doctoral candidate, Fengxun studied in the Department of Insectology at the University of Taiwan. He wrote a small paragraph about his own self-introduction. He is a community ecologist. What he wants to understand is the interaction between species and the environment in which we humans exist. In addition to ecology, he likes comedy, baseball, his home, and Taiwan. Today's speech is different from the past, because we think that in addition to sharing his own research points and results, we hope that he can share more information. Of course, we are very fortunate that Fengxun attended this year's annual meeting of the American Ecological Association a few weeks ago. The annual meeting of the American Ecological Association is one of the largest in the world and attended by many people. From his point of view, what important information is there at this year's annual meeting, and what breakthroughs are there in this area that are worth highlighting? Let's welcome Fengxun with a round of applause. Fengxun is not a formal Chinese name, but deals with issues such as sustainable development. What is special about our association is that it is not the same as the ecological association we are familiar with. Generally, the ecological association is based on basic science. We want to know the cause of a phenomenon, the evolution of species, and so on. However, our association now thinks that we only understand these things, which is like being in an academic ivory tower. In fact, this is not helpful for the development of ecology, so they think we should solve the problem more actively. That is to say, how do we solve the problem of applying the ecological theory we already know to the major changes in the environment that we humans are facing now? Or how do we make these relatively terrible extreme climates and other phenomena less common or milder? This is my background, and what I want to share with you today is that I went to the US Ecological Annual Conference two weeks ago to participate in the conference. I would like to share with you what I have seen, what I have played, and what I have thought. I would like to introduce ESA, which stands for Ecology Society of America. In fact, each country has its own ecological association, and Taiwan also has one. However, ESA's annual meeting should be the largest in the world. This year, more than 4,000 people participated in the conference. I also went to talk to people after the conference. I asked them about the situation in Europe. They said it was much smaller, maybe less than 2,000 people. This is the biggest conference in the world, and I think it is also the most complete conference in terms of discussion issues. The disadvantage is that there are too many people, and you can't get to know everyone, and you can't have a very in-depth conversation with everyone. So if your social skills are not good, you will be like me for a long time and don't know what to do. I can only find someone to talk to. So it's a good opportunity to practice talking to people. This is a side effect. Anyway, this is ESA's brief introduction. I went to the conference two weeks ago. Because I don't really know what everyone's background is, I will first introduce what ecology is. If you google ecology or go directly to wiki, they will tell you that this is a choice between biological interaction and biological organism interaction with the environment. In short, I want to learn how two organisms interact, including how we grab food, how we eat each other, how we help each other, and how the environment affects our relationship with each other. All the discussions about this are ecological issues. I don't think anyone will know what I'm talking about, because it's too abstract. So when we talk about ecology, we immediately think of the existence of hierarchy. Just like when we were in high school, we learned that the human body is made up of cells, and the cells make up the tissues, and the tissues make up the organs, the circulatory system, and the individual. So in fact, ecology has a similar hierarchy. From the smallest organism, which is a biological individual, to the vast majority of these biological organisms, which you can see in the picture below. This should be a geoduck, I don't know what to draw. Then with a group of geoducks, they are all the same, a group of geoducks. Then it becomes a population ecology. Then if you go up, in addition to this geoduck, there may be geoducks, snakes, eagles, other animals, trees, grass. There are different kinds of animals living in the same time and space. This forms a community, a group. In short, many kinds of animals live in the same place. This is called a community ecology. If we enlarge the scope a little more, for example, we want to know that in addition to so many kinds of animals, where do they get the energy they need? Where do their excrements go? What kind of changes did their excrements make to the non-biological environment? Then it becomes an ecosystem. An ecosystem is a system. The whole thing, biological and non-biological, all come together and become an ecosystem. Then there are people studying ecosystem ecology. Then to a bigger point is the biosphere. I think this is a whole planet. It's not a very meaningful classification. But if you insist on expanding, it becomes a whole planet. Then these levels, each level has its own questions to explore. For example, people who study individual creatures will want to know how a creature grows. How do I react to the environment and so on? Then the population ecology of the ecosystem is that I want to know why this species is sometimes more and sometimes less. For example, the evaluation of fish resources is one of the important parts of the population ecology. For example, in Taiwan, I want to know how many fish I can catch this year. When should I catch it? When should I not catch it? This is the question that the population ecology has to answer. The community ecology is like I just said. Different interactions between different species. So the most critical question is why there are so many species in the world. How do so many species live together in this world? Then it becomes so many species on the Internet. What impact does the environment of non-living things in this world have? This is the ecosystem ecology. This is roughly the hierarchy in ecology. I identify myself as a community slash a little ecosystem ecologist. What I'm interested in is that I want to know how each species interacts with each other. What impact do they have on the environment? Or to be more direct with people. There are many species in this system or in this natural environment. What impact does it have on me? What does it matter to me? Then talk about community ecology or ecosystem ecology. A question that everyone will ask is why there are so many species in this world. This is a very, very old question. It's also very old and very important. It's also a question that we haven't answered in 100 years. Because from the very beginning of 19 I want to explain why there are so many species of people. I have written here that it is Brunel. Then I put a table on the right for everyone to see. When we want to answer this question, I want to know why there are so many species. What is the evolution of ecologists' ideas from the past to the present? In short, I think it can be divided into two periods. The first period. The reason I'm talking about this now is because this question is very difficult to answer. And it's also very important. So now a lot of ecological research is actually inseparable from The most fundamental question I'm asking now. Why are there so many species? Then when we answer this question, For ancient ecologists, The way we try to answer is I think it's a turnip, a pit, this method. In other words, how many resources can be used in the world? Or how many niches can be occupied by species? Then we should have seen so many species. So including Grinnell, including Elton, These are all very famous ecologists. They all proposed various ideas about niches or ecological hypocrisy. I will not explain their ideas one by one. In short, the concept of this niche is a turnip, a pit. Until about 2000, The previous idea was that a turnip, a pit. At most, the environment changes. Then create different turnip pits. So there are different species. Sometimes the turnip pit is big, sometimes the turnip pit is small. The density of species will be high. The density of species will be low, etc. So different species can coexist together. Until about 2000, There was a man named Steve Hoppe. I don't know what his idea was. But he proposed a theory. There is no turnip, a pit. Everything is random. He proposed a neutral theory. We see so many species. Is it because of a random phenomenon? The most classic example is that he took a long-term experimental observation station. Then he went to study the changes in the composition of the species in the experimental observation station, etc. Then he found that he could use a random model. Make a random mathematical model. You can predict the changes in the composition of long-term species. The prediction is not bad. Then he proposed a theory. There are so many species in the world. It's not a turnip, a pit. There is a big species pool over there. In this species pool, ABCD may appear this year. EFGH appeared this year. ABEH appeared the following year. He went on like this. After this neutral theory was proposed, everyone thought that we had been faking for almost 100 years. So there was another man named Peter Chesson. The fourth bullet point. He proposed another theory. We call it Modern Coexistence Theory. He proposed this theory. Under this framework, neutral theory is just a special case under this framework. In other words, Peter Chesson's framework includes the theories we know so far. He wanted to make a big framework to tell us that different communities, different natural environments, we will see different species. Because there are different mechanisms behind it. So he proposed a fluctuation-independent mechanism. The first part of his modern theory is that when the environment has reached a balance, how many species will exist here determines how much the resources used by these species are different compared to the ability of their resources to interact. How much difference does their ability make? This is called stabilizing. For example, if I love to eat apples and he loves to eat oranges, then I will eat my apples well, and he will eat his oranges well. If not, we can coexist in this world without any problems. Then the concept of using different resources is called stabilizing. Another one is that we both love to eat apples, but my speed of eating apples is about the same speed as yours. So we fight fiercely. I take a bite, you take another bite. I take another bite, you take another bite. So we keep fighting each other. So no one can kill each other. So we can coexist in this world very tightly. This is a mechanism of equalizing. Under this framework, the neutral theory I just mentioned is an extreme state of equalizing. Everyone is the same. No one can kill another person. So there are a bunch of species in this world fighting each other here. So far, everyone seems to be a little satisfied. I think it's not bad. We can use this big framework to explain why we can see so many different species. But in fact, current ecologists can't understand these theories of Jason. On the one hand, it seems that we are enough here. We just need to know that everyone fights each other fiercely, or that everyone uses different resources. You can explain why there are different species here and then continue to extend. But when some current theoretical ecologists continue to dig Jason's framework, they will find that there is actually another mechanism, which is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism. The reason why this mechanism allows species to coexist is because it feels that the environment is constantly changing. So the system can't reach a balance or is on the way to a balance. So since we are still in a state where the environment is constantly changing, what we know now is that when we see these species, we can't use these theories that we have obtained in a balanced state to explain why we see these now. Of course, this is difficult because we don't know whether the natural environment we live in has reached a balance or has not reached a balance. So I think this is a big question. This is also the first thing I saw and I think it may be a topic that many ecologists will start to study in the future. How to quantify a system has it reached a balance or has it not reached a balance? If it has not reached a balance, it is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism. How do we quantify these mechanisms? How do we use these mechanisms to explain how many different creatures I see in this system now? In the fluctuation-dependent mechanism, the main core is that the environment is constantly changing. So when the environment is constantly changing, if I like low resources, I can live a good life. When in low resources, I can find a way to get rid of people. Another person may be when in high resources, he will find a way to get rid of me. But because the environment is constantly changing, we have to adapt to the environment. This is the concept. It's not like what I eat, what you eat, and stay in a very stable state. Now the environment is changing, and we have our own density. There may also be feedback back to the environment. This is the storage effect If you are interested, I don't know if you are interested. If you are interested, you can go and see this paper I wrote. I think he wrote it very well. Then there is a sentence in a relatively flat language that tells us what the whole Coexistence Theory is talking about. I'll give you an example here. What is a fluctuation-dependent mechanism? This paper is also a good one. Sorry, the resolution is not very good. This is a new paper that came out recently. In this paper, he wants to prove one thing. Storage effect and relative non-linearity These two fluctuation-dependent mechanisms is the reason for the coexistence of two species. You can see panel A and B. Different colors represent the density of different species. Yellow is one, blue is another. Then the background is either white or light, or gray represents the richness of resources. The background is dark or light, which represents the richness of resources. So we can see from panel A and panel B, when there is less resource, it is not so dark. Yellow wins. On the other hand, when it's darker, in panel C, blue wins. But when we get to panel D, he deliberately adds resources in that system. Sometimes this system has a lot of resources, and then sometimes he takes the resources away, and then he adds resources and takes them away. It creates a human-made fluctuation. When we see a human-made fluctuation, yellow and blue can coexist. No one can eliminate anyone. For example, this is the first real experiment proof. Of course, everyone does this kind of experiment. But this paper has a special point. In addition to telling you that you can really coexist, it really uses a mathematical model to really quantify how much storage effect I can have, how much relative non-inheritance. So let everyone know that there are really two kinds of environmental changes that allow species to coexist. It's not just that we want to say, because of environmental change, everyone has different levels of resources, so of course we can coexist. This kind of verbal argument is right. So this is the first one. I think it's a pretty eye-opening study. Then at the seminar, I also saw a few talks, so I tried to quantify why species can coexist in changing environments, and what is the mechanism behind their coexistence. Is everyone suitable for different environments? Or is the environment I affect affecting me? This is the first highlight I saw at this conference. I have a question. So you're showing this now, for example, there are two species of yellow and blue. Yellow and blue species. Both of them have a feature, which is that you can see the peak at each point. That is, the slope is very large. So it means that these two species themselves have a very small response time scale to change. Maybe less than a day. But if you look at the D-panel in the lower right corner, it's like external excitation. That is, their environment changes, their scale is ten days, five days, a few days, a few days, a few days. That's the width of black and white. So the time scale of the species system and the time scale of excitation are very different. So you can see this phenomenon very clearly. But if today the species must use about the same time, or even longer, to respond to external excitation, then the whole model will fail. Because it may not have time to reach the next state. The environment has changed again, and then it will collapse in the end. It's a mess. Yes, it's possible. So what I'm talking about now, this fluctuation-dependent thing, is actually what you're talking about. It's a relative concept. If the environment is changing, it must be fluctuation-dependent. It can be said that my own life cycle is very short. So even if the environment changes once a year, I have already given birth dozens of times a year. Yes, I have reproduced dozens of times. So the change in the environment is meaningless to me. So I just said that in a system, now we want to answer this question. Ecologists, the first difficult point is that we have to identify the change in the environment for the life cycle of my species. In terms of life cycle, is it dependent or independent? If it is dependent, if it is fluctuation-dependent, we can then ask which mechanism is it? Does this answer your question? Oh, thank you. Yes. Okay, next, like I just said, this is a very old question. It's so old that some people don't want to answer this question anymore. So everyone started to ask this question in another way. Now there are so many species in this environment. So then, the question just answered is why does this environment allow me to see so many species? But now, everyone may find it boring, so ask it the other way around. So many species, what impact will it have on this environment? This question or this question is actually not something that happened recently, but it suddenly became obvious. It probably started in the late 1990s. There was a person in Europe who did a project called Ecotron. In other words, it's probably like... I don't know if everyone knows that there is a kind of... Give you a glass ball, and then there is grass inside. There are different kinds of grass, and then there are some moss, something wet, like a planet. Ecotron is very similar to that concept. It's a microcosm. Their idea is that the more species there are in this microcosm, the more biomass I will see. I can see the more creatures in it. It started this Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning Branch. Biodiversity How does it affect the function of this system? Function means what is the production volume of this system? How efficient is this system with the nutrient salt? The most famous one will be brought to everyone. It's in Minnesota. There is a person who is the first person to really do this large-scale experiment. You can see it in the picture on the left. It's called Seagull Creek. It really digs a piece of land and plants this grass. You can see a plot. There may be five kinds of grass in this plot. There is one kind of grass in another plot. There are several kinds of grass in a plot. It goes down like this. Or in Germany, Jena Experiment also does similar things. There are different kinds of grass in each block. When I have a lot of grass, does this grass use different resources in order to survive? In total, I can take more resources from the environment. As I just said, there is a concept of a radish pit. The whole pit is full. We take a lot of resources from the system. A lot of biodiversity grows out of it. This kind of research has been done for more than 10 years. We have now discovered a general pattern. When we see a lot of species in an environment, when biodiversity increases, when X goes to the right, we see that those functions will increase. How much resources can we take away? How much biodiversity can we produce? We all see a function that increases but saturates. This is the knowledge we know now. However, the knowledge we have now is all based on grass experiment. This is the grass experiment I just showed here. We all plant grass or raise a certain nutrient-based organism. Then we find that the nutrient-based organism functions well. However, this is not enough. In our world, it is impossible to have only grass. At least there are humans. At least insects eat grass. Rabbits eat grass. Lions eat rabbits. There are many different kinds of life. Now, there are a few questions that ecologists want to continue to explore. The first is the function of these ecosystem. For example, the production of biomass, etc. Is it related to what we need in this world? This is the first one above. How do we put these functions and services I will talk about what service is later. Service is the function we need. How do we put these two things together? Otherwise, people will think that our ecological system is locked in a academic ivory tower. Purely understand the phenomenon of the natural environment and then it's over. No more. Everyone hopes that we ecologists can contribute to some changes in the environment, etc. This is the first ecologicalists want to continue to study. Next is what I just said. All the knowledge we learn now is very flat. Or the same nutrient class. But the natural environment is a very three-dimensional state. So should we put the natural environment into a very three-dimensional state? The third one is how can we predict accurately or accurately when the environment changes to reflect how many species will be left now. How many species will be left and how many functions will be left, etc. So these three are from Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning. The three branches I think are ecological systems. I can't say it's obvious, but a lot of people are doing it. Now I'm going to talk about the first one. What is ecosystem services? These services mean all people live in this world and learn about these functions, patterns, all the things you need. And then, I remember it was the UN or something. The report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. At that time, it was clearly defined that our current ecosystem is actually the whole earth. These services are provided to people. There are these four categories, supporting provisioning, regulation, and culture. The first few are easier to understand. Supporting services that support the operation of the earth. For example, the cycle of nutrients. You may have learned that in biology, we learn about the water cycle, the egg cycle, the carbon cycle, the carbon cycle, and so on. Or how much production can be used by us, etc. Then these will support how much food can we eat, the water cycle, because of the water cycle, how much clean water can be used by us. This is provisioning. Or when we want to manage a system, we don't want to have too many pests. We want to maximize, for example, maximize the number of corn. We don't want too many corn pests. The number of pest control is the regulation services. These three are relatively easy to understand. I think, and it is also now a big problem for ecologists. We call it cultural services. What I wrote here is you can think of everything related to culture. These are from the natural environment. You get these ideas. You get these inspirations. You get these education. You get to learn. But as long as it's related to the environment, it's not that kind of ugly. You don't have it. If you don't have it, you won't die. But you will live unhappily. These things are called culture. So some people say because nature is beautiful, it's too beautiful. So we can't maximize it. We can only rely on the beauty of our inner self to appreciate nature. Then there are other people who say that this is meaningless. I say what you say is beautiful. I can also say that there is nothing in the world that is the most beautiful. So how do we quantify the services of these ecosystems, especially the services of culture? This is something that some people are trying to figure out now. And that part of people includes a lot of economists. Because economists are very... I think they are very good at estimating the value of this thing in the market, and then how to trade it. So some people will think that we will quantify these services. For example, a piece of clean water is worth 2.5 million. Then a big clean swimming pool is worth 2.5 million. A big clean swimming pool is worth 10 million. I don't know. Just try to quantify it or find a way to... I can't say that this can be traded, but use money to quantify it so that we can do better management, etc. Or we can use money to quantify almost everything in the world in a system of communication. This is the second thing I think that eco-scientists are facing now. This is also a problem that some scholars who are not trained in ecology want to help us solve. How to quantify ecosystem services, especially these services related to culture. Even when I was at this conference, there was a special workshop. There were quite a few participants. Almost 100 people. Almost 100 people were discussing ecosystem services. This is the second thing that I think is pretty cool. Okay. Next, I just said that when we understand biodiversity, what we understand now is relative to others. When we understand the impact of biodiversity on the environment, our understanding of biodiversity is relative to others. So probably after 2005 and 2007, some people started to think that biodiversity should be said that the natural environment is a very three-dimensional state. We should not only consider the same nutrient class. We should consider all nutrient classes. So there are some studies that are also going to do pest control. Biological control. These studies on biodiversity will think that they first thought that if I want to control a pest, for example, this soil. We want to control this. This should be considered a insect. I don't know what kind of insect this is. Anyway, it's a pest. We want to control the number of pests. Then we should put a kind that will eat it at the bottom. Or is it better to put everything in? How should it be put to let the number of pests be suppressed to the minimum? At the beginning, when we consider a lot of different nutrients and a lot of different nutrient classes, the biodiversity we knew would really affect the ecosystem function. Does this still exist? This is the initial idea. Until recently, there have been more researchers who have invested in this research. Then we will think that in addition to different biological classes, should we think of the whole environment as a network? It's a concept of a food network. There are a lot of food networks. There are a lot of species that exist in this system at the same time. Then everyone eats each other. Everyone grabs food from each other. This research can actually involve a debate from a long time ago. Everyone will ask what kind of network and what kind of food network is the most stable state. Before the emergence of Biodiversity Ecosystem Function , everyone started to ask what kind of food network is the most stable. At that time, the pure research was purely thinking about how to prevent this food network from crashing. Maybe everyone is very good at connecting. Connectedness is very high. Everyone is in a small group. It's very close to each other. Then the small group and the small group are not so close to each other. How do these attributes of each network affect the stability of the entire network? Then put this idea into the idea of Biodiversity Ecosystem Function. Everyone will start to think that since each network has different attributes, different characteristics, then in the state of different characteristics, will there be different food networks with different characteristics? There will be different functions. For example, this opinion paper is not a real data paper. It provides an idea that when different food networks have different attributes, different characteristics, the energy flux is not discussing whether the entire network will crash easily. What we are discussing now is how much energy flows in and how much efficiency flows out in the end. Everyone started to ask this question. Theoretically, these are some of the network attributes. How does it affect the function of this part? This question is the question I am most interested in asking in the future. At the end, I will talk about my own research. It's very simple. My own research is very related to the question that some ecologists are starting to ask. How do different network attributes affect the function of this network? This research, I haven't seen it yet. I think it's fun and cool, but I haven't seen too much real data doing this. Now it's mainly a very theoretical research. In other words, we have to use a more three-dimensional way to understand how diversity affects the function of the entire ecosystem. We are still in a theoretical stage. Theoretically, this full web, everyone is very tight-knit, or everyone's interaction is very strong. I might see this kind of function. Theoretically, because this can't be blamed on ecologists, because I really want to quantify a full web. It's actually not easy. Of course, many people are already doing full web. But what everyone does is for example, fish in a lake, I want to open his stomach and see what kind of small fish and shrimp he ate. In my own words, A fish ate C, D, E shrimp, and so on. Use various methods to see what kind of things a species eats, or if there are any different species eating and eating each other. Use different microscopes, or like I just said, God content research. We can't blame that we don't have enough empirical data, but this empirical data is not easy to get. So everyone will start to dilute, for example, we use the size of the organism to decide, to estimate what he will eat. Because for example, a fish, a goldfish, I mean the goldfish in the aquarium, he may eat a shark. So we can use its size to estimate what kind of food a goldfish can eat. Then use the size of the organism and the size of the organism such a trait to help each species what kind of food it may have. Then build a more realistic, not so theoretical food network. Then we use some attributes of this food network to see what the function of this food network is. But it's the same, it's still built on a theory that small fish can't eat big fish. So it's not necessarily that this is the most perfect food network. It's just that the biologists are starting to think how to answer this question. Including myself, I also think this is the next topic I want to continue to study. After finishing these chapters of my Ph.D. I want to do some research. I've been talking to the people at the conference, including some biologists from France or Germany. They all say they have a huge greenhouse effect. Like what I just said, I want to make it three-dimensional, like what you can see on this picture. There are a lot of things like a greenhouse. Different food networks are made up of different greenhouses. Like the German IDIV, I think that organization is really cool. First, they have a lot of money. Second, the topics they study are all my friends. I like them a lot. They seem to have a lot of future ideas. This is my second conference. I think it's worth sharing what biologists are thinking about. Third, this research was done by my former teacher, Sutiara. She's my teacher. But she doesn't know much about math. Anyway, biologists want to do this kind of research. We're all looking for a cause-and-effect relationship. For example, why are there so many species in the world? What's the reason? We saw this result. Why are there so many species? Why do we get these functions? The reason is that there are so many species. The result is that there are these functions. But in addition to actually doing experiments, for example, like I just said, it's hard to really quantify the cause-and-effect relationship of a phenomenon other than the cause-and-effect relationship. Sutiara doesn't know much about math, so I just made it up. It's based on this theorem, the Taken's theorem, to develop a set of mathematical models or a set of statistical methods. We should talk about statistical methods. It can measure the impact of a population on another population. It can use the relationship of time series to know if a population has a direct impact on another population. For example, this is the most common example. Red and blue are two species. So at the time of A, red and blue have a strong relationship. According to our theory, red is the cause of blue, blue is the effect of red, or vice versa. But when we get to B, we find that their relationship is opposite. It's negative. So we say, if red increases, let blue decrease, or vice versa. We use this correlation to infer the causality. Red and blue have nothing to do with each other. So we find that red and blue have no causality. However, these two time series are written from the mathematical formula above. In other words, red and blue, x and y, have a causality. But in our traditional ecological research, if we just do a bunch of correlations or don't do experiments, we can't know the causality of red and blue, x and y. However, using this method, cross-mapping, we can know the causality of red and blue. I mentioned this method because I saw the experiment room this year. The experiment room is not that big. It's just four or five people. They came to give a talk. Almost everyone came to give a talk. It seems to me that this method has been developed successfully. Let's use it. It's a kind of declaration of significance. A few years ago, when I went to ESA, there were some collaborators. However, it's not like this year. Almost the whole experiment room came to give a talk. Ecologists, let's use CCM. Let's use this method. Let's not do correlations. Let's not do x and y. Let's use CCM. Let's try to collect time series data to know who is the cause and who is the cause. It's a kind of declaration. I think it's great. Actually, ecologists are not that smart. To be honest, I decided to study ecology because my math is not good enough. I can't study physics. I can't study chemistry. I don't like to study humanities. So, I decided to study biology. I was happy to see the biology running around. I'm not good at math. So, I'm not sure if this method will work. I'm not sure. This method requires a good time series. As you know, in the current scientific research environment, every project, every grant may take 3 to 5 years. Maybe 10 years. It's a good time series. 3 to 5 years. 3 to 5 years time series may not be long enough to do CCM. To do convergence cross mapping. Next, what I just said, I just wrote A detects an impact on another population. In other words, if A's impact on B is C's impact, which is indirect, then we get A, B, C, these three time series. It's possible for me to catch A's impact on B. But this impact is actually through C. It's not A's direct impact on B. In other words, this method is not omnipotent. I can only tell you who might affect who. But whether this impact is a direct impact, I can't be sure. In other words, CCM, although it's powerful and cool, it can let us know the causality. But it still can't let us know the real causal relationship. Is the causality direct? So this method still has some shortcomings. But I think it's already a great way to let everyone who has a time series to try to answer the questions they want to answer. Some more traditional correlation analysis. This is probably the last one. Is the last one a summary? I don't know. I just summarized everything I just said. In short, we still have to ask the most classic question. How do species coexist? Why are there so many species? And now a way to answer this question. We have to consider environmental changes. Use fluctuation-dependent mechanisms to explain species coexistence. After species coexistence, we are trying to solidify our understanding of biodiversity. And find a way to know what impact biodiversity has on the environment we live in. For example, how much food can we eat? This kind of question. Next is causality inference. We really want to know some causal relationships. Through time series analysis, we want to know causal relationships. Finally, ecosystem services. I think it's a very mysterious term. I really think that Schneider University seems to love this term. We want to use ecosystem services to manage our... I forgot where it is. Anyway, it's a country in South America. I heard in the workshop that our government is trying to push the concept of ecosystem services. We want to use the concept of ecosystem services to manage the natural resources of our country. I think these are some interesting topics. After participating in this meeting, I saw some interesting topics. I want to learn more about the impact of network and diverse ecosystem functioning. Lastly, I think I don't know if this is a question or a concern. If you know a little bit about ecosystem services, you will know that there are so-called theoretical ecologists and empiricists. Some people's research is a computer or a pile of paper with a pile of equations or a framework. For example, I just talked about Peter Chesson who proposed the Modern Consistent Theory. Some people think it's meaningless to just think about it. I need to do experiments. These two I can't say two sides. The communication between these two ecologists is not so smooth. I think maybe some people think it's not bad. I don't think it's that smooth. Because theoretical ecologists are too smart and empiricists may not be able to keep up with their ideas. On the other hand, empiricists think we are materialistic enough. Theoretical ecologists think we are materialistic. The other people are empty-handed. So I think the communication between these two sides needs a strong theory. Then I will do experiments with these ecologists to build a bridge of friendship. Otherwise, I've been thinking about the mechanism of fluctuation-dependent and how to influence co-existence. It's meaningless if you can't do experiments. Or the most obvious example is I did a theoretical model and one of my committee members said is it useful to do so many theories? Can you really do experiments to verify your model prediction? So my second chapter is to do experiments to see if the predicted results can be seen in real life. It's like a debate. It's like a civilized blind date. This is what I want to say today. This is what I want to say today. What I saw at this conference and what I think ecologists are thinking about. Is there any time left? Actually, it's about time. But we can ask questions. Before asking questions, let's turn on the microphone for two seconds. Thank you, Feng Xun, for the speech. I don't know if you have any questions or comments. I have a similar question or a comment. You mentioned network analysis and causality interference. You mentioned time series analysis. These two technologies are very useful in physics. They are very useful in physics. They are very useful in physics. In fact, they are widely used. But I think the biggest problem is that physicists' habits. For example, there are water molecules in the water. There are one or two water molecules in the water. I don't know how to use ten water molecules. The computer can't predict. So I use one water molecule and one water molecule. So I use water molecules and one water molecule to check the phenomenon. Then I said that my model would have such a phenomenon. Then I went for experiments. Then I said I understood the flow of water. I think this can be delineated. Assuming things can be delineated in a condition like a time series, it would be more interesting. Otherwise, physicists say they can calculate one by one, but they can't do fluid mechanics. Then I said I would leave it to the computer. Then I asked the computer to do a large-scale numerical simulation to simulate some strange phenomena. If the experiment can't be done, I said the experiment wouldn't be done. But it doesn't mean it's wrong. Because in the real world, water is still flowing. This kind of research and operation is actually very difficult for a system with complex variables. So let's go back to the biological ecosystem. Of course, you can say it's easy to issue a paper. I just need to build up the model and let the computer calculate it. In the end, you still have to go back to whether you can explain what happened in this world and whether you can do experiments to verify it. But there will be a lot of difficulty in the middle. Then it becomes a very interesting thought study. But it's hard to say if it has an impact on the learning itself. I totally agree. If I remember correctly, the talk of the person next week is similar to what you just said. It's about building a climate model or a water texture model to understand some of the changes in the environment, etc. That's a very popular question for some ecologists right now. Because, as I just said, we want to know how to face this world. So if I can use a digital simulation and I know that the temperature here is one degree higher than the temperature in a black box, I don't know what's going on. Anyway, the sea level will rise by 50 meters. I feel very happy. If the prediction is accurate, I feel happy. But some ecologists think that it's like doing big data analysis. You don't know what's going on at all. You only know one cause and effect. So I think this is a question that depends on what you want to answer. If you really just want to solve an environmental problem or a human survival problem, you can do a data analysis and I can come up with an effective solution, that's great. But if I just want to increase my knowledge, I think knowledge is the most important thing. This is very meaningful to me. This is why I don't like big data analysis or environmental studies. That's the reason. In fact, there are some people in the conference who are trying to use CtS to collect more data to understand environmental changes. I don't think they have a good enough theoretical foundation. I don't pay too much attention to what they are doing. Thank you. Do you have any questions?
