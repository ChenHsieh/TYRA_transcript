0	9000	First of all, I would like to welcome everyone to our Chira Talk on August 4th.
9000	17000	We are honored to have Jason Hong, a student from Hong Shi An University, to give a speech on his latest research.
17000	23000	Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.
23000	27000	Before we start, let me briefly introduce Jason.
27000	31000	Jason graduated from the University of Taiwan in the Department of Physics.
31000	36000	He did his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
36000	39000	He is currently working as a postdoc in Michigan.
39000	45000	His current field of expertise is the application of super fast light in solid matter.
45000	50000	His main research topics include graphene optical sensors,
50000	61000	coherent exotonic effects in 2D materials, and cavity exotonic polaroids.
61000	66000	In today's talk, he will introduce some basic principles and applications of super fast light.
66000	78000	He will use super fast light and light-matter interactions to understand the dynamics of electrons in solid state physics.
78000	87000	He will also discuss related research in super fast light and exotonic effects.
87000	93000	If there are no further questions, let's welcome Jason to start his talk.
93000	96000	Hello everyone.
96000	100000	I am very happy to be invited to Chira Talk.
100000	105000	Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.
105000	116000	Today's topic is Coherent Exotonic Effects in 2D Materials.
124000	126000	This is today's outline.
126000	144000	In the beginning, I will talk about what super fast light is, the history of super fast light, and a very important technique called pump probe measurement.
144000	164000	On the other hand, I will briefly explain what is special about the acetone in the coherent exotonic materials.
164000	168000	Finally, I will talk about my recent research.
168000	175000	In the coherent exotonic materials, there are not only acetone, but also biacetone effects.
175000	180000	I will start with super fast light.
180000	188000	The so-called super fast light is actually a super fast phenomenon that uses light to study the extremity of time.
188000	198000	Generally speaking, the definition of a super fast phenomenon is the phenomenon between a femtosecond and a picosecond.
198000	203000	We call it a super fast phenomenon, but there is no clear definition.
203000	209000	Femtosecond is 10 to the power of negative 50 square seconds, and picosecond is 10 to the power of negative 20 square seconds.
209000	214000	However, we will briefly introduce the extent of time later.
215000	225000	The main reason why we use light to study these super fast phenomena is that there are many super fast phenomena that cannot be observed in other ways.
225000	228000	For example, the general method of electrolysis.
228000	235000	Everyone knows that electrolysis is basically to charge.
235000	241000	The charging time is actually around nanoseconds.
241000	256000	For example, the switch speed of these computers is about gigahertz, and gigahertz is about nanoseconds.
256000	268000	Even if the electrolysis is done well, the time you can observe is only about nanoseconds.
268000	271000	There is no way to do better.
271000	280000	If you want to observe these super fast phenomena with a shorter time period, you have to use light.
281000	290000	At this time, we have a technique called pump-up technique, and we can use it to observe these super fast phenomena.
290000	301000	Basically, in my own concept, light is basically photography, which is the art of capturing light.
301000	309000	For example, when we usually shoot small objects, this is called micro light.
309000	319000	When we turn a black and white camera into a color camera, what we are actually doing is photography.
319000	329000	We can study the reaction of a object to a different amount of light with different energy.
329000	331000	This is called photography.
331000	335000	The meaning of super fast photography is actually high-speed photography.
335000	344000	For example, when we watch TV, when a baseball player throws a ball, he basically uses high-speed photography to do these things.
344000	349000	Super fast photography basically uses high-speed photography to the extreme.
349000	351000	What is photography?
351000	353000	There is a picture here.
353000	360000	Basically, photography is that you have a light source, and the light source shines on your object, on your model.
360000	363000	The model will reflect light or penetrate light.
363000	367000	People don't penetrate light, so this is reflected light.
367000	377000	In the end, the reflected light is taken down by the photographer with these cameras.
377000	379000	This is called photography.
379000	383000	Sometimes you need something else.
383000	389000	For example, you need another assistant to remind your model to remember to smile.
389000	394000	When you add all these things together, this is called photography.
394000	401000	When it comes to super fast photography, I have to talk about the interesting history.
402000	406000	A long time ago, people had a question.
406000	419000	When a horse is running, is it possible that when the horse is running, the four legs will float in the air for a moment?
419000	428000	It may not seem like a problem now, but you may think it's not useful at all.
428000	434000	This was in the 1870s.
434000	438000	These people were very passionate about racing horses.
438000	441000	This was a very interesting question at the time.
441000	445000	People wanted to know how the horse ran.
445000	450000	But you can't see it with your eyes.
450000	455000	You can't record it and tell everyone how the horse ran.
456000	462000	At that time, there was a man named Leland Stanford.
462000	467000	He was the governor of California.
467000	475000	He thought that when the horse was running, the four legs might float in the air for a moment.
475000	477000	But no one believed him.
477000	481000	Leland Stanford was very rich.
481000	496000	He asked Edwin Muybridge, who was a photographer, to research how to capture these fast things.
496000	502000	He gave him a $25,000 research fund.
502000	505000	I think it was a huge amount of money at the time.
506000	513000	After several years of hard work, Muybridge invented the shutter.
513000	516000	The picture on the left is the shutter he invented.
516000	519000	Basically, it's a few boards.
519000	525000	He used a mechanical method to make the board fall.
525000	530000	When the board falls, it blocks the light.
530000	535000	When the light does not pass, it means that the camera will not continue to expose the light.
535000	544000	The shutter speed can be up to 500 microseconds.
544000	549000	This is where he did the experiment.
549000	551000	Basically, it's a racecourse.
551000	553000	The horse will run from here to here.
553000	556000	There are 24 cameras.
556000	560000	Each camera has a shutter.
560000	567000	When the horse runs like this, it will take pictures like this.
567000	571000	Then he got a picture like this.
571000	575000	Basically, you can see that there are 12 pictures here.
575000	578000	This is the continuous process of the horse running.
579000	588000	You can see that these two pictures clearly show that the horse's four legs are in the air.
588000	593000	But it's definitely not like the picture above.
593000	596000	This is a very wrong concept.
596000	600000	When the horse is in the air, it's definitely not the state of the legs.
600000	604000	It's probably the situation where the legs are shrunk.
605000	608000	This is an interesting story.
608000	619000	In that era of super fast light, the method was to take a light source and take a picture of the object you wanted to take.
619000	625000	How do we choose which time to take a picture?
625000	628000	Use a mechanical shutter.
628000	631000	The shutter switch is very fast.
631000	638000	At this time, we can take a picture that is short in time.
638000	645000	But everyone found that the mechanical shutter has a limit.
645000	648000	Basically, you can't do it faster than microseconds.
648000	651000	The next time is nanosecond.
651000	654000	How to enter this nanosecond?
655000	662000	An important invention is the light bulb.
662000	668000	The light bulb was invented in 1880.
668000	677000	So it was before Moonbridge.
677000	680000	What is a light bulb?
680000	683000	Light is produced by electricity.
683000	688000	Of course, ordinary light bulbs can't do this.
688000	691000	But the next invention is this.
691000	694000	We can use electricity to produce light.
694000	696000	So we can adjust this electricity.
696000	701000	The light we produce is a form of pulse.
701000	708000	You can turn on this light at a certain time and turn off this light at another time.
708000	718000	You can use this pulse to hit your object.
718000	722000	When the object is reflected back to the camera,
722000	728000	you just need to turn off the shutter when the pulse stops.
728000	736000	In this way, you can measure the time it takes for the pulse to stop.
737000	743000	This method is called frequency-shift observation.
743000	750000	The main concept is that we can't quickly adjust the shutter of the camera.
750000	753000	So we change it to adjust the light source.
753000	760000	Here are some photos of stroboscopes.
760000	765000	This is basically what you see in many photo studios.
765000	771000	On the left is a woman waving a golf club.
771000	774000	This speed is also very fast.
774000	783000	Basically, every frame is your flashlight hitting the woman.
783000	786000	Then it reflects back and you take a picture.
786000	795000	At the next moment, the next pulse hits the woman and you take another picture.
795000	802000	This inventor is a professor at MIT named Edgerton.
802000	805000	He has a nickname called Papa Flash.
805000	809000	Basically, Flash is Flashlight.
809000	814000	It's the light source you need for frequency-shift observation.
815000	820000	This method was invented in 1931.
820000	824000	The picture on the right is an example.
824000	833000	You can use this method to take a picture of the state of the bullet in the air.
833000	844000	We use frequency-shift observation to reach the level of nanoseconds.
844000	849000	How do we get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds?
849000	859000	The first thing is why we are particularly interested in picoseconds and femtoseconds.
860000	871000	It's because there are many physical phenomena that occur at this time.
871000	875000	For example, phonon vibration.
875000	883000	The vibration of the metal in this material is actually at the level of picoseconds.
884000	894000	There are also a lot of electrons in this material.
894000	908000	The events of activation and relaxation are actually at the level of femtoseconds.
908000	918000	This is why we want to get to the level of picoseconds and femtoseconds.
918000	930000	The main discovery that can break through nanoseconds is the discovery of magnetic laser.
930000	935000	Laser is basically a game media.
935000	942000	When the light passes through the game media, the light becomes stronger because of the feedback of the game media.
942000	950000	If you put the light in an optical cavity,
950000	965000	The optical cavity is basically made up of two high-reflection mirrors.
965000	968000	At this time, it becomes a laser.
968000	980000	Of course, we want the laser to output, so we use a semi-transparent mirror on one side to let the laser pass through.
980000	982000	At this time, you have a laser.
983000	993000	Another interesting thing is that when you have a cavity,
993000	1000000	What frequency of light can become a laser?
1000000	1010000	The important thing is that when the light passes through the cavity,
1010000	1015000	How to make it a coherent line?
1015000	1035000	The condition is that when the light passes through the cavity, the light-returned phase is the same.
1035000	1040000	This is the condition.
1040000	1048000	We can convert it to frequency.
1048000	1058000	At this time, you can see that the allowed optical mode is actually a positive integer.
1058000	1065000	Multiply by c divided by 2L, where L is the length of the optical cavity.
1065000	1072000	I have a question.
1072000	1080000	What kind of material is the game media?
1080000	1084000	There are many kinds of game media.
1084000	1087000	We can see all kinds of lasers on the market.
1087000	1095000	For example, there are semi-transparent lasers, CO2 lasers, and hydrogen peroxide lasers.
1095000	1099000	These are the game media.
1099000	1102000	Semi-transparent lasers are used as game media.
1102000	1106000	CO2 lasers are used as game media.
1106000	1111000	There are all kinds of game media.
1112000	1120000	As long as there are four lasers, there are two conditions.
1120000	1123000	The first condition is that there should be game media.
1123000	1125000	The second condition is that there should be an optical cavity.
1125000	1127000	All lasers are indispensable.
1127000	1132000	There are many ways to do it.
1133000	1142000	Can you give more details about the output coupler?
1142000	1145000	What is its main function?
1145000	1149000	Does it allow light to pass through?
1149000	1156000	The output coupler is actually a mirror.
1156000	1160000	It's just a semi-transparent mirror.
1160000	1169000	The first thing is that when the light travels through the cavity,
1169000	1174000	the gain should be greater than the loss.
1174000	1177000	The reflection rate should not be too low.
1177000	1180000	If the reflection rate is too low, the loss will be too high.
1180000	1187000	The gain should be greater than the loss.
1187000	1192000	The output coupler can also leak some light.
1192000	1196000	This creates a laser that can be used.
1196000	1209000	It means that half of the light can pass through the cavity.
1209000	1213000	This is the basic structure of a laser.
1213000	1218000	The current laser looks completely different from this one.
1218000	1228000	You can still point out what is game media, what is mirror, and what is its cavity.
1228000	1239000	The frequency of light that can be allowed is the frequency mode of the equality space.
1239000	1242000	Let's see what happens.
1242000	1254000	The picture above is a simulation of an optical mode in the cavity.
1254000	1257000	This is the output of the laser.
1257000	1259000	There is only one mode now.
1259000	1266000	The difference between the two modes is c divided by 2L.
1266000	1273000	You can see that the frequency of red and green are slightly different.
1273000	1276000	If we add these two modes together,
1276000	1281000	you can see that there is a beating effect.
1281000	1286000	You can see that there is something that looks like a pulse.
1286000	1289000	When there are four modes, this is more obvious.
1289000	1294000	These four modes are c divided by 2L.
1294000	1300000	You can see that the pulse of the output of the laser is more obvious.
1300000	1305000	Now we can keep adding until there are 30 modes.
1305000	1309000	You can see that there is a very obvious pulse here.
1309000	1316000	The general ultrafast laser has hundreds or thousands of modes.
1316000	1323000	This will make the pulse very obvious.
1323000	1328000	Another thing is why this thing is called a lock mode laser.
1328000	1334000	This is because when you add a lot of modes,
1334000	1338000	there is a condition that their phase must be fixed.
1338000	1342000	Then these pulses will be formed.
1342000	1347000	This blue line above
1347000	1351000	means that when the phase of these modes is locked,
1351000	1354000	you will see that there is a pulse.
1354000	1359000	However, when each optical mode has a different phase,
1359000	1361000	when they have a random phase,
1361000	1367000	you will see that this is probably a general CW laser.
1367000	1379000	The invention of lock mode laser is surprising.
1379000	1382000	The invention of lock mode laser was in the 1960s.
1382000	1384000	It was Charles Townes.
1384000	1386000	They made Mesa or something.
1386000	1391000	The first invention of lock mode laser was in 1965.
1391000	1393000	Five years after the invention of lock mode laser,
1393000	1396000	everyone has already discovered this lock mode laser.
1396000	1399000	After a period of time,
1399000	1407000	everyone tried to shorten the pulse of the laser.
1407000	1410000	In 1980,
1410000	1414000	a method called CPA was invented.
1414000	1423000	It's called True Pulse Amplification.
1423000	1428000	Basically, it stretches the laser pulse,
1428000	1431000	amplifies it, and compresses it.
1431000	1434000	At that time,
1434000	1437000	it took about 6 femtoseconds to make a die laser.
1437000	1439000	It was in 1985.
1439000	1446000	Another technology was invented.
1446000	1448000	It's called Tie Sapphire.
1448000	1453000	It just changes the laser gain media.
1453000	1458000	There are many reasons why Tie Sapphire is good.
1458000	1460000	Basically, it is a semiconductor laser.
1460000	1463000	At that time,
1463000	1469000	the technology of Tie Sapphire made rapid progress.
1469000	1472000	In 2000,
1472000	1475000	it took about 4 femtoseconds.
1475000	1482000	This is equivalent to a light oscillation.
1482000	1487000	A light in a visible oscillation.
1487000	1490000	This is a limit.
1490000	1492000	There is no way to continue.
1492000	1496000	The application of lock mode laser is very wide.
1496000	1502000	The first application is to use the laser's pulse.
1502000	1506000	It can be used for a short time.
1506000	1510000	Basically, it uses rapid pulses
1510000	1513000	to study atomic physics, solid physics,
1513000	1519000	chemical reactions, and so on.
1519000	1521000	It can also be used for light communication
1521000	1524000	and higher harmonic generation.
1524000	1526000	Another direction is
1526000	1529000	because the pulse laser
1529000	1535000	collects energy that does not have a pulse time
1535000	1542000	in the time that there is a pulse.
1542000	1545000	This means that in the pulse time,
1545000	1550000	the laser beam will be very strong.
1550000	1553000	Generally, you can get the power
1553000	1557000	to 10 to the power of 8 or 10 to the power of 4.
1557000	1562000	This can be used to do a lot of interesting things.
1562000	1565000	If you have super strong light sources,
1565000	1568000	you can use it to do non-linear light studies.
1568000	1572000	Recently, some people want to do nuclear fusion.
1572000	1576000	There are also laser cutting or cosmetic surgery.
1576000	1580000	You can see that the picture on the right
1580000	1586000	is basically the laser's peak power.
1586000	1591000	It is the laser beam within the pulse time.
1592000	1599000	It is also a very fast-growing laser.
1599000	1607000	It can now reach the power of 1 terawatt.
1607000	1620000	Of course, you can use the laser as a light source.
1620000	1625000	Because the pulse time is very short,
1625000	1631000	you should be able to take very short pictures.
1631000	1633000	But there is a problem here.
1633000	1636000	The time is too short to figure out
1636000	1639000	how to trigger an event.
1639000	1645000	How do you know when the event will happen?
1645000	1647000	If you don't know when it will happen,
1647000	1649000	you can't take pictures at all.
1649000	1652000	So the next question is
1652000	1655000	how to find the event you want.
1655000	1658000	The general approach is like this.
1658000	1660000	The picture on the right.
1661000	1666000	We are using a pulse laser.
1666000	1668000	It will emit a pulse.
1668000	1670000	The red dot is a pulse.
1670000	1677000	When the red dot reaches the beam splitter,
1677000	1680000	the pulse will be divided into two parts.
1680000	1688000	One part will go through the pump beam.
1688000	1693000	The other part will go through the pull beam.
1693000	1699000	The pump beam will hit the sample first.
1699000	1703000	The pump beam will hit the sample first.
1703000	1709000	After the pump beam hits the sample,
1709000	1714000	the pull beam will pass the sample
1714000	1717000	and reach the detector.
1718000	1721000	What is the purpose of doing this?
1721000	1726000	We use pump beam to trigger the sample,
1726000	1730000	such as electrons or electrons.
1730000	1733000	Anyway, no matter what we do,
1733000	1735000	we generate an event.
1735000	1738000	After a while,
1738000	1744000	we use pull beam to observe the event.
1744000	1749000	Another thing you can do is
1749000	1751000	to adjust the time difference
1751000	1755000	between the pull beam and pump beam.
1755000	1758000	You can adjust the time difference
1758000	1763000	between the pull beam and pump beam.
1763000	1768000	You will put the pull beam on a delay stage.
1768000	1772000	When you adjust the delay stage,
1772000	1775000	the pull beam will start to change.
1775000	1777000	Then you can see
1777000	1781000	the evolution of the event over time.
1781000	1783000	For example,
1783000	1789000	this is a pump probe measurement on a pull beam.
1789000	1791000	This is how it works.
1791000	1793000	Basically,
1793000	1799000	a pull beam with a wavelength of 800 nm
1799000	1802000	hits the sample.
1802000	1808000	Then you use a wavelength of 100 nm
1808000	1810000	as a probe.
1810000	1813000	When the probe passes the sample,
1813000	1819000	you use the detector to observe the pull beam.
1819000	1824000	To simplify it into a dynamic picture,
1824000	1826000	it looks like this.
1826000	1829000	First, you use the pump beam
1829000	1834000	to stimulate the electron.
1834000	1838000	When the electron decays for a while,
1838000	1841000	you use the pull beam
1841000	1844000	to observe the graphene absorption
1844000	1847000	under the current situation.
1847000	1853000	The experimental picture looks like this.
1854000	1858000	When the time is zero,
1858000	1860000	the pump beam and the pull beam
1860000	1862000	are in synch.
1862000	1865000	This is when you get the biggest reaction.
1865000	1867000	As time goes by,
1867000	1870000	the electron slowly relaxes
1870000	1875000	and decays back to its original state.
1875000	1878000	I have a question.
1878000	1879000	Sorry.
1879000	1883000	Why does the curve
1883000	1887000	have a different direction?
1887000	1891000	This is the experimental detail.
1891000	1893000	Okay.
1893000	1895000	This is not what I want to talk about.
1895000	1897000	But this is an interesting thing.
1897000	1904000	This is what the paper discusses.
1904000	1907000	The blue line is graphene in charge neutral,
1907000	1910000	which means it is not doping.
1910000	1913000	You can see this.
1913000	1917000	This should be the absorption increase.
1917000	1920000	I can tell you that
1920000	1923000	this line represents the absorption increase.
1923000	1927000	It means that when you hit an optical beam
1927000	1929000	to stimulate the electron,
1929000	1931000	you will produce more carriers,
1931000	1939000	resulting in a higher conductivity of graphene.
1939000	1941000	When the conductivity increases,
1941000	1943000	the absorption increases.
1943000	1950000	The red line is graphene in doping state.
1950000	1953000	Why is it negative?
1953000	1955000	It means that the absorption is decreasing.
1955000	1957000	The reason is that
1957000	1959000	when you hit an optical beam,
1959000	1962000	you will increase the temperature of the electron.
1962000	1965000	When the temperature of the electron increases,
1965000	1967000	the conductivity will decrease.
1967000	1970000	Because it has more scattering.
1970000	1973000	When the conductivity decreases,
1973000	1976000	the absorption decreases.
1976000	1979000	Do you mean that it will produce photons?
1979000	1981000	Yes.
1981000	1983000	Okay. Thank you.
1983000	1985000	Basically,
1985000	1987000	this means that
1987000	1989000	there are a lot of things to study
1989000	1992000	in the super fast speed.
1992000	1994000	Very interesting.
1994000	1996000	Thank you. Please go on.
1996000	1998000	On the other hand,
1998000	2000000	I want to talk about
2000000	2002000	the two-dimensional semiconductor.
2002000	2004000	The first two-dimensional material discovered is graphene.
2004000	2006000	As you know,
2006000	2010000	graphene is made by the method of exfoliation.
2010000	2012000	Basically, you take a tape
2012000	2015000	and put the graphite on it.
2015000	2018000	Then you stick the tape on the substrate
2018000	2020000	and tear it up.
2020000	2022000	Then you will find that
2022000	2025000	there is a layer of graphene on the substrate.
2025000	2027000	It looks like this.
2027000	2029000	Then you look under the microscope
2029000	2031000	and you can find these
2031000	2034000	only one-dimensional flakes.
2034000	2037000	This is the band structure of graphene.
2037000	2039000	Another thing is
2039000	2042000	this is the band structure of graphene.
2042000	2047000	There are two Dirac cones.
2047000	2051000	There are two different Dirac cones.
2051000	2053000	The reason for these two cones
2053000	2055000	is that
2055000	2057000	graphene has inversion symmetry
2057000	2059000	and time reversal symmetry.
2059000	2061000	As a result,
2061000	2063000	this conduction band
2063000	2065000	and valence band
2065000	2067000	will always have
2067000	2069000	a intersection point.
2069000	2071000	Basically,
2071000	2073000	this thing
2073000	2075000	means that
2075000	2077000	graphene is always a metal.
2077000	2079000	It is always a metal.
2079000	2081000	Metal is often bad
2081000	2083000	and can't do what we want to do.
2083000	2085000	Another thing is
2085000	2089000	because it has two different values,
2089000	2092000	there is another degree of freedom
2092000	2094000	called pseudo-spin degree of freedom.
2094000	2096000	This means that
2096000	2098000	you can put these messages
2098000	2101000	on these two different values.
2101000	2105000	If you can manipulate this value,
2105000	2108000	you can treat it as 0 and 1.
2108000	2110000	For example, 0 is the k-value
2110000	2112000	and 1 is the negative k-value.
2112000	2114000	The advantage of this thing is that
2114000	2116000	we used to use
2116000	2118000	Electron's degree of freedom
2118000	2120000	to make computers.
2120000	2122000	Basically,
2122000	2124000	the current computer
2124000	2126000	uses charge.
2126000	2128000	When you turn on the transistor,
2128000	2130000	the charge will flow.
2130000	2132000	When you turn off the transistor,
2132000	2134000	the charge will not flow.
2134000	2136000	One of the things
2136000	2138000	we want to do in the future
2138000	2140000	is to use spin.
2140000	2142000	When you turn on a switch,
2142000	2144000	the spin-up electrons can pass
2144000	2146000	and the spin-down electrons
2146000	2148000	cannot pass.
2148000	2150000	There is a proposal
2150000	2152000	that we can also use
2152000	2154000	Electron's degree of freedom
2154000	2156000	in the k-value
2156000	2158000	or negative k-value
2158000	2160000	as 0 or 1.
2160000	2162000	However,
2162000	2164000	the first thing is
2164000	2166000	that metal cannot do anything.
2166000	2168000	We have to find a way
2168000	2170000	to open a gap.
2170000	2172000	This is a saying.
2172000	2174000	We want to find a semiconductor.
2174000	2176000	One of the semiconductors
2176000	2178000	is called
2178000	2180000	Transition Metal Dichotronate.
2180000	2182000	Basically,
2182000	2184000	its lattice
2184000	2186000	is similar to graphene.
2186000	2188000	One of its atoms
2188000	2190000	is transition metal,
2190000	2192000	which is probably
2192000	2194000	Mo or tungsten.
2194000	2196000	The other
2196000	2198000	atom site
2198000	2200000	is sulfur
2200000	2202000	or selenium.
2202000	2204000	At this time,
2204000	2206000	you will find
2206000	2208000	that this lattice structure
2208000	2210000	does not have
2210000	2212000	inversion symmetry.
2212000	2214000	You can't find a point
2214000	2216000	where the inversion symmetry
2216000	2218000	returns to its original state.
2218000	2220000	This means
2220000	2222000	that it will open a gap.
2226000	2228000	It turns out that
2228000	2230000	the basic structure
2230000	2232000	of this lattice structure
2232000	2234000	looks like this.
2234000	2236000	It has a gap.
2236000	2238000	There is no state
2238000	2240000	in the middle.
2240000	2242000	This is a gap.
2242000	2244000	However, it still has
2244000	2246000	k and negative k-value.
2246000	2248000	You can still
2248000	2250000	use it
2250000	2252000	to make valetronics.
2252000	2254000	However,
2254000	2256000	you still have a semiconductor.
2256000	2258000	Because you have a semiconductor,
2258000	2260000	you can still
2260000	2262000	study electrons.
2262000	2264000	Sometimes,
2264000	2266000	you can study electrons.
2266000	2268000	Sometimes,
2268000	2270000	you can reduce
2270000	2272000	Fermi energy.
2272000	2274000	Fermi energy
2274000	2276000	is in the middle.
2276000	2278000	At the same time,
2278000	2280000	electrons and holes
2280000	2282000	form acetone.
2282000	2284000	Acetone is a particle
2284000	2286000	where electrons and holes
2286000	2288000	form.
2288000	2290000	These properties
2290000	2292000	lead to
2292000	2294000	Transition Metal Dichotomy.
2294000	2296000	Transition Metal Dichotomy
2296000	2298000	is one of the popular
2298000	2300000	research topics.
2300000	2302000	We hope
2302000	2304000	to use it
2304000	2306000	to make valetronics
2306000	2308000	or other
2308000	2310000	optoelectronics.
2310000	2312000	Our question is
2312000	2314000	that we are
2314000	2316000	using valetronics
2316000	2318000	to make valetronics.
2318000	2320000	Another interesting thing
2320000	2322000	about valetronics is
2322000	2324000	that
2324000	2326000	we mentioned acetone.
2326000	2328000	Acetone is an electron and a hole.
2328000	2330000	You can imagine
2330000	2332000	that an electron and a hole
2332000	2334000	have coolant in them.
2334000	2336000	They are heterogeneous.
2336000	2338000	That's why they are heterogeneous.
2338000	2340000	When they are bound together,
2340000	2342000	they release their energy.
2342000	2344000	That's why their energy
2344000	2346000	is a little bit low.
2346000	2348000	How much energy do they release?
2348000	2350000	It depends on
2350000	2352000	how strong
2352000	2354000	the electric field between them is.
2354000	2356000	In the three-dimensional
2356000	2358000	semiconductor,
2358000	2360000	there is a hole
2360000	2362000	and an electron.
2362000	2364000	Because of this,
2364000	2366000	the electric field
2366000	2368000	goes through
2368000	2370000	many other backgrounds.
2370000	2372000	These backgrounds
2372000	2374000	cause the electric field to go down.
2374000	2376000	The coolant interaction
2376000	2378000	between them is not very strong.
2378000	2380000	The binding energy goes down.
2380000	2382000	In the two-dimensional material,
2382000	2384000	you will find that
2384000	2386000	the electric field
2386000	2388000	between them is in the air.
2388000	2390000	In the air,
2390000	2392000	the electric field
2392000	2394000	is not screened.
2394000	2396000	After the electron and hole
2396000	2398000	are bound together,
2398000	2400000	a very good
2400000	2402000	acetone is formed.
2402000	2404000	This is one of the reasons
2404000	2406000	why people want to study acetone.
2406000	2408000	Acetone is
2408000	2410000	similar to
2410000	2412000	the concept of
2412000	2414000	hydrogen.
2414000	2416000	You may have
2416000	2418000	found acetone
2418000	2420000	in Galileo Arsenal.
2420000	2422000	Basically,
2422000	2424000	this is
2424000	2426000	basically
2426000	2428000	an electron
2428000	2430000	and a hole.
2430000	2432000	They are not bound together.
2432000	2434000	They have a continuum.
2434000	2436000	The continuum is here.
2436000	2438000	Under this continuum,
2438000	2440000	you will have
2440000	2442000	the electron and hole's
2442000	2444000	bound state.
2444000	2446000	They have 1s, 2s, 3s,
2446000	2448000	just like the hydrogen atom.
2448000	2450000	Under this spectrum,
2450000	2452000	you will see
2452000	2454000	the spectrum of 1s, 2s, 3s.
2454000	2456000	In the
2456000	2458000	Transition Metal Dichotomy,
2458000	2460000	there is the same thing.
2460000	2462000	However,
2462000	2464000	the effect is very strong.
2464000	2466000	You can see
2466000	2468000	the energy scale
2468000	2470000	in the left picture.
2470000	2472000	The binding energy
2472000	2474000	is about
2474000	2476000	3-4 MeV.
2476000	2478000	In the Transition Metal Dichotomy,
2478000	2480000	we can't even see
2480000	2482000	the continuum.
2482000	2484000	The reasonable
2484000	2486000	prediction is
2486000	2488000	that the binding energy
2488000	2490000	is about 300 MeV.
2490000	2492000	You can only see
2492000	2494000	the first state
2494000	2496000	and the second state.
2496000	2498000	The next question is
2498000	2500000	that you have these values
2500000	2502000	and these acetones.
2502000	2504000	What is the question?
2504000	2506000	The question we want to ask is
2506000	2508000	whether we can
2508000	2510000	break the value degeneracy
2510000	2512000	We just mentioned
2512000	2514000	the value degeneracy.
2514000	2516000	We just mentioned the value.
2516000	2518000	However, the energy of
2518000	2520000	these two values is exactly the same.
2520000	2522000	So,
2522000	2524000	the question is
2524000	2526000	that if you store
2526000	2528000	the information in the value,
2528000	2530000	but you don't
2530000	2532000	touch
2532000	2534000	the energy of the value,
2534000	2536000	the information
2536000	2538000	will not change.
2538000	2540000	The final result is the same information.
2540000	2542000	This is basically
2542000	2544000	meaningless.
2544000	2546000	What we want to do now is
2546000	2548000	that if you have a way
2548000	2550000	to store the information
2550000	2552000	in these values,
2552000	2554000	if you use
2554000	2556000	some methods
2556000	2558000	to change
2558000	2560000	the energy of the acetone,
2560000	2562000	then
2562000	2564000	you can read
2564000	2566000	the final result.
2566000	2568000	The final result will be changed.
2568000	2570000	Depending on
2570000	2572000	the energy of the value,
2572000	2574000	the information will change.
2574000	2576000	This is called manipulation.
2578000	2580000	One of the ways
2580000	2582000	is to use the magnetic field.
2582000	2584000	Using the magnetic field,
2584000	2586000	you can pull
2586000	2588000	the energy of the value
2588000	2590000	on one side up
2590000	2592000	and the energy on the other side down.
2592000	2594000	Then you will see
2594000	2596000	that the red line
2596000	2598000	and the blue line
2598000	2600000	represent two values.
2600000	2602000	When the magnetic field is zero,
2602000	2604000	the two values are exactly the same.
2604000	2606000	When you add a strong magnetic field,
2606000	2608000	the energy of the two values
2608000	2610000	will be slightly separated.
2610000	2612000	At this time,
2612000	2614000	you can use
2614000	2616000	the magnetic field
2616000	2618000	to do valetronics.
2618000	2620000	Another thing is that
2620000	2622000	we want to ask
2622000	2624000	whether light
2624000	2626000	can do valetronics.
2626000	2628000	Another thing is that
2628000	2630000	in the valetronics,
2630000	2632000	the acetone has
2632000	2634000	very strong valence.
2634000	2636000	Will the valence
2636000	2638000	affect the behavior of the machine?
2638000	2640000	The reason
2640000	2642000	why I ask this question
2642000	2644000	is that
2644000	2646000	we have found similar things
2646000	2648000	in Galen-Arsenal.
2648000	2650000	In Galen-Arsenal,
2650000	2652000	you will have
2652000	2654000	various free electrons
2654000	2656000	and holes.
2656000	2658000	It is called plasma.
2658000	2660000	Then you will have some acetone.
2660000	2662000	When the density of acetone
2662000	2664000	is high enough,
2664000	2666000	biacetone will appear.
2666000	2668000	Biacetone is
2668000	2670000	two acetone bonds
2670000	2672000	together.
2672000	2674000	It is a bit like a hydrogen atom.
2674000	2676000	When you have more
2676000	2678000	density,
2678000	2680000	it will form a droplet atom.
2680000	2682000	There are many acetone bonds.
2682000	2684000	These
2684000	2686000	biacetone
2690000	2692000	quasiparticles
2692000	2694000	also have
2694000	2696000	some applications.
2696000	2698000	In Galen-Arsenal's
2698000	2700000	quantum darts,
2700000	2702000	you can use these biacetones
2702000	2704000	to make entangled photons.
2704000	2706000	You can also
2706000	2708000	use optical control
2708000	2710000	to change
2710000	2712000	the behavior
2712000	2714000	of acetone.
2716000	2718000	Next,
2718000	2720000	I want to answer
2720000	2722000	two questions.
2722000	2724000	The first question
2724000	2726000	is...
2726000	2728000	Sorry, I have a question.
2728000	2730000	Can we go back to the last page?
2730000	2732000	You just said
2732000	2734000	that
2734000	2736000	if you want to break
2736000	2738000	the valley degeneracy,
2738000	2740000	let's say
2740000	2742000	your sample is
2742000	2744000	molybdenum sulfide.
2744000	2746000	If you want to break
2746000	2748000	the degeneracy,
2748000	2750000	if I am an alloy
2750000	2752000	or some doping,
2752000	2754000	will it break the degeneracy?
2758000	2760000	If the material is not...
2760000	2762000	OK.
2762000	2764000	If you want to break
2764000	2766000	the valley degeneracy,
2766000	2768000	there is a
2768000	2770000	symmetry condition.
2770000	2772000	The symmetry condition
2772000	2774000	for the valley degeneracy
2774000	2776000	is time-reversal symmetry.
2776000	2778000	If your material
2778000	2780000	has time-reversal symmetry,
2780000	2782000	it will have valley degeneracy.
2784000	2786000	Then,
2786000	2788000	time-reversal symmetry
2788000	2790000	will break the time-reversal symmetry.
2790000	2792000	For doping,
2792000	2794000	it is not exactly break.
2794000	2796000	Doping is not.
2796000	2798000	Doping is not.
2798000	2800000	So, apart from the magnetic field,
2800000	2802000	do you know any other factors?
2804000	2806000	Light.
2806000	2808000	Is that all?
2808000	2810000	If so...
2810000	2812000	I don't think so.
2812000	2814000	And the current.
2814000	2816000	The current is...
2816000	2818000	If the current is long,
2818000	2820000	it will break the time-reversal symmetry.
2822000	2824000	So, if it has a lot of charge,
2824000	2826000	the current...
2828000	2830000	The current is...
2830000	2832000	The current is flowing.
2832000	2834000	So, for example,
2834000	2836000	when you are measuring,
2836000	2838000	if you apply a bias to it,
2838000	2840000	it may...
2840000	2842000	This will slightly break.
2842000	2844000	This is the valley hole effect.
2844000	2846000	OK.
2846000	2848000	Thank you.
2848000	2850000	You can continue.
2850000	2852000	OK.
2852000	2854000	The answer to the first question
2854000	2856000	is yes.
2856000	2858000	But this thing
2858000	2860000	is about optical stock effect.
2860000	2862000	Now,
2862000	2864000	let's look at a very simple model.
2864000	2866000	You have a...
2866000	2868000	a...
2868000	2870000	a material.
2870000	2872000	It has a state.
2872000	2874000	It has a black state called state A.
2874000	2876000	It has a red state called state B.
2876000	2878000	At this time,
2878000	2880000	if you apply a light,
2880000	2882000	it is non-resonant.
2882000	2884000	Then we
2884000	2886000	control the light's
2886000	2888000	frequency
2888000	2890000	under the
2890000	2892000	AB resonance.
2892000	2894000	Its energy will be under this.
2894000	2896000	At this time,
2896000	2898000	state A will produce a
2898000	2900000	virtual state under state B.
2900000	2902000	state B
2902000	2904000	will also produce a virtual state
2904000	2906000	above state A.
2906000	2908000	If you
2908000	2910000	consider these
2910000	2912000	dipole interactions,
2912000	2914000	if you
2914000	2916000	consider the two corresponding states,
2916000	2918000	these two states
2918000	2920000	will repel each other.
2920000	2922000	Usually, if you
2922000	2924000	write a matrix,
2924000	2926000	you add...
2926000	2928000	The matrix's
2928000	2930000	cross-section represents two energies.
2930000	2932000	The off-diagonal
2932000	2934000	represents
2934000	2936000	two...
2936000	2938000	represents their interactions.
2938000	2940000	If you turn on the interactions,
2940000	2942000	these two energies will be separated.
2942000	2944000	The following
2944000	2946000	is the same.
2946000	2948000	At this time, you will find that the red state
2948000	2950000	will move up and the black state will move down.
2950000	2952000	When
2952000	2954000	you apply light,
2954000	2956000	the transition
2956000	2958000	from black to red
2958000	2960000	will increase
2960000	2962000	its energy.
2962000	2964000	It will blue shift.
2964000	2966000	The quantity
2966000	2968000	of
2968000	2970000	the
2970000	2972000	blue shift
2972000	2974000	will
2974000	2976000	be determined
2976000	2978000	by this formula.
2978000	2980000	Basically, this formula
2980000	2982000	tells you that
2982000	2984000	it is equal to
2984000	2986000	how strong the light
2986000	2988000	is.
2988000	2990000	It is equal to
2990000	2992000	detuning.
2992000	2994000	Detuning is the energy difference
2994000	2996000	between the AB resonance
2996000	2998000	and the light.
2998000	3000000	This is called detuning.
3000000	3002000	However,
3002000	3004000	there is one thing.
3004000	3006000	If you take these things
3006000	3008000	into numbers,
3008000	3010000	you will find that
3010000	3012000	this change is very small.
3012000	3014000	Therefore,
3014000	3016000	it is true that you can use light
3016000	3018000	to change the energy of the machine,
3018000	3020000	to change the energy of the acetone.
3020000	3022000	However,
3022000	3024000	because this change is too small,
3024000	3026000	you need to adjust the intensity
3026000	3028000	very, very strongly.
3028000	3030000	The intensity of light is very, very strong.
3030000	3032000	Therefore, at this time, you need to sell
3032000	3034000	the laser to do this thing.
3034000	3036000	Of course,
3036000	3038000	someone has done this before.
3038000	3040000	You can see
3040000	3042000	that this paper
3042000	3044000	was published in 1986.
3046000	3048000	This is
3048000	3050000	basically
3050000	3052000	demonstrating
3052000	3054000	the optical star effect
3054000	3056000	on the gallium arsenide.
3056000	3058000	Basically,
3058000	3060000	you take a piece of gallium arsenide
3060000	3062000	quantum well.
3062000	3064000	The pump is 806 nm.
3064000	3066000	Its energy is lower
3066000	3068000	than
3068000	3070000	the energy of acetone.
3070000	3072000	Then,
3072000	3074000	you use another beam of light,
3074000	3076000	which is a probe.
3076000	3078000	Its function is
3078000	3080000	to see
3080000	3082000	if your spectrum
3082000	3084000	is changing
3084000	3086000	when the pump is on.
3086000	3088000	You can see that
3088000	3090000	here
3090000	3092000	at negative 2 picoseconds,
3092000	3094000	negative 2 picoseconds is this line.
3094000	3096000	Negative 2 picoseconds
3096000	3098000	means that
3098000	3100000	when you hit the probe,
3100000	3102000	your pump hasn't come yet.
3102000	3104000	Therefore,
3104000	3106000	its original spectrum
3106000	3108000	is two peaks.
3108000	3110000	One is heavy acetone.
3110000	3112000	The other is light acetone.
3112000	3114000	This is acetone in gallium arsenide.
3116000	3118000	When it's 0 picoseconds,
3118000	3120000	it means that the pump
3120000	3122000	and the probe are
3122000	3124000	hitting the sample at the same time.
3124000	3126000	You can see that
3126000	3128000	the resonance of acetone
3128000	3130000	is getting smaller.
3130000	3132000	The resonance of acetone
3132000	3134000	is getting smaller.
3134000	3136000	It means that its energy
3136000	3138000	is getting bigger.
3138000	3140000	When you turn off
3140000	3142000	the pump,
3142000	3144000	when the pump
3144000	3146000	is at 1.2 picoseconds,
3146000	3148000	the resonance
3148000	3150000	of acetone
3150000	3152000	moves back.
3152000	3154000	This is an interesting effect.
3154000	3156000	When you hit the pump,
3156000	3158000	when you hit the pump,
3158000	3160000	the resonance of acetone
3160000	3162000	moves slightly.
3162000	3164000	When you turn off the pump,
3164000	3166000	the resonance of acetone
3166000	3168000	moves back.
3176000	3178000	What's the situation
3178000	3180000	in Transition Metal Dichotomy?
3180000	3182000	What's the situation
3182000	3184000	in Transition Metal Dichotomy?
3184000	3186000	What's the situation
3186000	3188000	in Transition Metal Dichotomy?
3188000	3190000	The two values
3190000	3192000	will correspond to
3192000	3194000	different helicity light.
3194000	3196000	We can use
3196000	3198000	the left and right light
3198000	3200000	to distinguish the two values.
3200000	3202000	We can do this.
3202000	3204000	We choose
3204000	3206000	the left light.
3206000	3208000	It only couples
3208000	3210000	to the K-value.
3210000	3212000	We choose
3212000	3214000	the light
3214000	3216000	which is lower than
3216000	3218000	the resonance of acetone.
3218000	3220000	When there is light,
3220000	3222000	the resonance of acetone
3222000	3224000	will slightly blue-shift.
3224000	3226000	If we send
3226000	3228000	a probe
3228000	3230000	of the left light,
3230000	3232000	we will see
3232000	3234000	a blue-shift.
3234000	3236000	If we send a probe of the right light,
3236000	3238000	the resonance of acetone
3238000	3240000	will slightly blue-shift.
3240000	3242000	By using this method,
3242000	3244000	we can break
3244000	3246000	the VAD degeneracy.
3246000	3248000	Let's try
3248000	3250000	to see if it's right.
3250000	3252000	This is our sample.
3252000	3254000	We choose
3254000	3256000	to use Moebillion Dicillinide
3256000	3258000	as our sample.
3258000	3260000	We have
3260000	3262000	encapsulated
3262000	3264000	Moebillion Dicillinide
3264000	3266000	in these two HBNs.
3266000	3268000	It's in boron nitride.
3268000	3270000	The reason why we do this
3270000	3272000	is that
3272000	3274000	there is a study
3274000	3276000	that says
3276000	3278000	in boron nitride,
3278000	3280000	the quality
3280000	3282000	of Moebillion Dicillinide
3282000	3284000	is very good.
3284000	3286000	This is the reason
3286000	3288000	why we do this.
3288000	3290000	This is...
3290000	3292000	Sorry.
3292000	3294000	Is it necessary
3294000	3296000	to use low temperature
3296000	3298000	in this kind of measurement?
3298000	3300000	Or can we use room temperature?
3300000	3302000	You mean in this...
3302000	3304000	Yes.
3304000	3306000	We have this
3306000	3308000	in room temperature.
3308000	3310000	We can see this
3310000	3312000	in room temperature.
3312000	3314000	But some can't be seen.
3314000	3316000	So...
3316000	3318000	We can't do
3318000	3320000	what we want to do.
3320000	3322000	But
3322000	3324000	if it's Moebillion Dicillinide,
3324000	3326000	it can be seen in room temperature.
3326000	3328000	Yes.
3328000	3330000	Will there be some...
3330000	3332000	Because I always think...
3332000	3334000	I don't know much about this.
3334000	3336000	Will there be some phonons in room temperature?
3336000	3338000	Won't those affect
3338000	3340000	these observations?
3340000	3342000	There is an important thing here.
3342000	3344000	The light we emit is always
3344000	3346000	lower than the energy of acetone.
3346000	3348000	So basically,
3348000	3350000	it won't be absorbed
3350000	3352000	by the material.
3352000	3354000	It just passes through.
3354000	3356000	Okay.
3356000	3358000	So there won't be any phonons.
3358000	3360000	Yes.
3360000	3362000	This is a very important question.
3362000	3364000	Okay.
3364000	3366000	Thank you.
3366000	3368000	This is the sample's
3368000	3370000	reflectivity.
3370000	3372000	Basically,
3372000	3374000	E-reflectivity is a solution.
3374000	3376000	You can see this is Moebillion Dicillinide
3376000	3378000	in room temperature.
3378000	3380000	When we lower it
3380000	3382000	to low temperature,
3382000	3384000	you can see the peak
3384000	3386000	becomes narrower.
3386000	3388000	The intensity of the peak becomes larger.
3390000	3392000	The width of the peak
3392000	3394000	is about 5 MeV.
3394000	3396000	Compared to
3396000	3398000	before,
3398000	3400000	when we didn't
3400000	3402000	use boron-nitride
3402000	3404000	encapsulation,
3404000	3406000	the line width of CVD
3406000	3408000	is about 30 MeV.
3408000	3410000	Without
3410000	3412000	encapsulation,
3412000	3414000	the sample is about 10 MeV.
3414000	3416000	When we
3416000	3418000	demonstrate the sample,
3418000	3420000	the line width is about 5 MeV.
3420000	3422000	This means the quality of the sample
3422000	3424000	is very good.
3424000	3426000	Another interesting thing
3426000	3428000	is that we can see
3428000	3430000	the absorption
3430000	3432000	curve.
3432000	3434000	The absorption curve
3434000	3436000	changes from 30%
3436000	3438000	to very large.
3438000	3440000	We can even make it
3440000	3442000	close to 100% absorption.
3442000	3444000	There are
3444000	3446000	other interesting questions,
3446000	3448000	but I won't
3448000	3450000	talk about it today.
3450000	3452000	If you are interested,
3452000	3454000	you can discuss it.
3454000	3456000	I have a small question.
3456000	3458000	Have you compared
3458000	3460000	the sample of CVD
3460000	3462000	with the sample of
3462000	3464000	Isfoliade?
3464000	3466000	The quality?
3466000	3468000	Yes.
3468000	3470000	We have compared.
3470000	3472000	Generally speaking,
3472000	3474000	Isfoliade is better?
3474000	3476000	Yes, much better.
3476000	3478000	Much better means
3478000	3480000	if we measure
3480000	3482000	absorption or PL,
3482000	3484000	the line width of
3484000	3486000	Isfoliade sample
3486000	3488000	is about 5 to 10 MeV.
3488000	3490000	But the CVD
3490000	3492000	is about 30 MeV.
3492000	3494000	Is it because of some defects?
3494000	3496000	Yes,
3496000	3498000	because
3498000	3500000	the CVD sample
3500000	3502000	has a lot of
3502000	3504000	inhomogeneous broadening.
3504000	3506000	The source of inhomogeneous broadening
3506000	3508000	is basically those defects.
3508000	3510000	Yes.
3510000	3512000	Thank you.
3512000	3514000	This is the
3514000	3516000	setup of PoundProbe.
3516000	3518000	This is a simple diagram.
3518000	3520000	On the left,
3520000	3522000	there is a laser.
3522000	3524000	We divide it into two parts.
3524000	3526000	One part is called PoundProbe.
3526000	3528000	PoundProbe
3528000	3530000	Because the laser
3530000	3532000	has a wide bandwidth,
3532000	3534000	we use a spectrometer
3534000	3536000	to divide the light.
3536000	3538000	We only take
3538000	3540000	about 2 MeV of
3540000	3542000	line width light
3542000	3544000	and let PoundProbe
3544000	3546000	run to a delay stage.
3546000	3548000	The other half of the light
3548000	3550000	is called Probe.
3550000	3552000	We let it run to
3552000	3554000	a delay stage
3554000	3556000	and let it hit a Sapphire.
3556000	3558000	The role of Sapphire
3558000	3560000	is to make
3560000	3562000	Probe light produce
3562000	3564000	nonlinear effect.
3564000	3566000	Then it will
3566000	3568000	basically change
3568000	3570000	the color of the light
3570000	3572000	and it will
3572000	3574000	hit the sample
3574000	3576000	and study the sample.
3576000	3578000	Finally, we put the Probe light
3578000	3580000	into a spectrometer
3580000	3582000	to divide the light
3582000	3584000	and put it on
3584000	3586000	the detector.
3586000	3588000	This is basically the picture on the right.
3588000	3590000	We use
3590000	3592000	a picosecond
3592000	3594000	laser light
3594000	3596000	with a very sharp
3596000	3598000	line width light
3598000	3600000	to hit the sample.
3600000	3602000	Then we send
3602000	3604000	a Probe with many colors
3604000	3606000	and this Probe
3606000	3608000	is very short,
3608000	3610000	to hit the sample
3610000	3612000	and study what we want to study.
3612000	3614000	The result is...
3620000	3622000	The result is
3622000	3624000	something like this.
3624000	3626000	Let's take a look at
3626000	3628000	the picture in the middle.
3628000	3630000	The x-axis is
3630000	3632000	the delay,
3632000	3634000	which is the time
3634000	3636000	between the Probe and the pump.
3636000	3638000	The y-axis
3638000	3640000	is the delay.
3640000	3642000	The x-axis is the energy,
3642000	3644000	which is the energy
3644000	3646000	of the Probe light.
3648000	3650000	We see
3650000	3652000	the red
3652000	3654000	or blue
3654000	3656000	represents
3656000	3658000	the difference
3658000	3660000	between the pump
3660000	3662000	and the non-pump.
3662000	3664000	Let me explain
3664000	3666000	the meaning of this picture.
3666000	3668000	The first thing
3668000	3670000	is that
3670000	3672000	all the effects
3672000	3674000	occur within
3674000	3676000	1-1 picosecond.
3676000	3678000	This means that
3678000	3680000	only the pump light
3680000	3682000	hits the sample
3682000	3684000	and the non-pump light
3684000	3686000	hits the sample.
3686000	3688000	This is a
3688000	3690000	coherent effect.
3690000	3692000	This is
3692000	3694000	what we want to see.
3694000	3696000	If you
3696000	3698000	draw a line
3698000	3700000	within 0 picosecond,
3700000	3702000	you will get this.
3702000	3704000	This
3704000	3706000	basically tells you
3706000	3708000	how the reflectivity
3708000	3710000	changes
3710000	3712000	when the pump and probe
3712000	3714000	hit the sample.
3714000	3716000	We also have
3716000	3718000	the normal reflectivity of the sample.
3718000	3720000	The reflectivity of the sample
3720000	3722000	without the pump.
3722000	3724000	This is what we can measure.
3724000	3726000	If we add
3726000	3728000	these two pictures,
3728000	3730000	we can see that
3730000	3732000	the reflectivity
3732000	3734000	of the sample
3734000	3736000	increases
3736000	3738000	when there is a pump.
3738000	3740000	The reflectivity
3740000	3742000	of the sample
3742000	3744000	decreases when there is a pump.
3744000	3746000	Basically,
3746000	3748000	this is a shift.
3748000	3750000	The red part of the peak
3750000	3752000	increases
3752000	3754000	and the blue part decreases.
3754000	3756000	This means that
3756000	3758000	the peak is blue-shifted.
3758000	3760000	This is a blue-shift
3760000	3762000	effect.
3762000	3764000	To draw a picture,
3764000	3766000	we use
3766000	3768000	a ready-tuner
3768000	3770000	sigma plus light.
3770000	3772000	We probe
3772000	3774000	the k-value.
3774000	3776000	At this time,
3776000	3778000	the energy of the k-value
3778000	3780000	is blue-shifted.
3780000	3782000	This is what the picture tells us.
3782000	3784000	OK.
3784000	3786000	But
3786000	3788000	another thing is
3788000	3790000	that
3790000	3792000	we have done this before.
3792000	3794000	This is
3794000	3796000	Berkeley's
3796000	3798000	group.
3798000	3800000	There is another group,
3800000	3802000	MIT's group.
3802000	3804000	They have done this before.
3806000	3808000	This measurement
3808000	3810000	shows that
3810000	3812000	if the intensity
3812000	3814000	of the pump
3814000	3816000	is very high,
3816000	3818000	the blue-shift
3818000	3820000	is about 3 MeV.
3820000	3822000	This 3 MeV
3822000	3824000	means that
3824000	3826000	we have talked about
3826000	3828000	using magnetic field
3828000	3830000	to break the value degeneracy.
3830000	3832000	If you want
3832000	3834000	the energy
3834000	3836000	to change 3 MeV,
3836000	3838000	you have to add 60 Tesla's
3838000	3840000	magnetic field.
3840000	3842000	This is basically impossible.
3842000	3844000	Normally,
3844000	3846000	you can't do
3846000	3848000	60 Tesla's magnetic field.
3848000	3850000	However,
3850000	3852000	we can
3852000	3854000	break the value
3854000	3856000	degeneracy
3856000	3858000	at this rapid rate.
3858000	3860000	We can also
3860000	3862000	make the energy
3862000	3864000	shift very large.
3864000	3866000	But
3866000	3868000	the previous research
3868000	3870000	showed that
3870000	3872000	k'-value
3872000	3874000	basically has no effect.
3874000	3876000	Because these two are not coupled,
3876000	3878000	you will think that
3878000	3880000	it has no effect.
3880000	3882000	However,
3882000	3884000	we also found
3884000	3886000	some strange effects.
3886000	3888000	Because
3888000	3890000	the curve of k'-value
3890000	3892000	is the opposite
3892000	3894000	of the curve of k'-value,
3894000	3896000	it means that
3896000	3898000	this is a redshift.
3898000	3900000	When we use
3900000	3902000	sigma plus,
3902000	3904000	k'-value is redshifted.
3906000	3908000	The next thing
3908000	3910000	we want to talk about
3910000	3912000	is what happened.
3916000	3918000	In addition to
3918000	3920000	making a light
3920000	3922000	and observing it,
3922000	3924000	we can also change
3924000	3926000	the energy of the reflected light.
3928000	3930000	What we just showed
3930000	3932000	is detuning
3932000	3934000	equal to 50.
3934000	3936000	It's about this.
3936000	3938000	Omega x
3938000	3940000	is about 50 mEV.
3940000	3942000	We see a redshift.
3942000	3944000	However,
3944000	3946000	when we increase
3946000	3948000	the photon energy
3948000	3950000	of the pump light,
3950000	3952000	the detuning will decrease.
3952000	3954000	The detuning will be slightly smaller.
3954000	3956000	We see that
3956000	3958000	the peak becomes splitting.
3958000	3960000	If we
3960000	3962000	adjust the photon energy
3962000	3964000	very close to
3964000	3966000	the resonance of acetone,
3966000	3968000	we will find that
3968000	3970000	the curve is completely opposite.
3970000	3972000	It is a blueshift.
3974000	3976000	What does this mean?
3978000	3980000	When you see
3980000	3982000	a redshift to a blueshift,
3982000	3984000	the first thought is
3984000	3986000	is this a new resonance?
3986000	3988000	Next,
3988000	3990000	we need to ask
3990000	3992000	how to explain this phenomenon.
3994000	3996000	Let's go back
3996000	3998000	to the beginning.
3998000	4000000	In the beginning,
4000000	4002000	you have a light state.
4002000	4004000	You have K-value acetone.
4004000	4006000	You have K'-value acetone.
4006000	4008000	When you insert
4008000	4010000	a sigma plus light,
4010000	4012000	you will shift
4012000	4014000	the light state
4014000	4016000	down
4016000	4018000	and the K-value acetone up.
4018000	4020000	This leads to
4020000	4022000	if you send
4022000	4024000	a sigma plus light
4024000	4026000	in,
4026000	4028000	this will be a blueshift.
4030000	4032000	But there is a question.
4032000	4034000	Why?
4034000	4036000	Theoretically,
4036000	4038000	the light state will also
4038000	4040000	be a redshift.
4040000	4042000	This means that
4042000	4044000	the K'-value should also be a blueshift.
4044000	4046000	Why
4046000	4048000	hasn't anyone noticed this?
4048000	4050000	This means
4050000	4052000	that
4052000	4054000	this picture is wrong.
4054000	4056000	When we
4056000	4058000	consider the
4058000	4060000	Arpio Stark effect,
4060000	4062000	in addition to
4062000	4064000	the light state,
4064000	4066000	the K-value acetone,
4066000	4068000	and the K'-value acetone,
4068000	4070000	we need to consider more states.
4070000	4072000	What are these?
4072000	4074000	This is
4074000	4076000	a two-acetone state.
4076000	4078000	Basically,
4078000	4080000	you can
4080000	4082000	excite another acetone.
4082000	4084000	If you insert
4084000	4086000	a sigma plus light,
4086000	4088000	you will have a K-acetone.
4088000	4090000	You will have an acetone in the K-value.
4090000	4092000	If you insert
4092000	4094000	a sigma plus light,
4094000	4096000	you can have
4096000	4098000	two acetones in the K-value.
4098000	4100000	You can also
4100000	4102000	insert a sigma plus light
4102000	4104000	and a sigma minus light.
4104000	4106000	You will have a K-value acetone.
4106000	4108000	You can also have
4108000	4110000	K'-value acetone
4110000	4112000	and K'-value acetone.
4112000	4114000	These states
4114000	4116000	are actually
4116000	4118000	in your transition.
4118000	4120000	They all need to be
4120000	4122000	considered.
4122000	4124000	If you
4124000	4126000	consider like this,
4126000	4128000	you will find that
4128000	4130000	the energy of K-value acetone
4130000	4132000	does not change.
4132000	4134000	Because you have a light state
4134000	4136000	that will move it up.
4136000	4138000	But you have
4138000	4140000	a two-acetone state
4140000	4142000	that pushes it down.
4142000	4144000	So it will actually
4144000	4146000	stay at a fixed energy.
4146000	4148000	But your light state will move down
4148000	4150000	because it is moved down by K-value.
4150000	4152000	Your K'-value
4152000	4154000	will also move down.
4154000	4156000	At this time, you will find that
4156000	4158000	if you insert a sigma minus light,
4158000	4160000	the degree of moving down
4160000	4162000	is the same.
4162000	4164000	So the sigma here
4164000	4166000	should not change.
4166000	4168000	The next question is that
4168000	4170000	in addition to these states,
4170000	4172000	we know that there is another state
4172000	4174000	called bi-acetone.
4174000	4176000	As explained earlier,
4176000	4178000	bi-acetone is the interaction
4178000	4180000	between two acetones
4180000	4182000	to produce some binding energy.
4182000	4184000	This binding energy
4184000	4186000	will make the state's
4186000	4188000	energy move down.
4188000	4190000	This state
4190000	4192000	will also affect
4192000	4194000	the K'-value.
4194000	4196000	We claim that
4196000	4198000	the experimental results we see
4198000	4200000	are from these bi-acetones.
4200000	4202000	How do we explain this?
4202000	4204000	Let's go back to
4204000	4206000	the experimental data.
4206000	4208000	We can see that
4208000	4210000	this is the detuning dependence.
4210000	4212000	From left to right,
4212000	4214000	it is redshift to blueshift.
4214000	4216000	When it is redshift,
4216000	4218000	the photon energy
4218000	4220000	is relatively small.
4220000	4222000	The photon energy
4222000	4224000	is relatively small.
4224000	4226000	So the pump
4226000	4228000	will have this effect
4228000	4230000	in addition to this effect.
4230000	4232000	This effect
4232000	4234000	will cause a virtual state
4234000	4236000	above the K'-value.
4236000	4238000	It will push
4238000	4240000	the energy of the K'-value down.
4240000	4242000	This will cause
4242000	4244000	the probe value
4244000	4246000	to redshift.
4248000	4250000	When you move
4250000	4252000	the photon energy
4252000	4254000	of the pump
4254000	4256000	very close to the acetone,
4256000	4258000	the virtual state
4258000	4260000	produced by
4260000	4262000	the bi-acetone
4262000	4264000	is below
4264000	4266000	the K'-value.
4266000	4268000	If it is below the K'-value,
4268000	4270000	it will push
4270000	4272000	the K'-value
4272000	4274000	above the K'-value.
4274000	4276000	At this time,
4276000	4278000	you will see a blueshift.
4278000	4280000	This is how we explain
4280000	4282000	our data.
4282000	4284000	In the middle,
4284000	4286000	the photon energy
4286000	4288000	matches the
4288000	4290000	bi-acetone and acetone transition.
4290000	4292000	When these two
4292000	4294000	energies match,
4294000	4296000	the state will split.
4296000	4298000	We can see that
4298000	4300000	there is a split here.
4300000	4302000	Based on this method,
4302000	4304000	we can determine
4304000	4306000	the difference
4306000	4308000	between the two-acetone state
4308000	4310000	and the bi-acetone state
4310000	4312000	energy.
4312000	4314000	The energy difference
4314000	4316000	is the binding energy.
4316000	4318000	Based on the detuning result,
4318000	4320000	the binding energy
4320000	4322000	is 20 MeV.
4322000	4324000	This is similar to
4324000	4326000	what we have seen
4326000	4328000	in TMDC
4328000	4330000	to see the
4330000	4332000	effect of bi-acetone.
4332000	4334000	It matches
4334000	4336000	these effects.
4342000	4344000	The last thing we do
4344000	4346000	is to write
4346000	4348000	our theory
4348000	4350000	as an effective theory.
4350000	4352000	Because we are
4352000	4354000	experimentalists,
4354000	4356000	we cannot write a complete theory.
4356000	4358000	So we try to write
4358000	4360000	the interaction
4360000	4362000	of all these states.
4362000	4364000	Basically,
4364000	4366000	we only consider
4366000	4368000	the transition
4368000	4370000	from ground state
4370000	4372000	to K'-value.
4372000	4374000	The state related to
4374000	4376000	ground state
4376000	4378000	will change
4378000	4380000	the state of ground state,
4380000	4382000	which is K'-value and ground state.
4382000	4384000	This is a 2x2 matrix.
4384000	4386000	The state of K'-value
4386000	4388000	will change
4388000	4390000	the state of
4390000	4392000	free 2-acetone
4392000	4394000	and the state of
4394000	4396000	bi-acetone.
4396000	4398000	This will form
4398000	4400000	a 3x3 matrix.
4400000	4402000	If you solve this 3x3 matrix,
4402000	4404000	you will get
4404000	4406000	this prediction.
4410000	4412000	The picture on the left
4412000	4414000	shows the experiment.
4414000	4416000	As you can see,
4416000	4418000	the experiment matches the theory.
4418000	4420000	I want to emphasize
4420000	4422000	that this is an effective theory.
4422000	4424000	Many things are fitting.
4424000	4426000	If there is a theory here,
4426000	4428000	I hope this theory
4428000	4430000	can help us
4430000	4432000	to calculate
4432000	4434000	how these parameters
4434000	4436000	come from.
4436000	4438000	This may involve
4438000	4440000	many-body theory.
4440000	4442000	This is the conclusion.
4442000	4444000	Today, I talked about
4444000	4446000	the history of super-fast light theory
4446000	4448000	and the technique of pump-prop.
4448000	4450000	I also
4450000	4452000	showed you
4452000	4454000	the effect of
4454000	4456000	acetone in 2-acetone.
4456000	4458000	I hope
4458000	4460000	you can
4460000	4462000	understand
4462000	4464000	the value
4464000	4466000	of
4466000	4468000	valetronics.
4468000	4470000	Lastly,
4470000	4472000	we demonstrated
4472000	4474000	that we can use light
4474000	4476000	to change
4476000	4478000	the value
4478000	4480000	of valetronics.
4480000	4482000	We can
4482000	4484000	use our sample
4484000	4486000	to observe
4486000	4488000	the effect of acetone.
4492000	4494000	What's left is
4494000	4496000	what we didn't talk about today.
4496000	4498000	I'm currently
4498000	4500000	studying
4500000	4502000	ultrafast optics.
4502000	4504000	I'm still
4504000	4506000	studying
4506000	4508000	2D materials.
4508000	4510000	Recently, I'm studying
4510000	4512000	photon-echo spectroscopy.
4514000	4516000	Another interesting thing
4516000	4518000	is that
4518000	4520000	what we talked about today
4520000	4522000	is the optical star effect.
4522000	4524000	It's acetone in photon dress.
4524000	4526000	It's a very weak dress.
4526000	4528000	There are other ways
4528000	4530000	to
4530000	4532000	put the
4534000	4536000	semiconductor
4536000	4538000	in the optical star.
4538000	4540000	If you make the optical star very small,
4540000	4542000	you can strongly
4542000	4544000	couple
4544000	4546000	photon and acetone.
4546000	4548000	This is
4548000	4550000	acetone-polyurethane.
4550000	4552000	This is
4552000	4554000	my recent research in Michigan.
4554000	4556000	I hope you can see
4556000	4558000	the effect of acetone-polyurethane.
4558000	4560000	We also
4560000	4562000	did some applications.
4562000	4564000	One of the concepts
4564000	4566000	is that we can use
4566000	4568000	graphene.
4568000	4570000	Basically, if you
4570000	4572000	add voltage to graphene,
4572000	4574000	the absorption of graphene
4574000	4576000	will change.
4576000	4578000	We can use this method
4578000	4580000	to create optical sensors.
4580000	4582000	Recently,
4582000	4584000	we put
4584000	4586000	neuron cells
4586000	4588000	on graphene.
4588000	4590000	Neuron cells
4590000	4592000	emit electrical signals.
4592000	4594000	Do you use love to generate electricity?
4594000	4596000	What?
4596000	4598000	What do you mean by love?
4598000	4600000	Do you use love to generate electricity?
4604000	4606000	In our experiment,
4606000	4608000	we put the heart of a chicken
4608000	4610000	on graphene.
4614000	4616000	Basically,
4616000	4618000	we put
4618000	4620000	something
4620000	4622000	that generates electricity
4622000	4624000	on graphene.
4624000	4626000	We need to study your heart cells
4626000	4628000	or neurons.
4628000	4630000	Neurons
4630000	4632000	use electricity
4632000	4634000	to transmit messages.
4634000	4636000	When these electrons
4636000	4638000	transmit messages,
4638000	4640000	they also change
4640000	4642000	the absorption
4642000	4644000	of graphene.
4644000	4646000	When we
4646000	4648000	turn on the light,
4648000	4650000	we can see
4650000	4652000	if the neurons
4652000	4654000	are generating electricity.
4654000	4656000	By using this method,
4656000	4658000	we can detect
4658000	4660000	the signals
4660000	4662000	of brain cells.
4664000	4666000	This is the main application
4666000	4668000	for biophysics.
4670000	4672000	These are
4672000	4674000	my main collaborators.
4674000	4676000	In Ann Arbor,
4676000	4678000	Hui Deng is my boss.
4678000	4680000	In UC Berkeley,
4680000	4682000	Wang Feng is my boss.
4682000	4684000	In Charcong Yang,
4684000	4686000	we work together
4686000	4688000	to create
4688000	4690000	the optical star effect.
4690000	4692000	Thank you.
4720000	4722000	This is a slide of
4722000	4724000	sigma plus and sigma minus
4724000	4726000	pump probe.
4728000	4730000	On resonance,
4730000	4732000	you can see a split state.
4732000	4734000	In the middle of the slide,
4736000	4738000	the two states
4738000	4740000	that split up
4740000	4742000	have a parity difference.
4744000	4746000	In theory,
4746000	4748000	in quantum optically split state,
4748000	4750000	there should be
4750000	4752000	some selection rule
4752000	4754000	difference.
4758000	4760000	These two states
4760000	4762000	should not...
4768000	4770000	We write
4770000	4772000	effective theory,
4772000	4774000	but according to
4774000	4776000	effective theory,
4776000	4778000	there should be no change.
4778000	4780000	The reason is
4782000	4784000	basically,
4784000	4786000	this is
4786000	4788000	sigma plus.
4792000	4794000	When you add
4794000	4796000	optical star effect,
4796000	4798000	the remaining
4798000	4800000	is sigma plus.
4800000	4802000	Basically,
4802000	4804000	these two states
4804000	4806000	should not change.
4806000	4808000	For this state.
4810000	4812000	This is my understanding.
4812000	4814000	But of course,
4818000	4820000	in fact,
4820000	4822000	we did not do this experiment.
4828000	4830000	If you probe
4830000	4832000	with sigma plus,
4832000	4834000	you will...
4836000	4838000	This experiment is not easy.
4838000	4840000	This experiment is not easy.
4840000	4842000	Because if you send
4842000	4844000	a probe with sigma plus,
4844000	4846000	the most important effect
4846000	4848000	will be in ground state to k-value.
4848000	4850000	This thing
4850000	4852000	is just a very small
4852000	4854000	change.
4854000	4856000	Of course,
4856000	4858000	it is possible to do this experiment.
4858000	4860000	But
4860000	4862000	I'm not sure
4862000	4864000	if I can see the significant effect.
4868000	4870000	Thank you.
4874000	4876000	Because today's time
4876000	4878000	is a little over.
4878000	4880000	So we will stop here today.
4880000	4882000	I will
4882000	4884000	temporarily pause the recording.
4884000	4886000	Thank you, Jason.
