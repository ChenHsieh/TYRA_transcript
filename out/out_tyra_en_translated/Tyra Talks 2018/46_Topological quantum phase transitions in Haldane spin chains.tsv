0	4000	Q&A
4000	23000	Hello, I am today's representative host, Zhang Yanyong, because our host, Zhang Jianyuan, he is actually more suitable, because he is doing Qubits, doing condensed matter, but he is now stuck on the road, he has no time for transportation, so I will represent the host.
23000	43000	Let me introduce our speaker today. Our speaker today is Dr. Zeng Yuqing. The topic he is going to talk to us today is ... I want to read it right, wait a minute, I suddenly can't find it, wait a minute, wait a minute.
43000	68000	Topological quantum phase transitions in Haldane spin chains. This is a very popular topic, because in 2016 or 2017, Topological Matter won the Nobel Prize, so we have always hoped that we could invite an expert to introduce to us what topological phases are.
68000	95000	Then, Zeng Yuqing, in 2005, got a college degree from Donghai University, a physics major, right? Then he went to serve in the military, and then served in the military for 1.5 years, but he served in the military at Donghai University. Why?
95000	99000	After I served in the military, I returned to Donghai University as a research assistant.
125000	143000	Then there is a published paper in PRB, if you are interested, because I don't have that number, so you can directly ask our speaker for this thing. Then he transferred to Central University and completed his Ph.D. degree. The main function is also condensed matter theory.
143000	166000	At present, Zeng Yuqing is at the University of Kent in the UK, and he is now focusing on numerical study on the time-reversal invariant fractional topological insulator. This is a very hot topic, so we don't have much to say, we applaud and welcome today's speaker. Oh, if you want to applaud or ask a question, remember to turn on the microphone.
173000	181000	Let's get started. Today I prepared some props.
203000	214000	I have some props. You can play with some props later.
233000	250000	I will talk about some of the things I have done before, which will be more professional. First of all, what is physics?
250000	265000	What we mainly learn in physics is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is like classical mechanics, which is mechanics, or kinetic mechanics of electricity, quantum mechanics, thermal mechanics, and statistical mechanics.
265000	284000	This whole thing is actually studying the interaction between time, space, and matter. The interaction between matter has, for example, strong, weak, electromagnetic, or gravity.
284000	305000	You can take the whole world, these substances, as if they were actors on stage. The stage is the background between time and space, and there will be some interaction between the actor and the actor.
306000	314000	The whole thing will form a movie or a stage play.
315000	334000	What about matter? This is from when I was very young, for example, in high school or elementary school, I learned that we can classify matter in this way.
334000	345000	First, divide it into solid matter or mixtures. Mixtures, such as beer, milk tea, or air, are mixtures.
346000	357000	For example, alcohol, water, and many other substances, such as beer, flowers, and so on.
357000	365000	For example, most of the air is 4 out of 5 gas, and 1 out of 5 oxygen, for example.
366000	384000	Pure matter can be divided into elements and mixtures. For example, the elements in the cycle table, such as gold, iron, oxygen, and O2.
385000	393000	For example, the previously well-known graphene, which is basically carbon.
394000	405000	For example, alcohol is a mixture of alcohol and water.
406000	415000	Alcohol has a chemical form, such as CH3CH2OH, which is alcohol.
415000	424000	Chlorine is also a mixture of pure matter.
424000	429000	Oxygen is also a mixture of pure matter.
429000	436000	For example, ice is water, which is the solid of water.
436000	441000	Ice is also pure matter, which is H2O.
442000	450000	This classification is probably a little bit of preliminary understanding of matter.
450000	458000	To understand this understanding further, we can see that matter has many states.
458000	462000	This state is called phase.
462000	469000	There is a change between the phase and the phase, which is called phase change.
469000	481000	For example, the ice or water we just talked about is under pressure in the horizontal axis and temperature in the vertical axis.
481000	490000	For example, at the bottom of atmospheric pressure, below 0 ° C, it is solid.
490000	496000	This side will be liquid and this side will be gas.
496000	505000	The red line is from here, it will pass through a waste point and then become water vapor.
505000	513000	From here, it will pass through this ice point and solidify into ice.
513000	515000	For example, this picture.
515000	519000	Of course, you can't see the water vapor with your naked eye.
519000	523000	Because the water vapor is transparent and colorless.
524000	530000	If it is connected to this water drop on the glass, it will become a liquid.
530000	532000	You can see that this is water.
532000	535000	This is the water we usually see.
535000	539000	Ice is solid.
539000	543000	This picture is in our present.
545000	551000	It's snowing in the UK recently, and it's cold.
552000	560000	After the snow, many people want to do an experiment.
560000	571000	Put the liquid nitrogen on the snowman and then destroy it.
571000	574000	See what the result is.
574000	583000	In short, this picture of water should have been seen in elementary school.
583000	588000	I don't know if there is any problem.
588000	593000	If not, I want to emphasize that there is a critical point here.
593000	618000	The meaning of this critical point is that if the temperature and pressure are very high from here to the critical point, you will not be able to distinguish whether the water is a liquid or a gas.
619000	625000	After this critical point, there is no red line.
625000	631000	The red line on the left has been extended.
631000	637000	This point stops at this critical point.
637000	644000	So if this side is gas, this side is liquid, this side is solid.
644000	652000	This line completely separates solid and liquid.
652000	661000	But here you can adjust the temperature and pressure appropriately.
661000	665000	Then let it slowly go around this critical point from here.
665000	670000	Then enter another item.
671000	685000	In other words, the phase of the liquid and the phase of the gas are the same phase.
685000	693000	The three-dimensional picture of water here is actually only two phases.
693000	696000	There are only two images like this.
696000	700000	There should be no problem.
700000	705000	This is a relaxing video.
705000	719000	A few days ago, we put the liquid and gas on the snowman.
719000	723000	Many people came to see.
723000	726000	There are about 100 people here.
726000	729000	Other dramas have come to see.
729000	732000	I think this is interesting.
733000	744000	You can see that gas is also a pure material.
744000	749000	Pure materials have three-dimensional pictures of water like just now.
749000	752000	Now pour out the liquid and gas.
752000	760000	The liquid and gas are about 70K.
760000	766000	It's about 100 degrees below zero.
790000	808000	The temperature of the ice is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.
808000	821000	The temperature of the liquid and gas is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.
821000	823000	The temperature is lower.
823000	828000	You can see the picture of the liquid and gas.
828000	833000	It is still solid.
833000	835000	That's about it.
835000	838000	What is a phase?
838000	848000	What does it mean?
848000	851000	You have an external parameter.
851000	856000	For example, you just saw that there is temperature and pressure.
857000	860000	You have an external parameter.
860000	867000	What is the state of a huge macro of this material?
867000	868000	What are the external parameters?
868000	877000	For example, temperature pressure, magnetic field, or external control.
877000	879000	You can control the outside.
879000	880000	For example, you add a power plant.
880000	889000	Or you use other elements to replace these compounds.
889000	891000	You do some mixing.
891000	895000	This mixing can also be regarded as an external parameter.
895000	897000	Mainly these parameters.
897000	899000	You made these modifications.
899000	902000	Will affect these.
902000	906000	Because the matter is composed of those atoms.
906000	908000	It is composed of those particles.
908000	911000	You modified these external parameters.
911000	916000	Will affect the interaction between particles.
916000	920000	What about the interaction between particles?
920000	925000	It will have different phases.
925000	937000	The higher the temperature, the more chaotic the material is.
937000	952000	But if you have an interaction, the material may have a different order.
952000	955000	What is a macro state?
955000	959000	For example, the three-phase change just now.
959000	962000	The three-phase change is the solid, solid, gas.
962000	967000	But it's not just solid, solid, gas.
967000	972000	It's a macro state.
972000	974000	For example, conductivity.
974000	977000	Conductivity is also a macro state.
977000	981000	Magnetic field is also a macro state.
981000	983000	For example, mercury.
984000	991000	In 1911, it was discovered by Ernst.
991000	998000	After the temperature dropped very low, it suddenly became a superconductor.
998000	1000000	What about conductivity?
1000000	1005000	For example, the angle is the temperature.
1005000	1010000	When the temperature is very high.
1010000	1013000	This temperature is the absolute temperature.
1013000	1018000	From this place, you can see that there is a conductor here.
1018000	1020000	Satisfy the Ohm's law.
1020000	1025000	When the temperature drops, the conductor becomes smaller and smaller.
1025000	1026000	But there is still a conductor.
1026000	1033000	But when the temperature is about 4K, about 4.2K.
1033000	1037000	The conductor suddenly disappears.
1037000	1038000	There is almost nothing.
1038000	1039000	There is nothing at all.
1039000	1041000	There is nothing here.
1041000	1046000	This can be regarded as a phase change.
1046000	1049000	Because this is a very macro state.
1049000	1051000	The whole change.
1051000	1053000	Because there is a conductor here.
1053000	1055000	There is no conductor here at all.
1055000	1060000	Here is the general conductor.
1060000	1066000	On the left side, it suddenly becomes a superconductor.
1066000	1070000	The superconductor has great application value.
1070000	1080000	For example, later we found that mercury is a pure material.
1080000	1082000	Mercury is an element.
1082000	1087000	But other compounds may also become superconductors.
1087000	1090000	Like these high-temperature superconductors.
1090000	1099000	High-temperature superconductors can become superconductors as long as they are at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen.
1099000	1102000	For example, these copper oxides.
1102000	1107000	You will see that there is an X in these different compounds.
1107000	1109000	There is an X here, right?
1109000	1112000	This X is when you synthesize this compound.
1112000	1115000	How much ratio do you want to put in?
1115000	1117000	How much ratio do you put in?
1117000	1121000	Then you go to burn this compound.
1121000	1126000	Then you are equal to saying that this X is your external parameter.
1126000	1129000	That's your temperature with your axis.
1129000	1133000	Different temperatures and different cross-sections.
1133000	1135000	The horizontal axis is the cross-section.
1135000	1137000	The horizontal axis is the cross-section.
1137000	1139000	Write a P on the right.
1139000	1141000	You are the cross-sectional electric.
1141000	1143000	This is the meaning of the X.
1143000	1145000	Write an N on the left.
1145000	1146000	Write N on the left.
1146000	1148000	You are the cross-sectional electric.
1148000	1151000	Here is the electron dot and the hole dot.
1151000	1156000	This place is when you are not in the cross-section.
1156000	1162000	This is a counter-iron-magnetic superconductor.
1162000	1165000	When you cross-section to a certain degree,
1165000	1167000	When you drop to a low enough temperature,
1167000	1169000	It becomes a superconductor.
1169000	1174000	So this area is a superconductor phase.
1174000	1178000	This area is a counter-iron-magnetic phase.
1178000	1180000	What is a counter-iron-magnetic?
1180000	1183000	Then go on.
1183000	1185000	Magnetic.
1185000	1189000	There are many kinds of magnetic.
1189000	1192000	The magnet we usually see,
1192000	1194000	Like this magnet.
1194000	1196000	When we were in elementary school,
1196000	1199000	Take the magnet and sprinkle some magnetic powder.
1199000	1201000	Look at the magnetic field.
1201000	1206000	The magnetic nature of this magnet is called magnetism.
1206000	1208000	That is to say,
1208000	1212000	There are many magnetic poles inside the magnet.
1212000	1214000	Many small magnetic poles.
1214000	1218000	These magnetic poles are originally,
1218000	1220000	If it is messy,
1220000	1223000	If the temperature is very high,
1223000	1227000	Then these magnetic poles are messy.
1227000	1232000	After the mess, the whole is not magnetic.
1232000	1236000	But if you lower the temperature,
1236000	1240000	Then because of this magnetic pole and the magnetic pole,
1240000	1242000	There will be some interaction.
1242000	1247000	These interactions will make these magnetic poles,
1247000	1251000	The direction is still in the same direction.
1251000	1257000	When everyone is lined up in roughly the same direction,
1257000	1262000	The overall magnetic nature will be displayed.
1262000	1264000	You will see that it is a magnet.
1264000	1267000	It is the overall direction.
1267000	1271000	For example, this arrow here is N-level,
1271000	1272000	This is S-level.
1272000	1273000	If everyone is messy,
1273000	1275000	The whole thing is offset.
1276000	1281000	I found a YouTube video.
1281000	1283000	It's probably like this.
1283000	1286000	Can you see it now?
1286000	1288000	Should be no problem.
1288000	1291000	Yes, I can see it.
1291000	1294000	There is a piece of iron on the top.
1294000	1295000	Put a piece of iron.
1295000	1299000	After the magnetic iron below is red,
1299000	1307000	The red magnetic iron is magnetic.
1307000	1309000	Its magnetic pole is messy.
1309000	1312000	Messy, then there is no magnetic nature.
1312000	1314000	But after it slowly cools down,
1314000	1317000	The temperature is low enough.
1317000	1322000	Because it has an interaction between the magnetic pole and the magnetic pole.
1323000	1327000	When the temperature is low enough,
1327000	1330000	It will be aligned with everyone in the same direction.
1330000	1332000	There is a magnetic pole in the same direction.
1332000	1334000	If there is a magnetic pole,
1334000	1337000	It becomes iron magnetic.
1337000	1341000	Iron magnetic is the meaning of this magnetic iron.
1341000	1345000	There should be no problem.
1345000	1350000	Another one is that it is lined up well.
1350000	1356000	But it does not have a total magnetic force.
1356000	1359000	The total magnetic iron.
1359000	1368000	Although the super island I just talked about.
1368000	1371000	When you are not mixed, it is iron magnetic.
1371000	1374000	What does iron magnetic mean?
1374000	1377000	That is to say, your magnetic pole.
1377000	1379000	This magnetic pole.
1379000	1381000	How did this magnetic pole come?
1381000	1387000	Part of it is the orbital momentum of the electron.
1387000	1390000	And the other part is the magnetic circle.
1390000	1396000	If these magnetic poles are interspersed.
1396000	1401000	For example, here is up, down, up, down, up, down, up.
1401000	1403000	Interspersed.
1403000	1406000	It is also lined up well.
1406000	1413000	But it does not have the iron magnetic force of the magnet just now.
1413000	1416000	But it still has order.
1416000	1419000	This iron magnetic force.
1419000	1426000	Although there is no total magnetic force.
1426000	1436000	But it is completely different from the one that was completely messed up just now.
1436000	1442000	Because the magnetic pole of the burning red iron is messy.
1442000	1446000	This iron magnetic pole.
1446000	1451000	The magnetic pole is very well arranged.
1452000	1457000	After that, I will mainly talk about.
1457000	1464000	If these magnetic poles are arranged into a chain.
1464000	1468000	Of course, this is the intention below.
1468000	1471000	Because you are not taking a magnet.
1471000	1474000	Then directly this magnet.
1474000	1479000	Because there are countless magnetic poles in a magnet.
1479000	1482000	Or there are already a lot of magnetic poles inside.
1482000	1485000	Then we have to discuss later.
1485000	1490000	It is said that the magnetic pole is arranged into a circle.
1490000	1496000	Then the magnetic pole and the magnetic pole next door have some interaction.
1496000	1502000	Will this cause the whole?
1502000	1506000	Will there be a state of order?
1506000	1513000	Or will it be a whole?
1513000	1515000	What is the order?
1515000	1520000	Simply put, everything has an order.
1520000	1525000	For example, electrons also have an order.
1525000	1528000	The light also has an order.
1528000	1530000	The magnet also has an order.
1530000	1532000	Quark also has an order.
1533000	1536000	Everything has an order.
1536000	1546000	Order is a basic physical nature.
1546000	1550000	Quark also has an order.
1550000	1552000	Quark's order is 1.
1553000	1557000	But Quark's order is 1.
1557000	1562000	Its z-direction can only be positive or negative 1.
1562000	1570000	So we see that light has a polarizing direction.
1570000	1572000	There is a left-handed light and a right-handed light.
1572000	1574000	Light has an order.
1574000	1576000	The order of light is 1.
1576000	1581000	All orders should be divided into two categories.
1581000	1592000	One is the order of one-half, three-thirds, five-fifths, seven-fifths.
1592000	1602000	This kind of half-order is called quark.
1602000	1605000	The other is the order of the whole.
1605000	1609000	For example, the order is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1609000	1611000	This is called quark.
1611000	1614000	Light has an order of 1.
1614000	1616000	So it is quark.
1616000	1621000	Electrons have an order of one-half.
1621000	1623000	So it is quark.
1624000	1626000	Like this.
1626000	1627000	Sorry.
1627000	1628000	Go on.
1628000	1629000	That's right.
1629000	1630000	Yes.
1630000	1631000	Is it OK?
1631000	1632000	Yes.
1632000	1633000	OK.
1633000	1644000	So the spin-chain discussed later is related to quark.
1644000	1650000	Is it an order or a half-order?
1650000	1652000	This is a big deal.
1652000	1658000	These are two very different types.
1658000	1666000	Before talking about these orders,
1666000	1670000	what is symmetry?
1670000	1674000	What is asymmetry?
1674000	1677000	What is asymmetry?
1677000	1689000	Asymmetry means that after you have done a certain operation, the result does not change.
1689000	1692000	For example, as I just said,
1692000	1698000	parallel symmetry, rotation symmetry, mirror symmetry, time parallel, time inverse,
1698000	1700000	any kind of operation.
1700000	1708000	Can you see me now?
1708000	1710000	Yes.
1710000	1713000	For example, I take this.
1713000	1722000	If you don't look at the pattern on this ball,
1722000	1725000	if they are all the same color,
1725000	1728000	I just turn 360 degrees like this.
1728000	1731000	I'll cover it up first.
1731000	1735000	Then I'll turn a little bit.
1735000	1736000	Then I'll show you.
1736000	1738000	Then you don't know.
1738000	1743000	You will never be able to tell if I'm turning or not.
1743000	1744000	Right?
1744000	1750000	So it means that this ball has the symmetry of this rotation.
1750000	1752000	There is already a pattern on it.
1752000	1756000	Of course, this pattern will destroy its rotation.
1756000	1759000	Because if I turn like this, you will recognize this pattern.
1759000	1762000	You know I have turned.
1762000	1767000	But if this is all blue,
1767000	1771000	I can turn this three-dimensional corner.
1771000	1777000	This is a rotation symmetry.
1777000	1783000	What about this apple?
1783000	1787000	This apple, you have an imagination first.
1787000	1789000	There is a meme here.
1789000	1792000	And then, here,
1792000	1797000	So if I turn like this,
1797000	1799000	Then you will find that it is different.
1799000	1804000	But if I turn like this along this axis,
1805000	1807000	Assuming its shape is perfect.
1807000	1814000	Then you will see that it also has this rotation symmetry.
1814000	1817000	But this rotation symmetry
1817000	1824000	Only with this Z axis as the rotation axis
1824000	1826000	You have this symmetry.
1826000	1829000	I can turn like this.
1829000	1834000	I can also turn like this.
1834000	1838000	I can also turn like this.
1838000	1844000	I can also turn like this.
1844000	1853000	The symmetry of this apple is less than the symmetry of this ball.
1853000	1856000	Because it only rotates like this.
1856000	1862000	This ball can rotate in any way.
1862000	1867000	If so, you will see that this and this ring
1867000	1869000	I made a ring.
1869000	1873000	This ring is the same.
1873000	1879000	I turn like this, the result is unchanged.
1879000	1885000	What about this bagel?
1885000	1888000	If I turn like this,
1888000	1894000	You will not know that I have turned.
1894000	1901000	Of course, if this is the case,
1901000	1906000	If I put a sticker on it,
1906000	1908000	Do you know that I have turned?
1908000	1911000	For example, I'm hungry now.
1911000	1918000	I'm hungry, I take a bite.
1918000	1923000	Now after being bitten by me
1923000	1930000	It has lost the symmetry of this rotation.
1930000	1931000	This is also the same.
1931000	1933000	This bagel is also the same.
1933000	1937000	If I don't bite too big
1937000	1939000	I take a bite first.
1939000	1944000	I bought a lot today.
1944000	1947000	I bite a little bit.
1947000	1950000	I don't bite this hole.
1950000	1956000	Then it has no symmetry of this rotation.
1956000	1961000	In other words, what does this bite cause?
1961000	1964000	Causing a defect
1964000	1966000	Causing a defect
1966000	1977000	Defects will affect a lot of things.
1977000	1981000	What I'm going to talk about later is Torpo.
1981000	1986000	Torpo
1986000	1990000	Let's play a little game first.
1990000	1993000	I have a ring here.
1993000	2000000	I have a ring here.
2000000	2004000	If I use a pen
2004000	2008000	Many people should know that
2008000	2009000	If I go from here
2009000	2012000	Then follow this ring
2012000	2021000	Go around like this
2022000	2025000	Go around and pick it up.
2025000	2030000	Wait for the paper to turn 360 degrees
2030000	2034000	I'll go back to the origin.
2034000	2038000	These two are not the same.
2038000	2041000	One
2041000	2044000	I do this too.
2045000	2049000	I am also back to the origin.
2049000	2051000	But this is not.
2051000	2053000	When this is done
2053000	2058000	This ring is very different from these two rings.
2058000	2063000	This ring is just like this one.
2063000	2065000	This ring is just like this one.
2065000	2068000	These two rings are very different.
2068000	2072000	This ring is just like this one.
2072000	2074000	This ring is just like this one.
2074000	2076000	In fact, the same
2076000	2080000	I twisted it a little bit.
2080000	2082000	In fact, this ring is just like this.
2082000	2085000	This ring is like this.
2085000	2087000	So you see, I just painted black here.
2087000	2089000	If there is
2089000	2093000	Usually there is an ant walking up
2093000	2095000	After going around
2095000	2098000	You will return to the original place.
2098000	2100000	This ring is like this.
2100000	2102000	This ring is not
2102000	2108000	This ring is the so-called Mobius ring.
2108000	2110000	What if
2110000	2112000	I have an ant here
2112000	2115000	Walk like this
2115000	2118000	Walk like this
2118000	2120000	Go go go
2120000	2122000	Go go go
2122000	2124000	Go around
2124000	2126000	Go
2126000	2129000	After going around
2129000	2130000	He will
2130000	2131000	He actually
2131000	2133000	I'm going around now.
2133000	2134000	Go around
2134000	2136000	As a result, I ran to this path.
2136000	2138000	Run to the back of this ring
2138000	2140000	Not the same as this
2140000	2143000	After two laps
2143000	2146000	Will return to the origin
2146000	2148000	This is a
2149000	2153000	It's completely different from a few boxes.
2153000	2155000	This thing
2155000	2159000	And then go back to the video.
2168000	2169000	That
2169000	2173000	What I just said is symmetrical.
2173000	2175000	This is symmetrical.
2175000	2177000	That
2177000	2179000	This is symmetrical.
2179000	2181000	Has been destroyed
2181000	2182000	That
2182000	2183000	With
2183000	2186000	What does it have to do with the photo?
2186000	2188000	Because we know
2188000	2189000	Is
2189000	2190000	Ah
2190000	2191000	If you
2191000	2192000	If
2192000	2193000	Ah
2193000	2194000	You have one
2194000	2196000	Energy or free energy
2196000	2197000	He
2197000	2199000	If he is a certain parameter
2199000	2201000	If the function
2201000	2204000	Then you basically free energy should be like
2205000	2207000	Energy is like the lower the better
2207000	2208000	Will be stable
2208000	2209000	If your
2209000	2212000	At first your function is like this
2212000	2213000	So
2213000	2215000	If you have a ball here
2215000	2216000	He is of course symmetrical
2216000	2218000	Because of this symmetry
2218000	2220000	Symmetry is of course
2220000	2224000	Is the lowest point of energy
2224000	2227000	But if your external parameters
2227000	2228000	Change
2228000	2229000	For example, your temperature
2229000	2231000	Temperature changes
2231000	2232000	Temperature
2232000	2233000	Low temperature
2233000	2234000	Your temperature is getting lower and lower
2234000	2237000	That causes this function to change
2237000	2239000	The lowest energy state at this time
2239000	2241000	Not in this
2241000	2243000	Symmetrical point
2243000	2244000	And he might
2244000	2246000	Will choose to be in
2246000	2249000	A certain one
2249000	2251000	Free energy is lower
2251000	2253000	That place
2253000	2256000	Of course, every place
2256000	2258000	This place or this place
2258000	2260000	Free energy
2260000	2261000	Energy is the same
2261000	2263000	Then he has to choose
2263000	2265000	On the left or on the right
2265000	2266000	I don't know
2266000	2268000	He might be him
2268000	2269000	He might
2269000	2270000	He
2270000	2272000	He has a little bit
2272000	2273000	Direction
2273000	2276000	A little bit to the left or a little bit to the right
2276000	2277000	When
2277000	2278000	He is very natural
2278000	2279000	He will run to this soon
2279000	2280000	To a stable place
2280000	2282000	That's like this place
2282000	2284000	In this case
2284000	2287000	You will find that he is not symmetrical
2287000	2288000	Originally
2288000	2289000	Originally
2289000	2290000	It was left and right
2290000	2291000	This has a
2291000	2293000	Symmetrical
2293000	2295000	That's not symmetrical now
2295000	2297000	That's not symmetrical
2297000	2299000	It means
2299000	2301000	There is a order
2301000	2302000	Happened
2302000	2304000	That's what happened
2304000	2306000	That's a certain
2306000	2307000	An image is produced
2307000	2309000	For example, just now
2309000	2312000	We just saw that
2312000	2315000	The experiment of the distance temperature
2315000	2318000	That burning red iron
2318000	2320000	No magnetic
2320000	2322000	Burning red iron
2322000	2323000	His
2323000	2325000	The magnetic field is messy
2325000	2326000	That
2326000	2328000	When it's messy
2328000	2329000	Magnetic field
2329000	2331000	Although he has a magnetic field in every place
2331000	2334000	He has a lot of this
2334000	2336000	That order or
2336000	2337000	Magnetic field
2337000	2339000	For example, this magnetic field
2339000	2340000	That
2340000	2341000	But the temperature is very high
2341000	2344000	He has a magnetic field
2344000	2345000	All
2345000	2347000	Keep doing this
2347000	2349000	Just keep doing it
2349000	2350000	Ah
2350000	2351000	In the disturbance
2351000	2352000	In the transformation
2352000	2354000	That causes the whole
2354000	2355000	You look
2355000	2357000	That moment looks very messy
2357000	2359000	That magnetic field looks messy
2359000	2361000	And positive magnetic field and negative magnetic field
2361000	2363000	Positive and negative, but in different directions
2363000	2364000	The whole
2364000	2366000	Put this whole magnetic field
2366000	2367000	All offset
2367000	2369000	That's messy
2369000	2371000	That messy
2371000	2373000	How do you say he is symmetrical?
2373000	2375000	Just when you have this magnetic field
2375000	2377000	When the magnetic field is very messy
2377000	2379000	You you
2379000	2382000	Rotate him
2382000	2386000	You do a certain area to balance
2386000	2388000	You have a camera
2388000	2390000	You you you this camera
2390000	2394000	Observe and then you balance this camera
2394000	2396000	Then you find that he is still messy
2396000	2399000	Just as messy as just now
2399000	2401000	You can't see what it is
2401000	2403000	You can't tell
2403000	2405000	Do you have a rotation
2405000	2407000	I did not
2407000	2409000	I did a balance or did a rotation
2409000	2411000	You can't tell
2411000	2412000	and so
2412000	2413000	He
2413000	2415000	In the video just now
2415000	2417000	This red iron
2417000	2419000	What is the symmetry
2419000	2420000	Just have
2420000	2422000	Balance symmetry
2422000	2424000	Also have
2424000	2426000	Rotational symmetry
2426000	2429000	But what happens when the temperature drops?
2429000	2433000	Because of the magnetic field and the magnetic field
2433000	2435000	His interaction
2435000	2437000	It's more
2437000	2439000	More strong
2439000	2441000	More obvious
2441000	2443000	What about the thermal disturbance?
2443000	2445000	Not enough for him
2445000	2447000	Let him mess up
2447000	2449000	So he will be the whole
2449000	2453000	Causing the overall magnetic field to lean towards one
2453000	2455000	One direction
2455000	2457000	At this time if everyone
2457000	2460000	When everyone is leaning in the same direction
2460000	2463000	At this time you will find
2463000	2465000	I no longer have
2465000	2467000	This rotation symmetry
2467000	2469000	Is my rotation symmetry
2469000	2471000	Just
2471000	2473000	I rotate
2473000	2475000	That direction just now
2475000	2476000	It was all pointing up
2476000	2477000	Everyone is pointing up
2477000	2479000	Then I rotate everyone
2479000	2481000	Changed direction
2481000	2483000	You will find that he has changed
2483000	2485000	That's not symmetrical
2485000	2487000	That's called
2487000	2489000	Automatic symmetry
2489000	2491000	Symmetry
2491000	2494000	Symmetry is that he has a sequence
2494000	2496000	Then you say that he is
2496000	2498000	Change
2498000	2500000	This is us
2500000	2502000	The most traditional
2502000	2504000	Ah
2504000	2506000	For matter
2506000	2508000	The most
2508000	2510000	The most
2510000	2512000	Ah
2512000	2514000	One
2515000	2517000	This is the theory of the blue path
2517000	2519000	It should be
2519000	2521000	We have one
2521000	2523000	Just
2523000	2525000	There is one
2525000	2527000	This sequence
2527000	2529000	What about this sequence
2529000	2531000	What if he has it
2531000	2533000	He just has a sequence
2533000	2535000	That means he happened
2535000	2537000	A change
2537000	2539000	But like just now
2539000	2541000	Excuse me
2541000	2543000	Ah
2544000	2546000	Sorry
2546000	2548000	OK
2548000	2550000	OK
2550000	2552000	That
2552000	2554000	That
2554000	2556000	Some things are not like this
2556000	2558000	Just
2558000	2560000	Ah
2560000	2562000	Um
2562000	2564000	Wait a minute
2564000	2566000	Will continue to talk
2566000	2568000	That
2568000	2570000	Later found
2570000	2572000	There is a change
2572000	2574000	Ah
2574000	2576000	The earliest
2576000	2578000	A Russian
2578000	2580000	He found out
2580000	2582000	He is a model
2582000	2584000	That later
2584000	2586000	Because he published
2586000	2588000	This story is probably like this
2588000	2590000	The article he published is
2590000	2592000	Written in Russian and then
2592000	2594000	Earlier than Kostelis and Solis
2594000	2596000	That later
2596000	2598000	No one knows that later Kostelis and Solis
2598000	2600000	They also counted
2600000	2602000	One thing and then found out
2602000	2604000	Ah
2604000	2606000	There is actually a change
2606000	2608000	But this model
2608000	2610000	He did not happen
2610000	2612000	They do
2612000	2614000	This model is like this
2614000	2616000	I just said that one by one
2616000	2618000	Right?
2618000	2620000	Each arrow is a word
2620000	2622000	That seems to be here
2622000	2624000	One of this amount
2624000	2626000	This amount is
2626000	2628000	It's not like that
2628000	2630000	It's just an amount
2630000	2632000	That is
2632000	2634000	It is
2634000	2636000	I will talk about the amount later
2636000	2638000	Here
2638000	2640000	This amount is
2640000	2642000	There is an xy amount
2642000	2644000	You are on the plane
2644000	2646000	Then there is an xy amount
2646000	2648000	Then you are on this
2648000	2650000	Every one on this scale
2650000	2652000	In this square
2652000	2654000	Square lattice
2654000	2656000	Each one has a
2656000	2658000	The corresponding amount
2658000	2660000	All
2660000	2662000	Do it
2662000	2664000	Just write a built-in interaction
2664000	2666000	That
2666000	2668000	Look at this model
2668000	2670000	He did not
2670000	2672000	Destroy
2672000	2674000	Rotational symmetry because
2674000	2676000	I just put it
2676000	2678000	I am in this
2678000	2680000	Z axis
2680000	2682000	For
2682000	2684000	If you turn, I just rotate
2684000	2686000	How many degrees
2686000	2688000	0 to 2拍
2688000	2690000	0 to 360 degrees
2690000	2692000	I just turn a little bit
2692000	2694000	Or turn a lot
2694000	2696000	Just turn a few degrees
2696000	2698000	Any angle
2698000	2700000	This model
2700000	2702000	This energy is unchanged
2702000	2704000	This does not change
2704000	2706000	So he has this
2706000	2708000	Continuous
2708000	2710000	This rotation symmetry
2710000	2712000	There was a theorem before
2712000	2714000	This theorem is called Mermin-Wagon theorem
2714000	2716000	If you only have
2716000	2718000	Corresponding interaction
2718000	2720000	Then yours
2720000	2722000	If you have continuous symmetry
2722000	2724000	Continuous symmetry
2724000	2726000	That
2726000	2728000	Below 2
2728000	2730000	Continuous symmetry
2730000	2732000	Will not occur
2732000	2734000	This is
2734000	2736000	This is his mathematical theorem
2736000	2738000	But
2738000	2740000	They found
2740000	2742000	Even if there is no
2742000	2744000	Continuous symmetry
2744000	2746000	It will not occur
2746000	2748000	Does not mean
2748000	2750000	It will not change
2750000	2752000	And this change
2752000	2754000	Just
2754000	2756000	This kind of change
2756000	2758000	Later we
2758000	2760000	It's called KT Transition
2760000	2762000	Or BKT Transition
2762000	2764000	How is he
2764000	2766000	At high temperature
2766000	2768000	Because it will not occur
2768000	2770000	Will not occur
2770000	2772000	So
2772000	2774000	As long as you have a limit
2774000	2776000	He will not
2776000	2778000	Not that continuous
2778000	2780000	For example, you
2780000	2782000	This energy is written like this
2782000	2784000	There is a symbol in front
2784000	2786000	If j is j is positive
2786000	2788000	That
2788000	2790000	If you have these two quantities
2790000	2792000	How to
2792000	2794000	Internal
2794000	2796000	Will
2796000	2798000	The answer will be lower
2798000	2800000	Internal is
2800000	2802000	Did you learn in high school?
2802000	2804000	Is
2804000	2806000	The length of this quantity
2806000	2808000	Multiply by the length of another quantity
2808000	2810000	Multiply
2810000	2812000	Cos theta
2812000	2814000	If cos theta is
2814000	2816000	If theta is 0
2816000	2818000	Cos is 1
2818000	2820000	If theta is 90 degrees
2820000	2822000	Positive
2822000	2824000	That this
2824000	2826000	Cos is 0
2826000	2828000	So
2828000	2830000	There is a symbol in front
2830000	2832000	So if the energy is relatively low
2832000	2834000	Of course every quantity
2834000	2836000	It's best to
2836000	2838000	The same
2838000	2840000	What if the opposite
2840000	2842000	You have the highest energy
2842000	2844000	The same energy is the lowest
2844000	2846000	That
2846000	2848000	So
2848000	2850000	But if the temperature is 0
2850000	2852000	That is
2852000	2854000	It is in
2854000	2856000	Ground state
2856000	2858000	The lowest state of energy
2858000	2860000	Of course it is
2860000	2862000	But as long as you have a little
2862000	2864000	Temperature as long as there is a little
2864000	2866000	Temperature
2866000	2868000	It won't be
2868000	2870000	It won't be
2870000	2872000	All in the same direction
2872000	2874000	It is absolutely
2874000	2876000	Is not
2876000	2878000	No
2878000	2880000	Symmetry
2880000	2882000	Symmetry
2882000	2884000	That
2884000	2886000	No symmetry
2886000	2888000	But there is a change
2888000	2890000	What is the situation
2890000	2892000	That is
2892000	2894000	High temperature
2894000	2896000	That is
2896000	2898000	A little
2898000	2900000	When there is a little temperature
2900000	2902000	That
2902000	2904000	These will not
2904000	2906000	These
2906000	2908000	These quantities will not be the same
2908000	2910000	That won't be the same
2910000	2912000	That can only be formed
2912000	2914000	Some called vortex
2914000	2916000	Is some whirlpool
2916000	2918000	That way
2918000	2920000	At a very high temperature
2920000	2922000	What about these vortex
2922000	2924000	No matter what temperature
2924000	2926000	These vortex
2926000	2928000	Because you have to
2928000	2930000	You must be
2930000	2932000	You have a vortex
2932000	2934000	Is
2934000	2936000	Turn like this
2936000	2938000	That
2938000	2940000	In fact, this
2940000	2942000	Let's make an example
2942000	2944000	Is that you have a
2944000	2946000	This vortex
2946000	2948000	There is another
2948000	2950000	Reverse vortex
2950000	2952000	That this
2952000	2954000	The positive vortex and the reverse vortex
2954000	2956000	At low temperature
2956000	2958000	Is two
2958000	2960000	Tied together
2960000	2962000	Is paired together
2962000	2964000	That's like this ship
2964000	2966000	Two ships are actually tied together
2966000	2968000	But if it's at high temperature
2968000	2970000	This one by one
2970000	2972000	Is every
2972000	2974000	Every vortex is free
2974000	2976000	This
2976000	2978000	This quantity
2978000	2980000	Main configuration
2980000	2982000	Run around
2982000	2984000	That way
2984000	2986000	This kind of change
2986000	2988000	It's called
2988000	2990000	KT transition
2990000	2992000	It does not destroy any
2992000	2994000	So there is no contradiction
2994000	2996000	Sorry
2996000	2998000	Is there a question?
2998000	3000000	That is
3000000	3002000	I remember when I was learning xy model
3002000	3004000	He said he was different
3004000	3006000	One is
3006000	3008000	One is
3008000	3010000	How to put that thing
3010000	3012000	Connected to you
3012000	3014000	That
3014000	3016000	Um
3016000	3018000	Um
3018000	3020000	That is to say
3020000	3022000	Um
3022000	3024000	Um
3024000	3026000	Um
3026000	3028000	Um
3028000	3030000	Correlation
3030000	3032000	Because
3032000	3034000	First of all
3034000	3036000	First of all
3036000	3038000	If there is no order
3038000	3040000	Its correlation length must be
3040000	3042000	Decay to zero
3042000	3044000	But
3044000	3046000	But the way to decay to zero
3046000	3048000	There are actually two
3048000	3050000	One is
3050000	3052000	Decay to zero very quickly
3052000	3054000	The other one is
3054000	3056000	Is
3056000	3058000	It's slow
3058000	3060000	Outflow decay
3060000	3062000	Um
3062000	3064000	Um
3064000	3066000	I think I think this may be
3066000	3068000	Carefully pushed down to see
3068000	3070000	Its connection here
3070000	3072000	I don't think I can do it directly
3072000	3074000	In a very intuitive way
3074000	3076000	To see
3076000	3078000	This configuration
3078000	3080000	Uh in this place
3080000	3082000	Is exponential decay
3082000	3084000	The other place is power load decay
3084000	3086000	Um
3086000	3088000	If you have this feature
3088000	3090000	Type pair of voltage
3090000	3092000	You have to use math to show
3092000	3094000	For example, the amount of matter on the left and the right is different
3094000	3096000	Represents two phases
3096000	3098000	Is there anything like
3098000	3100000	Other parameters
3100000	3102000	For example
3102000	3104000	The method of decay is different
3104000	3106000	Two different phases
3106000	3108000	This place
3108000	3110000	Because you don't have
3110000	3112000	That kind
3112000	3114000	Order parameter
3114000	3116000	Um
3118000	3120000	Um
3134000	3136000	My question is
3136000	3138000	Can you define something
3138000	3140000	For example, the left phase is zero
3140000	3142000	The right phase is one
3142000	3144000	So they are different
3144000	3146000	That's the order parameter
3146000	3148000	But here
3150000	3152000	Um
3152000	3154000	Here you can only count its
3164000	3166000	Here you should count its
3170000	3172000	Some decay
3194000	3196000	Um
3206000	3208000	This may
3208000	3210000	I have to look again to answer you
3210000	3212000	Ok thank you
3212000	3214000	No problem
3214000	3216000	You go ahead
3220000	3222000	I have to review this
3224000	3226000	Um
3226000	3228000	That
3228000	3230000	Of course he should be able to
3230000	3232000	Calculate one
3232000	3234000	Is the so-called
3234000	3236000	Unchanged
3236000	3238000	For example, this is
3240000	3242000	I forgot what the number is
3242000	3244000	Or what
3244000	3246000	This is the phase
3248000	3250000	Uh, as far as I know
3250000	3252000	The number is
3252000	3254000	There is such a
3254000	3256000	Decay
3256000	3258000	It's a
3258000	3260000	It's a
3260000	3262000	It will correspond to
3262000	3264000	It's the quantity or the effect
3264000	3266000	Different
3266000	3268000	That
3272000	3274000	I'm just curious about that
3274000	3276000	Is there anything like this
3276000	3278000	It's math
3278000	3280000	You can tell me very clearly
3280000	3282000	I don't understand this
3282000	3284000	I remember there is
3284000	3286000	But not
3286000	3288000	Because here is only
3288000	3290000	All are
3290000	3292000	Spin system
3296000	3298000	Then you go ahead
3298000	3300000	I will also study it later, thank you
3300000	3302000	I may
3302000	3304000	I can check it later
3304000	3306000	Tell you
3306000	3308000	That
3308000	3310000	Just here
3310000	3312000	Talked about
3312000	3314000	Uh
3314000	3316000	Different
3316000	3318000	A few boxes and wrong
3318000	3320000	Different
3320000	3322000	If it's a few boxes
3322000	3324000	Uh
3324000	3326000	You will find
3326000	3328000	After a bite of apple
3328000	3330000	That his
3330000	3332000	His symmetry
3332000	3334000	Already
3334000	3336000	It's gone
3336000	3338000	His geometric shape has changed
3338000	3340000	But
3340000	3342000	His
3342000	3344000	Uh
3344000	3346000	What about the characteristics
3346000	3348000	Is unchanged
3348000	3350000	That's the same as this bagel
3350000	3352000	Uh
3352000	3354000	There is a hole
3354000	3356000	As long as
3356000	3358000	So this
3358000	3360000	What about this hole
3360000	3362000	If you keep it
3362000	3364000	Like I just said
3364000	3366000	Inside the equation
3366000	3368000	If that
3368000	3370000	Your conductance
3370000	3372000	With the one you calculated
3372000	3374000	Torpo
3374000	3376000	That amount
3376000	3378000	If it can correspond to
3378000	3380000	How many holes are you here
3380000	3382000	If there is a hole, two holes, three holes
3382000	3384000	Will correspond to you
3384000	3386000	Conductance is
3386000	3388000	There is a change in the whole number
3388000	3390000	Of course I can't find it
3390000	3392000	Two holes
3392000	3394000	If you find this
3394000	3396000	There are many holes in the answer
3396000	3398000	That's it
3398000	3400000	Um
3400000	3402000	Um
3402000	3404000	Um
3404000	3406000	Um
3406000	3408000	Um
3408000	3410000	Okay, I just said
3410000	3412000	I think
3412000	3414000	Maybe not very good
3414000	3416000	Um
3416000	3418000	What I'm going to talk about is
3418000	3420000	The anti-iron
3420000	3422000	Uh
3422000	3424000	Eisenberg model
3424000	3426000	First of all, these equations
3426000	3428000	Uh
3428000	3430000	The XY model just now
3430000	3432000	Is
3432000	3434000	Only
3434000	3436000	Which amount
3436000	3438000	Only x and y
3438000	3440000	And between this amount
3440000	3442000	It's just a number
3442000	3444000	That now
3444000	3446000	This
3446000	3448000	What about the amount of this equation
3448000	3450000	It's not just a number
3450000	3452000	What about them
3452000	3454000	Can't be exchanged
3454000	3456000	What about ax and y
3456000	3458000	For example, there is this
3458000	3460000	Is
3460000	3462000	xy
3462000	3464000	minus yx
3464000	3466000	Will equal
3466000	3468000	Is z
3468000	3470000	In this case, this is a
3470000	3472000	The model of quantum mechanics
3472000	3474000	That
3474000	3476000	His
3476000	3478000	This side
3478000	3480000	Is
3480000	3482000	If the inner machine is also
3482000	3484000	x times x
3484000	3486000	y times y z times z
3486000	3488000	What about this model
3488000	3490000	This if x is equal to
3490000	3492000	One-half
3492000	3494000	You can use
3494000	3496000	A mathematical technique called beta ansatz
3496000	3498000	Solve it
3498000	3500000	After that
3500000	3502000	Of course
3502000	3504000	There is another
3504000	3506000	This mathematical theorem
3506000	3508000	Is
3508000	3510000	Three people
3510000	3512000	That lsm
3512000	3514000	Three people's theorem
3514000	3516000	What about this theorem
3516000	3518000	He is using
3518000	3520000	Uh
3522000	3524000	You define one first
3524000	3526000	Another operator
3526000	3528000	Then put it in
3528000	3530000	Ground state
3530000	3532000	Then found
3532000	3534000	He and the original
3534000	3536000	Ground state is positive
3536000	3538000	Then found
3538000	3540000	This positive state
3540000	3542000	So this positive state
3542000	3544000	Uh
3544000	3546000	With ground state is positive
3546000	3548000	And his energy
3548000	3550000	To
3550000	3552000	When thermodynamics is limited
3552000	3554000	When n is equal to infinity
3554000	3556000	He and ground state
3556000	3558000	The energy is
3558000	3560000	The difference is equal to zero
3560000	3562000	For example
3562000	3564000	Of course here
3564000	3566000	Calculate directly with numerical
3566000	3568000	Ground state
3568000	3570000	This is the size
3570000	3572000	That size
3572000	3574000	What about this
3574000	3576000	Is
3576000	3578000	To find his
3578000	3580000	Is his
3580000	3582000	Parity is equal to
3582000	3584000	Positive or negative
3584000	3586000	Excited state
3586000	3588000	Then these two
3588000	3590000	To thermodynamics
3590000	3592000	Why do I say
3592000	3594000	Because there are some
3594000	3596000	Sometimes
3596000	3598000	When n is equal to
3598000	3600000	If n is equal to 4 times
3600000	3602000	That
3602000	3604000	10 is p
3604000	3606000	Equal to positive 1
3606000	3608000	That excited state is negative 1
3608000	3610000	But if
3610000	3612000	n is equal to
3612000	3614000	Is
3614000	3616000	Two
3616000	3618000	2 times
3618000	3620000	But not 4 times
3620000	3622000	That is the opposite
3622000	3624000	In short, there is a positive here
3624000	3626000	One is negative
3626000	3628000	One of the two is ground state
3628000	3630000	One is excited state
3630000	3632000	That's the end
3632000	3634000	When thermodynamics is limited
3634000	3636000	He will focus on this
3636000	3638000	This is just
3638000	3640000	That solution
3640000	3642000	That is to say
3642000	3644000	This theorem tells you
3644000	3646000	As long as you are
3646000	3648000	The number of times
3648000	3650000	These are the number of times
3650000	3652000	Is the number of times
3652000	3654000	Then he has no energy
3654000	3656000	That's how it works
3656000	3658000	That but
3658000	3660000	That
3660000	3662000	Correlation
3662000	3664000	Correlation is the power of decay
3664000	3666000	That guess
3666000	3668000	That is to say
3668000	3670000	The number of times
3670000	3672000	There is a gap in the system
3672000	3674000	The number of times is different
3674000	3676000	And correlation
3676000	3678000	Correlation is exponential decay
3678000	3680000	You can define
3680000	3682000	One
3682000	3684000	The length of the connection
3684000	3686000	that
3700000	3702000	What we know now
3702000	3704000	It is said
3710000	3712000	This equation equals to 1
3712000	3718000	What kind of nature does it have?
3724000	3726000	There is another model
3726000	3728000	Is spin equal to 1
3730000	3732000	But you add this
3734000	3736000	After adding this
3736000	3738000	You S equals 1
3738000	3740000	This model becomes
3740000	3742000	Strictly solvable
3742000	3744000	Strictly solvable
3744000	3746000	After you solve it, you will find that its ground state
3746000	3748000	It looks like this
3748000	3750000	This big circle
3752000	3754000	Is a spin 1 thing
3756000	3758000	The two dots in it
3758000	3760000	Is two
3760000	3762000	You look at it
3762000	3764000	This spin 1 is actually two
3764000	3766000	One-half spin
3766000	3768000	One-half spin
3768000	3770000	It can be one-half positive and one-half negative
3770000	3772000	So here it can be
3772000	3774000	Here it can be
3774000	3776000	One-half positive and one-half negative
3776000	3778000	Here it can be one-half positive and one-half negative
3778000	3780000	So there are a total of four possibilities
3780000	3782000	These four possibilities
3782000	3784000	But spin 1, it has
3784000	3786000	1, 0, negative 1, 3
3786000	3788000	Three possibilities
3788000	3790000	You find that
3790000	3792000	Two spins
3792000	3794000	One-half
3794000	3796000	Plus one-half
3796000	3798000	One-half
3798000	3800000	Is a spin 0 thing
3800000	3802000	That type
3802000	3804000	Is called
3804000	3806000	Singlet
3806000	3808000	The other three
3808000	3810000	Is spin equal to 1
3810000	3812000	That triplet
3812000	3814000	This circle is
3814000	3816000	This big circle is
3816000	3818000	These two spins
3818000	3820000	One-half
3820000	3822000	Translated into a
3822000	3824000	Spin triplet type
3824000	3826000	That
3826000	3828000	The blue stick is
3828000	3830000	This spin and the other spin
3830000	3832000	Form
3832000	3834000	Singlet
3834000	3836000	That way
3836000	3838000	After all this
3838000	3840000	If you are
3840000	3842000	This is the Open Boundary Condition
3842000	3844000	You find the most
3844000	3846000	One-half spin
3846000	3848000	He has no one
3848000	3850000	Can match him
3850000	3852000	So it will become a
3852000	3854000	Free
3854000	3856000	This
3856000	3858000	This state is out
3858000	3860000	You can see it here
3860000	3862000	He has one
3862000	3864000	Is the boundary
3864000	3866000	In this case, it will cause this side
3866000	3868000	This side can also
3868000	3870000	Up
3870000	3872000	Then you can also
3872000	3874000	The whole thing is
3874000	3876000	But
3876000	3878000	If you are
3878000	3880000	If you make a circle
3880000	3882000	With this spin
3882000	3884000	It will form Singlet again
3884000	3886000	The whole ground state is unique
3886000	3888000	There is no boundary
3888000	3890000	But if OBC, it is
3890000	3892000	Four-layer boundary
3892000	3894000	such
3894000	3896000	Um
3896000	3898000	What if you are
3898000	3900000	PBC
3900000	3902000	You can still calculate
3904000	3906000	Another thing
3906000	3908000	You put
3908000	3910000	A circle
3910000	3912000	A circle and then
3912000	3914000	Cut into two sides
3914000	3916000	One side is called A
3916000	3918000	The other side is called B
3918000	3920000	Then you
3920000	3922000	You put this ground state
3922000	3924000	Trace off the B part
3924000	3926000	Calculate his
3926000	3928000	Reduce Density Matrix
3928000	3930000	This Reduce Density Matrix
3930000	3932000	Assume it
3932000	3934000	If he is
3934000	3936000	One
3936000	3938000	Uh
3938000	3940000	Just like
3940000	3942000	Density Matrix
3942000	3944000	There is a temperature
3944000	3946000	You have one
3946000	3948000	Your Density Matrix should be exponential
3948000	3950000	Negative beta
3950000	3952000	H
3952000	3954000	But you
3954000	3956000	This H is not
3956000	3958000	A part
3958000	3960000	A part of Hamiltonian
3960000	3962000	That
3962000	3964000	This H does not know what
3964000	3966000	A part of Hamiltonian
3966000	3968000	Generally speaking, you will not just
3968000	3970000	After you finish
3970000	3972000	This is just the A part of Hamiltonian
3972000	3974000	So
3974000	3976000	The temperature in front
3976000	3978000	Beta is meaningless
3978000	3980000	Then put this
3980000	3982000	The temperature in front is absorbed
3982000	3984000	Absorbed into this Hamiltonian
3984000	3986000	Then put this Hamiltonian
3986000	3988000	Intangible Hamiltonian
3988000	3990000	What about this Hamiltonian
3990000	3992000	His
3992000	3994000	Eigenvalue
3994000	3996000	That is
3996000	3998000	That is
3998000	4000000	This is called Intangible
4000000	4002000	Spectrum
4002000	4004000	Omega i is
4004000	4006000	If the Eigenvalue of rho a
4006000	4008000	Then you put it on both sides
4008000	4010000	If you take the log, you will find
4010000	4012000	I want to know
4012000	4014000	This Intangible Hamiltonian
4014000	4016000	Spectrum
4016000	4018000	That is
4018000	4020000	Do it like this
4020000	4022000	Then
4022000	4024000	You can find out
4024000	4026000	Because you did this trace
4026000	4028000	So if you are a circle
4028000	4030000	If a ring
4030000	4032000	You will have two
4032000	4034000	You will have two edges
4034000	4036000	Two edges
4036000	4038000	Two edges
4038000	4040000	Is a
4040000	4042000	Your density matrix
4042000	4044000	Can be written as
4044000	4046000	This kind of product way
4046000	4048000	This kind of product way
4048000	4050000	No matter what rho 0 is
4050000	4052000	Then your
4052000	4054000	Omega i
4054000	4056000	Must be
4056000	4058000	This must be
4058000	4060000	But if
4060000	4062000	If you are
4062000	4064000	What is used
4064000	4066000	Infinite chain
4066000	4068000	You don't care about this boundary
4068000	4070000	Very far away
4070000	4072000	Then
4072000	4074000	Then you cut it in the middle
4074000	4076000	Then go here
4076000	4078000	Then you will find
4078000	4080000	At least every word
4080000	4082000	Because you only cut one
4082000	4084000	Boundary
4084000	4086000	If
4086000	4088000	The first is another parameter
4088000	4090000	Will talk later
4090000	4092000	If
4092000	4094000	AKLT
4094000	4096000	1 out of 3
4096000	4098000	If you make it a parameter
4098000	4100000	Then
4100000	4102000	If you make it smaller
4102000	4104000	You will find this ground state
4104000	4106000	Will be
4106000	4108000	Adiabatic
4108000	4110000	Will connect
4110000	4112000	To this
4112000	4114000	Heisenberg model
4114000	4116000	Heisenberg
4116000	4118000	Model
4118000	4120000	Is probably
4120000	4122000	This kind of
4122000	4124000	Configuration
4124000	4126000	Then
4126000	4128000	Intangible
4128000	4130000	Because you have edge state
4130000	4132000	So in
4132000	4134000	Holden phase
4134000	4136000	If you cut an edge
4136000	4138000	You are
4138000	4140000	If you are
4140000	4142000	Periodic boundary condition
4142000	4144000	Then you will have
4144000	4146000	Four edges
4146000	4148000	If you are in this place
4148000	4150000	You didn't add
4150000	4152000	Symmetry
4152000	4154000	Z2Z this is
4154000	4156000	This is
4156000	4158000	The face of the antithesis
4158000	4160000	That this is
4160000	4162000	You are the same
4162000	4164000	There is no here
4164000	4166000	There is no O, there is no O here
4166000	4168000	Here
4168000	4170000	Of course there is O
4170000	4172000	Here and here
4172000	4174000	No O
4174000	4176000	There is no symmetry
4176000	4178000	Destroy any symmetry
4178000	4180000	But
4180000	4182000	But you can see here
4182000	4184000	Here you can have
4184000	4186000	Intangible spectrum
4186000	4188000	At least two-fold
4188000	4190000	Here
4190000	4192000	There is no need to
4192000	4194000	Two-fold
4194000	4196000	There is no
4196000	4198000	This is a coincidence
4198000	4200000	There will be a
4200000	4202000	But at least there is no
4202000	4204000	That this
4204000	4206000	Can be regarded as
4206000	4208000	He is
4208000	4210000	Topological face
4210000	4212000	One
4212000	4214000	One possibility
4214000	4216000	One possibility
4216000	4218000	One possibility
4218000	4220000	Probably like this
4220000	4222000	That
4222000	4224000	That
4224000	4226000	That
4226000	4228000	That
4228000	4230000	That
4230000	4232000	That
4232000	4234000	That
4234000	4236000	That
4236000	4238000	That
4238000	4240000	That
4240000	4242000	If you want to use
4242000	4244000	Intangible spectrum
4244000	4246000	Is it here
4246000	4248000	He has a topological
4248000	4250000	If the face
4250000	4252000	That is also a problem
4252000	4254000	Because we don't know yet
4254000	4256000	How to define
4256000	4258000	Intangible
4258000	4260000	That
4260000	4262000	Maybe i'm
4262000	4264000	After that, I'll take a look
4264000	4266000	That
4266000	4268000	Turn the book over again
4268000	4270000	That
4270000	4272000	Of course
4272000	4274000	Everyone knows that he took the Nobel Prize
4274000	4276000	He
4276000	4278000	Nobel Prize
4278000	4280000	Of course, Hoden and Kosterlitz
4280000	4282000	With Solace
4282000	4284000	The three of them got the Nobel Prize together
4284000	4286000	That they
4286000	4288000	Nobel official
4288000	4290000	Give them everyone
4290000	4292000	There is a certificate like this
4292000	4294000	That
4294000	4296000	Everyone's picture is different
4296000	4298000	Hoden's picture
4298000	4300000	Of course, Hoden has another contribution
4300000	4302000	Hoden's picture is a
4302000	4304000	This circle
4304000	4306000	This circle
4306000	4308000	This circle
4308000	4310000	This is a spin
4310000	4312000	That this stick
4312000	4314000	This stick is
4314000	4316000	A single
4316000	4318000	That
4318000	4320000	One like this
4320000	4322000	That aklt
4322000	4324000	One aklt
4324000	4326000	That
4326000	4328000	Material
4328000	4330000	Uh
4330000	4332000	But Hoden
4332000	4334000	Hoden's idea
4334000	4336000	After that
4336000	4338000	That
4338000	4340000	Soon that
4340000	4342000	Experiment
4342000	4344000	The material is made
4344000	4346000	Of course the material is three-dimensional
4346000	4348000	But this
4348000	4350000	Is that
4350000	4352000	It is spin one
4352000	4354000	Particle
4354000	4356000	The one next to it is green
4356000	4358000	Green particles
4358000	4360000	Green words like spin two
4360000	4362000	Green words are a
4362000	4364000	A
4364000	4366000	That
4366000	4368000	Through this green
4368000	4370000	For example, like spin two
4370000	4372000	This is a spin two
4372000	4374000	This particle
4374000	4376000	That through the middle of this green
4376000	4378000	He
4378000	4380000	His interaction will be through
4380000	4382000	Through this green
4382000	4384000	To reach
4384000	4386000	That
4386000	4388000	Super exchange
4388000	4390000	He might jump in the middle
4390000	4392000	Then jump over here
4392000	4394000	Then jump back
4394000	4396000	That will become
4396000	4398000	Like this Hamiltonian
4398000	4400000	Like this material
4400000	4402000	This
4402000	4404000	Along this c axis
4404000	4406000	Is a circle
4406000	4408000	This is also a circle
4408000	4410000	So there are a total of four here
4410000	4412000	Four circles
4412000	4414000	Inside the circle
4414000	4416000	Through this green
4416000	4418000	To reach this interaction
4418000	4420000	To reach this super exchange
4420000	4422000	Interaction
4422000	4424000	What about the different circles?
4424000	4426000	This one to this one
4426000	4428000	He's going to
4428000	4430000	If you want to form this interaction
4430000	4432000	He
4432000	4434000	At least
4434000	4436000	Through the middle of two
4436000	4438000	Green
4438000	4440000	To reach this interaction
4440000	4442000	In this case, it means
4442000	4444000	Say this J
4444000	4446000	The size of this J
4446000	4448000	This in the circle
4448000	4450000	The size will be much smaller
4450000	4452000	Much smaller
4452000	4454000	Much smaller
4454000	4456000	As if he did not
4456000	4458000	What about the first word?
4458000	4460000	Is called single ion
4460000	4462000	Anisotropy
4462000	4464000	This one
4464000	4466000	Here
4466000	4468000	Basically this one
4468000	4470000	If it's not too big
4470000	4472000	What about this circle?
4472000	4474000	Can be regarded as
4474000	4476000	Spin one
4476000	4478000	This material is regarded as
4478000	4480000	Then later
4480000	4482000	A lot of materials
4482000	4484000	Found and did
4484000	4486000	Anisotropy
4486000	4488000	Then
4488000	4490000	It proves that Houghton's guess is right
4490000	4492000	Spin two
4492000	4494000	But less
4494000	4496000	Then
4496000	4498000	For example, this material
4498000	4500000	Should
4500000	4502000	This should still be because
4502000	4504000	It may be difficult to make
4504000	4506000	Now
4506000	4508000	There should still be people doing it
4508000	4510000	There seems to be some
4510000	4512000	Dispute
4512000	4514000	But usually
4514000	4516000	This one
4516000	4518000	Is in the material
4518000	4520000	Will have
4520000	4522000	The main thing is this single ion
4522000	4524000	Anisotropy is like this
4524000	4526000	This is a low orbit
4526000	4528000	Five orbits
4528000	4530000	What about the low orbit?
4530000	4532000	dSyS square
4532000	4534000	Y square
4534000	4536000	dZ square
4536000	4538000	dSyDyz
4538000	4540000	dDyz
4540000	4542000	What about the top here?
4542000	4544000	This side is
4544000	4546000	You
4546000	4548000	At this top
4548000	4550000	Originally should be
4550000	4552000	Have that
4552000	4554000	Other
4554000	4556000	Other orbit
4556000	4558000	Other electrons
4558000	4560000	Put these
4560000	4562000	Are regarded as a dot
4562000	4564000	If
4564000	4566000	If there are no such dots
4566000	4568000	These five orbits are
4568000	4570000	The energy is the same
4570000	4572000	Is the same
4572000	4574000	But now you put this top
4574000	4576000	After putting it up
4576000	4578000	Then you will find this energy
4578000	4580000	There are two types
4580000	4582000	One type of EG
4582000	4584000	Is these three
4584000	4586000	These two
4586000	4588000	The energy is the same
4588000	4590000	These three
4590000	4592000	These three
4592000	4594000	The energy is the same
4594000	4596000	Because you see
4596000	4598000	The distance is the same
4598000	4600000	Just
4600000	4602000	Just rotate the angle a little
4602000	4604000	These three energies are the same
4604000	4606000	These three T2G energy are the same
4606000	4608000	These two are the same
4608000	4610000	What if
4610000	4612000	You
4612000	4614000	These two above
4614000	4616000	You are also in the middle
4616000	4618000	Up and down
4618000	4620000	Extend or shorten
4620000	4622000	Extend and shorten
4622000	4624000	You
4624000	4626000	This one
4626000	4628000	This one and this energy
4628000	4630000	Will be divided
4630000	4632000	It's different
4632000	4634000	This one
4634000	4636000	With
4636000	4638000	These two
4638000	4640000	The energy will be different
4640000	4642000	These two
4642000	4644000	These two energies are still the same
4644000	4646000	If it is up and down
4646000	4648000	This one is different from these two
4648000	4650000	So
4650000	4652000	EG will be divided here
4652000	4654000	Assuming
4654000	4656000	Then these three
4656000	4658000	Will be divided
4658000	4660000	These two are the same
4660000	4662000	Then dxy
4662000	4664000	The energy is divided
4664000	4666000	These two are still short
4666000	4668000	How to
4668000	4670000	Let these two not be short
4670000	4672000	Is
4672000	4674000	This one
4674000	4676000	This one in the middle
4676000	4678000	This one
4678000	4680000	This one with color
4680000	4682000	This is a square
4682000	4684000	This was originally a square
4684000	4686000	If this square
4686000	4688000	You
4688000	4690000	You
4690000	4692000	Because of some reasons
4692000	4694000	Become
4694000	4696000	Square or not square
4696000	4698000	Then you will further cause
4698000	4700000	These two
4700000	4702000	The energy is divided
4702000	4704000	Sorry
4704000	4706000	Wait a minute
4706000	4708000	Our recording may be
4708000	4710000	End in about ten minutes
4710000	4712000	How many videos do you have
4712000	4714000	Almost
4714000	4716000	Okay
4716000	4718000	Control
4718000	4720000	In the back
4720000	4722000	Some new results
4722000	4724000	Let's talk about the results first
4724000	4726000	We may not understand the results
4726000	4728000	I don't understand
4728000	4730000	Actually
4730000	4732000	I am still
4732000	4734000	Introduction
4734000	4736000	Introduce some
4736000	4738000	Because I think this is
4738000	4740000	Very popular recently
4740000	4742000	Not so many people understand
4742000	4744000	I think the introduction is very interesting
4744000	4746000	That
4746000	4748000	Let everyone know
4748000	4750000	I think we have to talk very well
4750000	4752000	Some of the previous questions
4752000	4754000	I don't understand
4754000	4756000	I understand part of it
4756000	4758000	Correct
4758000	4760000	I understand that I have done it myself
4760000	4762000	This part
4762000	4764000	That
4764000	4766000	Then I will speak faster here
4766000	4768000	If you are here
4768000	4770000	What about this distortion
4770000	4772000	This is
4772000	4774000	Spin orbital coupling
4774000	4776000	You will become
4776000	4778000	Similar
4778000	4780000	It will become like this
4780000	4782000	Like this
4782000	4784000	That way ax and ay az
4784000	4786000	Three parameters
4786000	4788000	These three parameters are with you
4788000	4790000	The size of these three parameters will be with you
4790000	4792000	How to split here
4792000	4794000	Will be related
4794000	4796000	What about these three
4796000	4798000	There are actually three parameters
4798000	4800000	In fact, there are only two parameters
4800000	4802000	If it is a square
4802000	4804000	It is equal to s times s plus 1
4804000	4806000	That is
4806000	4808000	You can push it down
4808000	4810000	This ha can finally be written
4810000	4812000	Like this
4812000	4814000	This is a parameter
4814000	4816000	This is also a parameter
4816000	4818000	s times s plus 1
4818000	4820000	s equals 1
4820000	4822000	s equals 1, then 1 times 1 plus 1 equals 2
4822000	4824000	So this is a parameter
4824000	4826000	Only this sz square
4826000	4828000	With ss square minus sy square
4828000	4830000	So this parameter has only two parameters
4830000	4832000	If you throw away those parameters
4832000	4834000	That single isomers
4834000	4836000	That you are the source of this parameter
4836000	4838000	You just follow you
4838000	4840000	Up and down here
4840000	4842000	If there is distortion
4842000	4844000	Then you will
4844000	4846000	If you are all
4846000	4848000	Then you will have this d
4848000	4850000	If you are all
4850000	4852000	Isotropic
4852000	4854000	Then you are here
4854000	4856000	There is no d and 1
4856000	4858000	If you have this square
4858000	4860000	Becomes a rectangle or a ring
4860000	4862000	You will have this 1
4862000	4864000	That's it
4864000	4866000	So my previous work
4868000	4870000	The previous work is
4870000	4872000	Go
4872000	4874000	Use the numerical method
4874000	4876000	Such
4876000	4878000	Face diagram
4878000	4880000	To calculate his face diagram
4880000	4882000	Then go to see his
4882000	4884000	The nature of one state
4884000	4886000	The first is s
4886000	4888000	s equals 1
4888000	4890000	This
4890000	4892000	In the early
4892000	4894000	Someone has done it
4894000	4896000	Then I also
4896000	4898000	Teacher Yang
4898000	4900000	Some questions
4900000	4902000	Then put this place
4902000	4904000	This place is
4904000	4906000	The middle is the face
4906000	4908000	From here to the face
4908000	4910000	Nothing happens
4910000	4912000	Symmetry
4912000	4914000	Symmetry is not broken
4914000	4916000	That is to say this whole
4916000	4918000	Are all
4918000	4920000	That if
4920000	4922000	You are here
4922000	4924000	The earliest
4924000	4926000	The earliest classification of the face
4926000	4928000	You put that free energy
4928000	4930000	For external parameters
4930000	4932000	If the division is not continuous
4932000	4934000	You are the face
4934000	4936000	If the division is not continuous
4936000	4938000	That is the face
4938000	4940000	Then later
4940000	4942000	After the symmetry theorem
4942000	4944000	You have those old parameters
4944000	4946000	You divide it into
4946000	4948000	You if
4948000	4950000	Your old parameters
4950000	4952000	Continuous
4952000	4954000	Is not continuous
4954000	4956000	That is not continuous
4956000	4958000	Then he is a face
4958000	4960000	If the old parameters are continuous
4960000	4962000	Then he is called continuous face
4962000	4964000	Then he belongs to the second stage
4964000	4966000	The above face
4966000	4968000	Is called continuous face
4968000	4970000	Or some people say
4970000	4972000	These are called the second stage face
4972000	4974000	But if you want to subdivide
4974000	4976000	Still can
4976000	4978000	At zero temperature
4978000	4980000	You divide the ground state
4980000	4982000	Then you see him
4982000	4984000	A few times
4984000	4986000	That
4986000	4988000	This one
4988000	4990000	What if
4990000	4992000	You go to see the first one
4992000	4994000	These two parameters
4994000	4996000	Let me talk about this face diagram first
4996000	4998000	This face diagram
4998000	5000000	From this red dot
5000000	5002000	From here to here
5002000	5004000	This red arrow
5004000	5006000	Because there is no
5006000	5008000	Any
5008000	5010000	Symmetry
5010000	5012000	Because if it is
5012000	5014000	If it is
5014000	5016000	The value of SZ can be
5016000	5018000	10-1
5018000	5020000	That 10-1
5020000	5022000	His square will become
5022000	5024000	10-1
5024000	5026000	So if D is very big
5026000	5028000	You don't look at the other lines
5028000	5030000	That is very big
5030000	5032000	That
5032000	5034000	If the energy wants to be lower
5034000	5036000	That must be SZ equal to zero
5036000	5038000	So it becomes
5038000	5040000	This large
5040000	5042000	The limit of D becomes
5042000	5044000	SZ equal to
5044000	5046000	Zero
5046000	5048000	That SZ is equal to zero
5048000	5050000	Of course there is no
5050000	5052000	No order
5052000	5054000	Because you have to see
5054000	5056000	All of you
5058000	5060000	All of you
5060000	5062000	SZ you can't measure
5062000	5064000	You don't have magnetization
5064000	5066000	That red dot is not here
5066000	5068000	So I
5068000	5070000	Actually I didn't say
5070000	5072000	I didn't say
5072000	5074000	He actually has a string order
5074000	5076000	That you put these materials
5076000	5078000	Go find people to do experiments
5078000	5080000	This material
5080000	5082000	It will be very close to here
5082000	5084000	It still falls
5084000	5086000	Very close to this critical point
5086000	5088000	That critical point
5088000	5090000	What if you have a little bit
5090000	5092000	You will enter another phase
5092000	5094000	That these two phases
5094000	5096000	I haven't found it before
5096000	5098000	So we think
5098000	5100000	If it is on this material
5100000	5102000	Add a little
5102000	5104000	Distortion
5104000	5106000	That is very likely to let
5106000	5108000	Enter
5108000	5110000	Not enter large
5110000	5112000	But enter
5112000	5114000	Y-face or X-face
5114000	5116000	That's it
5116000	5118000	Intangible spectrum
5118000	5120000	Also said
5120000	5122000	Here is
5122000	5124000	Self-reduction
5124000	5126000	First of all, here we do
5126000	5128000	A periodic boundary condition
5128000	5130000	Just one
5130000	5132000	A closed ring
5132000	5134000	What about this ring
5134000	5136000	This is the energy
5136000	5138000	The energy of the ground state is at the bottom
5138000	5140000	Then
5140000	5142000	The energy of the excited state
5142000	5144000	According to your different quantum number
5144000	5146000	Divided out
5146000	5148000	Of course this paragraph
5148000	5150000	Is the magnetization gap
5150000	5152000	Then when you add 1
5152000	5154000	This gap
5154000	5156000	But here
5156000	5158000	Not
5158000	5160000	But there is
5160000	5162000	Another kind of gap
5162000	5164000	What about this gap
5164000	5166000	So this place is the ground state
5166000	5168000	But it still has a gap
5168000	5170000	If you go here
5170000	5172000	He just
5172000	5174000	There is no reduction
5174000	5176000	It becomes
5176000	5178000	Sx equals 0
5178000	5180000	Product state
5180000	5182000	Not Sz equals 0
5182000	5184000	Sx equals 0
5184000	5186000	Intangible spectrum
5186000	5188000	You will see
5188000	5190000	Indeed in this place
5190000	5192000	There are four points here
5192000	5194000	This red
5194000	5196000	Then black triangle
5196000	5198000	Then black cross green
5198000	5200000	This is a quadruple reduction
5200000	5202000	This is a quadruple reduction
5202000	5204000	Here is a symmetry breaking phase
5204000	5206000	It is a quadruple reduction
5206000	5208000	The origin of the quadruple reduction is because
5208000	5210000	This ground state is double
5210000	5212000	The ground state itself is double degeneracy
5212000	5214000	Then you have quantum number
5214000	5216000	Then it becomes
5216000	5218000	The ground state you choose
5218000	5220000	The ground state
5220000	5222000	Will be with these quantum numbers
5222000	5224000	That means it is
5224000	5226000	A certain
5226000	5228000	Add type
5228000	5230000	For example, it's all up down up down
5230000	5232000	Or add up up up
5232000	5234000	That's a bit like
5234000	5236000	That Schrodinger's cat type
5236000	5238000	Cat state
5238000	5240000	Will cause all
5240000	5242000	Intangible spectrum
5242000	5244000	Quadruple reduction
5244000	5246000	That can be used like this
5246000	5248000	Quadruple reduction here
5248000	5250000	Quadruple reduction
5250000	5252000	No reduction
5252000	5254000	Here is
5254000	5256000	Here is Hodian phase
5256000	5258000	Here is
5258000	5260000	Symmetry breaking phase
5260000	5262000	Here is trivial phase
5262000	5264000	Hodian phase is
5264000	5266000	Symmetry protected
5266000	5268000	Topological phase
5268000	5270000	I forgot to say here again
5270000	5272000	Correlation
5272000	5274000	Correlation
5274000	5276000	Correlation
5276000	5278000	Correlation is a more traditional way
5278000	5280000	Look at those order
5280000	5282000	I think the focus should be
5282000	5284000	Why
5284000	5286000	What is symmetry protected topological phase
5286000	5288000	What is symmetry protected topological phase
5288000	5290000	Should be
5294000	5296000	I did not put this powerpoint
5300000	5302000	It's okay
5302000	5304000	That is to say
5304000	5306000	That is to say
5306000	5308000	That is to say
5308000	5310000	You this
5310000	5312000	This middle
5312000	5314000	This Hodian
5314000	5316000	If this phase
5316000	5318000	If you
5318000	5320000	If your Hamiltonian
5320000	5322000	You did not add
5322000	5324000	Other items
5324000	5326000	If you add an item
5326000	5328000	You keep
5328000	5330000	You keep
5330000	5332000	Symmetry
5332000	5334000	For example, this Hodian phase
5334000	5336000	It has three symmetries
5336000	5338000	To protect it
5338000	5340000	The first is
5340000	5342000	Is parity
5342000	5344000	Is mirror
5344000	5346000	Is reflection
5346000	5348000	Is left and right
5348000	5350000	Is left and right
5350000	5352000	Symmetry
5352000	5354000	The second is time reversal symmetry
5354000	5356000	Is time reversal
5356000	5358000	All spin
5358000	5360000	SxSySy
5360000	5362000	SxSySy
5362000	5364000	Take the sub-number
5364000	5366000	Two sub-numbers
5366000	5368000	Both sub-numbers will be removed
5368000	5370000	So
5370000	5372000	It has time reversal symmetry
5372000	5374000	The other is more difficult to see
5374000	5376000	Is Z2
5376000	5378000	Z2 symmetry
5378000	5380000	As long as you add
5380000	5382000	Other perturbation
5382000	5384000	If there is no destruction
5384000	5386000	If there are no three destructions
5386000	5388000	Then
5388000	5390000	Hodian phase will still exist
5390000	5392000	This is still
5392000	5394000	Unless your perturbation is strong enough
5394000	5396000	It will be destroyed
5396000	5398000	Just like you added this
5398000	5400000	D and 1
5400000	5402000	If you add D and 1
5402000	5404000	Did not destroy time reversal symmetry
5404000	5406000	Did not destroy parity
5406000	5408000	Did not destroy
5408000	5410000	Z2 symmetry
5410000	5412000	So
5412000	5414000	So
5414000	5416000	When D is big enough
5416000	5418000	There will be a
5418000	5420000	There will be symmetry
5420000	5422000	That
5422000	5424000	That
5428000	5430000	Correlation skip first
5430000	5432000	That
5432000	5434000	This is
5434000	5436000	Monumentality
5436000	5438000	Is to set
5438000	5440000	I take this amount to set
5440000	5442000	Critical point
5442000	5444000	But
5444000	5446000	What about the critical point just now?
5446000	5448000	If you are AKLT state
5448000	5450000	You can use
5450000	5452000	Twisted boundary condition
5452000	5454000	That twisted boundary condition
5454000	5456000	You will let
5456000	5458000	This side
5458000	5460000	This spin
5460000	5462000	This boundary becomes a triplet
5462000	5464000	If you are
5464000	5466000	If you have multiple spin 1
5466000	5468000	If you are in Hodian phase
5468000	5470000	If you are in Hodian phase
5470000	5472000	There will be multiple singlet
5472000	5474000	Every singlet
5474000	5476000	Your parity is equal to negative 1
5476000	5478000	So you have multiple
5478000	5480000	It is equal to 1
5480000	5482000	That will be with large D phase
5482000	5484000	Can't tell
5484000	5486000	But if you are twisted boundary condition
5486000	5488000	That
5488000	5490000	You have multiple spin
5490000	5492000	You will have multiple singlet
5492000	5494000	This is a triplet
5494000	5496000	This triplet is parity equal to 1
5496000	5498000	This triplet is parity equal to negative 1
5498000	5500000	So this parity is equal to negative 1
5500000	5502000	This parity is equal to 1
5502000	5504000	You can do this level crossing
5504000	5506000	Is to put this 1 and negative 1
5506000	5508000	Do cross
5508000	5510000	That cross point
5510000	5512000	Just take it as your critical point
5512000	5514000	Then under the finite size
5514000	5516000	A critical point
5516000	5518000	Do finite size scaling
5518000	5520000	Finally you will get a very accurate
5520000	5522000	Critical critical point
5522000	5524000	That's it
5524000	5526000	Of course you can always use
5526000	5528000	Spin 2
5528000	5530000	Because spin 2
5530000	5532000	In 1992
5532000	5534000	Oshikawa
5534000	5536000	He is
5536000	5538000	I think it should
5538000	5540000	After you add this D
5540000	5542000	There may be middle
5542000	5544000	Middle phase
5544000	5546000	Not only from Hodian phase to large D phase
5546000	5548000	First spin 2
5548000	5550000	His Hodian
5550000	5552000	This isotropic
5552000	5554000	Heisenberg point
5554000	5556000	This phase is also here
5556000	5558000	This place is very small
5558000	5560000	That means his
5560000	5562000	He is very close to the critical point
5562000	5564000	His correlation length is actually quite long
5564000	5566000	There are about 60
5566000	5568000	In fact, if you put the whole image
5568000	5570000	If you get it out
5570000	5572000	In fact, this Hodian phase
5572000	5574000	With large D
5574000	5576000	This phase is connected
5576000	5578000	That is to say
5578000	5580000	Hodian phase
5580000	5582000	Trivial phase
5582000	5584000	Not
5584000	5586000	Topological phase
5586000	5588000	But you can still
5588000	5590000	Find one in the middle
5590000	5592000	Similar to
5592000	5594000	Intermediate D phase of spin 1
5594000	5596000	This is a topological phase
5596000	5598000	Because
5598000	5600000	This frame is mapped to spin
5600000	5602000	1
5602000	5604000	This frame is mapped to spin 2
5604000	5606000	And it is Sz equals 0
5606000	5608000	This is Sz equals 0
5608000	5610000	Spin 1
5610000	5612000	That looks like
5612000	5614000	AKLT state
5614000	5616000	That
5616000	5618000	Of course it is magnified
5618000	5620000	It can be seen
5620000	5622000	This
5622000	5624000	This is the way
5626000	5628000	That's the conclusion
5628000	5630000	Symmetry is actually
5630000	5632000	In physics
5632000	5634000	It's still a very important role
5634000	5636000	Because if you have symmetry
5640000	5642000	One is symmetry
5642000	5644000	Protective
5644000	5646000	There is another
5646000	5648000	In fact, you don't need symmetry
5648000	5650000	It has its own
5650000	5652000	Topological
5652000	5654000	That
5654000	5656000	It's not in 1D
5656000	5658000	That 1D
5660000	5662000	Can have
5662000	5664000	Must have
5664000	5666000	Symmetry
5666000	5668000	That
5668000	5670000	Um
5672000	5674000	1D spin system
5674000	5676000	I think there are still a lot of places to do
5676000	5678000	Um
5678000	5680000	That's about it
5680000	5682000	My speech
5682000	5684000	I think I didn't speak well
5684000	5686000	No, I think
5686000	5688000	Probably know the important
5688000	5690000	Where
5690000	5692000	From introduction
5692000	5694000	To the real result
5694000	5696000	Is
5698000	5700000	I feel a little bit
5700000	5702000	I don't know
5702000	5704000	The link in the middle
5704000	5706000	Where is it
5706000	5708000	And you can talk about it
5708000	5710000	Half an hour you should be very tired
5712000	5714000	Can I ask a question
5714000	5716000	Can
5716000	5718000	I have a question about that
5718000	5720000	That
5720000	5722000	That picture
5724000	5726000	What is your side
5726000	5728000	Is it
5728000	5730000	Or you later
5732000	5734000	If you want to see it here
5734000	5736000	It's a few lines of words
5736000	5738000	A method is
5738000	5740000	Ground state
5742000	5744000	Just fix a jz
5744000	5746000	And then
5746000	5748000	To ground state
5748000	5750000	To d
5750000	5752000	Energy
5752000	5754000	To d
5754000	5756000	To this
5756000	5758000	So you're here
5758000	5760000	The group you gave later
5760000	5762000	Will also give the same
5762000	5764000	Is it
5766000	5768000	In principle
5768000	5770000	But this is a mistake
5770000	5772000	The problem
5772000	5774000	But if the three-dimensional change is a five-dimensional change
5774000	5776000	If it's a five-dimensional change
5776000	5778000	Not divided
5780000	5782000	Three-dimensional and five-dimensional
5782000	5784000	Because it can't be counted
5784000	5786000	Because
5786000	5788000	The number to be divided
5788000	5790000	In fact, it is to be divided
5790000	5792000	What about your two-dimensional division
5792000	5794000	You have to count three points
5794000	5796000	If you use central
5796000	5798000	Difference
5798000	5800000	Then you
5800000	5802000	One-dimensional division
5802000	5804000	Then you have to count two points
5804000	5806000	Do the difference
5806000	5808000	You have to count three points in two-dimensional division
5808000	5810000	You have to do this point in the middle
5810000	5812000	Take two more points
5812000	5814000	That three-dimensional point to take five points
5814000	5816000	And your error will become
5816000	5818000	The error of your two-dimensional division will become
5818000	5820000	You take the square of the interval
5820000	5822000	That you three-dimensional
5822000	5824000	Become
5824000	5826000	Three-dimensional or four-dimensional
5826000	5828000	That five-dimensional
5828000	5830000	So
5830000	5832000	The three-dimensional and five-dimensional
5832000	5834000	Take advantage of
5834000	5836000	Critical exponent
5836000	5838000	Scaling
5838000	5840000	Find it out
5840000	5842000	Someone still counts
5842000	5844000	This three-dimensional
5844000	5846000	Five-dimensional
5846000	5848000	But that's not divisible
5848000	5850000	We already know
5850000	5852000	It's not divisible
5852000	5854000	But there is no serious
5854000	5856000	Three-dimensional and five-dimensional
5856000	5858000	I don't think so
5858000	5860000	Because I
5860000	5862000	I wanted to do this problem
5862000	5864000	But you have to find time
5864000	5866000	The one behind
5866000	5868000	If you don't consider
5868000	5870000	The problem of accuracy
5870000	5872000	You just find a physical quantity
5872000	5874000	For example, quantum energy
5874000	5876000	See if he has
5876000	5878000	You can find out if there is a phase transition
5878000	5880000	It doesn't matter
5880000	5882000	For example, you can do that
5882000	5884000	You can also find out the phase transition
5884000	5886000	As long as the physical quantity
5886000	5888000	You can see the phase transition
5892000	5894000	The first one is in the one-dimensional system
5898000	5900000	Either there is a gap
5900000	5902000	Or there is no gap
5902000	5904000	If there is a gap
5904000	5906000	Then your volume
5906000	5908000	Entropy
5908000	5910000	There is an area
5910000	5912000	If there is no gap
5912000	5914000	If there is no gap
5914000	5916000	Then your entropy will follow
5916000	5918000	Size log
5918000	5920000	That's what I wrote below
5920000	5922000	C is central charge
5922000	5924000	It is inferred from conformal field theory
5924000	5926000	It has a log
5926000	5928000	Here is one-third
5928000	5930000	Because I use
5930000	5932000	Periodic boundary condition
5932000	5934000	If there is some amount
5934000	5936000	There is no way
5936000	5938000	Detected
5938000	5940000	That phase transition
5940000	5942000	Before
5942000	5944000	Above
5944000	5946000	These
5946000	5948000	These two articles
5948000	5950000	Fidelity Susceptibility
5952000	5954000	Fidelity Susceptibility
5954000	5956000	Basically the concept is like this
5958000	5960000	I calculated
5960000	5962000	Choose a place
5962000	5964000	Then calculate the ground state
5964000	5966000	Then a little near
5966000	5968000	Calculate a little here
5968000	5970000	Then the next door is also a little
5970000	5972000	Two ground states
5972000	5974000	These two ground states are internal
5974000	5976000	If these two states
5976000	5978000	On the same phase
5978000	5980000	You will think you will
5980000	5982000	Expect
5982000	5984000	Its internal volume should be close to 1
5984000	5986000	If it happens
5986000	5988000	If it happens
5988000	5990000	One ground state is here
5990000	5992000	The other ground state is in another phase
5992000	5994000	Then you will expect these two
5994000	5996000	Ground state
5996000	5998000	It should be much worse
5998000	6000000	If it is much worse
6000000	6002000	It is
6002000	6004000	Internal volume
6004000	6006000	It may be very small
6006000	6008000	Use this to detect
6008000	6010000	Is there a phase change here?
6010000	6012000	In this case
6012000	6014000	In
6014000	6016000	In this example
6016000	6018000	Two-stage phase change and three-stage phase change
6018000	6020000	Can be successful
6020000	6022000	But there is no way
6022000	6024000	Five-stage phase change
6024000	6026000	Especially here
6026000	6028000	The so-called phase change here
6028000	6030000	This is the so-called
6030000	6032000	BKT transition
6032000	6034000	BKT transition is actually
6034000	6036000	You don't have to
6036000	6038000	It will happen
6038000	6040000	That is to say
6040000	6042000	It will not happen
6042000	6044000	In this case
6044000	6046000	It is difficult to detect
6046000	6048000	The phase change of this place
6048000	6050000	But if
6050000	6052000	You use
6052000	6054000	You have gaps here
6054000	6056000	Then only here is no gap
6056000	6058000	Of course there is a gap
6058000	6060000	So if you want the whole
6060000	6062000	In this
6062000	6064000	For this phase diagram
6064000	6066000	You have to use monument entropy
6066000	6068000	To set the critical point
6068000	6070000	Only here is valid
6070000	6072000	Only here is valid
6072000	6074000	If you are here
6074000	6076000	It will be difficult to find
6076000	6078000	Because there is an xy1 here
6078000	6080000	There is an xy1 here
6080000	6082000	There is also an xy2 here
6082000	6084000	These two are the gapless phase
6084000	6086000	What is this xy2
6086000	6088000	It is the kind of quadruple order
6088000	6090000	I didn't talk about
6090000	6092000	It should be like
6092000	6094000	Similar to this quadruple
6094000	6096000	This correlation
6096000	6098000	But these two are
6098000	6100000	Gapless
6100000	6102000	In monument entropy
6102000	6104000	All happened
6104000	6106000	Then you can't see it here
6106000	6108000	This is ferromagnetic
6108000	6110000	This is ferromagnetic
6110000	6112000	Ferromagnetic here is
6112000	6114000	One-phase phase change
6114000	6116000	One-phase phase change
6116000	6118000	I don't know how to use
6118000	6120000	So I don't know
6120000	6122000	Scaling here
6122000	6124000	What to do
6124000	6126000	Just in this case
6126000	6128000	This model
6128000	6130000	Selected
6130000	6132000	Actually, it's me
6132000	6134000	I calculated it first
6134000	6136000	How is it here
6136000	6138000	Then the last show is that picture
6138000	6140000	Every phase here
6140000	6142000	There is a gap
6142000	6144000	Only at these phase changes
6144000	6146000	These phase changes are gapless
6146000	6148000	In this case
6148000	6150000	Monument entropy
6150000	6152000	It looks more beautiful
6152000	6154000	Then you find this
6154000	6156000	Single place
6156000	6158000	This is the peak
6158000	6160000	That's the gap
6160000	6162000	Then you can do some finite size scaling
6162000	6164000	This is the finite size scaling
6164000	6166000	I don't know
6166000	6168000	Is this ok
6168000	6170000	Is this ok
6170000	6172000	Is this ok
6172000	6174000	Ok, thank you
6174000	6176000	Ok, today we probably
6176000	6178000	No special questions
6188000	6190000	Hello
6190000	6192000	Hello
6192000	6194000	I'm Ted
6194000	6196000	I just joined
6196000	6198000	Sorry
6198000	6200000	Today's speech is probably
6200000	6202000	It's over here
6204000	6206000	OK
6206000	6208000	Thank you
6214000	6216000	Very good
6220000	6222000	Then I'm going to
6222000	6224000	I'm going to stop the recording first
6224000	6226000	OK, thank you
6226000	6228000	Thank you
