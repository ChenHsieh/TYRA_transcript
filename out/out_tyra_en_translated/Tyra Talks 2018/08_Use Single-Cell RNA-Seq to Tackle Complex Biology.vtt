00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, everyone.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
I am honored to be able to introduce Dr. Sun today.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Dr. Sun completed her bachelor's degree from 1999 to 2013

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Taiwan University.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
After completing her bachelor's degree from 2003 to 2005,

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
she completed her master's degree in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the same university in Taiwan.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
She then completed her Ph.D. degree from 2005 to 2010 at Purdue University.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Her major is Chemical Biology.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
After completing her Ph.D. degree, she went to MIT to do her postdoc.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
After four years, she went to UCSF to do her second postdoc and assistant researcher.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
This year, she started her new job as a Senior Scientific Researcher at Genentech.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Today, Dr. Sun is going to talk about

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Use Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Tackle Complex Biology.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Now, let's welcome Dr. Sun to give her presentation.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Sun.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
Sorry, my voice is a bit hoarse due to my cold.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Today, I am going to talk in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Just in case, some of you may not have a background in biology.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
I hope you can at least learn about Single-Cell RNA-Seq.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Here is my personal email and LinkedIn account.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Although my LinkedIn account is not up to date,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
please feel free to connect with me.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
I will be speaking in Chinese today,

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
but I am not sure what the term is in Chinese.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't want to make it too complicated.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I will be focusing on technology.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I am currently working at a company,

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
so I can't really talk about research projects here.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
I will try my best to talk about the applications of this technology,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
and the principles behind it.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I hope this will be helpful to those who are interested.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Before we get into the technology,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I will briefly review the biology of NTU.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
As you may already know, our body is made up of cells.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Many cells form organs,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
and eventually form organs in our body,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
becoming a functional human body.

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
An interesting fact is that our body is composed of over 20 different types of cells.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
You can see that their forms and functions are very different.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
For example, there are nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells,

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
and even different types of cells in different organs.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Their functions and forms are very different.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's take a deeper look.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
As you can see, our body is made up of cells.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Each cell has a nucleus,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
which is a red dot.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
In English, it's called a nucleus.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
In Chinese, it's called a cell nucleus.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
In this cell nucleus, there is a chromosome.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
This chromosome is made up of our genes.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
I think everyone has a concept of genes.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Genes are our genetic material.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Genes are our genetic material.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
They are our genetic material.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Genes are our genetic material.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Genes are our genetic material.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
In this definition, genes are a DNA segment.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
They can be converted into a useful molecule.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
They can perform the functions and functions that they need.

05:09.000 --> 05:22.000
The reason for the general description of gene code is that DNA is a so-called ATCG.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
DNA is a so-called ATCG.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
So, if we talk about genes,

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
the sequence obtained may be composed of these four ATCGs.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
This is our so-called gene code.

05:42.000 --> 05:51.000
In molecular biology, there is a so-called central dogma.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
The principle is that we have this genetic material.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Its main structure is DNA.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
It will be transcribed into RNA.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
RNA will be further transcribed into protein.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
This protein can perform various biological functions.

06:13.000 --> 06:22.000
As time goes by, the central dogma is gradually extended to more different forms.

06:22.000 --> 06:32.000
We can even find more different directions from the virus or other systems.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Today's technology involves a discovery.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
In the past, we thought that DNA was transcribed into RNA.

06:42.000 --> 06:51.000
But later, scientists found another enzyme that can reverse transcribe RNA back to DNA.

06:52.000 --> 07:03.000
With the help of this enzyme, many related extension technologies can be built on this basis.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
Today, we will mainly talk about RNA-seq.

07:09.000 --> 07:19.000
Another way to talk about it is transcriptional analysis or gene expression profiling.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
Basically, we can use gene expression to understand human physiology.

07:26.000 --> 07:37.000
This picture shows a major timeline and milestone in molecular biology and sequencing technology.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
As many of you know, the first discovery was in 1953.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
In 1977, Sanger's DNA sequencing was developed.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Later, PCR technology was also developed.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
PCR technology allows us to rapidly increase our DNA in the laboratory.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
Many related technologies can be built on this basis.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
In 1990, the Human Genome Project was launched.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
After 13 years, the Human Genome Project was established.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
At this stage, sequencing costs are still very high.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
It is difficult to operate a sequencing project in a lab.

08:33.000 --> 08:49.000
In 2005, the next-generation sequencing technology was introduced.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
This technology has greatly reduced the cost of sequencing.

08:55.000 --> 09:07.000
The next-generation sequencing technology is still widely used.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
In recent years, the third-generation sequencing technology was introduced.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
When was single-cell RNA-seq developed?

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
The first report on single-cell RNA-seq was made in 2009.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
Because of the gradual maturation of the technology,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
especially the rapid reduction of sequencing costs,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
single-cell RNA-seq can be operated more widely.

09:43.000 --> 09:52.000
Now, many extended protocols, technologies, and companies continue to develop rapidly in this field.

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
Why do we need to do single-cell RNA-seq?

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
Before single-cell RNA-seq, we can look at gene profiling.

10:09.000 --> 10:21.000
For example, what is the difference between a cancer cell and a normal cell?

10:21.000 --> 10:29.000
For example, we have a healthy sample and a diseased sample.

10:29.000 --> 10:45.000
After sequencing, we can compare the gene profiling of these two cells.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Then we can find out the disease gene.

10:48.000 --> 10:57.000
Or we can find out which signaling pathway is further activated or inhibited.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
But there is a problem.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
For example, a tumor may contain a variety of different cells.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
There may be immune cells, tumor cells, fibroblasts, and so on.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
If the tumor is broken down and the RNA-seq is obtained,

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
the result is a variety of different cells.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
From this heat map,

11:31.000 --> 11:41.000
we can still see that some genes are inhibited or activated in the diseased sample.

11:41.000 --> 11:56.000
It is difficult to determine if the disease is caused by immune cells, fibroblasts, or unknown gene cells.

11:56.000 --> 12:05.000
At this time, if we can do transcriptome profiling at single-cell resolution,

12:05.000 --> 12:17.000
we can have a deeper understanding of each cell in a tumor tissue.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
Here are some interesting graphs that I saw on the Internet.

12:24.000 --> 12:32.000
It can give you an idea of why the so-called Bok analysis may cause some misjudgment.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
For example, in this graph,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
each point here has the so-called x-value and y-value.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Then you can do various calculations.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
For example, the x-value is like this,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
the y-value is like this,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
the x-deviation is like this,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
and the y-deviation is like this.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
But even if you calculate all these values,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
what about the relationship between x and y?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
So if you just do a Bok analysis,

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
you may not be able to express the so-called structure behind it.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Another interesting graph is that

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
sometimes if you do a Bok analysis,

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
you may get a conclusion that leads you to a wrong direction.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
For example, suppose this is your sample.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
So your sample contains a lot of different animals.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Then you do a Bok analysis to see what this creature might look like.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
Then you may come to a conclusion that this is what this creature should look like.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Then you will find that it is very different from the so-called real state.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
The so-called single-celled analysis basically has different methods.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
That is to say, under this technology,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
you can analyze each animal separately

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
and find a lot of different features.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Then based on the features you find,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
you start to do the so-called clustering.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
For example, this graph shows that

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
you have already found two features.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
One is Firm and the other is Venom.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Then even if you just add two features like this,

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
you can already cluster a lot of animals into at least two subsets.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
One big subset will be the snakes,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
which has the Venom but doesn't have Firm.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Then the other big subset may be the so-called

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
it doesn't have Venom, but it has Firm.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
When you can add more and more features,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
hopefully, finally, you will be able to

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
one individual item will be clustered into one group.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
So this is the whole idea about why you need to do profiling at a single-cell level.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Then generally in this single-cell field,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
one of their favorite metaphors is

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
the so-called fruit smoothie and the so-called fruit salad.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
When you make a Borg RNC asset,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
it's very similar to the so-called fruit smoothie.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Basically, you put all kinds of fruit and vegetables together.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
The taste you drink is basically

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
an average taste of all ingredients.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
So you may not be able to know

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
what ingredients are in this.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Then maybe the ingredients you taste

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
are some special strong ingredients.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
Maybe it's an apple, maybe it's a strawberry.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
But you can't know that

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
maybe there's some cabbage in it or something else.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Single-cell is like you're eating a fruit salad.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
Basically, you can taste each individual piece of the fruit.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
So somehow you'll know

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
what kind of composition the fruit should be made of.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
So this so-called fruit smoothie to the fruit salad,

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
basically what single-cell RNC wants to achieve

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
is that you can show the individual cell type

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
that causes the biological response or disease.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
Then this summary is a more scientific statement.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
So basically, the so-called Borg RNC

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
measures the so-called average expression level

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
for each cell across a population of cells.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Basically, like I just said,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
if you're doing a cancer study,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
you have two samples.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
One is from healthy tissue,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
the other is from diseased tissue.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Then you grind it up and compare the two samples.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Its limitation is basically that

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
if you want to study a more complex system today,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
for example, you want to study people's brains

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
or some more complex organs,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
then this technology

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm afraid I can't give you a very clear result.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Basically, what single-cell does,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
it measures the distribution of expression level

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
for each gene across a population of the cells.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So using this technology,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
every cell has a specific change

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
that can be shown.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Basically, now there are already a lot of

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
so-called commercially available single-cell platforms on the market.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Of course, they all have their own advantages and disadvantages.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
From my personal experience,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I have two platforms of experience.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
One is the so-called Fluidigm C1.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
The other is called 10x Genomics.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Now I'm going to quickly introduce

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
the two single-cell platforms I've used before.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Basically, in general,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
the so-called workflow of the single cell,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
its concept is basically the same.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
First of all, you have the so-called tissue of interest,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
either patient tissue or cells,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
which are some of the cells that you are interested in.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Then, before doing single-cell RIC,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
the most important step is that you have to

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
prepare in your own way

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
the so-called single-cell suspension.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Each person may have different approaches.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
For example,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
the so-called FACS to do the single-cell selection,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
or to do some so-called micro-dissection,

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
to sort out the cells one by one.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Then, when you can successfully complete

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
your single-cell suspension,

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
you basically inject it

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
into either single-cell platform.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Then, in the single-cell platform,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
what it does is basically

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
to lyse the cell

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and extract the RNA in it.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Then, this RNA is

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
reverse transcribed

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
into the cDNA.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Then, this cDNA can be amplified

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
through PCR.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
After the amplification,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
we build a library.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Then, these libraries can be sent for sequencing.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Like I said,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
this is the so-called sequencing result.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
You get the so-called sequence.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
This sequence is basically

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
the sequence of A, T, C, and G.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Then, you may be mapping.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Because now many genes have been decoded,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
including human, mouse,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
and some species.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
So, according to the source of your sample,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
you can map it to the reference genome.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Then, you can know

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
what the expression of each gene is.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Then, the last step is

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
the so-called computational analysis.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Because this single-cell RNAC technology

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
is relatively new,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
the computational analysis

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
is still under development.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
This is basically the same concept.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
You have a tissue that you are interested in.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
First, you have to be able to

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
dissociate it into the so-called single-cell suspend.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Then, there are all kinds of different systems

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
that can make the single-cell suspension

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
that you need.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Then, you can further

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
dissociate it into the single-cell platform.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
This picture is from a recent review paper.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
So, what you can see here is that

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
the single-cell RNAC technology

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
has developed very rapidly in recent years.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
It started with the first single-cell paper

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
around 2009.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
At that time, the single-cell technology

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
was still a very difficult technology.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It was not possible to operate smoothly

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
at every level.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
Then, the number of times you do it

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
may be accumulated from dozens of times.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
However, as time goes by,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
there are more and more different types of

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
different technologies,

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
including the droplet method.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
There are also some

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
random capture technologies,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
such as in-tube barcoding,

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
and so on.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
Now, you can see that

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
basically,

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
the single-cell technology

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
can already get a lot of cells

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
in one experiment.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
Of course, there are many technologies

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
that continue to develop

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
to get more and more cells.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Now, I would like to introduce

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
two single-cell platforms

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
that I have had hands-on experience with.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
The first one is FluDyn.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
FluDyn is probably the first single-cell

22:40.000 --> 22:46.000
RNA-seq technology in the market.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
Its basic process is very similar to what I just said.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
First, you need to be able to successfully

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
dissociate your tissue.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Basically, this technology

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
captures cells to 96 well plate.

23:01.000 --> 23:07.000
Basically, all the so-called cell lysing,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
RT, and cDNA amplification

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
happen in this machine.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Its output is basically

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
the cDNA after the amplification.

23:21.000 --> 23:27.000
Then you can make a barcode library

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
and send for sequencing.

23:31.000 --> 23:39.000
This is the real situation of the C1 chip.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
This is an image under the microscope.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
You can see that

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
this cell basically has a fluorescent label.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
So you can see that

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
after running this chip,

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
this cell is basically captured in this chip.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Then all the reactions

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
will happen in this reaction.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Finally, when this reaction is completed,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
you get the cDNA after the amplification.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Then you can further build your library

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
and send for sequencing.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
Then you will get your data.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
According to my personal experience,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
the C1 chip has some advantages

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
but also some disadvantages.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Its advantages are...

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
Oh, I may have made a mistake here.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
The first one is relatively long prep time.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
This should be its disadvantage.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Its prep time is actually very long.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Of course, if you let your sample

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
sit on the ice all the time,

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
you may worry that

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
its gene expression profile

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
may change during that time.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
So basically, we hope that

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
before we get the so-called

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
light cell,

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
the prep time can be as short as possible.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
But this C1 chip

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
still has some very good advantages.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
For example, this set of technologies

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
allows you to capture single cells

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
under the microscope

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
one by one.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
For example, this picture shows

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
a very beautiful single cell.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Some wells may not have single cells at all.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Some wells may have multiple samples.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Maybe later on,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
when you are building your library,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
you may ignore such samples.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Because in the subsequent data analysis,

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
you may not be able to judge

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
whether the data you get is from one cell

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
or multiple cells.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Basically, its biggest disadvantage

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
is the so-called throughput.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Because basically,

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
in the most primitive C1 chip,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
it can only capture 96 cells at a time.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
In the later version,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
it may be able to capture 800 at a time.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
But in fact, in reality,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
its efficiency is very poor.

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
Maybe only 60% to 70% of the wells

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
can capture single cells.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
So in fact,

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
the number of cells you can get every time is extremely small.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
So this is the biggest problem with C1.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
And later on,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
a lot of research found that

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
even some data that had already been published,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
they found that

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
some of the results they got

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
were quite related to batch.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
So this technology basically,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
in the current single cell field,

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
a lot of people have turned to other better

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
better technology choices.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
At present,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
the vast majority of single cell RNA-seq platforms,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
you will probably see,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
is from this company.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
This company is called 10X Genomics.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Its core technology

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
is basically called Gems.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
Gen Bits in Emulsion.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So its idea is basically

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
that it has a lot of these bits.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
And then these bits are basically

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I'm thinking the simplest way to do this is

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm going to show you a YouTube video.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
You should be able to quickly understand

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
how this technology works.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
Okay.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Oh, Dr. Sun,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I'd like to ask if there's any sound in this video?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Eh...

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
It's music, so you can't hear the sound, right?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Okay.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
But it's okay.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
It's not talking.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
It's not talking.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Okay.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah, so...

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
It's just background music.

28:42.000 --> 29:03.000
It's just background music.

29:03.000 --> 29:31.000
It's just background music.

29:31.000 --> 30:00.000
It's just background music.

30:00.000 --> 30:08.000
I think it's easier to use the video.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Wait a minute.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
Sorry, I'll turn this off.

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
So basically, you can see that this is the set of techniques.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
It's probably like this.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
If you compare these two sets of techniques,

30:30.000 --> 30:37.000
Of course, the biggest advantage of 10X Genomics is that its throughput is very high.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
We can capture more than 10,000 cells in each round.

30:43.000 --> 30:51.000
If you compare it to 96 or 800 cells, 10X is much better than C1.

30:51.000 --> 31:06.000
In addition, the advantage of the UMI set of techniques is that it involves some PCR processes.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
This process may also cause some experimental biases.

31:10.000 --> 31:18.000
The UMI set of techniques can basically help correct these biases.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
In addition, the process of generating Gems is extremely fast.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
It only takes 7 minutes to generate all the Gems.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
So basically, you can make sure that your cells are in a relatively intact state.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Of course, there are some disadvantages.

31:40.000 --> 31:49.000
For example, 10X Genomics does not sequence all the transcripts.

31:49.000 --> 32:01.000
It only does a small part of 3'N.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
So if your research is looking at variants of Gems,

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
You basically can't use 10X Genomics.

32:11.000 --> 32:21.000
On the other hand, many data analysis tools are designed for 10X Genomics.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
So if you use this set of systems,

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
You may get more help in subsequent analysis.

32:32.000 --> 32:44.000
Next, let's talk about some real-world operations.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
In the real world,

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
Before injecting into the 10X system,

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
We have our tissue of interest.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Then we may have different sample prep strategies.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
To control our single-cell suspension.

33:05.000 --> 33:10.000
Before injecting into the 10X chip,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
We basically need to do a cell quality control.

33:13.000 --> 33:19.000
We need to look at several parameters.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
For example, its viability.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
And basically, this cell looks like a single cell.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
And then there's the cell size.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
Let you know that your protocol is basically able to target the cells you're interested in.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
So the take-home message here will be that

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
The sample prep protocol optimization is very important.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
For you to get high-quality single-cell data in the future.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
In the first step, it basically determines most of it.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
After your cell QC pass,

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
You make sure that your single-cell suspension is a very good prep.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
Then you can basically inject into the 10X system.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
Then all these steps are basically like a kit.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
And then you can just run it through.

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
And now Genome has developed its own computational tool.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
I can do the initial data processing.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
And then you get a so-called gene barcode matrix.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
And then you can use this matrix to do the follow-up analysis.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
For the whole workflow of single-cell data analysis,

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
It's basically divided into two stages.

34:47.000 --> 34:53.000
The first stage, the yellow one, is basically the so-called sequencing QC.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
That is to say, you have to see if your sequencing data is good or bad.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
In this part, it's basically quite mature.

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
Because I mentioned before that this technique has been used for many years.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
That set of techniques is basically the so-called sequencing QC.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
It can almost move the whole set to the single-cell RNAC part.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
So at this stage of sequencing QC,

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
It's basically looking at the so-called read QC, alignment QC, and mapping QC.

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
And now Genome has a set of its own software that can help you finish this thing.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Finally, you can get a gene barcode matrix.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
And then when you get the gene barcode matrix,

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
The red part here is basically the so-called further data processing.

35:43.000 --> 35:48.000
I'm going to take a little bit of time to talk about it.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
The so-called further data processing here.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
In the first step, I call it matrix LQC.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
What it means is that basically the most important point of this step is to say

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
You have to get rid of some of the so-called low-quality cells first.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
Because if you keep these low-quality cells in your dataset,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
A big problem, it might cause a lot of noise.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
And then it might make your subsequent data analysis very difficult.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
So basically, after you remove some of the bad cells,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
You can take your data to further normalization.

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
After normalization, you may need to face another problem.

36:32.000 --> 36:39.000
After all, single cell technology is based on single cell.

36:39.000 --> 36:46.000
So it will have a lot of unwanted variation.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
For example, it may be a batch effect.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
Then all the cells may be in different cell cycle status.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
These may be information that you are not interested in.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Then you may need to use some computational methods to either regress it out.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Or maybe give it a score.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
This may be a more detailed data analysis.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.000
Then, in short, when you clean up these data through this step,

37:12.000 --> 37:17.000
Then your dataset can do a lot of downstream data analysis.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
It includes clustering, cell type identification,

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
And then you can do the so-called differential gene expression analysis.

37:28.000 --> 37:35.000
That is to say, you can compare the gene profiling between cell type A and cell type B.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
Which one is the same? Which one is different?

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Or maybe you have a very interested cell population.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Then you can see what are the cell service markers.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Or you can compare two situations.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
Then see which single-only pathway is being activated or inhibited.

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
These things are very useful information for both basic biology and disease research.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
Then you can also do some network analysis.

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
Then some people will even take this single cell to do some so-called pseudo-time analysis.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
The so-called pseudo-time is that we

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Because in a lot of research, such as developmental biology,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
It may look at a bit like a time course.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
That is, how does this cell change from one state to another state with the eyes of time?

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
In the past, you may have to take samples at different times.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Then do the analysis.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
The concept of single cell may be that you may not need to take so many time points.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
You may take one or two time points.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
Because every cell will give you some information.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
Not all cells are in the same state at the same time.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
So you can basically go through every cell.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
It may be at a certain stage in the process of transformation.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Then it may be in this set of data.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
It will give you a so-called pseudo-time.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Such information.

39:09.000 --> 39:17.000
So this is also a very powerful place for single cell.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
Let's talk about the so-called metric cell quality control.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
What is it like in a real state?

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
How do you filter out the so-called unhealthy cells or cells you don't want?

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Of course, everyone may have their own criteria.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Here are some of the most general ways.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
This set of data sets is basically published.

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
It uses the so-called human blood cells to make a demo data.

39:52.000 --> 40:02.000
This scatter plot is the percentage of the mitochondrion versus the UMI number.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
This UMI number can be regarded as how many molecules have been detected.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
So-called how many transcripts have been detected.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
Then every point here basically represents a cell.

40:16.000 --> 40:22.000
You can see that the majority of the cells are in this position.

40:22.000 --> 40:29.000
In terms of biology, you will know that the vast majority of the cells are in this position.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
So these cells have a very high UMI number.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
It means that there are a lot of transcripts being detected.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
So it is possible that these signals are not coming from one single cell.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
These may be cell aggregation or multiplex.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
These may be the cells you want to get rid of.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
Because basically this signal is not coming from one single cell.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
Then some other cells you may want to get rid of are the so-called cells.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
So you can see that there are very few UMI that can be detected.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
But it has a very high percentage of mitochondrion.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
Usually when a cell is in an extremely unhealthy state, its mitochondrion will be very high.

41:16.000 --> 41:28.000
So this is also a general criterion that many people will set to filter out some cells that they think are not worth doing downstream analysis.

41:28.000 --> 41:35.000
The last cell that may be used for downstream analysis is this one.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
So what does this analysis look like?

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
This is basically a result of unbiased clustering.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
So you can see that the sample here is from a human pbmc cell.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
Here, each point represents a cell.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
This type of clustering is called t-SNE clustering.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Basically, it is a clustering algorithm.

42:05.000 --> 42:17.000
Basically, what you can understand is that the closer the cells are, the more similar their properties are.

42:18.000 --> 42:29.000
Basically, they look at, for example, which genes are expressed in this clustering cell, and which genes are expressed in this clustering cell.

42:29.000 --> 42:35.000
Then they can identify what kind of cells these may be.

42:35.000 --> 42:47.000
So in a single-cell RNAC experiment, you can quickly identify all kinds of different immune cells.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
For example, this clustering is basically a B-cell.

42:51.000 --> 43:01.000
The gene expression plotting here further confirms that when you see here, it becomes more purplish, which means that this particular gene is expressed in large quantities.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
This gene is basically a B-cell mutagen.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
So it further confirms that these cells do have B-cell properties.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
For example, this CD3E is basically a T-cell marker.

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
It is also expressed in large quantities in this T-cell population.

43:18.000 --> 43:38.000
Once you get a result like this, you can further study and compare which cells are the same and which cells are different.

43:38.000 --> 43:45.000
Or you can compare two B-cells in a different sample.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
Then you can compare the gene profiling of the two B-cells to see what is different.

43:49.000 --> 44:00.000
In this way, the result you get will be a signal that only B-cells give you, rather than a result where all cells are averaged.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
This is roughly the concept of a single-cell.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
Due to time constraints, I will skip the last part.

44:08.000 --> 44:17.000
This is just an example of what a single-cell can do.

44:17.000 --> 44:25.000
To summarize, there are some things you may need to consider before conducting a single-cell experiment.

44:26.000 --> 44:37.000
In my current job, I have to support many single-cell projects on campus.

44:37.000 --> 44:51.000
Based on my experience with many different projects, I can see that data analysis is still the biggest bottleneck in this technology.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
In terms of generating the data, it is not that difficult.

44:56.000 --> 45:05.000
However, every time you generate a library of data, it may be over 1,000 cells.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
To be honest, it is not that easy to analyze the data.

45:11.000 --> 45:28.000
Even though we have a single-cell working group in our company, we still have to figure out what is the best normalization method and what is the best batch correction method.

45:28.000 --> 45:40.000
In terms of differential gene expression analysis, which method is the best for single-cell analysis?

45:41.000 --> 46:01.000
Basically, if you know exactly what you want to ask, your single-cell data will be more meaningful.

46:01.000 --> 46:21.000
However, if you are not sure what you want to see, your data will be lost.

46:21.000 --> 46:40.000
In my experience, it is very important to optimize the sample prep protocol before going into the single-cell platform.

46:40.000 --> 46:52.000
If you don't optimize your sample prep properly, you may not get the cells you need.

46:52.000 --> 47:02.000
Finally, I want to touch on the single-cell genomics.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
The single-cell genomics development is very fast.

47:07.000 --> 47:12.000
There are many new technologies for different biological problems.

47:13.000 --> 47:23.000
For example, the single-cell RAC we just talked about is a single-cell suspension.

47:24.000 --> 47:32.000
However, in some research, you may not be able to get the so-called living tissue.

47:32.000 --> 47:42.000
For example, if you want to study the brain, you may only get the tissue after a person's death.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
Or you may only get the frozen tissue.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
Basically, you can't get the tissue from a living cell.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Therefore, there is a so-called single-cell RAC.

47:54.000 --> 48:10.000
The single-cell RAC takes the tissue from a dead cell and extracts the RNA from it.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
There are also other versions.

48:13.000 --> 48:25.000
For example, if you are interested in the recombination of T-cells and B-cells, there is also a single-cell RAC like this.

48:25.000 --> 48:36.000
If you are studying cancer T-cell therapy, it will be very useful.

48:37.000 --> 48:51.000
If you are studying the chromatin regulation, there is also a single-cell attack C protocol.

48:51.000 --> 49:00.000
You can see which part of the chromatin is open and which part is closed.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
There is also a new technology called CyC.

49:04.000 --> 49:11.000
CyC adds a DNA barcoding to the antibody.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
CyC turns it into another RNA molecule.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
CyC turns it into a pseudogene.

49:20.000 --> 49:29.000
When you run the single-cell platform, CyC becomes an additional signal.

49:29.000 --> 49:44.000
In addition to obtaining the RNA expression profile, you can also detect the cell service protein signal.

49:44.000 --> 49:52.000
This technology can also help you with cell type identification.

49:53.000 --> 50:07.000
Overall, CyC is still developing rapidly in the field of sample processing and data analysis.

50:08.000 --> 50:14.000
This is a brief introduction to CyC.

50:14.000 --> 50:24.000
If you are interested in CyC, you can learn more about it.

50:24.000 --> 50:39.000
Thank you Dr. Sun for giving us a presentation today.

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
We will now open the Q&A section.

50:47.000 --> 50:55.000
I hope everyone can actively discuss or ask questions about what Dr. Sun just said.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Thank you.

50:56.000 --> 51:03.000
I just saw a person in the chat asking,

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
Do you mind sharing your presentation slides?

51:33.000 --> 51:41.000
Let's see if Dr. Sun can send the slides to you.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Okay.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Another person asked,

51:48.000 --> 51:56.000
Hi Dr. Sun, for in vivo study, would you suggest to do the qPCR on intracellular organ first,

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
then based on the qPCR result to design the experimental for RNA-Seq?

52:03.000 --> 52:17.000
Do you have any suggestions for the qPCR and RNA-Seq?

52:17.000 --> 52:25.000
For qPCR,

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
if there is a new project coming in,

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
we will not go for single cell RNA-Seq.

52:37.000 --> 52:46.000
We will first look at the existing technology,

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
such as qPCR or Bulk RNA-Seq.

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
or knockout or wild-type mice,

53:01.000 --> 53:11.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
If your qPCR can already answer your question,

53:16.000 --> 53:24.000
we usually prefer to ask them to use a relatively cheap and simple technology to confirm.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

53:29.000 --> 53:37.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

53:37.000 --> 53:42.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

53:42.000 --> 53:49.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

53:54.000 --> 54:02.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

54:14.000 --> 54:19.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

54:19.000 --> 54:27.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

54:32.000 --> 54:39.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

54:44.000 --> 54:51.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.000
If you want to compare healthy and diseased,

54:56.000 --> 55:04.000
you may want to look at whether there is a difference in a specific single-cell RNA-Seq.

55:05.000 --> 55:11.000
What software do you use to do batch correction for single-cell RNA-Seq?

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
Are you asking about rPackage?

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
Hello?

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
Oh, rPackage.

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
I can answer that.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
Are you doing single-cell RNA-Seq analysis?

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
Yes.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
I believe Serat is doing single-cell RNA-Seq analysis.

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
Have you heard of Serat?

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
If you are interested,

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
this is one of the most popular software out there

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
and it is being developed for single-cell RNA-Seq.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
It is being developed for single-cell RNA-Seq.

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
It is being developed for single-cell RNA-Seq.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
In terms of the CCA,

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

56:58.000 --> 57:03.000
In terms of the CCA,

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
In terms of the CCA,

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
In terms of the CCA,

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
In terms of the CCA,

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
it assumes that your dataset is co-variant.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
My personal favorite batch collection algorithm is MNN.

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
My personal favorite batch collection algorithm is MNN.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
It is another package called SCRAN.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
It is another package called SCRAN.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
It is another package called SCRAN.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

58:08.000 --> 58:13.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

59:23.000 --> 59:28.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

59:38.000 --> 59:43.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
It is another patch called SCRAN.

59:48.000 --> 59:53.000
it is another patch called SCRAN.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
it is another path called SCRAN.
