{"text": " Okay, let's get started. Oh, I hear the recording has started. Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today is Phylogenetic Components with Meta-Optics. Because my main research background is the interaction between light and matter, and then, through this interaction, we can further manipulate light's behavior. So the main application we want to do is how to reduce the size of the current phylogenetic components on the market. For example, transparency or bias. So, what is meta? I'll talk about it later. The word meta-optics is actually the Greek word for meta. I'll talk about it later. Before we get into the topic, I want to share a picture. I don't know if you've seen this picture. This is from the ancient Roman era. The picture on the left is from the ancient Roman era. This is a wine cup. What's amazing about this is you can see that the colors are different. But they are actually the same cup. The color is different because they found that when they put the light source outside, the color of the cup is green. But if they put the light source inside the cup, the cup will turn red. That is to say, the material on the cup is very special. If you look at the cup from the perspective of reflection, it is green. But if you put the light source inside, the color you see is transparent. So after you put the light source inside the cup, the color you see is red. At this time, people think this is amazing. They also use this kind of material to make church colored glass. We all know that churches in Europe have very beautiful colored glass. Why are there so many different colors? The reason is the same as the cup. The principle of its operation is very similar. Why does this phenomenon occur? Later, people found that there is a thing called localized surface plasma. What does this mean? Why doesn't it move? They found that if we have a colored light source, it will interact with a metal nanoparticle. After interacting with it, it will accumulate some free electrons on the surface of the nanoparticle under the appropriate conditions. These free electrons will allow it to produce a similar dipole inside, an H-ray dipole or a magnetic dipole. Let it further produce, let it radiate electrons from other dipoles. Then we will see different colors. When will this phenomenon occur? It mainly occurs when our nanoparticles are smaller than the dipole of the colored light. This thing will only occur. So the high-angle cup, the colored high-angle cup, later they did a further study and found that the high-angle cup actually contained a lot of gold particles of different size. This is gold particle. The size of these metal particles compared with the dipole of the visible light, the visible light dipole is about 400 to 700 nanometers. Compared with it, it is smaller than the size of the dipole. So they thought that the reason for the different color may come from this local surface plasmon resonance. The result of localized surface plasmon resonance. After this resonance, what special phenomenon will we have? It actually has a lot of advantages that we can control, that is, we can have. For example, they found that this resonance has a bias with the dipole of the colored light. The bias is the direction in which the electron waves resonate. You can see that this picture may be more obvious. For example, the color here is very colorful, very beautiful, there are five or six colors. Here you can't see any color at all. These two pictures are actually the same sample color. Their only difference is that they changed the direction of the dipole of the colored light. This red and white arrow is the direction of its dipole resonance. When the direction of the dipole of the colored light is along the y-axis, they will see that the chip above will produce different colors. In fact, you can imagine that the chip uses some micro-imaging technology to make some metal disks that are smaller than visible wavelengths. Like this disk. Then they change its diameter or cycle. We can see different colors in the reflected light part. But when they turn a bias, the colors are all gone. So you can use it to do something. For example, this thing can be used to make color filters that have a bias control feature. Another special thing is that we used to know that for example, why are we so interested in this thing now? For example, we know that gold is often used to make decorations. For example, rings and necklaces. But gold, as long as we use gold to make a decoration, whether I pinch it into a square, a circle, or a ring, its color is yellow. But like I just said, if we put this gold, all the particles here are gold, but they are at a very small scale. If its scale is smaller than the wavelength, we can find that as its size changes, the colors we see are different. This is very different from the optical phenomenon that we see on the object. The main reason for this is because of the localized surface plasma. The next feature is that if the two metals are very close together, there is a very small nano gap between the two metal particles, there will be a very strong near-field coupling. The two of them will interweave each other. This interweaving will make them a bit like the simple electronics we learned before. It's like the feeling of end-to-end power generation. Because its scale is very small, the more end-to-end power it can accumulate, the stronger the near-field power generation it produces. If it is very close, the interweaving between the two will cause it to have a stronger field enhancement. Finally, this resonance has a lot to do with the surrounding environment. It is very sensitive to the environment. That is to say, if the surrounding environment's resolution changes, its resonance wavelength, which is the color we saw in the original factory, will change. For example, this stick now, if it is in the air, I see blue. But if I put it in the water and look at it again, it may turn red. This feature is also used by some people to say that we can do some sound sensing. It is based on the change in color to judge what is the object in the surrounding environment. OK. After introducing the Localized Surface Plasma, I will tell you what is Metamaterial. As I said, the word Meta comes from Greek. It means the same in English. Metamaterial is a kind of material. It has some features. These features are not found in natural materials. We call it Metamaterial. Simply put, we can use the shape of it or the distance between the particles to change its optical properties. These are called Metamaterial. Why do we have these features? It should be said that we need to produce Metamaterial properties. What is the strict condition? As I said, we generally know that natural materials are composed of atoms. For example, CO2, H2O. Because we know that the distance between them is very small. If I take the surface plasma as 500 nm, which is about the surface plasma of green light, as an example, these two have a very, very big difference in their magnitude. So its optical properties are mainly determined by this molecule or atom. For example, gold is AU. No matter how I rub it, it is yellow. Metamaterial is what I just said. If we now put the distance or size between the particles to be reduced to the original size, which is the level of the magnetic field, which is about Lambda over 4 to Lambda over 10, at this magnitude, we can use man-made methods to change the optical properties of the material itself. Then we can further manipulate some of the behavior of light or electromagnetic waves. This can be produced by the resonance at the magnitude of the magnetic field. By using this method to manipulate light, we call it metamaterial. It is mainly triangular. Although my structure is very small, its thickness in the z-direction can be very thick. My very thick is only compared with the surface plasma of green light. For example, it can be one or two microns. Let me ask you a question. 10 to 100 microns? No, 1 to 10 microns is fine. It can be several microns. So 10 nanometers to 100 micrometers is fine. The magnitude I'm talking about here is a bit broad. Mainly because the example I gave earlier is visible light. But the advantage of this thing is that my work plasma may not necessarily be visible light. I can even be a microwave wave. So 10 micrometers is Terahertz? 100 microns. If it is 100 microns, it should be 3 Terahertz. If I'm not mistaken. It's about the range of Terahertz. It's far away. So its work plasma can be very broad. Here is a very special example. The metamaterial I just mentioned. When I first saw this phenomenon, there was no such word as metamaterial. It's called left-hand material. Why is it called left-hand material? Because they found that the structure of man-made can control the behavior of light. We know that the characteristic of light transmission mainly comes from the refractive index of the ring. So they thought, is it because of the refractive index? Metamaterial is used to manipulate the refractive index of the ring. That's why it affects the behavior of light. Here is a schematic diagram. We used to study chemistry in high school. If a cup is an empty cup, the air refractive index is 1. If I put a chopstick here, it will be straight. If I put a refractive index of 1.3 in it, it's probably water. We know that because of the refractive index, it looks like the chopstick is broken. But if we put a negative refractive index in it, the chopstick we see at this time will look like this. This is actually just an experiment. This is not the result of the experiment. Another interesting thing is that if we have this negative refractive index, we usually know that the beam of light will be full. In other words, the beam of light is orange here. If it is a beam of light, it is along N1sin\u03b81 and N2sin\u03b82. So it keeps refracting. But if the material in the middle is a negative refractive material, the beam of light and the beam of refractive light will be located on both sides of the beam. This makes them very interested. That is to say, is it true that because of these characteristics, we can create some real boundaries that naturally cannot exist, and then achieve some light and snow characteristics that we can't imagine at all? This kind of negative refractive index, I am trying to prove it here. But in fact, there is already an experiment to prove that this thing is really feasible. But I didn't put their experiment results here. It is to prove that by properly designing the size of this material, or the elements of the material itself, they can achieve the negative refractive index phenomenon. I think I can skip here. Next, I will talk about the Metamaterial I just mentioned. I just said it can be very thick, it can be three-dimensional. But in fact, our main purpose is to control the light. Can we further reduce the element? They want to say, if I make Metamaterial only one layer, because I just said that Metamaterial can be many layers, it means that it can be very thick. If I only have one layer, can I achieve the same effect? This one-layer Metamaterial, they call it Metasurface. A surface that is the same as a general surface. Yes, so it's called Metasurface. Here is an example. For example, I now have a metal stick. After I inject a electromagnetic wave into it, because this magnitude is much smaller than the injected light wave field, so I can directly use the concept of injecting electromagnetic waves to see the result of this resonance. So if my injected light wave field vibrates along this direction, I can theoretically accumulate positive and negative electrons at both ends of the stick. This accumulated positive and negative electron can make us equivalent to an electrode. After this electrode vibrates, another electromagnetic wave will be radiated. If we take a closer look at this structure of penetrating light waves and phase light waves, under a fixed wavelength, it is obvious that if the length of the stick changes, just like I just said, because this material, this Metasurface or Metamaterial, has a lot to do with its resonance characteristics and size. So when I make the length longer or shorter, we can see that its resonance wave will gradually be flattened. At this time, if I look at a fixed wavelength, its magnitude or phase can be changed. A point that everyone is very concerned about is the phase. Is this a simulation? Yes, this is a simulation. Both of these are simulations. If we can manipulate the phase, we can further manipulate the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, which is the characteristics of its transmission. For example, if I now have a sample substrate, and I record a flat wave, if I put some of the Metasurface nanostructure on the surface, because its size is different, the phase deviation they feel will be different. The different phase deviations will make the phase delay of the original wave different, which means that after the original interference, they can reconstruct another wave front. And this wave front is completely different from the Metasurface. Although this magnitude is less than the Metasurface wavelength, we can control the electromagnetic wave characteristics with the Metasurface nanostructure. Here are some examples of applications. This is probably to say that we can not only manipulate the electromagnetic wave government and phase, in fact, the wavelength and deviation can be manipulated by Metasurface. For example, they can do some optical image or do some deviation conversion, which I will introduce later. Here is a very simple image that is, why this thing can be so interesting and help us to design some flat optical components. I use the simplest one before is our deflection law to explain to you. For example, if we used Hagen's principle to explain the deflection of this thing, that is, if I have two materials in the space now, the deflection rate is N1 and N2 respectively. After the deflection wave comes in, every point on this interface is reflected by the deflection light, I can think of it as a two-point light source. So here is a little bit gray, gray and white dots, round dots. I just split it into a very small point in each space. This small point is reflected by the deflection light and interacts with the deflection light. I think of it as a two-point light source. The deflection wave coming out of the point light source will be a circle. This circle will eventually reconstruct another deflection wave in the original factory. Because each of them has the same surface, the phase coming out of their radiation has no delay. So their original transmission will be as flat as the deflection light, which is the tradition. How did they explain this thing with Higgins before? When I am now in the diagonal direction, you can see that the red part is the wave front. This wave front touches the time on this interface will be different. It will first touch the point on the left. So after the point on the left is touched by the light, it will be regarded as the first two-point light source to start radiation. Then this point is touched. But because it is slower to be touched, it will produce this radiation slower. In this way, to the end here. Because the time they were touched is different, we can think of it as their radiation is different. So you can see that the shape of the radiation produced by them is different from here. The radiation is getting smaller from left to right. This will cause the wave front to be oblique. Bing Jie, Zhang Yang has a question. He has a question. He said Transmittance's light source is mainly a design decision. What about Resonance's Q-factor? How high and low can it be now? This thing? How high can the Q-factor be? How is it determined? Q-factor has a lot of things. It will be affected by a lot of things. First of all, the most intuitive is its loss. Because the material I designed here is made of metal. The metal in the visible light, or the part outside the mirror, after it has been resonance, because of the dipole, we can think of it as a movement of free current. This part will cause The second thing that will affect it is the loss of the original radiation. In theory, we divide it into two categories. One is Intrinsic. One is Extrinsic. Intrinsic is the heat radiation that the material itself produces. The other is the loss of the original radiation caused by the original radiation. I classify both of them as the part of the loss. This part will reduce my Q-factor. The other part is whether my cavity is strong enough. Because my current structure is based on the loss of the original radiation. So even if there is a shock on it, I can think of it as a movement of free current. But this movement of free current cannot be perfect because this cavity is not very strong. If I want a very strong cavity, in theory, we should have almost 100% reflectivity on both sides. At this time, my Q-factor can be very high. But because of my current structure, I just wait for it to accumulate and let it accumulate radiation on both sides. But this cavity is not that strong. So my Q-factor will be reduced. These factors result in the Plasmon Resonance produced by this kind of metal. Its Q-factor will not be too high. As far as I know, if it is made of metal, without considering any cavity, that is, without considering any mirror, that is, the perfect mirror in this system, its Q-factor can only reach a few hundred. This is already the highest. But usually it is only a few tens. He said he understood. OK, thank you. Then, if I have the nanoparticle I just talked about, I am now in the same direction. But because of my nanoparticle, each nanoparticle has a different size. The size is different, just like what I just showed in this picture. Under the same wavelength, the phase delay felt by each different size will be different. At this time, it works as if each particle, although they both feel the electromagnetic wave, but after their resonance, the radiation phase will also be delayed. This is very interesting. It allows us to achieve transparency. In theory, I am transparent. But if I design the structure appropriately above, I can see that it is written out. I can use Momentum's picture to explain it. I don't think it needs to be explained. Basically, it is the phase delay. Here is a simple experiment result. If I design a stick of different lengths on the surface, you can see that Can you go back to the page and explain Momentum? I don't quite understand. Momentum, in theory, we know that its K is 2\u03c0\u9664\u03bb. If I have different structures here, in theory, I can equate it to each structure can provide a horizontal momentum. How does this horizontal momentum decide? This horizontal momentum is determined by 2\u03c0\u9664\u03bb. What does this \u03bb mean? This \u03bb of 2\u03c0\u9664\u03bb means that my structure has a phase delay from 0 to the minimum length of 360 degrees. That is, I can see it as a pixel of light. A pixel of light. If a pixel of light is \u03bb, we know that its K is 2\u03c0\u9664\u03bb. Because I have a phase change of T, I can equate it to the horizontal momentum of 2\u03c0\u9664\u03bb on this surface. And these two Momentum boxes can let us see through the light. These two boxes are obviously in this direction. This is why we can achieve the phenomenon of paranormal penetration. This is a simple experiment result. After designing different lengths of sticks on the surface, if my light is perpendicular to the light, I want to see if it can reflect back in the opposite direction. This is the result of the experiment. This is the result of the calculation. The curve of different colors represents different angles of light. Black is when the light is perpendicular to the light, and white is when the light is perpendicular to the light. The reflection angle is about 45 degrees. This proves that we give it a horizontal momentum in the horizontal direction. Why don't I see through the light here? Because the structure of this design has a thick metal at the bottom. This thick metal helps us block all the light. So we only see the reflected light. Why do we only see the reflected light here? You can also see that when the light is perpendicular to the light, if you look at the scattering, you can see that the light is perpendicular to the light. Let me ask you a question. What wavelength is the light reflected? The working wavelength is about 780 nm. This is the boundary between the reflected light and the reflected light. After doing this demo, we also want to demonstrate that its efficiency can be very high. You can see that the efficiency of the calculation can be more than 90%. The experimental beam is also 80%. I'm talking about the time when the reflection was recorded. So why do we have to choose this wavelength? Because the inter-beam scattering is at 550 nm, so if we use gold to make the inter-beam scattering, its resonance will never happen before 550 nm. Because the loss is too big. So the farther we work from 550 nm, in theory, its efficiency can be better. Of course, this is just the characteristic of the material itself. Other factors also affect its efficiency, such as structural design. This is the final optimization result. I want to share with you most of my work. The first part is that we want to use aluminum to make a visible Metasurface, and then make some flat components. The other part is that we want to make a transparent mirror. Why do we want to make a transparent mirror? Because what I just said is that the most important thing about Metasurface now is that it can greatly reduce the size of the components we can buy on the market. For example, the simplest and most impressive is the iPhone or our smartphone camera lens. After the iPhone 6, you can find that its body is actually very thin, but its lens protrudes a piece. This is because when the body becomes thin, it has to maintain the resolution of the image it takes . This premise will cause it to not be able to greatly reduce the size of the mirror. It has to insert a lot of different mirror groups and stack them up, so that the image produced after taking pictures will be clearer, so that some contrast and color difference can be eliminated. I will introduce this later. I don't know if I have enough time, so I may be a little faster. In fact, if you take a look at the current direction of the battery wave, we call it bias. In fact, whether it is the linear bias of the y-direction or the linear bias of the x-direction, or when it rotates, it produces a circular bias. No matter what the bias is, I can split its positive and negative into three components, x, y, and z. I can easily stack these three components in the same way. I should say that I can split any bias light into these three components. So our future design will be based on this logic. Bias is actually quite useful in life. For example, 3D images are the most common. If you go to see a 3D movie, it will give you a 3D glasses. These 3D glasses are what the left eye sees and what the right eye sees. Its bias is also perpendicular to each other. When it causes this illusion, the image you see will look like a 3D. So why do you see that the image is foggy when you take off your glasses? Because your two eyes detect the image of two biases at the same time. Or we often see that some people who play photography will know that they will put some filters related to bias in front of the lens, which can shoot some light on some slower or stronger surface to make them more clear. Or do some biological or chemical molecules detection. Because some biological or chemical molecules will take the initiative to bias the bias of the light. Different molecules have different angles of bias. Some are big and some are small. Some people use this thing to make chemical molecules detection. What are the most common ways to manipulate bias on the market? Let me give you three examples. The first one is linear bias. For example, if there is a dirty battery, the battery factory is messy. If you want to turn it into a pure battery factory, for example, the battery factory is a horizontal wire. If the battery factory is along this wire, it will be absorbed. The volume of the battery will be penetrated. So it uses this method to filter out the bias it doesn't want. This is what I found on the Internet. You can buy it on the market. Because we need to effectively absorb all the light in the x-direction. So its thickness must be thick enough. Usually this thickness is about a millimeter. This diameter is one inch. This diameter is half an inch. Another one is that after we produce linear bias, we want to do a rotation of bias light. For example, the linear bias of the green light is 45 degrees. If I want to rotate it to negative 45 degrees, we will use 1 in 2 waves. The main thing is that this material itself can provide different phase differences in the x- and y-directions, so that when the light penetrates, the bias of the x-direction slowly slows down, and the y-direction slowly speeds up, so that the x- and y-directions of the green light are in the positive direction respectively. After coming out, it will become a negative and a positive, and then use this method to rotate it. Because it has to accumulate enough bias delay, so its thickness must be thick enough. Or to produce linear bias light. This is to give the x- and y-dimensions an additional bias delay, so that the angle of the bias delay is large enough that the x- and y-directions of the x- and y-directions are exactly 90 degrees. Then it can become the original bias light. It also has to have enough bias delay, so its thickness must also be very thick. What are the benefits of using linear bias light? We don't need to use the thickness of the minimiter level, we can produce any bias light we want. For example, we provide a design method called Geometry Faced Metasurface, which is a superimposed interface that combines the positions of the x- and y-directions. What does this mean? For example, if I have a stick now, I record a right-handed light and look at the penetration of the left-handed light. At this time, because the bias light of the penetrating light is different from the recorded light, so I call it conversion efficiency. We can see that the conversion efficiency is here. Then I look at the x- and y-directions of the bias light, and I will see a value. At this time, if I rotate it a theta angle, this theta angle is the angle with the y-axis. We will find a very magical thing that its efficiency will hardly change, and its position will change to 2 theta. Then, as long as I let it rotate at the same angle on this surface, I can make its position change from 0 to 2\u03c0. Every time I rotate a theta angle, its bias delay will become 2 theta. Another interesting point is that if the same structure, the direction of my rotation is exactly the same, but at this time I turn into a left-handed light and look at the penetration of the right-handed light. At this time, I will find a more interesting thing, its bias delay can reach 360 degrees, but it is from 0 to 360 and becomes 0 to negative 360. This thing can help us design some components that can be manipulated by bias. For example, if you look at it with the right-handed light, it will become a focal penetration. If you look at it with the left-handed light, it will become a scattered penetration. In other words, I can combine many different optical functions on the same optical component, and its magnitude is very thin. The thickness of this metal is only 50 nanometers, so it is much smaller than the previous 50 nanometers. This is what we are talking about, because its magnitude is very small, so the concept we propose here is that we can integrate all the different chips on the same sample. Then after I enter the color light, I hit different chips and the reflected light can produce a different fragrance. Compared with the general traditional components, I want to produce the original light, for example, I at least need a linear light, a linear polarizer, and a quarter wave, to produce the original light. But now if I only use our metasurface, my thickness only needs about dozens of nanometers to complete this thing. Let me tell you why we use aluminum, because I just mentioned that gold, because its intervention coefficient is around 500 to 550 nanometers, so it is impossible to work on the entire optical spectrum. Silver can work on the entire optical spectrum, but there is a big disadvantage of silver, which is that it is very easy to oxidize, so the components cannot last long. So we choose aluminum here. Here is a demo for everyone, that is to say, we use LISO to pattern some different aluminum sticks of different lengths and sizes, and its color will change drastically. This is its tradition. Indeed, its resonance can expand from 400 nanometers of blue light to 750 nanometers of red light. Here is the design of the component. I won't talk about it. Simply put, we optimized its structure dimension so that it can produce the highest work efficiency. Next, I will tell you how to use the same component to achieve the production of any parameter. First of all, after I design a stick here, as I just said, I make it rotate in the direction of change. I can let it produce 0 to 2\u03c0 and I can produce an abnormal reflection. The interesting thing about this abnormal reflection is that my rotation angle is fixed, so if I enter the color light at this time, it will produce an abnormal reflection of the right light here. Conversely, if I enter the color light and it is the right light, it will produce an abnormal reflection of the left light, but it is on the other side and it is already achieved. If I enter a linear parameter light, which is horizontal, I mean the x-parameter light. Because the x-parameter light can be regarded as the addition of the right light and the left light, so it can let me produce the left and right parameters at the same time. So I use a simple rotation to achieve the adjustment of the original parameter light if I enter the color light as a linear parameter light. How do I produce any linear parameter light? We introduce another parameter light that looks exactly the same as it, but the rotation direction of the structure is opposite. The first group of rotation is clockwise, and the second group of rotation is counterclockwise. In this case, when I enter a linear parameter light, I can achieve the reflection of the right and left parameters at the same time on the same side. Then I make a spatial parallelism between the two of them. This parallelism will make a difference in the position between the two of them. This difference in the position can be determined by this d. As mentioned earlier, the difference in the position can be equal to 2\u03c0d divided by Lx. Lx is the length. So you can see that the difference in the position can be changed by the change in d. So after the two of them interfere with each other, they can be multiplied into different linear parameters. For example, if d is 0, it means that the difference in the position between the two original parameters is 0. At this time, their reflection light will also be an x-parameter light. It's a bit like a mirror. If I let its d be designed to have a difference in the position of \u03c0, it will become a y-parameter light. That is, Lx's reflection light will become y. In this way, I can make it a positive 45-degree linear light or a negative 45-degree linear light. So it's all reflected. Now there's no way to do the refraction. Isn't it just a projection? We can do projection here, but the efficiency of projection will be very low. Because I just said that the loss of metal is relatively large. So our demo here is mainly reflected. The work I will do later will be projected. But our material will be converted from metal to electrolyte. OK, good, continue. Then here is its SEM map. That is, we integrate the six samples together. Then the optical system. Here is a test result. We usually use this POSCALISphere to show what the refraction of light is. In fact, this map is very simple to see. If this map is the earth, its north pole represents the purest right-axis light. The south pole is the purest left-axis light. The four points on the equator represent the linear light. The four points in the east, west, south and north represent the purest x, y, positive 45 and negative 45-degree linear light. And these three maps are based on the experiment results of these three green light wavelengths. The black dots are the theoretical results of ideal prediction. And the black dots with colors are the results of our experiment measurement. It can be said that they are almost very match. Some may have some miscalculations, but they are still quite close to our theoretical prediction results. Then it proves that we can achieve different equilibrium states based on our experimental results. This is an acoustic-optic modulator. This is an acoustic-optic modulator. This is an acoustic-optic modulator. We want to design a different structure, and make it a stick-length. So the resonance will only be produced when the polarity of the infrared light is along the length. That's when I see the image. If I rotate the polarity of the light, the image will disappear. When the white light comes in, I hope to see RGB in the original. If I rotate the polarity of the light, I will see different images. I skip the design principle. This is a sample picture. This is the experiment result. If the white light comes in, I can see the RGB pattern in the original. The same is reflected. If I slowly rotate the polarity of the light, I will see that the image will disappear. This is the first part of making a polarity-dependent holographic image. The second part is the lens. The lens is widely used in our daily life. For example, a microscope or a camera lens. The main thing is to focus on the lens. There are several big problems with the lens. One of them is the difference between the two. The difference is the light coming in from different angles. It will be focused in different places. If I want to make a full-color image, there will be a big difference. The difference is that the light comes in from different angles, but it will be focused in different places. This makes it impossible for us to make a full-color image. In order to satisfy this problem, they will stack two lenses together to compensate for the difference in color. They can be focused at the same point in different places. This makes it possible to make a full-color image. This is why we can't make full-color images. Because they have to stack many lenses together so that they can be focused at the same point in different places. Theoretically, if you add one more lens, you can only make a full-color image. For example, if I want to make a full-color image, you can imagine that I need at least ten or twenty lenses. It may not be enough. Here is a picture. Why is the lens of our smart phone so thick? Because it has a lot of different lenses in it. In order to satisfy the compensation of the difference in color, the picture we take will not have distortion. Or the color will not run away. It's the same as what you see with your eyes. This is why we want to use MetaServer as a lens. I just mentioned that we used to use metal. We want to make a high-efficiency lens. If I use metal, all the examples I just mentioned can only be reflective. On the other hand, if I want to make a penetrative lens, I have to convert it into an anodized material. Anodized material does not have a distortion rate, so there will be no heat loss when it is compensated. Without heat loss, it can greatly reduce the efficiency of work. Here is a history. This may also be skipped. First of all, we use GetInNitro as a material. It has a high enough distortion rate in visible light. We want to use anodized material to make MetaService. The prerequisite is that its distortion rate is at least greater than 2. Because anodized material is not like metal, it has a free electron accumulation. So its resonance must rely on the displacement current. If the displacement current has resonance, it means that the distortion rate itself must be large enough to compare with the surrounding environment. Only then can it produce a strong enough displacement current to produce anodized material accumulation. At least, as far as I can see, if compared with air, it is at least 2. Similarly, we use PPFace, which is the MetaService of GeometryFaceFace, which is the rotating method I just mentioned, to adjust its anodization. Why do we need to adjust its anodization? Because we are going to make a focal length. To make a focal length means that I am now inserting a plane light into it. The light in different positions will feel that its anodization delay is different. It can only reach the same point. So this is the anodization distribution that I have to satisfy in different structures in the space. Then this is the final design result. If I insert an experiment, this is the experimental electronic microscope photo. This is the MetaService Lens we designed. We call it MetaLens. In order to detect its anodization, when we insert a light into it, this ultraviolet transceiver will focus on a certain point in a certain space. We use a flat platform at the back to detect how good its anodized light band is. It can be seen that when we match it to its anodized surface, we can see a very beautiful green highlight. I inserted a green light and laser at this time. If I move away from it, it will not focus. In addition to the green light, we can also do different things. How far is the distance? How far can it move? You mean this stage? Yes. The stage we bought at that time was quite high. It can move up to 7mm. What about its step size? Its step size can be up to 500nm. OK. Yes. Thank you. Go on. Not only the green light, we can also do red, blue, and green. Just change its size. Just like what I just said. Because it also has a resonance. The resonance depends on its size. Yes. Next, in addition to doing positive focal length, we can also do oblique focal length. It's the same on a flat surface. But this thing is very difficult to do in traditional optical anodizing. Because traditional optical anodizing is mainly done by hand to achieve the surface frequency I want. Anodizing is a glass with a curve. Different thicknesses will cause different fragmentation. If I want to use traditional anodizing to do oblique focal length, you can imagine that this curve will become a curve on one side. This is very difficult in terms of technology. Our technology is very simple. I just need to change the distribution of the surface structure and move its center to the left a little bit or to the right a little bit. Then I can do oblique focal length. For example, this picture. Yes. This is the experiment result. You can see that red, blue, and green are focused. The dotted line refers to the position of the lens. The focal length is in the upper right corner. We designed it in the upper right corner. We proposed an application for this. If we integrate all of them on the same chip, it's the same because it's very small. So we can easily integrate them all together. At this time, after I insert a wide-screen light source, I will see different colors with different color distribution. I can use it to divide the light. For example, this is our sample photo. If I insert a red light now, I can see that it focuses in the upper right corner. It's the same sample. If I insert a green light now, I can see that it focuses in the upper left and lower right. If I insert a blue light, it focuses in the lower left. If I insert three wavelengths at the same time, I can see the effect of dividing the light. The biggest application of this is on CMOS. CMOS is a very important component in the current image sensor. Traditionally, a micro lens must be made. It must be focused first and then go through a filter and then go through a detector. Because the detector can't distinguish colors, that's why it has to put a filter here. That's the reason. It must first determine that this filter can only receive blue light. So it has to put a blue light filter here to filter out the white light in front, red light and green light. This causes the red light and green light of this part to be wasted and pushed back and forth. But for our sample, we can put all the white light in and put all the red light here, green light in the middle, and blue light on the other side. We can effectively use all the energy of the green light to greatly increase its S-N ratio. The other biggest advantage is what I just said. Our thickness is only 600 nanometers. Traditionally, it's about 1 to 10 microns. So we can shrink down its physical dimension. Another thing we want to do is to eliminate the color difference. As I just said, different wavelengths will focus on different positions. This is the work of people in the past. This is our work. Traditionally, different wavelengths of green light would focus on different positions in the space. So it's hard to make a full-color image. After some special designs, we provide different color compensation in different positions to create a white light focus point. We're just doing a demo here. So we're using a metal part to do a reflective demonstration. This is the design principle. I won't talk about it. I'll just show you the result. This is the sample photo. This is the measurement result. This is the calculation result. You can see that my wavelength has changed from 1.2 microns to 1.65 microns. Basically, its focal length hasn't changed at all. If I do a different transparent measurement, you can see that when the green light wavelength changes, its focal length remains at the same position. If I compare it with traditional Meta Lens or other traditional Lens, in the same wavelength, its deviation is quite large. So it proves that we can completely eliminate color difference. This is another example. I'll skip it. Another example is what we just talked about. The biggest use of transparency is when we want to make a full-color image. Reflectivity is actually very capable of making a full-color image. So our work here is to make a transparency with high efficiency to eliminate color difference and further apply it to make a full-color image. This is what we just talked about. Why can we use the material of the interface to adjust the fragrance? Mainly because there is a big difference in reflectivity. So it can produce a cavity-like resonance inside. So different wavelengths can produce different resonance. Different wavelengths can produce different fragrance delay. This is our photo. Our studio is located in the visible light. So the refractive wavelength range is from 400 to 640. We can actually eliminate it to 660. But because of the deviation here, I only show it to 640. The last is to make a full-color image. After I use a photo to come in, we use our metalance to eliminate color difference. We want to be able to make a full-color image analysis. This is a full-color photo we made with our transparency. You can see that even the white or yellow colors are very clear. Compared with the original photo, there is not much difference in color. This proves that we can eliminate color difference in the entire refractive wavelength range and make a full-color image application. That's about it. Sorry, I talked a little too fast. Because the time is a bit delayed. This is my report today. Thank you everyone. I don't know if there are any questions. If I talk too fast later. I think it's good. Yeah, no problem. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you now. My question is Basically, your device is roughly scaled as the working frequency. Basically, right? Yes, it's smaller than the frequency. I mean, it should have the same effect. If today you want the wavelength of your work to be doubled, basically, the length is scaled to be about 2. So the area is about 4. No, no, no. It's not a linear scale. It's not a linear scale? No, it's not. Because of the resonance. So it's different from the material. For example, this thing is very intuitive. For example. For example, I just talked about this thing. For example, if we produce resonance, we can think of it as the resonance here. So if you say the wavelength of my work is doubled, in theory, the length should be doubled. The premise of this thing is that the resolution of the structure itself does not change. Oh. But now I have different wavelengths. The resolution of the material will change. So its equivalent wavelength, the effective lambda is actually lambda over n. This n is also the wavelength function. Oh, yeah. Yes, so it's not a linear scale. Now for this kind of material, can you do it in millimeter wave or infrared and deep IR device? Yes, it can be Terahertz or microwave. On the contrary, the most people do microwave. Now there are several American companies established to do this principle are doing microwave. Because microwave is easy to do and the loss is super low. Then the military use is the widest. And its materials are basically for example, aluminum or some silicon base. This kind of cheaper and easy to make material can be done, basically. Yes, that's right. So the metal part is actually quite long, but why the metal part has not been commercial product The main reason is here. Because metal is not yet silicon part fabrication compatible. So why do we want to do gallium nitride later? That's the reason. Because gallium nitride is at least a semiconductor company. Now the current manufacturing can be compatible. Let me tell you why I want to ask this question. Maybe you can think about it. Because we are looking for Terahertz absorber, but it has to be very, very low radioactivity. So we have a very, very big material limit. So we are looking for material limit is very, very big. We can't use some very fancy elements, you know. So if you can do this thing, it should be usable. And it's quite sophisticated. What do you think your Terahertz needs? We need it to be able to adjust its optical quality in Terahertz. Not only optical quality, but also the quality of EM wave. But all the materials it uses have to be very low radioactivity. In other words, its natural isotope has to be very low. So we don't have many materials we can use. But if you can use some pure elements, such as silicon, or aluminum, or some not alloy, or that kind of super heavy metal, or super heavy metal, you can do it. That's a very good choice. For example, can you accept gold and copper? Copper, yes, gold and copper. But what do you want to use? For example, silver, or something weird that you can't read Chinese, that's not OK. If it's Terahertz, gold and copper can be used. These are very common materials. On the other hand, Terahertz is less likely to see electrolytes, because electrolytes in Terahertz's resolution doesn't seem to be able to reach such a high value. Because usually in the natural world, the refractive index of electrolytes will become smaller as the wavelength increases. So it's visibility will be the highest, and then slowly decay. So in my mind, I haven't seen anyone use electrolytes in Terahertz, such as silicon, or gallium nitride, or germanium, not germanium, but silicon nitride, this kind of electrolyte material to make Terahertz components. There's a lot of metal, like I said, a lot of copper and gold. OK, thank you. You're welcome. Ian, you just mentioned radioactivity. What kind of radioactivity do you mean? Do you mean the radiation response in space? No, I mean the radioactivity of the material itself. Like bananas have beta decay, something like that. Oh, OK. So the radioactivity will be higher in space? Yeah, if you want to use something that's at the bottom of the elemental cycle, it won't work. The reason why it won't work is because... Because it will naturally have the same value and then it will easily decay. Then the decay will release particles, and the particles will affect the quality of the material. I didn't quite understand what kind of material do you usually use in the microwave range? Aluminum or gallium nitride? No, if it's microwave, the most common thing is copper, because copper can print the pattern they want directly. So the pattern they print is like the nanostructure of the microwave. Because the wavelength of the microwave is dozens of millimeters, or even centimeters. So it's easier to make? Yeah, it's easier to make. And what they print is a large area. You can stick it on the wall of your house. Oh, I see. Are there any other materials that can do the same thing? Well, the most common metal is gallium nitride. No, not copper. It's gallium aluminum. These three are the most common. Oh, thank you. And if it's... No, you go first. Yeah, and if it's gallium aluminum, there are a lot of choices. For example, as long as it's high enough. So silicon, gallium nitride, silicon nitride, titanium oxide, and gallium phosphide. But gallium phosphide has adsorption, so the effect may not be as good. You have a video where the light hits the left and right of the picture. Oh. This one? Yeah. This one? No, the first one. The first one. The one you just showed. Yeah. Oh, so how efficient is it? If you hit the light directly, if it's linearly polarized, it will turn left and right. This one, in practice... Let me see. In practice, it's about 30% to 50% efficient. OK. And this is its wavelength. Yeah, the next one is the wavelength. In theory, we expect it to be 70% or so. But after we published this, there was one thing that we didn't consider. When we calculated this, we knew that aluminum oxidizes easily. So when it oxidizes, there will be 3 to 5 nanometers of aluminum oxide on the surface. This will affect its resonance and reduce its efficiency. So this picture is actually talking about this. This is someone else's work. He's talking about pure aluminum. If I design it, its resonance is this high. And after the aluminum oxidizes, it will slowly turn right a little bit. Then the efficiency will drop a little bit. This is also seen in our experiment. Indeed, our simulation hopes that its peak is here. But our experimental result is to turn right, and then to fall down. So at that time, there was speculation that the efficiency of this result could not be so high. It's because when we calculated it, when we optimized the structure, we didn't consider the influence of aluminum oxidization. The question I want to ask is if I'm sorry, I'll ask it again. If the positive light keeps reducing the energy, in the end, it will become a single light or several lights. Then it will have to reflect these two lights at the same time Will there be some state of entanglement? Or you don't care about this? We don't care about this. But what you're talking about is actually what I want to do next. Because now the most common entanglement following source is to use BBO, this kind of non-linear crystal to produce entanglement of linear light. But it's linear light. So I actually thought about this thing at that time. If I am now a linear light entanglement, both are H plus V entanglement, I put the light through this source. What is H plus V? The state of H plus V. H is horizontal, V is vertical. It's the entanglement of X and Y. If I turn the green light into the state of H plus V entanglement, can I have spatial entanglement at the same time? Or does it become hyper-entanglement? I'm not sure about this. But I actually wanted to do this thing at that time. Because I'm not sure whether it's H or V. So after it comes in, I can't be sure whether it runs to the left or to the right. Because if it's H, the left is the right. If it's V, the left is the left. I think this thing is likely to be established. Because this kind of element has already been done. We mainly use laser light, which is a bunch of photons to integrate with this structure. If I only have single photons now, it has already been proven that it will also work. In the case that single photons will also work, entanglement should be established. It should have a chance to happen. So what I'm going to do is to use entanglement photons to transfer to the spin of quantum dot. So you're doing quantum light. Yes. And then what I'm going to do is what I just said. But now the entanglement is vertical and horizontal. Yes. If this can be done with left and right entanglement, it should be... Yes, you do it first. And then after you're sure, you should think about it. Before I came here, I... Are there any other questions? OK. Everyone has no questions. Audience. OK. Thank you, Ping Jie. Thank you. You have a good grasp of time. Actually, I talked a little too fast. Anyway, if you have any questions later, you can tell me. Yes. If you really did it in the end, will you continue to do this in Caltech? I didn't do this in Caltech. OK. You can ask Cai Ding Ping later. Yes. Because if this is done, then... We should... We are planning to do this recently. But... OK. Yes. Have you come up with a good approach? Or do you already have some approaches? Just what you just said about BBO. It can only produce linear light. Yes. It can only produce linear light. Yes. If it can produce... Because if you want to produce spin, you have to use circular polarizer. Yes. So... Yes. That's what we are thinking about. No problem. OK. OK. That's all for today. Thank you. Thank you.
