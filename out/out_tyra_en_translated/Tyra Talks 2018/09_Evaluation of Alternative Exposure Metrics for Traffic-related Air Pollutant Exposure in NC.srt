00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi everyone, welcome to this week's TARA Talk.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The title of today's talk is

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The Evaluation of Alternative Exposure Metrics

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
for Traffic-Related Air Pollutant Exposure

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
in North Carolina.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's welcome our speaker today,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Zhang Shiying, or you can call her Zhang-C.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's briefly introduce the speaker's information.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
She's currently working at Sonoma Technology,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a company that specializes in this area.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
She did her Ph.D. at UNC-North Carolina-Champaign Hill.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Before coming to the United States,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
she was a master's student at the University of Texas,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
then a master's student at the University of Texas,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
then a master's student at the University of Texas.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
She's currently working on a topic that's closely related to her research.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's welcome our speaker, Zhang Shiying.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hi everyone.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Before I start, I want to show you my T-shirt.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I won last year.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My name is Zhang Shiying.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You can call me Zhang-C.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Today's topic is

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
how to use air quality models or model-based methods

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to assess human exposure to air pollution.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to focus on the traffic pollutants.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A few days ago, the host asked me to talk about

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
the related issues of air pollution.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But because our company has a strict process

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
of reviewing things and publications,

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I didn't have time to make a new video.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So I'm going to talk about my last year's video.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This photo was taken in the United States in 1948.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why is air pollution important?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This photo was taken in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1948

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
called Donora.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The photo on the right was taken at noon.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can see that it wasn't bad weather or raining that day.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, it was a normal noon.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The streetlights were all on and the sky looked dark.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Air pollution was very serious at that time.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
After that incident,

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
40 people died in the town.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
50% of the residents suffered from

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
People said that it was very difficult to breathe at that time.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This incident caused a lot of resonance in the United States.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
People said that air pollution was very serious.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
After that incident,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
there were a lot of social movements,

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
protests, and government measures.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Finally, in 1967,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the United States passed the Clean Air Act,

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
which is the most important law in the United States.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Clean Air Act was finally passed,

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and control began.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Was it useful?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The answer is yes.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's take a look at this picture.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The word may be too small to see clearly,

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but it doesn't matter.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is basically the annual air pollution concentration.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is a measured situation.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I remember I took this.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It should be LA.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Each line represents a different city or county.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can see this trend.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Every year, air pollution is decreasing.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So it's actually useful.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Since air pollution has decreased,

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
what are we doing to study air pollution?

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's already so low.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are we doing here?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The two most important things now

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
are not only in the United States,

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but also in the world.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The two most important air pollutants are

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
1. Smelly sheep

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
2. PM2.5

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
PM2.5 is called a particulate matter

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I won't go into detail.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But basically,

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
smelly sheep is not directly released.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You won't have something that says it's smelly sheep.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It won't be like that.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The formation of smelly sheep is secondary.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In other words, it's not a smelly sheep gas.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
These gases become smelly sheep

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
after chemical reactions in the air.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
These gases that are released

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
may not be so harmful to the human body.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But after it's released,

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
it becomes smelly sheep

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and is very harmful to the human body.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
PM2.5 is simply a very, very small particle.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is a strand of hair.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We all love to use this picture.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is a strand of hair.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
PM10 is a diameter smaller than 10 micrograms.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's about this big.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a blue circle.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
PM2.5 is this small.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What does being small have to do with it?

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Being small means that it's easy to pass through your respiratory tract.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It can go deeper.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It can go into the lungs.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It will cause respiratory diseases

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and even cardiovascular diseases.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's skip this one first.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is a study

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that has been very active in recent years

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
called Global Burden of Disease.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They publish every year

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the current ranking of causes of death

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and how many people die.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why is air pollution important?

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
After the Clean Air Act,

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the concentration of pollutants decreased every year.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But if you look at the whole world,

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the cause of death from air pollution

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
is ranked fourth in the world.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Air pollution is very, very, very important.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is a paper from Nature in 2015.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They divided the world into countries

126
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and gave the most serious air pollution

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
emission sector.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They predicted how many emission sectors

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
would cause death.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So if you look at this table,

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
there are different pollutants in the horizontal axis.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For example, we have residential energy.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Air pollution caused by using energy.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Agriculture causes air pollution.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Land traffic causes air pollution.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can see the two red boxes,

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
USA and Germany.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
These two countries

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
cause the most death

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
in the traffic sector.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
These are some introductions.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What am I going to talk about today?

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This paper was published in 2015.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In terms of environmental epidemiology,

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
it is important to look at the relationship

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
between diseases and air pollution.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You want to use air pollution variability

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
to explain whether there is a disease

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
or whether there is a disease.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In this case,

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
if there are 10 people today,

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
5 people have respiratory diseases,

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
5 people do not.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I wonder if this is related to air pollution.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
When I was doing this statistical model,

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I found that these 10 people

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
were exposed to the same amount of air pollution.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, they were all exposed to

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
At this time,

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the model can't see anything.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
5 people are sick, 5 people are not sick,

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but everyone is exposed to the same amount of air pollution.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This means that you can't do anything.

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This paper talks about

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the past epidemiological studies,

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the past studies that link diseases

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and air pollution.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What can be improved?

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This slide has a lot of words.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Basically, the most important thing is

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the Health Effect Institute.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is a 2009 paper.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The Health Effect Institute

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
is a very famous institution

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that studies health effects.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They use data from the American Cancer Society

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to re-analyze and link

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the relationship between air pollution and death.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
As I said before,

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
when you do this,

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you need to have all the information

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
about whether you are sick or not.

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Secondly, you need to have data

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
about the exposure of air pollution.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How do they do the air pollution exposure data?

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Basically, they do it in this area.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let me translate it for you.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They have a monitoring station

190
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
set up by the U.S. Department of Environment

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
in the United States.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They have a station on both sides,

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
an air pollution station.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Their approach is

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
for example,

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
in San Francisco,

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have 10 stations.

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I collect the data of these 10 stations

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and calculate the average.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I say that everyone living in San Francisco

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
has the same air pollution exposure.

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That is to say,

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
everyone living in San Francisco

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
has the same air pollution exposure.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This is the same as what I just said.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
For example,

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
everyone lives in San Francisco.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Some people are sick.

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Some people are not sick.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
When I do this epidemiological analysis,

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I tell my models that

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
whether they are sick or not,

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
as long as they live in San Francisco,

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
their exposure is this high.

215
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
At this time,

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you can see that

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
there seems to be a problem.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Another question is

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
that the U.S. Department of Environment

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
set up these stations in the United States

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to measure air pollution.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
However,

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
many air pollution is not regional.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It does not mean that

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
a station can represent

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the concentration of pollutants in the entire area.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The table I listed here

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
is the distance from the road.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The unit is meters.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The axis is normalized to roadside.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That is to say,

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the concentration of air pollution

233
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
is standardized,

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
which is the concentration of two roads on the roadside.

235
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
On the left side of the table,

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you can see that

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
so many pollutants

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
actually have a very steep gradient.

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That is to say,

240
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
between 100 and 150 meters,

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the concentration has dropped by almost 60%.

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That is to say,

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
the road distance is only a few meters.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There is such a difference in concentration

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
within 100 meters.

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can you see such a difference

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
in concentration

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
in a station

249
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
in a certain corner of the city?

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You can't see it.

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The first one,

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you use that kind of station

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to represent exposure,

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the exposure of human body to pollution.

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You may not be able to catch

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
the hot spot in the urban.

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hello, I have a question.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Please go ahead.

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The first one,

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the horizontal axis is the distance,

261
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and the vertical axis is the concentration.

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In the first few meters,

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
their gradient looks almost the same.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But you have,

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
for example, CO, CON,

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and NO, NO, and N.

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't they have a lot of difference in their atomic mass?

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If I take one,

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think it's just an expansion.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Shouldn't the gradient be a lot different?

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because there is still a chemical reaction.

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
CO may not have much reaction.

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
NO and NOX may have chemical reactions.

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It will generate other things.

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So it may laugh faster,

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
laugh slower, not necessarily.

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
OK, OK.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Maybe it's all gas.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Even particles are different.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Particles may have

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
some different characteristics.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want to add that

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
you have to consider the gradient.

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So,

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
there is a physical problem.

286
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So there is a chemical process.

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's right.

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
OK.

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
OK.

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We just talked about outdoor.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
For example,

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you use outdoor,

293
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you use the concentration of the side station beam

294
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to represent the pollution source.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
First, you can't catch the hot spot.

296
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like this kind of traffic pollution source.

297
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If someone lives,

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
if someone's house is close to the road,

299
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you can't catch it.

300
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But if it's far away,

301
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
you can't catch it.

302
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Second,

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
in fact,

304
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
most people

305
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
spend more time indoors

306
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
than they spend outdoors.

307
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is a...

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It should be a Canadian study.

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They looked at

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
how much time

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
children spend

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
indoors or outdoors.

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I used the two red boxes.

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can see

315
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
one is in winter,

316
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
one is in summer.

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
In indoor time,

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
67% in winter,

319
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
72% in summer.

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It means that

321
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
most people

322
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
spend more time indoors

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
than they spend outdoors.

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
At this time,

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
you use outdoor pollutants

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to represent...

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The concentration of the beam

328
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to represent human exposure

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
may also be a problem

330
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
because everyone is indoors.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Right?

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So that's why

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
there is this paper.

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The first one is

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Central Sites.

336
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Central Sites

337
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
means

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
those

339
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
U.S. environmental protection agencies.

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They can't catch

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
these local sources.

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Local sources can be

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
traffic

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
or any

345
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
small sources

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
next to your house.

347
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
They may not be able to...

348
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The second one is

349
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
using outdoor air pollution

350
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
to represent exposure

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
may not be very representative

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
because most people are indoors.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
In theory,

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
you should use indoor air pollution

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to represent exposure.

356
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The goal of this paper

357
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
is to use model-based...

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That is to say,

359
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
use model-based methods

360
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to predict...

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to estimate

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the intensity of indoor and outdoor

363
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and use them

364
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to represent human exposure

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to see

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
how different they are.

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
We can quantify

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
these potential exposure errors

369
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This is the model I used.

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The three yellow boxes

371
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
are STOKE, STOK, R-Line,

372
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and LBL AR models.

373
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
These three are models.

374
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
STOKE stands for

375
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Spacetime Ordinary Crating.

376
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It represents...

377
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's actually

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
an internal and external

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
technology.

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That technology

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
uses...

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Its input data

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
is the data

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
from these environmental protection agencies.

385
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We use that data

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
to push it inwards and outwards

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to the census block level.

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Census block is...

389
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Imagine...

390
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's a block.

391
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
When you're walking,

392
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
there's a block on the road.

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It could be a block.

394
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So we push those intensities

395
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
inwards and outwards

396
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to these block levels.

397
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This represents

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
a background level.

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I use the data

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
from the Central Monitoring Site

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
to push it inwards and outwards

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
to these places.

403
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But it could miss

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
these local sources,

405
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
such as traffic.

406
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
R-Line is a line source

407
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
dispersion model.

408
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's used to predict

409
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
traffic-related pollution.

410
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It basically

411
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
takes all roads

412
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
as a line.

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It uses

414
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
a simple

415
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
high-definition

416
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
method

417
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
to model

418
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
traffic pollution.

419
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It represents local source.

420
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We define local source

421
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
as traffic pollution.

422
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The last LVL-AR model

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
is Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory

424
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Air Exchange Rate Model.

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's used to

426
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
predict air exchange rate,

427
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
which is the air exchange rate

428
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
for each household.

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
For example,

430
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
how long

431
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
will the air

432
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
in your house

433
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
be exchanged

434
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
with the air outside?

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Using these three models

436
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and combining them,

437
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we can calculate

438
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the six blue boxes.

439
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
These six boxes

440
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
represent

441
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
exposure.

442
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We call it

443
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
exposure metric.

444
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We use these six boxes

445
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
to represent

446
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
air exposure.

447
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What are they?

448
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The first one is

449
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
outdoor stoke,

450
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
which is

451
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
outdoor air exposure.

452
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's called stoke.

453
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It represents background.

454
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Remember,

455
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
the source of this thing

456
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
is Central Monitoring Site,

457
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
which is

458
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the U.S. Department of Environment.

459
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The second one is

460
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
outdoor on-road.

461
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It represents

462
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
air pollution

463
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
caused by

464
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
traffic.

465
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's modeled

466
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
by R-Line.

467
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Combining these two things,

468
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
outdoor stoke

469
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
represents background

470
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
because it can't

471
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
capture local source.

472
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you add these two things,

473
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you get total exposure.

474
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We call it

475
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
outdoor hybrid,

476
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
which is hybrid between

477
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
R-Line and stoke.

478
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
These three things

479
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
represent

480
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
outdoor concentration.

481
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Using these three

482
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
outdoor concentrations

483
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
as a base,

484
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
we can combine

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the air exchange rate.

486
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The air exchange rate

487
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
from the LBL

488
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
air exchange rate model

489
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
on the left

490
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
can be used

491
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
to calculate

492
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the corresponding

493
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
indoor concentration.

494
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We use outdoor concentration

495
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
to calculate

496
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
indoor concentration.

497
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We have

498
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
three other metrics,

499
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
indoor on-road,

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
indoor stoke,

501
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and indoor hybrid.

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There are six metrics in total.

503
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I have a question.

504
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Go ahead.

505
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Do you consider

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
opening and closing

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
the window

508
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
or just

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
looking at

510
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
the exchange rate

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
under the air condition?

512
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You'll see it later.

513
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We'll talk about it later.

514
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We'll talk about it later.

515
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This slide

516
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
is about R-Line.

517
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
R-Line is a dispersion model.

518
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You have to use R-Line.

519
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In any air pollution model,

520
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
the most important thing

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
is emission.

522
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
This slide talks about

523
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
how emission is calculated

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and where the data comes from.

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This is not

526
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
too important

527
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to everyone.

528
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Let's not talk about it.

529
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is stoke.

530
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's the same as what I just said.

531
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It is an

532
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
internal and external

533
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
critting technology.

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It uses

535
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
the U.S. Environmental Protection

536
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Air Quality System,

537
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
or AQS,

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
which is

539
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the big test stations.

540
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Finally,

541
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
these two things are added up.

542
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This is

543
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
how to calculate

544
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
the corresponding

545
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
indoor concentration

546
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
of the outdoor concentration.

547
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is a very simple

548
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
mass balance model.

549
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The internal

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
concentration

551
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and time change

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
are determined by these terms.

553
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The first is

554
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
the outdoor concentration

555
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
brought in by the

556
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
air exchange

557
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and the

558
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
internal concentration

559
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
of the outdoor pollution.

560
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This includes

561
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
deposition,

562
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
which is the rate

563
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
of indoor air

564
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
being excreted.

565
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Here are some factors.

566
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The penetration factor

567
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is the rate of

568
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
incoming air.

569
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The deposition rate

570
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is the rate of

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
incoming air.

572
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The penetration rate

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
is 1.

574
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The deposition rate

575
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is 0.5 per hour.

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The PEM

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
is the rate

578
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
of incoming air.

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The particle

580
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
is lower

581
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and the deposition rate

582
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
is lower.

583
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This is

584
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
the question

585
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
from the instructor.

586
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
AER model

587
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
is to calculate

588
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the window.

589
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The answer is no.

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This study

591
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
is at the census block level.

592
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I remember

593
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
there are

594
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
330,000 houses

595
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
in this area.

596
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
In theory,

597
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
if you want to use

598
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the model,

599
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
including the window

600
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and air conditioning,

601
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
you won't have the data.

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because I can't go to

603
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
330,000 houses

604
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
one by one

605
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
without the data.

606
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So we need the simplest

607
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
model.

608
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We don't even consider

609
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
where the house is.

610
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What is the air exchange rate?

611
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I won't

612
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
explain the model

613
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
in detail.

614
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
All the parameters,

615
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
such as how many years

616
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the house has been built,

617
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
how big the floor area is,

618
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you need this model.

619
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
In the past,

620
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
this model was used

621
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to look at 10 or 15 houses.

622
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But now

623
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I need to look at 330,000 houses.

624
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't do that.

625
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So I need to look for the data.

626
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I use the County Property Assessment Record.

627
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can have

628
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the data

629
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
for each house.

630
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is free

631
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
in North Carolina.

632
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's expensive in California.

633
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll give you $100.

634
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I won't explain

635
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
the rest of the data.

636
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's basically public available data.

637
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's one thing here.

638
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
For each census block,

639
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I sample

640
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
about 10 houses.

641
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I use the 10 houses

642
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to represent the census block.

643
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't just make 330,000 houses

644
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and make them all.

645
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This is my modeling domain.

646
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
These three counties

647
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
in North Carolina.

648
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Orange County is where UNC is.

649
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I used to live here.

650
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Durham is where

651
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Duke University is.

652
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Don't go there.

653
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This is

654
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
a snapshot.

655
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I use

656
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the six exposure metrics

657
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I mentioned earlier.

658
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This is the map.

659
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's shown here.

660
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
A is the Outdoor Stoke.

661
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It uses

662
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the data from the station.

663
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
B is Outdoor Hybrid.

664
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It uses R-Line,

665
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the traffic source,

666
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and the background,

667
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the interpolation

668
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
data.

669
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The two below

670
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
represent

671
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the air quality field

672
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
in the simple

673
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
indoor mass balance model.

674
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Let's look at the Outdoor Stoke

675
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in the upper left corner.

676
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Most of the concentration

677
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
is between

678
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
24 and 27.

679
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
There's no spatial

680
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
variation.

681
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's it.

682
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I remember

683
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
there are only

684
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
two or three stations

685
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
in this area.

686
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
If you have two or three stations

687
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
with interpolation data,

688
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
you can only achieve

689
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
this much.

690
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Let's look at the Outdoor Hybrid.

691
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
If you add the local source

692
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
data,

693
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
you can see

694
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
the map

695
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
of air pollution.

696
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You can tell

697
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
the difference.

698
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Let's look at

699
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
C, the Indoor Stoke.

700
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The station

701
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
is a transportation source.

702
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There are different types of stations.

703
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Some are in the background,

704
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
such as National Park.

705
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Some are near the traffic.

706
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's right.

707
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We chose the background station

708
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
for this study.

709
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We didn't use urban stations

710
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
for this study.

711
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Did you use

712
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the transportation model

713
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
of R-Line?

714
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yes, I did.

715
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I gave the model evaluation

716
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
in my last talk.

717
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Thank you.

718
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's look at

719
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Indoor Stoke.

720
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
A is the input of C.

721
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
C and A

722
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
are compared.

723
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
First,

724
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the color scale is lower.

725
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Second,

726
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
there are more spatial variations.

727
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The concentration

728
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
of C is between

729
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
7 and 14.

730
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Compared to

731
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the Outdoor Stoke,

732
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
it's between 24 and 27.

733
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Where do these spatial variations

734
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
come from?

735
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They come from

736
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the air exchange rate

737
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
of different stations.

738
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What does this mean?

739
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It means that

740
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
if you only use the Outdoor Stoke,

741
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
which is what they did,

742
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
they used that method

743
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
to predict

744
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the exposure.

745
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
They used that method

746
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
to estimate the exposure.

747
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
On the right,

748
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
you can see

749
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the concentration of local source.

750
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
On the bottom,

751
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you can see the map

752
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
of the Indoor Stoke.

753
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You can tell the difference

754
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
just by looking at the map.

755
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The last one,

756
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
D, is the Indoor Stoke.

757
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The input source is B.

758
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
B to D.

759
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
You can see

760
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the variations are the same.

761
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
High concentration

762
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
near the road,

763
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
low concentration far from the road.

764
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
However, the concentration

765
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
on the top

766
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
is between 90 and 100.

767
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
On the bottom,

768
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
it's less than that.

769
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
When you go to the Indoor Stoke,

770
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
the absolute concentration

771
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
will decrease.

772
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Here,

773
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm looking at...

774
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Hello.

775
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I have a small question

776
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
about the front page.

777
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
This is basically a 2D model,

778
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
right?

779
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You can also

780
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
make it vertical.

781
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You can have different heights.

782
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Mine is 2 meters

783
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
away from the ground.

784
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
2 meters away from the ground.

785
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm just curious.

786
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Is the terrain near here flat?

787
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Or is there a hill?

788
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This area is quite flat.

789
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This area is quite flat.

790
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's a hill to the west.

791
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's quite flat here.

792
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Here,

793
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm using a box plot

794
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to show

795
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
the average concentration.

796
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The concentration distribution

797
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
by pollutant.

798
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I forgot

799
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
what I was going to say.

800
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's start with CO.

801
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Let's start with A.

802
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
If we only look at...

803
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's compare

804
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the black and white boxes.

805
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
The black represents

806
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
the outdoor concentration.

807
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The white represents

808
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the indoor concentration.

809
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
You can see that

810
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
CO is about the same.

811
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Look at Stokes.

812
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Outdoor and indoor

813
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
have similar distribution.

814
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Why is it similar?

815
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's because

816
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the penetration factor

817
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and deposition factor

818
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
of CO is 1.

819
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The deposition rate

820
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
of CO is 0.

821
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's why the indoor and outdoor

822
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
have similar distribution.

823
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Look at Knox.

824
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The penetration factor is 1,

825
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
but the deposition rate is 0.5.

826
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You can see that

827
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the indoor concentration is lower

828
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
than the outdoor concentration.

829
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's about half.

830
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
In the same situation,

831
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
PM and EC

832
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
have similar distribution.

833
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The indoor concentration is half

834
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If the outdoor concentration

835
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
represents the deposition rate,

836
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the PM will stay in the indoor

837
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
for longer than the deposition rate.

838
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
After comparing the black and white boxes,

839
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
let's compare

840
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Stokes and Unrow.

841
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Stokes and Unrow.

842
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The two black and white boxes

843
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
on the left

844
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and the two black and white boxes

845
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
on the middle.

846
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
First, look at

847
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
CO and Knox.

848
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
CO and Knox.

849
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You can see that

850
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Stokes is much higher than Unrow

851
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
in terms of CO.

852
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Knox is closer.

853
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Why?

854
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because of traffic pollution,

855
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the deposition rate of

856
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
gas cars is very high.

857
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't have the table here,

858
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
but I remember

859
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that in some places,

860
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the deposition rate of gas cars

861
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
may be up to 40%,

862
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
which means

863
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
because gas cars

864
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
deposit a lot of pollutants,

865
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the deposition rate of gas cars

866
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
is relatively high.

867
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
In particular,

868
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the deposition rate of Stokes and Unrow

869
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is actually very low,

870
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
because the deposition rate

871
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
of primary PM2

872
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
is only up to 5%.

873
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
is only up to 5%.

874
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
However,

875
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
the deposition rate of EC

876
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
is smaller.

877
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
This is the consequence of

878
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
the combustion of PM2.5.

879
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Because of the combustion of engines,

880
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it will burn slightly higher.

881
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Here I am looking at

882
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the spatial variation

883
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
after talking about density.

884
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I have calculated

885
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
a value of

886
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
spatial coefficient

887
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
of variation.

888
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The higher the value

889
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
of spatial coefficient,

890
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
the higher the value of

891
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
spatial variation.

892
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What we want to see

893
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
is whether these things

894
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
represent exposure.

895
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Most people

896
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
use Stoke's

897
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
outdoor concentration

898
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
to represent

899
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
exposure.

900
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The black box

901
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
on the far left

902
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is Stoke's

903
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
indoor concentration.

904
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
For example,

905
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Stoke's

906
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
spatial variation

907
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
is very low.

908
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The white box

909
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
on the far right

910
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
is Stoke's

911
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
indoor spatial variation.

912
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Why?

913
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Because I have added

914
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
the air exchange rate

915
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
spatial variation.

916
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
If you replace

917
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the air with air,

918
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
you get

919
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
spatial variation.

920
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
There is a

921
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
method to

922
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
classify

923
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
exposure in

924
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
epidemiology.

925
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Sometimes we do not

926
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
use absolute density

927
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
such as 50mcg per cubic meter

928
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
to represent exposure.

929
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Sometimes we just

930
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
classify it.

931
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
For example,

932
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the low-middle-high

933
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
group may only expose

934
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
0-2mcg.

935
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The middle group

936
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
may expose 2-4mcg.

937
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The high-middle-high

938
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
group may expose 4-8mcg.

939
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I do the same thing here.

940
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I divide the six

941
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
exposure metrics

942
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
into five groups,

943
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
0-20%,

944
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
20-40,

945
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and 50-60.

946
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The first group

947
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
is the indoor

948
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
hybrid-based exposure.

949
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The second group

950
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
is the

951
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
indoor hybrid-based

952
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
exposure.

953
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The first group

954
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
is the

955
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
indoor hybrid-based

956
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
exposure.

957
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
The second group

958
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
is the

959
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
indoor hybrid-based

960
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
exposure.

961
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Let's compare

962
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
the outdoor hybrid-based

963
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and the indoor hybrid-based.

964
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The red line

965
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
represents

966
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
the

967
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
agreement

968
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
between

969
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
the two groups.

970
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
The higher the number,

971
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
the more agreeable

972
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
the agreement is.

973
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
For example,

974
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the 0-20% group

975
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
is the hybrid-based

976
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
indoor group.

977
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The outdoor hybrid-based

978
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
group

979
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
represents

980
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
50%,

981
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
49.22% of the

982
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
exposure.

983
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The hybrid-based

984
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
group

985
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
represents

986
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
50% of the

987
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
exposure.

988
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The highest group

989
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
represents

990
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
73%,

991
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
which is

992
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the NOx group.

993
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The NOx group

994
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
is the

995
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
on-road source.

996
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The NOx group

997
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
is the

998
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
on-road source.

999
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Your analysis unit

1000
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
is the sensor's track.

1001
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No, the sensor's block.

1002
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What about your spatial resolution?

1003
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Your model could be run hourly.

1004
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I mean

1005
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you have

1006
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
a sensor track

1007
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
with hourly data.

1008
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Did your contingency

1009
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
match the group?

1010
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Is the sensor's track

1011
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
hourly data?

1012
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No, I remember

1013
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I used annual average.

1014
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
This should be only annual average.

1015
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This is not hourly data.

1016
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I used sensor's block,

1017
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
not sensor's track.

1018
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Sensor's track has a lot of blocks.

1019
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's take a look

1020
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
at the worst case.

1021
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I remember

1022
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
outdoor stock

1023
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
is widely used

1024
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
in popular

1025
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
epidemiological research.

1026
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Compare to

1027
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
hybrid-based indoor,

1028
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
the red line

1029
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
is

1030
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
25.54%.

1031
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It means

1032
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
you could have

1033
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
such a big exposure error.

1034
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Why?

1035
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
First, you didn't consider local source.

1036
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Second, you didn't consider

1037
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
indoor concentration.

1038
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We talked about this.

1039
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The surprising thing

1040
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
about this analysis unit

1041
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
is that when you use

1042
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
indoor on-road concentration,

1043
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the performance is good.

1044
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Remember that

1045
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
indoor on-road concentration

1046
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
is only for on-road.

1047
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
It doesn't consider background level.

1048
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Why?

1049
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Because

1050
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
a large part of NOx

1051
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
comes from gas engine.

1052
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It also controls

1053
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
spatially.

1054
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
When you only use this unit,

1055
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you can see

1056
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
the high concentration of on-road

1057
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and the low concentration of off-road.

1058
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
As long as you can capture this,

1059
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you can capture

1060
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
most of

1061
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
the high concentration.

1062
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It also considers

1063
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
indoor concentration.

1064
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It uses air exchange rate

1065
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
to reflect

1066
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
the air exchange rate

1067
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
between each house.

1068
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The performance is good.

1069
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The highest group can reach 89%.

1070
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Here, I'm showing

1071
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
a similar situation.

1072
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I use hybrid.

1073
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
You can see

1074
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
the area is blank.

1075
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Because this is

1076
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the answer.

1077
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Other things

1078
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
cut out the answer.

1079
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It becomes a box.

1080
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Each box

1081
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
represents

1082
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
when you use

1083
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
a specific exposure metric

1084
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to represent exposure,

1085
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
what is the error?

1086
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Let's see

1087
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the most widely used

1088
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
exposure metric,

1089
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Stoke Outdoor Concentration.

1090
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You can see

1091
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
the normalized difference

1092
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
is very high.

1093
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The average of NOx

1094
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
is about 80-90%.

1095
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The conclusion is

1096
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
that

1097
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it's complicated.

1098
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
There are many

1099
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
different analysis and pollution.

1100
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The pollution

1101
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and traffic

1102
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
are different.

1103
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Bear with me.

1104
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Basically,

1105
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
CO and PN2.5

1106
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
traffic

1107
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
is lower.

1108
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
14% and 6%.

1109
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
NOx and ECO

1110
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
are higher.

1111
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
40% and 44%.

1112
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
When you use

1113
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
the indoor infiltration model,

1114
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the indoor concentration

1115
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
is about 60% of

1116
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
the outdoor concentration.

1117
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It will be reduced by 40%.

1118
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
When you use the outdoor concentration

1119
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
to represent the exposure,

1120
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
it's not right.

1121
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The concentration is not that high.

1122
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The exposure is not that high.

1123
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Okay.

1124
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's too complicated.

1125
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This is my

1126
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
acknowledgment.

1127
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I used to work at UNC.

1128
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The funding source is

1129
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
EPA's contract.

1130
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
EPA provides emissions

1131
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and meteorological data.

1132
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's not on the slide.

1133
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This is a reference.

1134
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That's it.

1135
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Thank you.

1136
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Thank you.

1137
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Do you have

1138
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
any questions?

1139
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't think so.

1140
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yay!

1141
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
On Saturday afternoon,

1142
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
stay healthy.

1143
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Don't be so academic.

1144
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is interesting.

1145
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You can see it with R-Line.

1146
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
For example,

1147
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
why is there a basketball court?

1148
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
When I started

1149
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
doing this,

1150
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
especially after I moved here,

1151
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the Golden Gate Bridge

1152
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
next to San Francisco

1153
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
is a place

1154
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
for jogging and cycling.

1155
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
There are six lanes.

1156
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
There are three lanes

1157
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
on each side.

1158
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Normally, cars drive very slowly.

1159
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
In terms of emissions,

1160
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the slower the car drives,

1161
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
the higher the emissions.

1162
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
People jogging and cycling

1163
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
are enjoying

1164
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the air pollution.

1165
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
My idea is

1166
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
if you move

1167
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the basketball court

1168
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
to the middle,

1169
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
you can save

1170
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
a lot of energy.

1171
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That's it.

1172
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Is there a way

1173
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to do it in Taiwan?

1174
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I have a question.

1175
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Please go ahead.

1176
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The question is

1177
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
if you look at

1178
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the road emission data,

1179
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
you won't stand

1180
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
next to the road

1181
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
and check

1182
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
if every car

1183
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
is a Tesla

1184
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
or a diesel car.

1185
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
However,

1186
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
there is a free parameter.

1187
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If all the cars

1188
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
are Tesla,

1189
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
half Tesla, half pickup,

1190
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and all are big trucks,

1191
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
how much improvement

1192
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
can be made?

1193
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Is there a way

1194
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
to justify

1195
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
how much

1196
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
public sector resources

1197
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
are needed

1198
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
to change the air quality

1199
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
in a static way?

1200
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's a very important point.

1201
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's called fleet distribution.

1202
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
When we talk about

1203
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
traffic pollution,

1204
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
a very important parameter

1205
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
is fleet distribution.

1206
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is there a difference

1207
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
between fleet distribution

1208
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and model distribution?

1209
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The difference is

1210
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that we use

1211
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
MOOVS,

1212
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator.

1213
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
In terms of models,

1214
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
we use MOOVS.

1215
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
In terms of models,

1216
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
you can tell MOOVS

1217
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that if half of

1218
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the fleet distribution

1219
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
is electric vehicles

1220
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
and half is diesel cars,

1221
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
you can do it

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
in terms of models.

1223
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But if you want

1224
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
to block a street

1225
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and make the entire fleet

1226
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
50% Tesla,

1227
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
it's a bit difficult.

1228
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
You made a very good point.

1229
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I don't remember

1230
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
having seen

1231
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
a similar study

1232
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
in fleet distribution.

1233
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Have you seen a similar study,

1234
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
coach?

1235
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
He's probably taking care of the kids.

1236
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't remember

1237
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
having seen a similar study

1238
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
where we changed the fleet distribution

1239
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and changed it to electric vehicles.

1240
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I haven't seen such a study.

1241
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Thank you.

1242
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I have a question.

1243
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm a bit curious.

1244
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
When I first saw this topic,

1245
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I thought it was very interesting.

1246
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Why did you choose that place?

1247
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I looked it up on the Internet.

1248
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
North Carolina

1249
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
seems to have more

1250
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
air pollution.

1251
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
This area is

1252
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
the NC Piedmont region.

1253
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There are four areas in North Carolina.

1254
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Coastline,

1255
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Piedmont, Mountain,

1256
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and I forgot the other one.

1257
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Piedmont is like a triangle.

1258
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
This area is an RTP area,

1259
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
so the air pollution

1260
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
is a bit more severe.

1261
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Another reason

1262
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
why I chose these three counties

1263
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is because we had a project

1264
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
with the EPA.

1265
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
They wanted to use

1266
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
the metrics I just mentioned

1267
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
to do their epidemiological research.

1268
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They did a study

1269
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
on heart disease

1270
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and wanted to use

1271
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
air pollution data.

1272
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We had a contract

1273
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
with the EPA

1274
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
to do this research.

1275
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
When I talked to them last time,

1276
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
they said they were already

1277
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
writing a paper.

1278
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't know where it went.

1279
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So the research you did

1280
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
in this area

1281
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
is quite valuable, right?

1282
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Because the EPA

1283
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
is located there.

1284
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The EPA's R&D office

1285
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
is located there.

1286
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A lot of research

1287
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
is done there.

1288
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yesterday,

1289
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
a few people from UNC

1290
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
came to the lab.

1291
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I asked them,

1292
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I heard the air pollution

1293
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
in UNC is quite severe.

1294
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
They were surprised.

1295
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I said, really?

1296
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The air there is much better than California.

1297
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I said it's severe

1298
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
compared to

1299
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
North Carolina.

1300
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Even in Piedmont,

1301
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
although it's a severe area,

1302
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it's still very low.

1303
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Okay.

1304
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
North Carolina is a very clean area.

1305
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The population of North Carolina

1306
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
is only 9 million,

1307
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
which is four times the population of Taiwan.

1308
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
In South California,

1309
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
the population of

1310
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
one county is 20 million.

1311
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yes.

1312
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So I believe

1313
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
air pollution is more severe.

1314
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yes.

1315
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
In California,

1316
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
there are a lot of

1317
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
near-road studies

1318
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and children's health studies.

1319
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A lot of those papers

1320
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
are done by our company's

1321
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
senior scientists.

1322
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They do a lot of research

1323
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in LA.

1324
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
The first project

1325
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I joined our company on

1326
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
was to use R-Line

1327
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
to predict the air flow

1328
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
of children

1329
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
because of air pollution.

1330
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The system

1331
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
is also

1332
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
targeted at

1333
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the entire South Coast

1334
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
area.

1335
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
The entire South Coast area.

1336
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That area is

1337
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
well-known

1338
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
for air pollution.

1339
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Actually,

1340
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
in Joe's

1341
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
presentation,

1342
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I think

1343
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
this is

1344
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
a newspaper

1345
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
from the 1970s.

1346
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
This is

1347
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
the Los Angeles Times.

1348
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's an LA newspaper

1349
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
from that time.

1350
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
At that time,

1351
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
they talked about

1352
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
the problem of

1353
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
bad oxygen.

1354
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I remember

1355
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
they said

1356
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
bad oxygen can reach

1357
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
70 ppb.

1358
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That's high.

1359
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It can reach 700 ppb

1360
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
at that time.

1361
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Some of our senior scientists

1362
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
lived in LA when they were young

1363
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and they said

1364
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
standing outside

1365
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
can make you cry.

1366
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
That's an older magnitude difference.

1367
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's very exaggerated.

1368
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
LA is a basin.

1369
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It's an air basin.

1370
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The air quality

1371
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
is relatively stable.

1372
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Air pollution can't escape.

1373
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Thank you for your answer.

1374
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I want to ask

1375
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
if there are any other questions.

1376
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
If not,

1377
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
let me promote Taira.

1378
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Got it?

1379
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I want to

1380
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
simply say

1381
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
that

1382
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Do you have a question?

1383
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
No.

1384
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
OK.

1385
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You know what I'm doing.

1386
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Let me...

1387
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Right.

1388
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Let me talk about it.

1389
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Basically,

1390
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
many epidemiologists

1391
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and epidemiologists

1392
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
make

1393
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
underestimated responses.

1394
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The main reason is

1395
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
from an economic point of view,

1396
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
when you know

1397
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
the air quality is bad,

1398
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
you optimize your behavior.

1399
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So,

1400
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
acute hospital admission

1401
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
or all the endpoints

1402
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
are the results

1403
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
after people optimize their behavior.

1404
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So,

1405
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
for example, ozone,

1406
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
CO,

1407
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
you may not see anything

1408
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
in low concentration.

1409
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But in fact,

1410
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
it's gone.

1411
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So,

1412
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
from an economic

1413
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and epidemiological

1414
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
point of view,

1415
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
it's a big difference.

1416
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
When the air quality is bad,

1417
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you can choose

1418
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
a different transportation mode.

1419
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
For example,

1420
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
in Taiwan,

1421
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
you ride a scooter,

1422
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
but if the air quality is bad,

1423
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
you ride a bus.

1424
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So,

1425
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
it has nothing to do

1426
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
with today's topic.

1427
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Interesting.

1428
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So, what's your name?

1429
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yi.

1430
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yi Xu.

1431
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'd like to ask

1432
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
if you work on energy policy.

1433
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yes, I do.

1434
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I have an article

1435
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
about Taipei Metro

1436
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and air pollution.

1437
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
In the U.S.,

1438
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
for example,

1439
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
when the Energy Bureau

1440
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
wants to change

1441
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
their policy,

1442
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
do they refer to

1443
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
researchers or companies?

1444
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Or do they take an average?

1445
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
No,

1446
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
policy set up is basically

1447
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
a political negotiation process.

1448
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
For example,

1449
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
in California,

1450
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
renewable energy

1451
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
will be 50% in 2030.

1452
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So,

1453
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
the government's policy

1454
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
will be like this.

1455
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
The next step is

1456
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
to hand it over to California

1457
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Air Resources Board

1458
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
or other government agencies

1459
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
to implement.

1460
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So,

1461
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
under my overall policy

1462
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
target,

1463
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
how do I use

1464
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
economic instruments?

1465
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
For example,

1466
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I can force companies

1467
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
to use renewable energy.

1468
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So,

1469
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
our target is to

1470
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
come up with a way

1471
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
to use market instruments.

1472
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
For example,

1473
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I can close subsidy

1474
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
renewable energy

1475
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
from the fossil fuel

1476
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
or dirty energy.

1477
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
In this way,

1478
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
those firms

1479
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
will endogenous

1480
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and use market

1481
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
to achieve the result.

1482
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I think policy is important

1483
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
for researchers.

1484
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
For example,

1485
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I'm doing CO2 reduction here.

1486
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So,

1487
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
our institute's funding source

1488
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
is based on the government's policy.

1489
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
For example,

1490
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
if Trump doesn't support

1491
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
energy,

1492
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
we will be worried.

1493
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Will you be fired?

1494
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I don't think so.

1495
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
But others are worried

1496
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
about our institute.

1497
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Our institute is not only in Caltech,

1498
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but also in Stanford and Berkeley.

1499
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So,

1500
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
everyone is worried about it.

1501
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But now,

1502
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
it seems to be guaranteed

1503
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
to be implemented in 2020.

1504
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So,

1505
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
except Trump,

1506
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
everyone else is supportive.

1507
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I think it's impossible in California.

1508
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Our institute is a pioneer

1509
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
in environmental policy.

1510
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So,

1511
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
even if the government's funding

1512
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
is not enough,

1513
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
we have a lot of state funding.

1514
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Thank you for your comment.

1515
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I think it's interesting.

1516
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'll send you an email later.

1517
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I think we can work together.

1518
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Let me interrupt.

1519
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
As I mentioned,

1520
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I'm a policy designer.

1521
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If I'm not mistaken,

1522
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
next week's talk

1523
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
is about economics.

1524
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
The speaker will talk about

1525
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
mechanical design.

1526
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's not specific

1527
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
about energy

1528
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
or energy policy design.

1529
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But it's about

1530
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
mechanical design itself

1531
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
from an economic perspective.

1532
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I just realized it's related to

1533
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
what you just discussed.

1534
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yixu,

1535
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
we can keep in touch.

1536
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You should have it.

1537
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I'm in control of everything.

1538
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Okay.

1539
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm just cyber-stalking you

1540
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
right now.

1541
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Please.

1542
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I already have Zhang Xi.

1543
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I can stalk others.

1544
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Keep tracking.

1545
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Okay.

1546
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't know

1547
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
if Jiao Yan has joined

1548
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Tyra's members.

1549
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
If you're interested in joining Tyra...

1550
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
She gave a talk last year.

1551
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Okay.

1552
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yixu,

1553
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
are you in Tyra?

1554
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
You're a passerby.

1555
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm a passerby.

1556
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You can join us next time.

1557
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Okay.

1558
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'll send you the membership form

1559
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
right away.

1560
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
If you're interested,

1561
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
you're welcome to join Tyra.

1562
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
There's a lot of people.

1563
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay.

1564
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
The biggest problem is

1565
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
you can't find students

1566
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
even if you want to.

1567
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
What kind of students?

1568
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
PhD students.

1569
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
You mean me?

1570
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I mean me.

1571
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I can't find students

1572
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
if I want to.

1573
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Not necessarily.

1574
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
We'll have students

1575
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
after the promotion.

1576
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
We'll have students after the promotion.

1577
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Thank you.
