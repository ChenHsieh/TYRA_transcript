Q&A SESSION
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech.
Today's speech topic is very special and I like it very much.
The speaker is Liu Junlin.
He is going to talk about LATEX and DINNER today.
I will briefly introduce the speaker today.
The speaker got a doctorate in electrical engineering from Caltech this year.
His main field of research is digital signal processing and statistical signal processing.
This is a brief introduction of the speaker.
Without further ado, let's welcome the speaker to talk about today's speech tool.
Please turn on the microphone and let's clap together.
Let's start the speech.
We'll leave the time to Junlin.
Thank you.
I need to turn on the microphone.
You can turn it on, I'll turn it off.
Then I'll turn it on here.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for the invitation from TAIRA.
I am honored to give a special academic speech today.
Today's speech topic is mainly about LATEX.
Another tool called TIKZ and DINNER.
How to use these three tools in academic reports.
Before talking about this topic, I want to mention why I want to talk about this topic.
First of all, when I received the invitation, I also thought about whether to talk about my special research topic.
Thinking about it later, I think it's too professional.
It may not be useful to everyone.
Then I turned to talk about some tools in the academic world that I have a little experience with.
These three tools.
By the way, let me share my experience with these tools.
Next is my speaker.
The speaker will first do a brief introduction.
Then I will focus on these three tools.
Then show some of the presentations I made.
Presentations made with these three tools.
Finally, a little summary.
Before starting the whole talk, I want to show you a picture.
I believe everyone should have at least a little experience in academic research.
In fact, academic research can be divided into several stages.
Suppose you want to do academic research.
First of all, you need to have the most primitive research idea.
According to this idea, you have to make a corresponding plan.
For example, how much funding to apply for, how many students to receive, and how large your lab needs.
After these things, you are responsible for managing people or managing the progress of the plan.
After having people or progress, you may need to design experiments and collect data.
Then make a corresponding conclusion based on your data.
The last step, I personally think it is a very important step.
When you have the results of your research,
You may have to publish it to the appropriate conference and magazine.
Make the right oral report and promote your results to let others know.
I believe that many research topics are related to this research cycle.
The topic of my report today is related to this research cycle.
But I'm not going to share with you how to find new research topics.
I'm not going to teach you how to do research.
Of course, it has nothing to do with the following topics.
Of course, it has nothing to do with my research topics.
The topic of my report today is related to the sixth topic,
Publication and Presentation.
It has a little bit to do with these two topics.
But I'm not going to teach you how to write a paper or how to do oral expression.
This is another topic.
My main focus today is to show you a picture.
This picture...
Because of copyright issues, I didn't put the original picture on the screen.
I'll just put a copy and I'll show it to you.
After I click on it, I have to change to share, right?
This one.
I don't know if you can see this picture.
If you know Ph.D. Comics, it's actually a...
When you read the textbook, you can draw a picture like this.
I'll show you.
This is a pretty close ecology in the academic world.
When you finish writing the paper, you show it to the boss.
The boss will change it for you for the first, second, and sixth time.
Or later...
According to what he wrote, I don't know how many times.
49 times, right?
Okay.
This is actually something that happens quite often in the academic world.
Because everyone wants to adjust the quality of the paper to be very perfect.
After it's very perfect, it will be sent to the magazine
or find a way to try to publish it.
In this case, you can see that this student is in great pain.
The reason for the pain is actually...
There are several reasons.
The first one is that he changed it back and forth many times.
You can see that the file name is different every time.
Suppose you look at this Revision 8, Common File.
Do you know what the boss changed?
You probably can't tell.
You don't know what the boss did just by looking at the file name.
There's another one. You can look at the photo.
He also wrote a track change.
After you open the file, he might say,
Oh, what did he change in this file?
But if I want to compare this Revision 18 with Revision 2,
it should be quite difficult in this situation.
I'm actually using this comic as a motivation today.
We can use LaTeX to deal with this situation more effectively.
It won't be so painful to change the paper.
I'm going back to the original...
This is my story.
My report today is mainly focused on LaTeX.
I believe that everyone has a little background on LaTeX.
Someone calls it LaTeX.
I personally like to call it LaTeX.
Because the word LaTeX has another meaning.
It's actually a text layout system.
I will introduce a tool called TIKZ later.
It's actually a interface that can display images in LaTeX.
Finally, I mentioned what Beamer is.
It's mainly used to make videos.
Okay, then...
Okay, then I won't talk too much nonsense.
I'll just go straight into what LaTeX is.
LaTeX is actually the most primitive version.
It's called TeX.
It was actually designed and published by Professor Donald Knuth.
It's a layout system.
The so-called layout system means that
it designs the text you want to type
with a text file.
Then, through the layout system,
it can design the font size and distance of the text
and then prepare it into a final version of the file.
This is the so-called layout system.
The version of TeX is very interesting.
You can see it's a strange number.
There's actually a story behind it.
Professor Knuth was quite confident in the text he wrote.
So he felt that the text he wrote had very few bugs.
So if someone found a bug,
he would give a corresponding check as a reward.
Then when TeX was revised,
the number would be added,
but the way it was added was not the usual software,
which is to add 1 and add 2.
It's the number of decimal places after pi.
This is the current version.
The little story is that
if Knuth can't maintain it in the future,
the final version will be changed to pi.
So it's still a prime number.
Then it might become pi at some point.
This is the TeX system.
What we often use in LaTeX
is to add some additional instructions to TeX.
These instructions allow us to
efficiently arrange a file.
For example, in a academic document,
it usually has a title and author.
Then you may want to control the size of the page.
You have to add a password.
LaTeX will wrap these functions
into some very simple applications,
so you don't have to worry about
what the format of the title, author, and password is.
You just need to focus on what your content is.
If you have any questions,
please feel free to interrupt me at any time.
Let me ask you here.
You turned on your microphone,
that is, your speaker.
So if everyone is talking, you can hear it.
I'm not sure if you turned it on or not.
Oh, right.
Okay, that should be fine.
Oh, yes, I just muted it.
Okay, I'll move on to the next page.
I'm sure you all have experience with LaTeX.
I'll just quickly talk about it here.
LaTeX mainly inputs a text file
and then goes through some layout systems.
After going through the layout system,
you can output the final file.
Usually, the text file name is .tex.
After going through the layout system,
there are a lot of different options here.
I just mentioned .tex and LaTeX.
There are other different ones later.
They are used for different layout situations.
The final result of the layout
may be this kind of different file names.
The most common is to arrange the file into a PDF file.
This is the LaTeX system,
which is the most basic concept.
Okay, in the next page,
I'll briefly introduce
the basic structure of a LaTeX file.
I'd like to ask
if you think this is too simple.
You may think it's too simple.
If you all have experience.
No, no.
No?
So do I need to explain a little more?
Yes.
Okay.
I said no, no.
Does that mean you need to skip it?
I think it's just right.
That's it.
Let's talk about it quickly.
Okay, let's talk about it quickly.
A standard LaTeX file is probably...
First, it will have a command
called document class start.
Then the GuaHu part will specify
whether I want this file to be an article,
a report, or a book.
It will first define
the approximate size of this file.
Then usually after this document class,
there will be a part of the area
called use package.
That is to say, this file,
some of the commands it will need,
for example, more complicated math,
or some special font,
or some other functions,
such as if there is a hyperlink,
or some special color,
or drawing.
These enhanced functions
are usually introduced with this use package.
This is the second part of this file.
The next part is that
these commands will specify
what the title of this file is,
and then its author,
the author's name at the back,
and then the date of this file.
It's very simple to use.
You just type in this command
and change this part to say
what the title is,
what the author's name is,
and what the date is.
This part is usually called preamble.
The real file starts
with the beginning document,
the end document.
The latex command is
that most of the commands
are processed by the beginning and end.
The beginning means
that I am now at the beginning of a certain environment,
and the end is the end of this environment.
So from the 10th and 15th lines,
this means that
between the 10th and 15th lines,
I will describe the content of this file.
After defining the file,
we can see that the 11th line
is a command called makeTitle.
This command means that
based on the title author date I specified earlier,
I will make a corresponding
title shape.
The important part of this part is that
when you do this,
you don't have to worry at all
about how big the title font is,
how big the author font is,
or how much the date font should be.
This part of the latex
will help you
to arrange it according to the specified command.
So all you have to do is
focus on your content.
For the 12th to 14th lines,
I will simply show an example.
It can arrange some mathematical parameters.
Here I use a command called
beginAlign and endAlign
to insert a mathematical value
with a whole width.
This command will also add a
function number behind the function.
This is a very simple one.
Of course, there are a lot of commands behind it.
I don't want to mention so many time factors.
This is a standard example.
Next, I will show you that
if you are really interested in
making real latex files,
there are some that I have used,
and there are some editors
or some interfaces that I recommend.
There are usually two types of editors.
There is a type of editor
that I call Latex Specific.
This type of editor
will automatically
compile the compiled file
and sometimes compile the PDF
to the same interface.
So you can
click some quick buttons at the same time
and you can quickly see
the contents of the compiled file.
Then there are often used
text maker, text studio, textworks, etc.
I just had a discussion with the host
that there are some web page interfaces
such as Overleaf or ShareLatex.
These interfaces mean that
you don't need to install anything at all.
Your stuff is stored in the remote server.
As long as you open the web page, you can edit it.
You don't have to worry about
which editor to use to edit it.
It has done a good job of compatibility.
As long as you focus on the content of the file,
the format of the file
will automatically arrange it for you.
This is one type.
I call it Latex Specific.
There is another type.
I call it General.
Basically, as long as you can open the text file,
you can do this.
I often use things like
Vim, Emacs, etc.
I personally like to use Sublime Text.
You can also use Windows Notebook.
It depends on your preference.
As long as you can open the text file,
you can edit and save it.
As for the layout system,
if you use a single board Latex,
you need to install a larger system.
This system includes
the editing interface I mentioned earlier.
I often use things like
TechLive, MiKTX, or MacTek.
These are used separately.
TechLive can be used for Windows or Linux.
MiKTX is mainly used for Windows.
This is mainly used for Mac.
After editing,
you can choose
which PDF monitor you want.
There are many different choices.
This is mainly to give you an overview.
What are the most basic Latex tools?
How do we make a simple text file?
What is the content?
The first is the background.
Next, I will introduce the main focus of this talk.
I think everyone will be more interested in this.
But if you come to listen,
you should already have a good understanding of Latex.
So for this picture,
you might think it's acceptable.
The meaning of this picture is
Latex vs Word.
Horizontal represents the complexity of processing files.
Y-axis represents the time you need.
The meaning of this picture is
when your file is very small,
maybe only one page,
or one or two pages,
not much content,
maybe only text,
when it's simpler,
in this case, you can use Word
to make this file in a very short time.
But when your file is very large,
for example, you want to write a journal paper,
you want to write a book,
some problems will arise.
At present, I still don't know
how to use Microsoft Word
to effectively solve these problems.
But Latex has a corresponding method.
Here, I would like to say
that I will compare Word and Latex.
I personally use Latex more often,
so I might be a little biased.
I might think Latex is better.
The same function,
Word may also be able to achieve.
If you want to discuss with me,
please feel free to interrupt me.
The first point I want to discuss
is the difficulty of mathematical editing.
If you use Microsoft Word,
the tool you often use
may be called a square editor.
Some people may think that
the square editor is too ugly.
They will use tools like MathType.
These tools are mainly
used to edit the square editor with a mouse.
So you need to use a mouse
to click here and there
to select some up and down icons,
to select some root numbers,
some special mathematical symbols.
I don't say this is not good.
This is an input method.
But if you use Latex,
suppose you want to input the following symbol,
you can use Word at all.
You don't have to leave the keyboard.
Just input these symbols with the keyboard
and you can output the following mathematical equation.
You may think
how to convert this equation
to these strange symbols.
This actually depends on
your familiarity with Latex.
For example,
Begin and Align
means that I inserted a row of wide mathematical equations.
The input method
is actually quite similar to the way we read.
It's the same from left to right.
If I need a square,
I will enter a square.
If I need the initial a,
I will enter an a.
This command means
I want the initial a in mathematics.
It's very similar to the way
to input words in mathematics.
I need an initial u, initial c, initial v,
and then a right square.
This symbol means up and down,
and then up and down plus 1.
So this command
is not the final result,
but in terms of reading,
it's actually quite in line with people's reading habits.
It's the same from left to right.
Another advantage I use is
when Latex is in the array,
you can add blanks and arrays at will.
So you can put a very complex mathematical equation
with very effective arrays.
You can insert an array or a blank
to make it easier to read.
So like me,
this equation represents this part.
Then according to the following
different structures of this mathematical equation
to make a relative array.
So when you want to change the mathematical equation,
you can also easily go back
to the relative Latex part
to change its original code.
This is my personal experience.
The first advantage is that
the mathematical equation is very easy to input.
Let's pause for a moment.
Do you have any questions?
I want to...
I guess I should turn this on.
Then you can turn it on.
It's okay.
Then I'll just use your side to talk.
It's okay.
I want to share something with you.
It's a powerpoint plug-in.
It's called Iguana Text.
I'll post it in the chat room for everyone to see.
It's actually...
Because you mentioned that
the Microsoft equation is an editor.
It's actually very ugly.
So someone developed a powerpoint plug-in.
In fact, all the mathematical equations
are still using Latex code.
Basically, it's also
what the author shared on the screen.
It just happens to be a plug-in
that can be placed directly in your powerpoint.
So it's beautiful.
This Iguana Text
is a very, very advanced
Microsoft equation editor.
So I'll post it in the chat room
and share it with you.
Thank you for sharing.
Because I...
My computer is actually Linux.
So it's...
Iguana Text can't be installed at all.
It can be installed, but...
It's very painful.
It's very painful.
So I'm just...
I'm not familiar with this aspect of the plug-in.
Okay, so this is...
I personally think the first advantage is
to edit in a mathematical way.
Okay, what about the second part?
This is a personal experience
of sharing.
That is to say,
when you need to deal with
a very large file,
suppose you want to write a doctor's thesis,
and then suppose your research results
are very rich,
you write up to 500 pages.
Yes, write a 500-page doctor's thesis.
If you have Word experience,
that is, you open a 500-page Word file,
what will happen?
I haven't really opened it myself,
but I've heard people share their experience
that usually this situation is...
First of all, when you open the file,
it will be very, very slow
because it needs to scan all 500 pages.
Then next,
if you have some text blocks in the middle,
some blocks you pulled yourself,
it will be slower
because it needs to load these blocks.
Okay, but for our purpose,
these steps are not necessary.
We just need to change
a paragraph in our text.
So the focus of our focus
should be to pick this paragraph
and then modify it.
After that,
that is, to do this,
it should not need to be loaded
into other blocks.
If it's Word,
I don't know yet
how to avoid this problem.
Suppose you have a 500-page thesis.
If it's LaTeX,
it can use a...
It's a bit like writing a word.
Suppose you write a thesis,
you can use a file called
Thesis.txt for your thesis.
Under this file,
you separate the different content.
You may need to separate a file,
Introduction a file,
Topic 1 separate a file.
Under Topic 1,
you can have your own Introduction,
your own introduction,
your own translation.
That is to say,
you make your file
a system plan.
Distribute different content
into different files.
The advantage of this is that
if I want to change
Example 1 of Topic 1,
I just need to open this file
and make a relative modification.
I don't need to
load all the files.
This is the first advantage.
The second advantage is
if I want to see
the result of this part of the translation,
I can translate this
Thesis.txt file,
but I can put
these unnecessary ones,
such as
Example 1,
Introduction,
Topic 2,
Topic 3,
Conclusion,
I can just block it.
I have a simple version.
Thesis.txt only has
Example 1 in Topic 1.
I only do translation
for this file.
So I can see right away that
I changed this thing,
and it will look like this
in the real file.
So this can reach
a very large file,
we make it a system partition,
then we can edit
a small file,
and we can see
the result of the editing very quickly.
This is my personal opinion
the second advantage of LaTeX.
Next is
to continue to the next one.
The third advantage
is the compatibility problem.
If you often use
Microsoft Word,
you may still remember
about ten years ago
there was a
Dock version
to DockX version
a pain period.
Dock version is mainly
I think DockX version
is Office 2007
Word 2007 plus
about ten years ago.
Anyway,
there is this pain period.
Before that,
it was all DOC version.
Like this file format change
there will be some
some trouble.
Suppose you wrote a paper
twenty years ago,
you may now
the format will run out.
This thing,
especially in the academic world
it should not be allowed.
Suppose you have a picture
you run out
then your data will run out.
So it's very troublesome
to maintain anything.
Microsoft has such
DOC to DOCX
history.
So it's hard to guarantee
DOCX may be changed
to other formats.
It's hard to say.
So this is a
history of Word.
Another one is
even if you use the same file
you use DOCX.
If you use different versions of Word
it may run out a bit.
Maybe its line
or font will be a bit
not the same as your original edit.
Suppose some people don't have Word
they use Pages or LibreOffice
it may be different.
This is the same
in academic papers
a very disadvantageous phenomenon.
Another one is
you may use different computers
different operating systems
Windows, Mac.
This file
may not be able to run
in other operating systems.
If you use LaTeX
its editable file
is actually Word.
So Word
you can run a lot of things.
You can run a notebook
and Mac, Linux
all can be run.
The final file is PDF
almost every platform can support PDF.
There are a lot of software
you can use.
This is my
third advantage
from my experience.
The file format is Word
and there is no DOC, DOCX
or other problems.
Next I will
Is there any questions?
All right.
Next I will look at
one of my personal experiences.
Look at the picture on the left.
I will draw it roughly.
Suppose you have a paper
you are writing a journal paper.
This box represents
one of your pictures
it is Figure 1.
Then you are in the text
in the paragraph
you need to mention Figure 1.
Then in a certain place
you need to mention 20%
this number.
Then in another place
you need to mention
X equals 10
this message.
Then this 20%
and X equals 10
it may actually be
one of the Figure 1
some data points
the conclusion.
I use red here
means
red means
my experiment data.
The file is here
there is no problem
Word or LaTeX
can reach this function.
Now suppose there is a situation
suppose your boss is not satisfied with Figure 1
he is not satisfied with the parameters
he thinks you change the parameters
to see if these numbers
become more effective.
So in some cases
you may need
after you finish writing the paper
you need to update your data.
Maybe you need to run again
run to a new set of data.
In terms of updating
in concept
the red part
needs to be updated together.
Because you run a new result
your Figure content changes.
So this Figure 1
it
you may also
in the process of text editing
this Figure 1 becomes Figure 2.
So this
this
this
Figure 1 also needs to be relatively modified.
This number
needs to be modified
according to your experiment data.
If you use Word
you can think about
if you use Word
how to achieve this?
Maybe you just
run MATLAB again
generate another picture
and then
after the picture is generated
you put the picture back
back to Figure 1
put the picture back
then you have to remember
you need to change 20%
you may now become 15%
and now X may not be 12
X may become 12
So
a job
you need to change Figure 1
at the same time you have to pay attention
you have to change 20%
with X
all these things need to be changed.
When your file is complicated
this thing will appear
more times.
So if it appears
100 times
then you change 95
you have 5 forgotten to change.
Then your data is wrong.
Okay, then LaTeX has a solution
that is
first you can use
Label and Reference
to update
your Figure numbers.
If you use LaTeX
to write paper
this value should be used often.
This is my own
experience
that is
20% and X is 10
These two data points
are actually related to Figure 1.
So before you use LaTeX
you can
when you write MATLAB
you generate two text files at the same time
output 20% and X is 10
that is, the city directly input these two numbers
it is for two different files
when you write paper
you directly include these two files
right
so you
when you write a file
you have to pay attention
that is
what value
is related to what
then put all these things
together
then it is convenient to update
this is one of my
experience
because
I also studied for a while
then I found out that
LaTeX has this
quite convenient function
that
the last one I
this picture I
showed you before
that is
final.doc
that is
if you use Word
you will keep changing
and then
change the name
then you may track
do not know how
this can track
but it may be
very difficult to say
the difference is very far
version to track
that if LaTeX, then
first I have to state that
LaTeX itself
it does not provide
that is the file tracking function
it needs to add some other
software
then
I often use my own
software called GIT
that if you have written
that is
a relatively large software
project
project
GIT is actually a management
that is
a program code
version control system
it can control
that is to say
this program code
at what time
by which
program designer changed
what part of who changed
then
these changes
it will have a relative record
then
between different users
to do
these changes
record
it integrated
in the same project
so
this
GIT is actually
a pretty
I personally think
pretty great invention
because it can
like that
software engineering
some super big project
it can use
a lot of people together
that is
a lot of engineers
to do the same software
then it can ensure that
different engineers
will not change
other engineers
the result
so
that
this function
it actually
needs to use
LaTeX file
plus GIT
to achieve
that
I only simply list
a few keywords
if you use
GIT
this software
to monitor
that is
LaTeX file
file
change
text
you wait
to come up
and say
you can control
that is
your file
at what time
to change
what place
you
usually
commonly modified
that is
you add text
or delete text
then
right
then GIT
has a feature
that is
every time you modify
you can do
something like
change block
it can
send a simple report
that
in this version
which file was changed
then
you can do
very detailed
so
that
with this feature
you do not have to
that
change content
it forced
because
this is not easy
to read
that
use GIT
can also be
very easy to
reply to the changes
before
then
you can do
a lot of people
in this
cooperation
that
this is
my personal experience
that
finally show you
that
I mentioned
the first five
advantages
that
probably
the second
with
this
with this
second
and the fourth
is my personal experience
that
good
later if
we use more advanced
there are some other
features
like
we can
write a paper
in
is to use
reference
when
it can
automatically
help you
form a format
automatically
help you
arrange
that
you write
paper
you want to
change
that
good
that
this is mainly
that I
currently
include the
part of
that
you have any
questions
or want to
discuss
it
is very
welcome
that
I will
continue
good
that
next
I want to
discuss
a called
TIKZ
I'm sorry
I have a
small problem
that
you said
you can
output
a certain
or a certain
number
when
that
side I do not
understand
you say
I can
picture
picture, then
I can
understand
that I
output a
picture
and then
I just
reference
to that
picture
and then
feature
will not
change
but you
is to produce
a picture
you are using
tools like
MATLAB
or something like
that
you are using
RR
RR
good
that should
also be
the same
meaning
good
I mean
that
because
this is just
a reference
picture
if my
feature 1
is a
long
picture
I did not
draw
then this
20%
represents
that
the second
data point
is the first
data point
of 20%
it represents
this
question
and then
in the file
I
especially
use
a number
20%
to
represent
is
particularly
emphasize
this picture
of a
feature
like this
here
integrated
that is to say
when you output
this picture
this picture
has included
20%
of this information
in the
inside
Oh
right
that
good
so now if you want
to update data
you run
the experiment
20%
becomes 15%
in this picture
looks like
15%
but you
you become
you have to go back
to your paper
part of
the 20%
manually changed
to 15%
so
your
figure
is not a
that it actually
contains another
thing I do not know
what this
is called
because this
I have not used
but your
figure is not a
example of a
.eps
such a file
I
look at
my back
there is no
case
Oh
I
that
but I can
that I
take as an example
suppose
now this is
what I want
to be
good
then
he
he is
this strange
picture
and then
suppose
I wrote
later
when I
specifically
mentioned
that
this function
is the lowest
point
is the lowest
point
0.2
I
that
now
suppose you
teach
you to run
another picture
this function
of the picture
that you become
you later
in that
article
when you
do not
0.2
this place
you have to
follow your
picture
to do
relative
modification
that
OK
?
I guess
I guess
his question
should be
that
I will mention
the next section
I personally
prefer to
use
latex
to
draw
that
of course
I know a lot of users
will save
EPS
right
that I just
mentioned the
problem is
that he
is with you
picture
is not
directly
related
so
should be
said
if you are
in the
picture
this
can achieve
this thing
but I
want to mention
that
latex
can also
do
control
these
things
that
I
want to
say
this page
is that
you
file
some
part of
the data
with
some other
other
other
part of
the data
they are
related to each other
that if
you
are writing
files after
you did not
put this thing
into consideration
that you have to
manually update
figure 1
manually update
this 20%
and manually
update this
three parts
because you
write files
when you did not
pay attention
to you
is to write
separately
when you
update
you become
because you
know that the
red part
is actually
these data
points these
values are
related to each
other
so if you
have this
concept, then
you can
put
figure 1
these
or these
values
are output
into three
different files
figure 1
maybe you
figure 1.
EPS
is a file
and then this
20%
you may
output
a data
1.
TXT
and then
this place
you may output
a data
2.
TXT
and then this
data 1 and
data 2
you have to
use your
MATLAB
or R to
generate
when you
are drawing
a good calculation
at the same time
you put
20%
and 10%
it out
output
into two
TXT
EPS
and then you
input data
1.
TXT
and data
2.
TXT
so
this is
ok
I know
this is
a personal
use
I think this
is very practical
and if you
want to change
a lot of things
at once
you have to
remember this
thing
I
wrap up
a little bit
now this
20%
but
when I do
figure 1
I do
another thing
called
data 1
equals
20
measure
right
thank you
ok
this is mainly
practical
and
this
doesn't seem
to have a book
talking about
this
this is
more of a
writing habit
here
to remind
the distance
is
time
I
will
talk about
TIKZ
and
Beamer
TIKZ
is a
language
that can
draw a
picture
and
it can
directly
do the
drawing
in
Lighttime
and
I
personally
like it
because
this is a
basic introduction
so I
jump to
some basic
things
that
I
just
mentioned
is the
EPS file
so I
think you
have some
basic
knowledge
of the
file
basically
a
file
can be
classified
as a
quantity
file
or
a
dot
file
a
quantity
file
different
lines
different shapes
different words
and their
color they
are stored
information
so when you
enlarge the
picture
when it
can be
based on
these
shapes
colors
to do
the same
proportion
so you
will not see
these
sentence
phenomenon
that
dot
picture
means that
that
special
academic report
academic research
it
actually
quantity picture
is a better
choice
because
back to the
beginning
is that you
have to do
academic report
you have to
say that
the precise
and concise
is that
you describe
things to be
precise
like this
is not
acceptable
like this
is not
acceptable
for
this
setting
you may
standard
Latex may
be less used
because most of the
blocks may still
Matloft
paste well
output into
EPS
and then add
in
that
TIKZ
this
reading kit
it is
such
a process
it
is called
a begin
and then
TIKZ
this
way is
it draws a
point it
designated
coordinates
such as
the
seventh line of
this instruction
means that
I start
at the
coordinates
negative
0.50
has been drawn
to 0.50
so I
have drawn
this line
and then
this bar
arrow
means that
I want to draw
a line
and then the
arrow is
the second
this instruction
means that
I'm at
1.50
this coordinate
I want to put
a node
and then the
node content is
X
so I have
a X
here
and then
this node
is to
the right
of this
coordinate
node
is to
put a
text
instruction
and then
the middle
number can
specify that
I want to ask
your arrow
symbol is
which line
is the first line
of the middle number
right
so your arrow
is this
is drawn
is
a
so
the seventh line
is only to draw
arrow
that the eighth line
is to draw
X
that
nine and ten
this line
is that it can
combine the
instruction
I can draw
arrow
while drawing
text
this means that
from 0.5 to
0.5
draw a
arrow
after
I put a
node
and this node
is in
this
0.5
above
I want to draw
a Y
right
so I can draw
X axis
and Y axis
and then
some other
people like to say
I can draw
a rectangle
rectangle
is to say
I specify
four
four points
I draw
from this
negative one
negative one
this point
to positive one
this is
two relative
points and then
I want to draw a
rectangle
and then this
instruction means that
I want to draw a
circle
and then this
0.0 is the
circle
and then the
radius is
one
and then
green means
that I want to
draw it
in green
that 14-16
instruction means
that I want to
draw it
in green
and then
it is
this
curve
right
big and
dash
it means
a rough curve
and then
these things
mean
the point
so I
specify some
points
that
point
here
I use
a cartoon to
represent
cartoon
means
that
the front
is the
point
so I
use
degree to
represent
and then the
second point
is the
radius
so I
equal to
90
equal to
this point
start
and then draw
a line
to the
angle is
210
and then draw
the angle
is 330
and then this
cycle is
back to
the original
point
so I have
to mention
here is that
you use this
set of tools
you can be very
precise to draw
the picture
you want
because of
these numbers
you can see
it is
this circle
it with this
square is
cut
you can imagine
if you draw
this picture
with PowerPoint
you can draw
that square
and circle
cut
may be
you need to adjust
quite a long
should be able to draw
but to adjust
quite a long
because you specify
this axis
you can also
ensure that
this triangle
is the inner
circle
and you can be sure
that this point
on the circle
so
simply put
I want to say
that you use
this set of
TIKZ
is very
precise drawing
you can draw
the picture
very precisely
so
this comparison
I skip
because of
time
so
next I will
introduce
called
PGF
PLOT
it is actually
based on
TIKZ
a set of
drawing
package
yes
it is
mainly
it can draw
like this
picture
and it
has a very good
compatibility
with
LaTeX
and
it
is also
I thought
it
because it is
text
so you can
simply say
you draw a picture
you can
ensure that
I changed the picture
where
this may
use
Office
autofocus may be
quite difficult
because
like you
to adjust the position
you just adjust a pixel
you may be in
Word
is more difficult to see
the change
but if you use
the text
you use this
TIKZ
to track the
words you can
see the
change in
this
because of time
so I'll show you
a simple
example
is good
this is also my
experience
here
if you want to
draw a picture
and paste it
into the paper
usually
the workflow is
I first use
Meta
or Python
or
suppose to
write a
script
after writing it
out of the
corresponding
picture
and then save it
as a
.
After saving the
picture file
you put the
picture file
into the
file
so it's
like this
this picture
actually has
some problems
if you are
large enough
it has some
problems
the first
problem is
that these
words are too
small
but the
size of the
words
depends on
the ratio of
your picture
if you put
the picture
into the
picture file
some words
look fine
but if you
put it
too large
the words
look too
small
so it's
not easy
to read
this also
tells us that
the size of the
words
is related
to the
file
so
controlling
the
size of
the
words
should be
handled
in
a
systematic
way
the second
problem is
that
for some people
it's
too
systematic
so
it should
be handled
in a
systematic way
because it
depends on
the
ratio of
the
word
and
the
ratio
of
the
picture
and
the
word
so
if you
use
the
original
workflow
you
have to
manually
input
the
word
and
manually
input
the
word
and
manually
input
the
word
and
manually
input
the
word
and
manually
input
the
word
and
manually
input
the
word
and
manually
input
the
word
and
finally
your
application
file
and
you
need to
decipher
that
word
and
eventually
you
need to
decipher
that
word
and
eventually
you need to
decipher
the
word
and
encode
that
word
and
use
decrease
the
word
and
字
ok
you need to adjust the size of the image
and the font
of course you need to adjust the
initialization of the line
this is
you need to make relative adjustments
according to your file
ok
this
I personally recommend this workflow
because when you want to run another image
you just need to change the raw data
you run it again
you don't need to change the image
you just need to change the raw data
so this data will
be like running another image
you don't need to worry about the size of the word
or the group of the equation
or anything else
ok
this is my recommended workflow
so this is my personal experience
ok
10 minutes left
ok
I don't have much left
ok
for binger
ok
I will talk about binger
binger
is actually
based on LaTeX
it is a system that can be used for projection
like this image
is made by binger
binger
I personally think the advantage is that
it has some
pre-defined themes and colors
and these themes and colors
are very suitable for academic reports
academic speeches
and
these files
are all PDF files
so compatibility is not a problem
and of course it also has some other advantages
and these advantages are mainly
overlap with LaTeX and TRKG
ok, next I want to show you
an example
let me show you this image
like this
let me play it again
ok
I may choose the wrong window
because I seem to have two windows
this one?
this one?
yes
oh, this one, I know this one
oh, this one, yes
this is
binger
has built-in format
and
there are different names
such as
Ann Arbor
or something
there are a lot of names
this means that
if you go to the projection
to configure its
shape
so you can see that
some projection
it will have some
footnotes
and
some footnotes
may be on the left and right
so it can choose
binger's theme
and this theme
will control the configuration of the projection
after choosing the theme
you can choose
binger's color
what kind of color I want to use
like this
like this may be
red
red
and maybe
some are yellow
some are gray
and so on
so
binger has
a lot of choices
to do
ok
this is
to show you
binger has some
themes and colors
ok
if you want to use binger
to make a projection
actually
this page
the corresponding code is very simple
these lines
if you want to produce a binger code
you just
produce a binger slide
you just use
begin friend
end friend
to deal with it
and put a
big quotation mark
put the binger you want to put in the middle
put the title you want to put in the middle
and in the middle
you just need to focus on
what your content is
so like my front page
I mainly put this
prince
put a prince
like this
so
like this
uh
uh
like this header
or that
footer
I don't have to worry
binger will automatically
fill these in for you
and
this information
is actually
a professional projection
because the audience
must know
who you are
what page you are in
what is the topic you want to report
ok
then I will skip it quickly
then
here are some details of binger
it has some built-in
like a block
you can choose
and you can also make
many different columns
because of the time factor
I skipped
binger can do the same
is to
change pages
some effects
like this
same
same video
I can control
in the first page
I want to appear
some words
in the second page
appear other words
third
then in another page
appear other words
like this
that means
in the first page
to the last page
I have to appear
this
on-site 1 to end
this line
and then
I jump to the next page
this is the result of the second page
the second page
it will appear
on-site 2
then
at the same time
on-site 2 and 3
right
that
if I jump to the next page
when the third page
it should
appear
this
because
I have to appear
on-site 1 to the last page
then
this page
middle
this should disappear
so it will become
this
right
binger
it can also do
some
here
is
it used
many different
videos
to do
similar animation
effect
but
animation
here
is not as good
as
powerpoint
powerpoint
can also
binger animation
is relatively
simple
I think it is relatively simple
but
if we want to do
academic reports
in fact, I think
this is a good thing
when the mosquitoes
jump around
in fact, your
your readers
will be a little
confused
like this
right
good
that
this is mainly
I briefly introduce
binger
that
time factor
I quickly
show some
of my own
presentation
like this
this is a
poster
and this is
made with
LaTeX
and TI-KZ
and
its original file
is actually very large
seems to be
its width
seems to be
64 inches
and
the length
seems to be
more than 30 inches
and
because of
its
so I just
output a
pdf file
that
during the
production process
I directly
pdf file
it
so
the resolution
is very
very high
so
this is actually
a poster
right
that
that
what kind of
restrictions
are all
drawn with
TI-KZ
very
spectacular
very spectacular
right
that
can be drawn
right
so
so
some people say
LaTeX
is very
plain
it is
very
simple
right
right
so
the application
is very
simple
it is
so
just
the
first
the
picture
is
in
text
and
the
image
is
in
text
and
the
picture
is
in
text
and
the
speech
is
I
la
there
and
that
the
eye
and
the
teeth
the
image
are
in
text
and
the
speech
and
the
text
and
text
and
the
speech
are
in
text
and
speech
are
in
text
and
speech
are
in
text
dialect
the
text
are
in
text
dialect
and
speech
are
in
text
dialect

我想
那我想

現在就我們三個人
因為現在就我們三個人
那現在就我們三個人
那這樣子
Oscar你有什麼問題嗎
Oscar你有什麼問題嗎
有
就是那個
就是那個
就是那個
就是
就是
就是
就是
就是
就是
就是
就是
就是
就是
所以我想我
所以我想我的問題是
所以我想我的問題是
就是
就是
那麼花多久的時間
譬如假設你要做出
你今天這個style就好了
大概花了多久的時間
製作出這個東西
或者說你的learning curve是多陡
好
我誠實回答
我誠實回答
就這一整期的影片
就這一整期的影片
我大概
厲害
認真做
因為我之前
就有什麼慢些少增多增
那認真的做只是
人生畢業
那我大概花了三到四天吧
對
那當然有一些投影片是那種
像這一頁投影片我是
我是就直接做
所以我就是那個code
直接複製過來這樣
然後對
有一些是現成的
那
多陡的話我覺得
我可以跟你分享一下我的經驗
就是我
第一次用Latex的話
大概是
我十二年前
我第一次用Latex
那
當時是好像有
有一個作業要
打那個就是解答吧
打Solution
然後他就是請我們用Latex
來打這樣
那當時我算是第一次
接觸Latex然後當時我會的功能
就是把字打出來
把方程式打出來
大概就這樣
然後連
可能還有基本的reference
就是說
方程式1
文件裡面引用方程式1
方程式1這樣
那插入圖片其實那個時候還不太會
所以我大概十二年前
大概就是文字打出來的程度
大概我想一下
大概我
我八年前就是
我有一群朋友就說我們就是有分組報告
就說大家
幾個朋友就說那我們都
要不要都用Latex來打這樣
當時就是強迫自己
因為有通財壓力
所以就是
某一門課的所有報告
都用Latex打
那當時我自己的經驗就是
可以把文字打出來
可以把方程式打出來
那還會插入一些圖這樣
那可是圖還是
簡單的就是
當時還是用PNG的圖
對然後就是插入圖
OK那之後就是我上
授班之後呢
我就想說
聽說這個東西對
寫Paper很有用那是不是要認真
學一下這樣
我當時授班的時候就是我假設
如果有書面報告就會
盡量就是
把它整理成用Latex
把它整理成一份文件
然後
把一些圖片啊或者是
重要的方程式推導過程
把它打成一份Latex文件
然後
在那個之後我才
還會比較多其他功能就是什麼插入
除了插入圖片之外
可能還會
把圖片做裁剪
或者是插入表格表格
裡面再插入圖片
對就是我覺得
Learning curve是
根據你手頭上的project
去決定的
如果你手頭上的project就是只要
把字打出來的話那其實
沒有到非常的困難
你大概只要知道你
怎麼把數學方式打出來
Latex就會排
排出一個還
OK的文件給你看這樣
那如果你後面要進行更多的調整的話
你就必須要去學一些
其實我蠻多資訊都是Google來的
就是如果你
可以把你的問題
用英文描述去Google
通常會找到答案
有時候會有些線
你直接複製貼上
好我不知道
這樣可能回答有點太長
反正簡短的回答就是說
我花蠻多時間的
我博班也是
都在處理
Latex這些格式
做投影片之類的
所以花時間
然後
取決於你手上的project
那我個人是覺得做出這些結果
還蠻有成就感的
對
不知道這樣有沒有回答到很多問題
對
那這樣說好了就是說如果你有想要
做出什麼
畫面的話
你也可以跟我討論這樣
對
因為有時候是
我想要做出某個畫面可是我不知道
對你的指令是什麼
或是說我不知道要怎麼做出
這個
舉例來說像我聽到這一頁
假設我要做出這個結果
PowerPoint可能就很簡單
我就是拉三個文字方塊
然後字放進去
那如果是beamer的話你可能
必須要知道下面這些指令這樣
可是這種東西就是說
你知道之後你以後就記得了
然後使用起來就是會
就是你看到這個圖
你就知道OK
所以我就必須要放這些指令才會出現這個結果
所以這個有時候也是
取決於你的
有沒有遇到這個問題
然後熟悉度怎麼樣這樣
當然就是
有任何問題歡迎跟我討論
對
感謝
不客氣不客氣
很高興有人可以
討論
比如說就像大概你的12年前
我可以做出一個Document
然後裡面有一些方程式
插幾個圖就插幾個EPS圖
我還沒有辦法像你剛剛講的
做出那個
就有raw data跟
bigger style的那個東西
這個我主要是個人使用經驗
那
我覺得你加EPS
有它的方便性
因為你的圖就是EPS嘛
直接插入
你只要稍微調一下它的大小就可以了
那這個有它的方便性在
我一剛開始也都是這樣做的
那
就是我
有點是
做越多事情我會發現就是
每個工具都有
它的各自一些限制
那
所以我目前是用這樣的workflow
對
如果初學者我還是還蠻建議
就是直接用EPS把圖放進去
這樣方便
可是這樣就會被嫌棄說那個
像你剛剛講的
字太小
這件事情我被嫌了大概100遍
好這個我也可以稍微
做經驗分享
我在換這個workflow之前呢
我有
另外一個就是workflow假設
這個是1這是2.0
我有一個1.5workflow
就是
存檔的時候不要直接存EPS
你像MATLAB可以存
FIG檔
我不知道RR可不可以
就是某一種文
某一種圖檔
它是可以再被載入
然後再重新調格式的
像說如果是MATLAB的話它有一個檔案叫做
FIG檔
然後這個檔案呢你可以
再被MATLAB載入之後
它跟MATLAB產生圖是
完全一樣的
就它會把這些
格式啊字啊全部都是
儲存起來存到那個FIG檔
裡面
那所以我的workflow
1.5就是
除了存PNG
EPS之外我還會存一個FIG檔
然後
1.5的workflow就是說
假設字太小我就打開FIG檔
調這個字的大小
再存成一次EPS
對
那這個算是
workflow 1.5啦
那勉強可以啦
你就看這個字太小
那我就是再開一次再調一次
再存一次
是可以
對
如果是R的話
可能要再
應該是有個相對應的格式它可以存成
就是最原始
就是可編輯的
可能要找一下是哪一個格式
對
我就要研究一下
這個好處就是說
你不用你程式不用再重跑啦
因為你的圖是
就是可編輯的圖已經是
存好了
對
這算是使用經驗
那初學者還是
EPS我還蠻建議的
就是方便而且又是像量圖
嗯
好
那
請問還有什麼問題嗎
目前好像還好
就是總之就是
就是多練習嘛
對其實就是取決於說
你
你用data做了多少
事情就是
當你做越多的報告你就會遇到
越多的
小地方需要克服這樣
對那
當你都克服之後你就
這東西就會變成是你的這樣
那當然你
如果想要跟我討論我也
非常歡迎我也會把
相對應的code
就是把一些code給
大家看這樣讓大家知道
這是怎麼做的
對
我覺得Latex Community它還蠻
都還蠻和善的啦
你去Google它都可以找到code
那我很多code也都是拼湊的
來的
對
所以我覺得
我覺得重點是要
要有人一起討論啦如果有人一起討論的話
就是可能有大家不同的做法
對
好謝謝
現在大家問題好像都差不多了
那我想請問俊霖有特別想要再
補充嗎
跟大家講一兩句話就是給所有
想學Latex的人
因為我想之後等你講完這段小節
我就把錄影就關了
OK
好了
我覺得Latex還是取決於
你的
你想要做什麼文件
像這張圖
如果你只是要很簡單的
做個research note的話
又無所謂的
可是當你的文件
複雜度越來越高的時候
當你要寫論文寫書的時候
Latex我
私心推薦啦
當然一剛開始學習
門檻是比較高的
可是如果有相對應的機會去練習
嘗試把自己的報告用Latex
去做的話
我相信大家也都會
上升
大家都可以發paper
好那就這我這集的小節
謝謝講者
那這樣我就先把錄影就關起來了
