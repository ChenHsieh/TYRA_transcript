00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are approaching the end of the year, so we may not have a speech next week.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Yang Yaolun to tell us about his doctoral research.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is now a doctoral candidate for the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In fact, he is about to graduate.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When he was in college, he graduated from the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin, and then came to the United States to study astronomy.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
His specialties and research interests include early-phase star formation, including observations and simulations.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In his doctoral research career, he has used various telescopes such as Herschel, ALMA, and SOFIA to do his research.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What is interesting is that he is also the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What kind of event is this?

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They will regularly give speeches to the public on astronomy at the bar.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They have now grown to more than 250 people attending each time.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Today, he will talk about the topic of the birth of solar-like stars and the inseparable entanglement of dynamics and chemistry.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's welcome Dr. Yang Yaolun to give a speech.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have been involved in this project for a long time.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Over the past few years, I have been doing research on star formation at UT Austin.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am a 6th-year PhD student at UT Austin.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My main advisor is Neil Evans.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We mainly do various observations on star formation.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We use models to explain the physical and chemical phenomena observed in early star formation.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Dr. Yang mentioned SOFIA observations.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is SOFIA?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observations for Infrared Astronomy.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is an astronomical observatory for infrared.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why do we use SOFIA for infrared observation?

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Because there are a lot of water vapors in the atmosphere.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
These water vapors emit a lot of infrared rays.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When we observe on the ground, we only observe the water vapors on the earth.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, many times, we use a telescope, such as Spitzer or Hubble, to observe infrared rays.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If I remember correctly, we can avoid 95% to 99% of water vapors by using a telescope.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is SOFIA.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can see that SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can see that there is a bulge in the middle section of the tail of the plane.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It is not very clear here.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It is a hole in the middle section.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A 2.7-meter telescope is placed in the hole.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When the telescope flies up, the door will open.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is how it is observed.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Astronomers and technicians discuss how to make the observation easier to achieve and adjust the strategy in time.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is how my advisor and I are going to get on the plane.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It is very different.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a military airport.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When you enter the airport, you will go up the stairs.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There is a B-2 bomber in the same airport.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is the inside of SOFIA.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The blue part is the instrument.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The other side of the closed cabin is the telescope.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The other side of the telescope is the mirror.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The other side is the instrument.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is a balance on the weight on both sides.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Different instruments, telescopes, and mission operators monitor the observation on these stations.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is a very complicated task.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
NASA considers every flight of SOFIA as a mission.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There is a mission director.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There is a mission briefing before departure.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the route we flew that day.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We flew from Palmdale, California, about an hour and a half north of LA.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can see that the route is very strange.

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Basically, the route is determined by each arc.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One arc is for a target.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here we have six or seven targets.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The longer, the longer you stay on the celestial body.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's move on to today's topic.

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Today's topic is mainly about star formation.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How do we understand the dynamics of early planetary orbits and the corresponding chemical changes?

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is a picture of our galaxy.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can see a lot of these black irregularities in the middle.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is what we call Darkland.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It has a lot of dust.

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It is also a higher density place.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It is also an area where stars are forming.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If we zoom in to one of them, the Molecular Cloud,

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It is mainly a star-forming place.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
These black areas are also the so-called dust gathering areas.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It is a place where stars form early.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If we switch to infrared light,

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can see that there are a lot of these pillars or even what we call filamentary structures.

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
These are from what we imagine as a celestial sphere on Earth.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's like a sphere in the sky, but it's not a ball or even a block here.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's more like a texture or a filamentary structure.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then through these filaments,

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then pull to the middle and then reach a high enough density.

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then trigger the activity of this star formation.

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is when the star formation occurs.

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You will have a lot of.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Basically, the density will be from 10 to 3 or 10 to 5.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is the mole per cubic centimeter.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It will be quickly multiplied by 10 to the power of 9 to the power of 10 to the power of 4.

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is a very large number of changes.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In the process, if you have, um.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
At the beginning, um.

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When the collapse, um.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're going to have a little bit of, uh.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The angular momentum is in the outermost part.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you have this smaller angular momentum, it's in a very small area.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At this time, the degree of rotation is likely to make this.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The collapse of the star formation is not very effective.

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That is to say, your, uh.

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The gas becomes itself to rotate there, not to continue.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Continue, uh.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's sucked into the middle of the star.

108
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In the process, there will be a lot of.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We call outflow, and then go.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Go to these, um.

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The high-speed rotation of the matter is released.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then go in to reduce.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The angular momentum of the whole system.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You see the green ones here.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The matter that looks like a jet is the outflow.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, this is a simulation.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That is, um, a simulation.

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Roughly describe that we are from a filament.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And then slowly, uh, develop into.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It will start with a filament, and then zoom in.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then you'll see a star.

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The early shape of the star.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The situation is a lot of molecules.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Very, very fatal molecules.

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How to be in that state.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And then, um.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Collapse and then erupt.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's what you saw in the picture just now.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This kind of outflow.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
OK, so you can see this whole process.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is very, very.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Very big change, and then, um.

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Irregular structure.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We also found in observation.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's what it is.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can see here, this one.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The picture behind this black and white picture is.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Uh, the distribution of molecules.

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is.

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then the different symbols in front of it.

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It means that we are directly observed.

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Early star.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Uh, where it appears.

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can see most of it.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Early stars are in, um.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
These molecules.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Uh, it's also a more fatal place, so it's produced.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, um.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We can probably get one of these.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Uh, scenario is to say that you first have a lot of very fatal clouds and dust.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then through.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Um, these clouds and dust may slowly or even quickly.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Um.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It will collapse to the middle and then become.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Uh, a star or a few stars, I don't know.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So in this process, a very important thing is to say.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, this is probably a very simple one.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Uh, cartoon pattern to express the words is that we have a, uh, a core at the beginning.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We call pre-stereo core.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Simply put, it's the core before the stellar.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So it's called pre-stereo core.

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And then you start to collapse.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
These core collapse to the middle and become, uh.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Uh, in the early days, it was called pro-star.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So we called this core pro-stereo core.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
At the same time, it may, uh.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Um.

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It produces a lot of, uh, these.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
These flow, this orange side is called the flow.

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What about the evolution?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
These substances.

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The surrounding matter is either sucked into the middle and becomes a part of the star.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It will be affected by a lot of feedback.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And then it just.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just slowly, uh, dissipated.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then the rest of you are left with a disk.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because.

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There's still a lot of matter, um, in the middle.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The middle part of the high-speed rotation.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no way it's very direct.

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's sucked into the middle, uh, on the planet.

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So there's a disk.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What about this side?

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This disk is, um, planet.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's where the stars are produced.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So gradually, this disk will slowly evolve into, uh.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Generally, we recognize the planter system.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just like.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Our solar system, we may be somewhere here.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay, um.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So we, uh.

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There's a pretty important one.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Uh, the question is, is this.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In the early days of this info, from this.

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When you want to produce a pro star.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Uh, it's like a process like this.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How much is his time scale?

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay, um.

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In the pre-status evolution, it's not quite certain now.

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So basically.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Um.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If a core starts to collapse.

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
To become.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Um.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's about.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
2 million years.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Relatively short.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
From disk to disk, it's about 10 million years.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So then a, like our sun, our sun can probably live.

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
10 million years.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So this is probably their, maybe 1% of the time.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
1% of the time.

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then I have another question.

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh, that's it.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How do you say this?

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Such a process.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
With the limit, for example, is Modern Universe.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Or, for example, Z3, Z5.

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Or something like that.

225
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or these things will only happen in the near future.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So there is no difference.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm going to ask you to go in.

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, it's actually happening, but it's also happening in the early days.

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There are even a lot of active research areas that are doing so-called first star, which is the first star that starts the earliest.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The biggest difference is in.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Uh.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's in the cold, it's.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Um.

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This core, a dance core, he wants to collapse, he doesn't need.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Uh.

236
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It doesn't have to be dynamic.

237
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If he is.

238
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Uh.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The temperature is very high, he is very, his thermal motion is very strong, so he.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
His thermal pressure, he can easily be greater than this gravity to him.

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This middle attraction, so.

242
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Um, when the temperature is very high, it is not easy to collapse.

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So he has to be cold enough for him to collapse.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Of course, in the early universe.

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Um, I should say, um.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So how do you make this core cold?

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Usually a very important mechanism is called, uh, radio cooling.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Basically, uh.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Your energy, uh, is absorbed by molecules, and then molecules, molecules, decay, connect, decay, and then turn into radiation, radiation, and then your energy leaves this system.

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So you, you will slowly become cold.

251
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That molecule or.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um.

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's more, except for hydrogen and hydrogen, all of them are quite useful for cooling.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's relative to the early universe.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You will be weaker.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So, in the early universe, everyone will think that you can become very, you can become very big.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then, and then it's easy to form a super big quality, etc.

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And so on.

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I believe that we haven't observed anything yet, but there should be a lot of simulation to do this part.

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay, thank you.

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay, so, um.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So, from an observational point of view, we want to know, uh, how does this collapse happen?

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What kind of mold does this material go through?

264
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
From the outside of this core to the area that is transferred to the inside.

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So, like, in this simulation, it's simulating.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How does this core collapse?

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And then, in the end.

268
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You can see that this middle collapse is very, very short at the beginning.

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Compared to the time point after that.

270
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So, uh, you can see that this is the same as the previous one.

271
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can see that it is very irregular.

272
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And so it means that there may be a lot of structures in it.

273
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Different structures, different modes.

274
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Depending on the angle you look at, there may be an outflow.

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Other places may see info.

276
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So, um.

277
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
For this info measurement, we mainly want to know how this info started.

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And then how did he do it?

279
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
For example, how far is he?

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How big is it?

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What kind of size scale starts?

282
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What kind of characteristic?

283
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
For example, how big does this core need to grow at what temperature?

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He will start to have info.

285
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So what's his process?

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's with, uh.

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh, the radius is getting smaller and smaller.

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How fast is it increasing?

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Or even not increasing, so the radius is getting smaller and smaller.

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It may be slower or faster inside.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So how did he evolve in the end?

292
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It becomes the inside.

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This rotation dominates the region.

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's like saying, uh, this disk, the early disk.

295
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A region like that.

296
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How did he go from the original radio info motion to the rotation?

297
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, uh.

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Through this view, we want to know what the model of this info is.

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We have a way to write a very good model.

300
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
To simulate this part.

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And then there's this chemical change.

302
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How to change with this info?

303
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll talk a little bit more about this later.

304
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So now I'm going to mention it.

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then in a bigger structure.

306
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Uh, this info is actually for our so-called initial mass function.

307
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Very important.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is the initial mass function?

309
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a bit like saying.

310
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Uh, we're going to build a galaxy now.

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Build a star.

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The star of different quality, how much is the ratio?

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So it's called initial mass function, and it's less likely to be large.

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Small quality stars are more that this one.

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Uh.

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Mass distribution is the initial mass function.

317
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Uh.

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But these initial mass functions are mainly referring to the stars that have already been generated.

319
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So we're in the early days.

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In the morning, we really want to know, OK.

321
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If we have all of these, big, big, small, small, different sizes of core,

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What kind of traces will these cores become?

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The core mass distribution between them and the initial mass distribution and the star mass distribution.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Uh, what's the change?

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So we hope to get to know this model in the future.

326
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Can be.

327
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are some hints that say, OK, if we have a core, it may be a solar quality.

328
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That may be how much of it will become, uh.

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
How much of the middle star will be 3?

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So, do we hope that we can use this model to do this research?

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Go to approach the problem.

332
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How do we go from this blue core mass function to this dash line, all kinds of different dash lines?

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Uh, initial mass function.

334
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The other thing is that we're in the early days.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Uh, these are a lot of binary systems.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And in the general, uh, already formed, we know, uh.

337
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Most of the stars are binary, that is, uh, double stars or more.

338
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Uh, multiple system.

339
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So we saw that in the early days.

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So you want to know how this early star is how to form this kind of binary system.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So what's the impact of this binary system on this info?

342
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Or what kind of criteria do you want to reach?

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What kind of threshold will trigger this kind of fragmentation?

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Fragment into different two or three or more sources.

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So we want to know.

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Uh, this initial condition, what is it?

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
How big is it?

348
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
How much is its quality?

349
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So I hope we can get to know how much.

350
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How much mass will be in the middle?

351
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How much will be in the middle?

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay, so this is another one.

353
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This is a very neat system.

354
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It has three, three, three stars in the middle.

355
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And then you look at the structure.

356
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So we still don't know why it's like this.

357
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay, the other part is.

358
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hey, we're like this, this MWC480, this, this disk.

359
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You see a lot of this kind of structure.

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Very neat structure.

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But we also see a lot of different, uh, more complex molecules.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like this CH3N or this is different.

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Um.

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Uh, more large-molecule organic compounds.

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So, uh, we were in the early, uh.

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The core stage also saw a lot of these, uh, organic compounds.

367
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So these.

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Organic compounds, because organic compounds, ultimately, they will become.

369
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It will enter the interstitial atmosphere, and then it may be.

370
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Trigger, uh.

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The main part of the life cycle, because these organic compounds are.

372
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Maybe it's just.

373
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In addition to speaking more broadly, it may be.

374
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Even the first step of life, or even the seed of life.

375
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So we want to know that in the early star evolution process.

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
How do these chemistries change with the information?

377
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Um, the same, I'm going to do a lot of explanation in the back.

378
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay, so our goal is to find out how this information happened.

379
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Then we are in our current method.

380
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We are, uh, want to measure, uh, through the distribution of molecules to measure, uh.

381
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Uh, the performance of, uh.

382
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Kinematic structure is simply through.

383
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Its distribution of, uh.

384
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
To analyze that in the end, his, uh, we look at this.

385
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The path of the movement of the gas inside.

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What does it look like?

387
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Here, if we look at it from this antenna,

388
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is a very simplified one on the left.

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Um, the look of the core info.

390
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
One of the more common models is the middle.

391
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Info's velocity is higher, and the outside info's velocity is lower.

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So you can simplify this thing to the right.

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
This picture is like this.

394
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Uh, the red one is, um.

395
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Uh, the red one is, um.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This, uh, the red one is, um.

397
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We've seen the path.

398
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Because he has this radio motion, so you can.

399
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Um, you can draw a circle like this.

400
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
A trace, and then they, um.

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The line of sight above the two points is the same.

402
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It means that you will have two, you will have two groups of gas.

403
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then they, for you, his, uh.

404
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What is it called?

405
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The speed is the same.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But they are in different places.

407
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Uh, this will cause, uh.

408
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
He will look like he's on the left.

409
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A profile like this.

410
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Um, yeah, that's about it.

411
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And then, and then the middle of this, this is the dip.

412
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's just, it's just, it's from the outside.

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Um, gas in your, maybe it's a cold gas.

414
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a strong radiation that comes in behind the absorption.

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because you're cold in front of you, so you're more likely to be excited.

416
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Then you will be absorbed by this cold material.

417
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So you see a dip.

418
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Um, if you have a higher resolution.

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You can see, uh, like this.

420
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's like this, if this purple, this.

421
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Shady area refers to our telescope beam.

422
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Uh, you can see the cold gas outside.

423
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Uh, gas, but it's still, uh, moving to the center.

424
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's still falling on to the center.

425
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That kind of, uh, cold gas will give you one.

426
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not in the deep, it's not in, uh.

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Source velocity of an absorption.

428
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Because he's still far away from you.

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And then he's going to make this redshift absorption on the right.

430
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's basically the profile we want to see.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We want to measure a profile like this.

432
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And then, um.

433
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And then when you, uh, in the back, we have this in the middle.

434
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Every collapsing star will have one in the middle.

435
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Um, continuous source, he might be.

436
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Uh, this is the hottest place in there.

437
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The temperature is very high.

438
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Maybe it's a few thousand degrees.

439
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Then he just gives you a very strong black body radiation.

440
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So if you put it on, this radiation, this, um.

441
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Radiation continuous radiation will also be absorbed by the cold material in front.

442
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's the radiation that's going to be absorbed.

443
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So in the end, you're going to get something like this.

444
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
This kind of continuous, originally your continuous may be flat.

445
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But in the middle of this part, uh, because you have material in.

446
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Away from you in this velocity, so you'll be a part of it.

447
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's absorbed, so you actually see it.

448
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Uh, observation is observed in your telescope.

449
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It will probably look like this.

450
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So, of course, if we're in, uh, according to this.

451
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The two front and back ends of the continuum.

452
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Go to it.

453
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
When you correct the continuum, you'll get this.

454
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's a strange one.

455
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We'll see, uh, the middle absorption is.

456
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Less than 0.

457
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's actually not because we assume the continuum in the middle.

458
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Still, uh.

459
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
On the surface, it's part of it.

460
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So we basically want to measure a line profile like this.

461
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And then analyze it like this line profile.

462
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To understand that we, uh, uh.

463
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I've seen the inside of this line of sight.

464
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

465
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I want to ask a question.

466
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hey, that.

467
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Why is that profile?

468
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That is, these profiles are not symmetrical to that.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
OK, OK, this is the part I just skipped.

470
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Uh.

471
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
OK, if we go back to the two circles on the right, this picture.

472
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Um, in the middle, I write this high high temperature.

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The place is more central.

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And then on both sides, uh.

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Large radius is the place where the temperature is lower.

476
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Then you can imagine it as, um, in this.

477
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Uh.

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
In your foreground, in front of you, your foreground is your red.

479
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The foreground material is basically redshift.

480
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That is, it is falling to the center, so it is redshift to you.

481
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But in this redshift part, you will have.

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Um, high temperature is behind.

483
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Low temperature is in front.

484
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It means that you are more like you have a cold thing in front of a hot thing.

485
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So this cold thing will absorb the back.

486
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The hot gas gives you the radiation.

487
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Uh, but in the blue shift part, it is in the back side of the envelope.

488
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You will, you, you don't have this situation.

489
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It is the cold material behind the hot material.

490
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So you don't have this kind of self-absorption.

491
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So this is why the redshift peak.

492
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Will be lower.

493
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Why is that the same shape in Continuum is not symmetrical.

494
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because continuum is continuum, only in the middle.

495
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
If you imagine it is a radiation from the very last look of the Curtain.

496
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I went to the middle, so I got the continent.

497
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So continue only in, only in RTS part is absorbed because of the continent.

498
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
In front of it, there is no material of BlueSchi Photo.

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, I see.

500
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Ok, thank you.

501
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yes, so about 20 years ago, people started to measure this kind of profile.

502
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Then this is usually measured with a radio wave network.

503
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That was usually used in the past.

504
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's like the small ears we usually think of.

505
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Or is it bigger?

506
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Maybe it's a 10-meter network mirror or a 10-meter dish.

507
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Then measure these different molecules.

508
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Then try to measure the profile just now.

509
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Then you can see here.

510
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The first one, in addition to the sensitivity, is not very good.

511
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There are a lot of different structures.

512
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It has a lot of this kind of broad profile.

513
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Or even you don't have a very obvious absorption.

514
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Even the most important thing is that you don't have less than 0.

515
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The so-called no less than 0.

516
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The most important thing is that this absorption is very likely to be.

517
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Uh, you're in front of this source.

518
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Other completely unrelated clouds to you.

519
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Caused absorption.

520
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You can't test it.

521
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Uh, is this absorption real?

522
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It belongs to what you see now.

523
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If you can see this absorption.

524
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Uh.

525
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Drop to 0.

526
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
If it becomes negative.

527
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You can find a way to move your telescope's beam.

528
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Then you can say, OK, if I move away from the middle.

529
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
This has a continuum source.

530
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
See if there's any change in this absorption.

531
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You can be more sure.

532
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
When is it confirmed that this absorbent material is associated with?

533
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The audience is the core that you can see.

534
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So that because the relationship between decisions and the ability to ask.

535
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Uh, this question, about 20 years ago, was studied widely, and maybe 5 to 10 years later.

536
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Everyone thinks this okay, it's almost done.

537
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can't just keep doing it, so just wait.

538
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Um.

539
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Uh, new generation, the voltage waves of thisicated.

540
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Power garage to not be able to have a better optimization result.

541
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So what is Oma?

542
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Oma is, uh.

543
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Uh, Akitama Large Millimeter Sub-millimeter Array.

544
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It is a wireless wave array on the Akitama Desert plateau in Chile.

545
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then.

546
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
He mainly.

547
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There should be 66 antennas, which is probably like the bigger antenna outside.

548
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Each antenna is a 12 meter antenna, and there is a smaller one in the middle.

549
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Another, uh, separate array.

550
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Uh, it's 7 meters.

551
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Then he is.

552
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Uh, he's basically a whole world.

553
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
A collaboration, the United States is NRAO.

554
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh, that's not NRAO, that's NRC.

555
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
NRC is Canada's National Research Council.

556
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Then Japan's NLJ, Europe's ESO.

557
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Taiwan is A, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Uh, there's participation.

559
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And then there's Chile.

560
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And then this is open to the world.

561
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Um.

562
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Astronomers can apply to observe.

563
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Then he mainly.

564
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Uh, the biggest bonus is that he can have a very, very good resolution.

565
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
His.

566
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He can see very, very small things.

567
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Then basically the array is.

568
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Uh, the telescope is, uh, your resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by.

569
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Uh, you, you.

570
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The diameter of your telescope.

571
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The wireless wave array is simply a mirror.

572
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Cut.

573
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Cut into a lot of little ones.

574
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Uh, a different telescope.

575
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Then, so you can pull the two telescope very far as a telescope to use.

576
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So, like this, the biggest of this.

577
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Uh, baseline is called baseline.

578
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Simply put, his diameter can be up to 15, 15 kilometers.

579
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes, it can be analyzed to a very small area.

580
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Ok, then, at the beginning of this, we started with two more similar profiles that we just drew at the beginning.

581
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Like the left side, this is a.

582
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
This is a, uh, organic molecule, uh, Chinese, what is this English Miso?

583
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Uh.

584
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
This is the appearance, you can see, if we, uh.

585
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
After taking the continuum off, you can see this absorption is enough, and then you can see his, uh, absorption.

586
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Redshift.

587
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And then in the same way, in this other source, we also see the same thing.

588
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Uh, but in these two cases.

589
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
These are still relatively small, because the first one, like the left one, is an organic molecule, so his.

590
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
He may, uh, in those early stars, uh.

591
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The abundance is not so high.

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Uh, not much, so the image is relatively weak.

593
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Then, like the source on the right, it is a relatively, uh, darker source, so his continuum is not so high, so his absorption is relatively small.

594
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Then, in my main research, I mainly want to use, uh, the target, the other, which is the B, H, R, 71.

595
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Then go to understand, see if we can measure a better, uh.

596
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Uh, the signature of the infor, which is the double peak, and then analyze it.

597
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Then he is also a very isolated, uh, early, uh.

598
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Uh, and then if you look at it in the optical band, it's a black thing, basically all of it.

599
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Uh, all kinds of dust, uh, and gas.

600
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Then, in the infor, you can see that he has a beautiful outflow.

601
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
In the radio, you can also see a beautiful outflow.

602
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He actually has two sources in the middle.

603
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Then, here, we just focus on the RS1, which is the main source.

604
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Ok, then we are in Alma cycle 4, so we propose, and then we get our data.

605
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
It looks like the right side, which is very much like the way it was drawn before.

606
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Especially this HCL plus, this curve is basically the same as the front.

607
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then you can see here, although, um.

608
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This absorption is very wide, but you can probably see that he is actually in, uh.

609
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Redshift velocity still has a lot of absorption, which proves that he is actually part of it.

610
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It comes from, um, the middle, uh, those who are really falling in the gas.

611
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
To produce absorption.

612
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That, uh.

613
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Ok, then we need to analyze this curve.

614
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We actually need to use one.

615
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We can't just read it out of this.

616
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Absorption is in, maybe it's in 0.5 kilometers per second, and then you'll know.

617
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Uh, I, you might know there's something in 0.5 kilometers per second falling in.

618
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But you don't know if he's in, you've seen this line of sight in which place.

619
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That, uh, because you have absorption and emission mixed together.

620
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So we have to, um, use a very common technique in astronomy.

621
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The technique is ready to transfer the calculation to find a way.

622
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Um, to model the curve we see.

623
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That way to transfer, simply put, uh, if I'm here now, every one of these, this, this.

624
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The shape is a, a, a, a gas.

625
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
All right, you may have radiation on the left.

626
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Come in, and the radiation will be in the gas, it may be absorbed by the research, your research will become weak.

627
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Or after you have been absorbed, or you, you, this, this gas is actually very hot.

628
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So he has some, uh, he has some black radiation, or he has some of his own radiation.

629
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So you, he may have, there will be a mission.

630
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So, in these energy transitions, he may be part of it.

631
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It becomes the temperature of this gas, or, uh, inside the excite.

632
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The level population of different molecules.

633
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Your mother from the beginning to the end, and then you can know from the inside.

634
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Uh.

635
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Radiation to the end, uh, we observed what it should look like.

636
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And then, uh, through, uh.

637
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
The process of more than once, and then to get a better model to explain what we saw in front of us.

638
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So, in fact, what we do is very, um.

639
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's tedious, but it's also, um.

640
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Um.

641
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's actually okay, it's actually not that tedious, but it's a lot of iteration, a lot of iterative process.

642
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Basically, after we have a model, we can get it, we can say, okay, our, our.

643
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
What does the density of the envelope look like?

644
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Um.

645
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Info this, uh, velocity should look like.

646
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We can throw it into, uh, different radio transfer models to do.

647
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Uh, this is where we separate gas and dust.

648
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Because basically.

649
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Um.

650
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
First of all, we use, uh, dust.

651
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Uh, it's the continuation of the part of the register.

652
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Go to, uh.

653
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
To constrain this whole envelope structure.

654
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
For example, this envelope.

655
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Uh, his, uh.

656
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
What is the density?

657
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So, uh, what is the change in the radius?

658
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
How much does he stand behind this?

659
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
His.

660
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Uh, what is the angle?

661
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
How much is it?

662
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Then, when we determine this envelope structure.

663
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Let's put it in again.

664
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And then we'll figure out that we're okay.

665
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
If we follow this structure, we'll get the spectrum.

666
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What should it look like?

667
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay, so, uh, this is what we did before, uh, the model.

668
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And then here, uh.

669
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
See this is, uh.

670
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That is.

671
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The spectrum of BHS 1.

672
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
That's behind this.

673
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The gray line is the spectrum.

674
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And then this is probably.

675
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Uh, 2 microns, 3 microns, up to.

676
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Up to 1 millimeter range.

677
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And then.

678
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Uh.

679
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The blue circle is our model.

680
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And then the red square is the observation.

681
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And then you see most of us.

682
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
We just fit through this.

683
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
To fit, we put the model fit to the observation.

684
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And then we'll get a.

685
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Uh, a better model to describe this envelope.

686
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
For example, I drew it like this here.

687
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
But actually, how do we construct this?

688
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
How much is his output angle?

689
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What is the density distribution of the envelope?

690
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Okay, so you don't have to say.

691
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's more like it's coming out of the outflow.

692
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then the long way is coming out of the envelope.

693
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay, and then.

694
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Uh, I said earlier that we're going to take this envelope structure.

695
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Plus, uh, we can think of a way to model this.

696
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Uh, but in fact, one of the very, very important.

697
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Uh, the factor is chemistry.

698
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So the chemistry is not.

699
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Uh, well, so the chemistry is not just thinking, okay.

700
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
What are you going to have?

701
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And it's this kind of molecule.

702
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Is it possible to exist in that kind of condition?

703
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
In the atmosphere, you can see it, especially in.

704
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Um, these dense core, the density in the middle is very high.

705
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And then the temperature is quite low.

706
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So it's possible to be frozen on top of these dust.

707
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then if it freezes, you, you, you.

708
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
You can't do it in him.

709
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You expect the atmosphere to give you a curve.

710
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And see that this is.

711
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So there's a different chemical abundance profile.

712
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You might be out there, you might have.

713
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Uh, the radiation from other places might take you.

714
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
By H, this is an example of H.

715
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You might let him.

716
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's a separation of two different things, or it's.

717
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
In there, he might be frozen on top of the dust.

718
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Or in this one, he's going to be with some, uh.

719
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Active molecules interact with each other, and then.

720
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Produce fat particles, and then he disappears.

721
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So you can't measure it.

722
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So in the middle, we're going to.

723
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Mainly, like I've been in.

724
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Uh, it's been a long time.

725
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It takes a while to say what we're going to do.

726
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
A relatively good abundance profile.

727
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
To explain our data.

728
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So, uh.

729
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Basically, we need to understand this kind of info profile.

730
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Uh, we're going to take our dust model.

731
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You can get density, temperature, and velocity.

732
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And then we add our.

733
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Chemical abundance.

734
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The, uh.

735
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We're going to find a way.

736
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Uh, get a spectrum.

737
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If you don't feel good, we'll go back.

738
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Modify and change, so this is very.

739
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Uh, a long one.

740
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Uh, the process.

741
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Uh, this is us.

742
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Uh, hey.

743
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Um, uh, yeah, that's good.

744
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The front is almost the same.

745
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
That's my question.

746
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Um, like this, like this, like this.

747
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's a relatively small system.

748
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Uh, that kind of info.

749
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Or the final outflow.

750
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The distribution of gravity.

751
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's all about, uh, normal.

752
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That matter is good.

753
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If there is a dark matter, he has a way.

754
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It doesn't really matter.

755
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It doesn't really matter.

756
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And.

757
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm not sure if it's early.

758
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Early universe will be affected.

759
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But at least in the modern universe.

760
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Uh, the general assumption should be dark matter.

761
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Mainly in the outer galaxy.

762
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's in the black building.

763
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So I rarely.

764
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I heard that.

765
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Uh, dark matter will affect.

766
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's the evolution of these.

767
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
At least in the.

768
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
In the region.

769
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So I don't think there's much.

770
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Big impression.

771
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Uh, because I.

772
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
My idea is like this.

773
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
If today, in some of those.

774
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Dark matter can be strong with them.

775
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Interacting, then there will be some small.

776
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Small structure, for example.

777
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is a relatively clumpy phenomenon.

778
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Uh, maybe.

779
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Can be constrained, but I don't think so.

780
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I can't see it.

781
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, I guess I can't see it.

782
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
If you have a big.

783
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It should be very, very small.

784
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That's probably like a micro lens.

785
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You're looking at things.

786
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So.

787
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Uh, so I'm going to be like this.

788
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
A system should be able to see it.

789
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The current observation.

790
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The relationship should be.

791
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Very far away.

792
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe there will be, but it's hard.

793
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah.

794
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay, thank you.

795
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So, uh.

796
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Like this, like me.

797
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This model is our latest.

798
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This is the latest model we got.

799
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Actually, it was about two days ago.

800
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Uh, uh, on the right.

801
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Uh, blue is our data.

802
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Then orange is our current model.

803
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Then you see our model.

804
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Roughly capture is data.

805
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The feeling.

806
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But you can see, for example, in Russian.

807
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
We still miss a lot of emissions.

808
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So, uh.

809
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is this is actually.

810
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Now.

811
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In the future, we should continue to do more.

812
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Uh, different tuning, and then even.

813
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
To understand that there is no way to make up.

814
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Uh, to make up for this part.

815
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Missing mission.

816
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Uh, to understand that it is possible to say.

817
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Um.

818
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Of course, our current model is very, very.

819
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Symmetry is basically a.

820
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Symmetry model.

821
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Um.

822
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The first one is to understand that, okay.

823
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Under this very strong assumption.

824
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Is there any way to make this model better?

825
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What if it doesn't work?

826
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
How do we break this?

827
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This assumption.

828
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And it won't cause too much.

829
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The freedom.

830
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay, you can say whatever you want.

831
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Um.

832
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So, uh, this is probably the future.

833
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The main thing to do in the next month or two.

834
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That's on the left.

835
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This picture is.

836
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Basically, it's like.

837
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Uh, if you look at.

838
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The mission map.

839
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Then if you take the middle continent.

840
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's like this.

841
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The dark place in the middle is the continent.

842
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
After being removed, it causes a very strong absorption.

843
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Just like the right side, you see this very strong absorption.

844
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So when you get close, you will become negative.

845
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And then up and down like this.

846
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
This bright spot is because.

847
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Uh, you have all flow, so all flow is up.

848
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Uh, up and down, this, this, this direction.

849
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So, uh.

850
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Uh.

851
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Uh, the density is relatively low, so it is easier to be heated.

852
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So it's brighter.

853
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Ok, then.

854
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Why do you say this?

855
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Info will affect this chemistry?

856
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That is to say.

857
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Uh, simply put, if there is a group, a group of gas.

858
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Now he, he is from.

859
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Um, this envelope.

860
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The outer circumference keeps traveling.

861
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You are affected by the infogravity.

862
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You can't travel to the middle.

863
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And then falling to this star or disk.

864
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It will pass through the middle.

865
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Different temperatures.

866
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The middle may be getting hotter and hotter.

867
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Basically, it's getting hotter and hotter.

868
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Because there is a pro star in the middle.

869
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Pro star is emitting a very strong emission.

870
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That, but this info.

871
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This chemistry is determined by.

872
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Say, ok, I have this, this group of gas.

873
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This group of gas will be at different temperatures.

874
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
How long will it take?

875
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If he is very slow.

876
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Then he may spend a long time in every place.

877
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That or even.

878
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
He may spend more time in the lower temperature.

879
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Or at a higher temperature.

880
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That will affect.

881
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Uh, at different temperatures, it will affect.

882
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Um.

883
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It should be said that at different temperatures.

884
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The chemical reaction you can produce is different.

885
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That, and every chemical reaction.

886
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The time scale is also different.

887
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
If you are at low temperature, although you have a lot.

888
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Low temperature chemical reactions can be produced.

889
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But if you just spend it at low temperature.

890
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Very short time, then those reactions.

891
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Will not be for, um.

892
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
The chemical state of these molecules.

893
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Uh.

894
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
The state has caused any change.

895
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What about the other way?

896
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
To see is to say.

897
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Um, we are actually using these molecules.

898
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The.

899
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The radiation to go.

900
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
To trace this.

901
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The envelope inside the dynamic.

902
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If we don't understand which side of the road.

903
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
These molecules are sometimes our interpretation.

904
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It will become incorrect.

905
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That.

906
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Another point is what I said before.

907
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Uh, the evolution of the dynamic code.

908
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Will affect you.

909
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
What is the chemical reaction you can produce?

910
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So these two are a bit like interaction.

911
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's like being tied together.

912
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's hard for you to separate one from each other.

913
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That's to say here.

914
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
At different, for example, at low temperature.

915
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You may have a lot of free.

916
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You have a lot of deterioration.

917
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
H will become very low.

918
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Then, more.

919
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So-called medium tension.

920
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
You will have a lot on the surface of this dust.

921
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Different chemical reactions.

922
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That will cause the chemistry.

923
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
The people who do the chemical model will tell you.

924
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
That this may produce different species.

925
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Different species.

926
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Now, at high temperature.

927
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
When it comes to Kelvin.

928
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Uh, you used to be.

929
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
The ice is frozen on the dust.

930
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
These molecules may all come out because the temperature has risen.

931
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So it will affect us.

932
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
What you see is different.

933
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Or at different temperatures.

934
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
There will be different changes.

935
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Well, basically, uh.

936
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
There will be two in the early stars.

937
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
There are currently two different types of observations.

938
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Uh, source, one is called.

939
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Uh, the other is.

940
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
One carbon molecule source.

941
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's basically it.

942
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
His original meaning is.

943
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
It represents his small hot core.

944
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
What is the hot core?

945
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It is a relatively large-capacity source.

946
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
He may be.

947
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
100, 1000, even a few thousand.

948
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Uh, the sun.

949
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
A source.

950
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Uh, we've been observing for a long time.

951
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Oh, in these sources.

952
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You'll see a lot of mess.

953
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Different organic molecules.

954
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So this kind of.

955
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The source is classified.

956
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's classified as a hot core.

957
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Because he doesn't have to be hot enough.

958
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
These molecules will become gas.

959
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Let you be observed.

960
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So the hot core is.

961
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
We observe similar chemical states.

962
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
A lot of organic molecules.

963
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's a relatively low quality.

964
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Little quality.

965
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Uh, 0.5 to.

966
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Uh, 10.

967
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Uh, range.

968
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's another one.

969
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
One carbon molecule source is.

970
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Uh, in the same process.

971
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
We found.

972
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Uh, there's another kind of source.

973
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Um, he doesn't have a lot of this.

974
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
He still has a lot of organic molecules.

975
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It doesn't look like this.

976
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Uh, so-called.

977
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Uh, long convention means that he has a lot of carbon.

978
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
One by one.

979
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So you might see something like C2H.

980
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
C4H or something.

981
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
C7H.

982
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
These carbons are both.

983
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Maybe it's a double or three.

984
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Three pieces together.

985
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
He can have a lot of carbon stuck together.

986
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And then you don't have any other hydrogen atoms.

987
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Or other different atoms.

988
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That, um, in.

989
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Hot core, you know, these saturated molecules.

990
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It means that these points.

991
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
The square or triangle is opened to pick up different functional groups.

992
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Then produce different organic molecules.

993
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
That's in chemistry.

994
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Um.

995
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Their, uh, their formation path is different.

996
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So now it's.

997
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Uh, everyone.

998
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
From the model, from the control.

999
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Try to characterize it.

1000
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Is the first one really true?

1001
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Or is it just that we see two different extremes?

1002
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
In fact, there are a lot of overlaps in the middle.

1003
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Or say.

1004
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Hey.

1005
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
In terms of models, how can we produce a lot of long carbon molecules?

1006
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
How can we produce a lot of, uh, these saturated complex molecules?

1007
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's the same source.

1008
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
In the same observation.

1009
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We measure a lot of, uh.

1010
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Uh, organic molecules.

1011
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Like the middle one.

1012
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
This is very high.

1013
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
This is outstanding.

1014
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This is more than this.

1015
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This is the four panels in front of it.

1016
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I'll show you.

1017
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Uh, four panels.

1018
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
This is the four main lines.

1019
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
But we also found that in.

1020
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
The other places of this spectrum.

1021
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
We see a lot of weaker emissions.

1022
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And then we identify them.

1023
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
In fact, uh.

1024
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Most of them are from organic molecules.

1025
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And then we identified it.

1026
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
There should be 14 different organic molecules.

1027
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
On the right side.

1028
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Some of them are quite complicated.

1029
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
There's alcohol, alcohol.

1030
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Or some different, uh.

1031
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Calcium, different.

1032
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Uh, his isotope.

1033
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Uh, his isotope.

1034
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And then we found that in different sources.

1035
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Inside?

1036
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Like here, we have three different sources.

1037
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
That.

1038
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Basically, they are, uh, these three sources.

1039
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Their, um,

1040
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Luminosity difference will be more than 10 times.

1041
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So the so-called luminosity is basically.

1042
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Uh, depending on the control.

1043
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
How much of the radiation can be released in the middle?

1044
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
How bright is the star in the middle?

1045
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
How bright is the process in the middle?

1046
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's the difference in brightness.

1047
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So in such a big different source.

1048
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Inside?

1049
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
We found that his organic molecules.

1050
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
For methanol.

1051
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Uh, the abundance is about the same.

1052
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
That is to say, you can see these three symbols.

1053
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Basically, they are all quite close.

1054
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That, uh, that means.

1055
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Um.

1056
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
The middle of this.

1057
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Um.

1058
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
How much is the luminosity?

1059
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
How strong is the radiation in the middle?

1060
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It doesn't affect the production of these complex molecules.

1061
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Well, since it's not.

1062
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
The middle, uh, this radiation.

1063
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
If you say carbon, that means it's in front.

1064
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
These, uh.

1065
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
In the early days, these complex molecules.

1066
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It's already formed.

1067
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
He might be in, uh.

1068
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
When it freezes on the ice.

1069
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Through some of the relatively low temperature.

1070
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Some reactions are formed.

1071
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
When he travels to the middle, it's relatively high temperature.

1072
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
He was released.

1073
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
To the gas station, and then you see it.

1074
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So he didn't have too much.

1075
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Processing produces different.

1076
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So this is a very small sample.

1077
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But I.

1078
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's just a hint.

1079
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
This is actually with, uh.

1080
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The prediction of the chemical model is quite close.

1081
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So, in addition, we found that we can do this.

1082
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Uh, complex molecules can also give us some.

1083
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Uh, can imagine the signature.

1084
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Uh.

1085
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Let's look at the cartoon on the right.

1086
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Simply put, if you have a structure like this.

1087
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
The middle of this gray ring.

1088
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The middle of this gray ring represents a disk.

1089
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And then you might have an info outside.

1090
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Now we have, like, we're going down from the top.

1091
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
This, this disk.

1092
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
If you look at it from the left.

1093
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
If it's yellow, this disease.

1094
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You can see, uh.

1095
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
On one side, there's a red shift emission.

1096
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's far from you.

1097
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's a red emission.

1098
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But at the same time, you can see it in the back.

1099
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Uh, blue shift, the info.

1100
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So you become one of the same.

1101
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
There's the same offset inside.

1102
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You can see at the same time.

1103
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
There's a blue shift and a red shift emission.

1104
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's not the same as if you're just a disk.

1105
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
If you're just a disk.

1106
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Your left.

1107
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It's all going to be, for example, it's all going to be a red shift emission.

1108
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's all going to be a blue shift emission on the right.

1109
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's all going to be a blue shift emission on the right.

1110
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
In this case.

1111
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You'll see two different kinds.

1112
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
At the same time, you'll see a blue shift and a red shift emission.

1113
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So this is our left.

1114
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
We're in, uh.

1115
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
What you see in the observation.

1116
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Offset you can see.

1117
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
If it's 0.1, we can see it at the same time.

1118
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You can see the blue shift and the red shift emission.

1119
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So if it's.

1120
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It's just a desk.

1121
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You'll see two triangles.

1122
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It's in the upper right corner and the lower left corner.

1123
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So that's what we're talking about.

1124
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Um, and then at the same time, this.

1125
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
If you go in and analyze it.

1126
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
A morphology like this.

1127
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Or what kind of structure is it?

1128
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We found that he was in the middle.

1129
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It's 50 to 100.

1130
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It's a disk.

1131
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1132
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,000


1133
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1134
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
This is the mission.

1135
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I found that we can use it at the same time.

1136
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Hcl plus.

1137
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That's the mission to trace.

1138
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Um, the info of the envelope skill.

1139
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Um, the info, uh, the same complex.

1140
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
A lot of molecules can give us some.

1141
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Uh, more central information.

1142
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So the goal for the future is to figure out a way.

1143
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If we can put this big tree, we should say.

1144
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Envelope skill and desk have two different dynamics.

1145
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Let's see if we can get a better one.

1146
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Uh, info model.

1147
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
At the same time, we see a lot of different structures.

1148
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
This is the other thing we can do.

1149
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
We see a lot of different outflow structures.

1150
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It's just a school picture.

1151
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Um.

1152
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So, um, it means that we're actually this observation.

1153
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
There's only an hour of observation time.

1154
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But he probably can bring it to us.

1155
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
It may be more than three projects.

1156
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It may be more than three projects.

1157
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um.

1158
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Um, so, um, so, um, so, um.

1159
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Um.

1160
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Ok.

1161
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
We're going to ask again.

1162
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Um, you can go back to the first two.

1163
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
In the front page.

1164
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Uh, just, uh.

1165
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Uh, uh, next page, next page.

1166
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
There's one.

1167
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That's right, this page.

1168
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Just.

1169
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
It's just that I just missed it.

1170
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Why is there only a complex?

1171
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You can do this thing.

1172
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Then you before.

1173
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's the few lines that are very bright at the beginning.

1174
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Why can't I see this?

1175
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Um.

1176
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Basically,

1177
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the front.

1178
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Those in the front, for example,

1179
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
it may have some.

1180
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It may have some destruction in the middle.

1181
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But even if those models don't have destruction,

1182
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
it's relatively simple.

1183
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It may be.

1184
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It may be in the middle.

1185
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's very high, but it's because of its.

1186
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Um.

1187
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It may be at the same time,

1188
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
from 10 to 2000,

1189
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
all of them.

1190
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So in terms of analysis,

1191
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
it causes a lot of complexity.

1192
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The advantage of the complex model is that

1193
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
the first one, most of the time,

1194
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
it's in the state of defrosting.

1195
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It may have to be more than 100 Kelvin.

1196
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
The temperature, it will go to the gas phase,

1197
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and you can see it.

1198
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's a relatively simple model.

1199
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It may be 20 K, 40 K,

1200
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you can see it.

1201
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So, um, this kind of temperature

1202
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
constraint, let the complex molecule

1203
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
basically gather in a very

1204
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
compact center,

1205
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
or this scale place.

1206
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So basically,

1207
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
its existence itself is self-selected,

1208
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
so that you can probe

1209
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
a very well-defined or

1210
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
very compact region.

1211
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So, of course, other simpler

1212
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
molecules can also be traced in the middle.

1213
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You can find other molecules in the middle,

1214
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
but it's relatively difficult to analyze.

1215
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Oh, okay.

1216
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Got it. Thank you.

1217
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay, so

1218
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
we basically, so maybe we have

1219
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
a case now, that is, this source, we can

1220
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
derive an info model,

1221
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and then we can connect from this core

1222
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and then draw a line to trace

1223
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
its evolution from core to

1224
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
a star case.

1225
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But in the future,

1226
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
we should

1227
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
pursue more samples,

1228
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
so this observation is actually

1229
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
very simple.

1230
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
15 minutes on source,

1231
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the rest is actually calibration.

1232
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
15 minutes on source,

1233
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
you can measure so many things.

1234
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So it should be very,

1235
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
if we have a good argument,

1236
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
it is actually

1237
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
relatively easy to push

1238
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
more samples,

1239
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
maybe 10 or even 50 sources,

1240
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
you can probably know, okay,

1241
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
the evolution of different mass sources

1242
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So this is more of a future

1243
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
direction.

1244
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Then I will put my summary here,

1245
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and then if you have any other

1246
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
questions, you are welcome.

1247
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Thank you.

1248
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Then

1249
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
please turn on the microphone.

1250
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
We are now applauding,

1251
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
thank you for

1252
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
giving us a speech.

1253
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Thank you.

1254
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Thank you.

1255
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I don't know if you have any questions.

1256
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
If you have any questions,

1257
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
remember to turn on the microphone.

1258
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I will ask another question.

1259
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay.

1260
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Just stop here.

1261
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
The picture in the upper right corner,

1262
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you just said you are

1263
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
using your

1264
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
radiative transfer model

1265
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
to fit your

1266
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
observation data.

1267
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So

1268
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
you

1269
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
will use, for example,

1270
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
like MCMC,

1271
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
you may run one first,

1272
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
and then compare the observation,

1273
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
and then come back to adjust the parameters,

1274
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and then run again?

1275
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Or is it

1276
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
theoretically possible?

1277
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Theoretically it is possible, but

1278
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
the biggest

1279
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
limitation is that we

1280
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
are running this 3D radiative transfer,

1281
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
because this is a very high density

1282
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
place, so

1283
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
running a model of realization

1284
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
takes a very long time.

1285
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
A realization may take 2 hours, 3 hours.

1286
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So if you are MCMC,

1287
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
you may have to map,

1288
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
so you have to probe this parameter space.

1289
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
If you need 1000 models,

1290
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
it will take 3000 hours

1291
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
per source.

1292
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So we later thought

1293
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
it was not very feasible.

1294
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But

1295
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
some

1296
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
other studies do simpler

1297
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
sources, they use MCMC

1298
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
to characterize different

1299
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
parameters. But I think that's

1300
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
actually very important.

1301
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Maybe we can

1302
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
test, for example,

1303
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
other things are all fixed,

1304
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
we will

1305
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
change the chemical abundance profile.

1306
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Because that's actually

1307
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
a pretty

1308
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
hand-tuning parameter.

1309
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
We currently have some ideas

1310
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
to see if we can

1311
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
optimize the radiative transfer

1312
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
calculation. For example,

1313
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
we can fix the gradient,

1314
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
some more technical considerations

1315
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
can be relaxed.

1316
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So I think

1317
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
in the future, maybe I will

1318
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
do some more

1319
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
small experiments. But

1320
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I think this part

1321
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
has its own

1322
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
limitations. So

1323
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
if you can do MCMC

1324
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
optimization,

1325
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
it should be

1326
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
in a more

1327
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
special situation.

1328
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So

1329
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
your current approach is

1330
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to run one first

1331
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
and see if it's not

1332
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
right. Then you probably

1333
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
know what

1334
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
parameter to choose.

1335
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yes, it's the brain

1336
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
to guide the search.

1337
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
For example,

1338
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
we have a lot of different tools

1339
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
to do this. For example,

1340
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
we have some tools

1341
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
that can tell us,

1342
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
in this beam,

1343
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
as a function of radius,

1344
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
what our velocity looks like.

1345
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
If I want to say that I think

1346
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
the emission at a certain velocity is too low,

1347
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'll see if I can adjust it,

1348
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
or see

1349
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
what the reason is.

1350
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It takes a lot of time to

1351
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
model the inspection,

1352
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and then think about

1353
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
how to adjust it.

1354
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Got it.

1355
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It feels like

1356
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
a project

1357
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
that can be used for machine learning.

1358
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yes, I hope so.

1359
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Who can help me do this?

1360
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Yuting can help you.

1361
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
She's really good at it now.

1362
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Okay.

1363
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
In January,

1364
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I'll need your help.

1365
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Before today's speech,

1366
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
before everyone

1367
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
came in,

1368
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
we talked about

1369
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
the content of today's speech,

1370
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
which is still being written and submitted.

1371
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
If you want to discuss,

1372
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
you can contact our speakers directly.

1373
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You can

1374
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
put your email in the chat.

1375
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Whether you want to be contacted

1376
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
or you want to contact someone,

1377
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
you can exchange

1378
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
contact information here.

1379
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Or you can Google it.

1380
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
You can Google it directly.

1381
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
The recording of our speech will be delayed

1382
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
until February or March next year

1383
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
before it is uploaded.

1384
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
The reason is that it is now

1385
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
being written.

1386
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Do you have any questions?

1387
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
If you don't have any questions now,

1388
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'll promote it.

1389
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I'm going to put

1390
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
the two main websites

1391
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
in the chat.

1392
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
One is our Facebook,

1393
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
the other is our website.

1394
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
If you go in,

1395
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
you can see

1396
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
the purpose of our project.

1397
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
We hope that through

1398
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
young people

1399
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
working in the research circle,

1400
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
we can cooperate with each other

1401
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and exchange research information quickly,

1402
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
get to know each other,

1403
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
and share information.

1404
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
If you support such a project,

1405
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
we hope you can consider

1406
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
joining the member.

1407
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I also put the information

1408
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
for joining the member in the chat.

1409
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
More importantly,

1410
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
we are now open to sign up

1411
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
for the 2019 speech.

1412
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
If you are in the past year

1413
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
or expected to be in the next year,

1414
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
there will be interesting research discoveries

1415
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
or information or ideas

1416
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
to share with you.

1417
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I also put the link

1418
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
in the chat.

01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
There are several websites here,

1420
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
you can go in and play.

1421
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'll ask one last time,

1422
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
do you have any questions?

1423
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
By the way,

1424
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yaolun's email is in the chat,

1425
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
so you can ask him directly.

1426
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Thank you.

1427
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
If there are no questions,

1428
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
let's turn on the microphone

1429
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
and thank Yaolun again.
