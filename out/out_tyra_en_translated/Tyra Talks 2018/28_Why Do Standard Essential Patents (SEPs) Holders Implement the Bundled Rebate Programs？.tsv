0	8000	Welcome to this week's Tera Talk. I'm your host, Yu-Wei Lin.
8000	11000	I'm pleased to welcome our speaker today, Louis.
11000	15000	He is currently a Ph.D. student at St. Louis University of Washington.
15000	21000	His main research projects include intellectual property rights, law, anti-Thorax law, and economic analysis.
21000	27000	Before he was a Ph.D. student, he was an intern at Winston & Stone, a law firm in Taiwan and abroad.
27000	34000	He also analyzed the legal behavior of Taiwanese clients and non-independent individuals in the U.S. and East Germany.
34000	38000	Louis is also very interested in entrepreneurship.
38000	42000	He is a member of the China Entrepreneurship and International Exchange Association,
42000	48000	and regularly holds meetings and talks in Taiwan to promote entrepreneurship.
48000	51000	Today's topic is about his background in law and entrepreneurship.
51000	61000	Louis, please turn on your microphone.
61000	80000	Thank you, Yu-Wei, and thank you, Tera, for inviting me.
80000	96000	Last year, I also talked about the topic of streaming, which is the issue of copyright for online streaming videos.
96000	104000	If you are interested, please go to Tera's website and click on the link.
104000	111000	Today's topic is completely different. It has nothing to do with copyright, but is related to patents.
111000	122000	This topic has a little to do with my graduate thesis, but it is not all of my graduate thesis.
122000	128000	Instead, I use different angles to analyze the case study of my graduate thesis.
128000	144000	As you can see on the screen, my graduate thesis was co-written with a friend from Shanghai Fudan University's Administration College.
145000	157000	The main part of my thesis is to study whether the use of bundling in the market,
157000	164000	or the use of bundling in the market, or the use of bundling in the market,
164000	167000	or the use of bundling in the market, and some economic analysis.
167000	174000	The main details of the content will allow me to talk about it for about 30-40 minutes.
174000	184000	It should not be too long, because this is a bit of a background, so I have to talk about it in detail.
184000	191000	I'm just curious about which background friends are coming to listen to my speech today.
192000	198000	I don't know who will respond, so I'll turn off the full screen to see.
203000	206000	There are those with a deep background, welcome.
206000	210000	Then there are those with physics, mechanical.
210000	212000	So none of them are from the Academy of Social Sciences.
213000	216000	Okay, very good. Then I will talk about it in detail.
216000	223000	In fact, the things in the Academy of Social Sciences or the law are not so complicated.
223000	232000	Today we will use some mathematical things, but I will not show you the whole process of deduction.
232000	238000	I think there is no need to show off, just to show you what our results are.
238000	240000	I don't have much to say.
240000	245000	The things I study have some background knowledge that needs to be understood by everyone.
245000	255000	If some of you are interested in this industry or already know it very well, please add it if I say something wrong.
255000	260000	What I want to talk about today is actually related to modern chip.
260000	264000	Modern chip is the so-called communication chip industry.
264000	269000	In fact, I found this Samsung Galaxy S4 on the Internet.
269000	274000	Its structure looks like this.
274000	277000	One of them is modern chip.
277000	279000	What are the benefits of modern chip?
279000	284000	The advantage is that after the modern chip is installed in the mobile phone today,
284000	295000	For example, we all know that the communication standards of 2G, 3G, and 4G will not have so-called problems that cannot be used in different countries.
295000	301000	Just imagine that if you buy an iPhone today, whether it is iPhone 4, iPhone 5, or iPhone 6,
301000	308000	The result may be that your communication standards are different today, or your communication bandwidth is different.
309000	314000	In fact, this is very blind.
314000	320000	How to solve this difference in bandwidth or communication standards?
320000	323000	Modern chip plays a very important role.
323000	326000	Another example is that everyone is in the United States.
326000	331000	I assume that everyone is in the United States.
331000	341000	If you take your mobile phone and go to some remote places, it is not 4G that covers the range, but 3G or even 2G.
341000	347000	But you can still make calls and you can still go online.
347000	349000	It's just that it's very slow.
349000	351000	How is this function done?
351000	353000	In fact, this is the function of modern chip.
353000	359000	It can still operate under different standards and under different levels.
359000	361000	However, its operating function is limited.
361000	363000	This is the function of modern chip.
363000	372000	It can be seen that a mobile phone has a lot of functionality.
372000	378000	But the value of a smart phone is to be online.
378000	382000	Modern chip plays a very important role.
383000	389000	What I want to discuss today is a small communication chip problem.
389000	394000	Let's take a look at the situation of this industry.
394000	399000	This is a total of 1.2 years.
399000	405000	From 2007 to 2012, there were several leading companies in the modern chip industry.
405000	415000	We can probably see that Qualcomm has been playing a leading role in this field.
415000	423000	Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since the 3G in 2007 to the 4G in 2012.
423000	427000	Later, I will show the state of the 5G patent layout.
427000	431000	In fact, Qualcomm has been playing a leading role.
431000	438000	Qualcomm has been playing a leading role since Samsung, Intel, and Huawei.
438000	440000	Huawei has not written here yet.
440000	444000	Huawei started to layout from 4G to 5G.
444000	448000	This is the current state of the industry.
448000	451000	From 2012 to now,
451000	463000	we can see that the green part of the patent layout is high-speed communication.
463000	470000	In fact, in various fields, including radio front, modulation, and core networking,
470000	476000	the patent layout of the modern chip has a very high status.
477000	482000	From these pictures, we can see the current state of the industry.
482000	490000	The inter-digital and blackberry are all gone.
490000	493000	These are all in the past.
493000	496000	The former dragon head is no longer in use.
496000	500000	You can see that there is a lot of high-speed communication in green.
500000	506000	The gray part is Intel, which we will discuss today.
506000	515000	In fact, the patent layout, especially 5G, is not as good as Qualcomm.
515000	519000	So we can simply summarize one thing.
519000	526000	Qualcomm is almost in monopoly in the modern chip industry.
526000	536000	Because most of the chips are sold due to the patent layout and the maintenance of product quality.
536000	539000	So the state of maintenance is very good.
539000	546000	So most of the big manufacturers, including Apple users,
546000	560000	mostly use Qualcomm's modern chip for their important suppliers from iPhone 4, 5, 6, and 7.
560000	568000	But the problem is that these so-called communication standards,
568000	573000	as mentioned above, 2G, 3G, and 4G standards.
573000	579000	Although there are a lot of patent layout behind these standards,
579000	583000	and the negotiation process of each party,
583000	586000	because we always have to decide which standard to use.
586000	589000	It must be of good quality and easy to promote.
589000	591000	I think everyone can understand this.
591000	598000	In fact, there are international standard organizations behind the standard promotion.
598000	604000	So let's go back to the picture just now.
604000	610000	I think this picture is very important in the context of my law school.
611000	613000	Why is it important?
613000	618000	Because it explains the relationship between people of different levels.
618000	624000	Because on my left is IEEE, ITU, and ETSI.
624000	629000	These three are very important to develop 4G and even 5G technical standard organizations.
629000	637000	These technical standard organizations play a role in promoting technical standards.
637000	646000	The core concept is that I want my 4G standard or 5G standard in the future
646000	651000	to be able to be used by many people.
651000	653000	It's not that I only let a group of people use it.
653000	656000	A small group of people using it is not a standard.
656000	660000	So everyone must be able to recognize that this thing is good for them.
661000	665000	It's easy to use and has a high rate of measurement.
665000	669000	The standard of 5G and 4G can be slowly promoted because the industry recognizes it.
669000	676000	But behind it, it involves a lot of different patent layouts.
676000	681000	Because it's impossible for a company to have all the patents of technical standards.
681000	682000	This is impossible.
682000	686000	It must be a segment.
686000	688000	It must be cut into many segments.
688000	690000	Some companies focus on that.
690000	692000	Some companies focus on that.
692000	694000	For example, you can see Radio Front End.
694000	699000	Although the patents of Ericsson and Qualcomm are similar,
699000	702000	it also means that there are a lot of things that Qualcomm can't do.
702000	707000	So today I'm going to talk to you about this.
707000	710000	This industry is very dense.
711000	718000	This patent is called SEP.
718000	727000	SEP stands for Standard Essential Patents.
727000	739000	The holders of SEP, such as Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel,
739000	742000	are considered to be these players.
742000	751000	If people all over the world use this standard,
751000	754000	can they boost the price?
754000	755000	If people all over the world use this standard,
755000	757000	can they boost the price?
757000	763000	In order to prevent this from happening,
763000	764000	this is one point.
764000	768000	Another point is that it can take advantage of the patent status of the market.
768000	772000	Because patents are legal monopolies.
772000	774000	You can understand it this way.
774000	777000	Most people don't study law.
777000	781000	If you want to ask me how to understand patents,
781000	783000	the way to understand it is very simple.
783000	792000	It is a law that gives you the right to monopolize.
792000	796000	It allows you to have the right to monopolize within a period of time.
796000	799000	For your technology, for your patent.
799000	802000	So it is a limited monopoly.
802000	806000	After these people have patents,
806000	811000	if these patents or technologies are used as standards,
811000	814000	it can increase their price infinitely.
814000	822000	Isn't that against the purpose of these technical standards organizations I just mentioned?
822000	825000	Because the price is too high, no one can use it.
825000	828000	If I want to pay so much, who will think about my rights?
828000	836000	So in this atmosphere, in this concept,
836000	841000	all technical standards organizations in the process of setting standards,
841000	845000	remember that this structural organization in the process of setting standards,
845000	849000	it will require all technical standards organizations,
849000	852000	all SEPs,
852000	855000	you have to provide an LOA.
855000	860000	You have to accept the conditions provided by the technical standards organization.
860000	863000	That is to say, you want to become a 3G standard,
863000	867000	for example, or 3G or 4G or 5G standards in the future.
867000	870000	But your patent price must be within a certain range.
870000	875000	But the condition of this range, we call it FRAMED.
875000	878000	Let me stop for a moment.
878000	881000	Because I really can't see everyone's conversation.
881000	884000	Does anyone have any questions now?
884000	887000	Let's take a look.
887000	890000	It seems that no one has asked me a question.
890000	893000	If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, it doesn't matter.
893000	896000	If there is no problem, I will continue to speak.
896000	900000	Because I found that there is no social science background,
900000	903000	I have to speak particularly slowly.
903000	913000	The full name of FRAMED is Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory Licensing.
913000	921000	FRAMED is included in the conditions provided by all technical standards organizations.
921000	924000	This condition actually includes a lot.
924000	927000	If you are interested, you can check it.
927000	932000	One of the most important conditions is that your patent must be used as a standard.
932000	935000	You can use your technology to become my 5G standard.
935000	942000	You can provide your patent and submit your patent application.
942000	946000	But you have to accept FRAMED's restrictions.
946000	947000	Why?
947000	951000	Because, as I said, you can't raise the price too high.
951000	954000	If the price is too high, everyone will not use it.
954000	957000	The other point is the box below.
957000	960000	The box below is the implementer.
960000	966000	What I mean by implementer is, for example, our great HTC.
966000	970000	HTC may have some patents, but it is not a player.
970000	976000	HTC is not the patent holders we just saw in the picture.
976000	982000	HTC is simply a person who is authorized to use the technical standards they have.
982000	985000	Then I use it and I adopt the technology.
985000	987000	We call it implementers.
987000	990000	It is not a person who develops modern chips.
990000	993000	Simply put, HTC is the same as Apple.
993000	995000	Of course, if you pay attention to this industry,
995000	1000000	Apple has already released a message that it wants to step in.
1000000	1002000	It also wants to make its own chips.
1002000	1005000	If you are interested in the future, you can talk to me.
1005000	1007000	It's a matter of whether you can do it or not.
1007000	1010000	In fact, there are still some entry barriers.
1010000	1013000	First, you have to accept it.
1013000	1016000	You have to accept it in the SEP holders.
1016000	1018000	You have to become a technical standard.
1018000	1019000	You have to accept Friend.
1019000	1027000	Second, the condition of Friend will not be limited to the relationship between you and the technical standard organization.
1027000	1031000	It will have a third-party interest.
1031000	1034000	We call it a third-party interest contract.
1035000	1046000	The efficiency of these terms will affect the third person.
1046000	1049000	The meaning of the third person is to include HTC.
1049000	1053000	HTC is not an SEP holder.
1053000	1058000	HTC is not an SEP holder, but its efficiency will affect the third person.
1058000	1063000	So everyone can enjoy the benefits of Friend.
1063000	1071000	For example, HTC also uses the 3G, 4G, or 5G patents of these technical standard organizations.
1071000	1075000	You can't say that I'm not in this technical standard organization.
1075000	1079000	Or I didn't participate in the process of designing this technical standard organization.
1079000	1084000	So these SEP holders raised my price very high.
1084000	1085000	No way.
1086000	1103000	Basically, these SEP holders join the technical standard organization and submit their patents to the technical standard organization as a prerequisite for the 5G standard.
1103000	1105000	You have to accept these two conditions.
1105000	1111000	First, the price of your patent must be within a reasonable range.
1111000	1115000	Second, it will affect the third party.
1115000	1123000	As long as everyone wants to use this technical standard, everyone can enjoy the benefits of Friend.
1123000	1128000	I won't give you a discount because you are in a technical standard organization.
1128000	1130000	No one else will.
1130000	1132000	But I made a signal here.
1132000	1136000	My research is in this area.
1136000	1140000	The source of all problems is here.
1141000	1146000	It's because of the so-called market monopoly.
1146000	1147000	Why?
1147000	1148000	Think about it.
1148000	1153000	Who are the members of all the technical standard organizations?
1153000	1157000	Isn't it the so-called industry leaders?
1157000	1158000	Because who sets the technical standards?
1158000	1160000	It must be the industry leaders.
1160000	1165000	If everyone gathers together in these industry leaders to have a meeting,
1165000	1167000	Taiwanese people may not know much about this law.
1167000	1172000	It seems that many manufacturers sit in a row together to eat and discuss things.
1172000	1175000	It seems to be very simple and there is no legal problem.
1175000	1176000	Let me tell you.
1176000	1177000	The problem is here.
1177000	1188000	The problem is that the U.S. Anti-Trust Law and the so-called EU Competition Law strictly prohibit this from occurring.
1188000	1193000	This prohibition is actually a so-called joint pricing behavior.
1193000	1200000	The U.S. Anti-Trust Law has many different review standards.
1200000	1205000	The most taboo thing is the so-called joint pricing.
1205000	1210000	A bunch of competitors in the same industry.
1210000	1213000	For example, Ericsson also has a patent.
1213000	1217000	It is also in the ETSI, ITU, and IEE.
1217000	1219000	Qualcomm is also a member.
1219000	1223000	Because they all submit their patents and join their members.
1223000	1228000	So this group of people are all competitors in the same industry.
1228000	1230000	All set standards here.
1230000	1237000	Of course, as a government role, the government will be very worried about this matter.
1237000	1238000	Are you guys doing something?
1238000	1239000	Why?
1239000	1240000	Think from another perspective.
1241000	1243000	Friend is what we just talked about.
1243000	1247000	The problem with Friend is that I promised you today.
1247000	1248000	SEP or not.
1248000	1250000	I promised you to set the price of Friend.
1250000	1252000	But this is for everyone.
1252000	1257000	All SEP holders must require this condition.
1257000	1259000	What about this technical standard organization?
1260000	1272000	For example, if I ask for 5%, the price of Friend is 5% for each product.
1272000	1273000	5% may be too high.
1273000	1275000	1% is called Friend.
1275000	1277000	Think about it.
1277000	1280000	If such a condition appears.
1280000	1283000	What is the price of Friend?
1283000	1286000	What is the reasonable and non-discriminatory price?
1286000	1289000	Everyone can only charge 1%.
1289000	1293000	In fact, from the perspective of the government, it will feel strange.
1293000	1297000	Why did you all create this RATE together?
1297000	1299000	Is there a joint pricing behavior?
1299000	1301000	So this problem is stuck.
1301000	1305000	This technical standard organization, I call it SSO.
1305000	1307000	It's easy for me to say.
1307000	1309000	SSO will worry.
1309000	1313000	If everyone is investigating me, everyone is doubting me.
1313000	1315000	Am I doing joint pricing over there?
1315000	1317000	Because I said a sentence.
1317000	1319000	The price of Friend is 1%.
1319000	1323000	Am I not being investigated all day?
1323000	1325000	So the problem is here.
1325000	1329000	Although it is a very important organization.
1329000	1330000	It made Friend.
1330000	1333000	It requires everyone to accept Friend.
1333000	1337000	But it is not responsible for the so-called pricing behavior.
1337000	1340000	Because of this, what is Friend?
1341000	1343000	I can report to everyone.
1343000	1345000	What is Friend?
1345000	1347000	In the legal circle.
1347000	1351000	There are many discussions in the paper of the Chamber of Commerce.
1351000	1352000	Too much.
1352000	1355000	Because no one really dares to go to court.
1355000	1359000	It should be said that the court itself or the government unit.
1359000	1363000	He never dared to respond positively to this matter.
1363000	1365000	Includes his definition.
1365000	1367000	He has his calculation method.
1367000	1369000	But every court in the United States.
1369000	1372000	Are using different methods of calculation.
1372000	1374000	Today.
1374000	1377000	So this thing is actually complicated.
1377000	1378000	OK.
1378000	1382000	In fact, I will introduce this kind of background to everyone today.
1382000	1386000	Because I think this thing needs to be explained to everyone.
1386000	1388000	Then his background state.
1388000	1391000	Then I can get into what we are studying.
1391000	1395000	Because of this, everyone will have the so-called level playing field.
1395000	1398000	That is, everyone has a rough idea of ​​this matter.
1398000	1400000	I know what I am studying.
1400000	1402000	I'm getting into my stuff.
1402000	1404000	This is easier for everyone to understand.
1404000	1407000	Before we officially start talking.
1407000	1410000	Before this fun case.
1410000	1411000	Let me ask you first.
1411000	1414000	The simple industry I just introduced.
1414000	1416000	Or some knowledge background.
1416000	1419000	Is there any problem with the introduction?
1420000	1421000	Talk.
1429000	1430000	5 seconds.
1430000	1431000	3, 5, 4.
1431000	1433000	No problem so far.
1433000	1434000	OK.
1434000	1437000	No problem, very good.
1437000	1439000	But if you have any questions, you are welcome.
1439000	1441000	I also want to train.
1441000	1443000	Talk to people in the legal field.
1443000	1445000	See what you think.
1445000	1446000	OK.
1446000	1447000	After having such background knowledge.
1447000	1449000	Then we know that the technical standards have a lot of patents.
1449000	1450000	OK.
1450000	1453000	He has to authorize him to be restricted by this regulation.
1453000	1455000	Then he has a third-party regulation.
1455000	1457000	So everyone can enjoy the friend.
1457000	1458000	OK.
1458000	1459000	Good.
1459000	1462000	Then there is that we all know that the modern chip is selling.
1462000	1464000	Usually there are a lot of patents behind.
1464000	1465000	OK.
1465000	1466000	So just about summary.
1466000	1467000	Summary is like this.
1467000	1470000	The problem is that we all know.
1470000	1474000	I just mentioned that Qualcomm is an industry leader.
1474000	1475000	OK.
1475000	1477000	The quality of the modern chip is very good.
1477000	1481000	Then he is also Apple's long-term supplier.
1481000	1482000	OK.
1482000	1488000	But last year, at the beginning of 2017.
1488000	1492000	The US Federal Trade Commission FTC.
1492000	1494000	And Apple itself.
1494000	1497000	Apple is his downstream manufacturer.
1497000	1498000	OK.
1498000	1501000	Then he specifically has a lot of this kind of claim.
1501000	1503000	That is, he has advocated many things.
1503000	1507000	What I want to focus on today is that Qualcomm is on the so-called contract.
1507000	1509000	Playing with everyone in a so-called.
1509000	1511000	Uh, he uses his position in the market.
1511000	1513000	And then to achieve his goal of making profits.
1513000	1515000	So how does he do this?
1515000	1516000	First of all.
1516000	1517000	This picture is actually public.
1517000	1518000	It's not me.
1518000	1519000	It's not that beautiful.
1519000	1520000	This picture is when Apple is suing Qualcomm.
1520000	1521000	He added his.
1521000	1524000	This content of the prosecution and his analysis of the picture.
1524000	1525000	That is, how Qualcomm.
1525000	1548000	How does Qualcomm do it and how does he do it?
1548000	1562000	Basically, Qualcomm's approach is divided into two stages.
1562000	1570000	Qualcomm's two-stage behavior is that before Qualcomm officially became Apple's supplier in 2007,
1570000	1590000	Qualcomm already had a contract with Apple's assembly plant.
1590000	1594000	If you want to assemble, you will also use Qualcomm's patent.
1594000	1596000	Because Qualcomm's patent layout is very wide.
1596000	1598000	In fact, I just gave a simple example.
1598000	1605000	If you look at it, Qualcomm's patent layout has exceeded the scope of Modern Chip itself.
1605000	1607000	It contains the entire technical standard.
1607000	1609000	This is what he said.
1609000	1611000	I also believe that this is the case.
1611000	1614000	If you look at Qualcomm, it was established in 1985.
1614000	1619000	Then continue to develop in the communication chip industry.
1619000	1623000	Then continue to expand the patent layout of his business.
1623000	1628000	So in fact, the influence of his business is not just in the Modern Chip itself.
1628000	1634000	It also contains the entire technical standard.
1634000	1639000	So Qualcomm has been cooperating with Apple's suppliers.
1639000	1642000	Because Apple's supplier, for example, I just said Fushkang.
1642000	1645000	Fushkang is not just an Apple product.
1645000	1647000	He also does other things, such as HP.
1647000	1650000	You do other products.
1650000	1652000	HP's, for example, subscriber.
1652000	1658000	Qualcomm's patent or technology will also be used.
1658000	1661000	Also need to do patent authorization.
1662000	1670000	So it turns out that Qualcomm has been cooperating with Apple's other suppliers.
1670000	1672000	So why did I mention Apple's supplier?
1672000	1673000	The complexity is here.
1673000	1676000	Because Qualcomm did a very interesting thing.
1676000	1679000	Before he became Apple's supplier.
1679000	1685000	He told Apple's supplier that I signed a contract with you.
1685000	1690000	You want to assemble this Apple product.
1690000	1692000	Then I will collect this patent with you.
1692000	1697000	But the content of this patent, the scope, the content, the specific details.
1697000	1700000	How is it NDA?
1700000	1704000	Non-Disclosure Agreement is not open to the public.
1704000	1706000	What about other things?
1706000	1710000	Because this is a bit complicated.
1710000	1716000	But simply put, Qualcomm and Apple's assembly plant today.
1716000	1718000	Then do the patent authorization.
1718000	1724000	These assembly plants can actually come back and ask Apple for reimbursement.
1724000	1730000	Because the assembly plant feels that there is no need to bear this responsibility anymore.
1730000	1732000	Because this contract is actually negotiable.
1732000	1737000	But in the real world, I can report to everyone.
1737000	1740000	In fact, most of the money in Taiwan's assembly plant.
1740000	1746000	A lot of money has become Apple to squeeze.
1746000	1749000	Of course, Apple will say that I did not squeeze them.
1749000	1753000	Of course, in this case, Qualcomm is.
1753000	1758000	Qualcomm claims that I have been working with these assembly plants today.
1758000	1764000	Then I asked them to pay me the rights to these patents.
1764000	1768000	If you don't want to pay this right, you can go back to Apple.
1768000	1770000	You don't have to pay this money.
1770000	1771000	Does Apple pay for you?
1771000	1773000	But the fun thing is here.
1774000	1777000	Qualcomm, I just said that Qualcomm is SEP.
1777000	1782000	In fact, its SEP is a range.
1782000	1785000	Its range is the so-called Friend.
1785000	1790000	OK, it is fair and reasonable.
1790000	1793000	It must be reasonable and non-discriminatory.
1793000	1796000	But it signed the NDA with these assembly plants.
1796000	1799000	Then think about it, if you are Apple.
1799000	1805000	Then there is a chip that I want to use Qualcomm.
1805000	1807000	As a result, I use Qualcomm chips.
1807000	1810000	The assembly plant below me has been asking me for money.
1810000	1814000	Qualcomm and I have received more money.
1814000	1816000	Then you have to compensate me.
1816000	1818000	Then how much compensation?
1818000	1820000	Then how much according to the contract?
1820000	1823000	Then Qualcomm asked him why it was this price.
1823000	1828000	Apple asked those assembly plants why it was this price.
1828000	1830000	As a result, the assembly plant said I can't tell you.
1830000	1832000	Why? Because Qualcomm said this is NDA.
1832000	1834000	I can't tell you.
1834000	1837000	OK, so this is amazing.
1837000	1842000	The first stage is that Qualcomm went to Apple's assembly plant for a sum of money.
1842000	1846000	Then the source of this sum of money is NDA.
1846000	1847000	It is not public.
1847000	1850000	Then it becomes that Apple can only accept it unilaterally.
1850000	1852000	Because the account is there.
1852000	1854000	Qualcomm asked me for so much money.
1855000	1858000	Then Apple transferred the money to Apple.
1858000	1861000	Then Apple can only accept it unilaterally.
1861000	1863000	Apple thinks it's strange.
1863000	1865000	Is this price reasonable?
1865000	1867000	But I asked my assembly plant below me.
1867000	1869000	He can't say.
1869000	1871000	OK, that's weird.
1871000	1875000	OK, so Apple actually wants to get rid of this state.
1875000	1877000	How much did I pay Qualcomm?
1877000	1878000	I don't know.
1878000	1881000	I should say that I don't even know my source and my calculation method.
1881000	1882000	I just kept paying for it.
1882000	1884000	He thinks it's unreasonable.
1884000	1886000	It feels like the price is inside.
1886000	1890000	Managers or lawyers or lawyers feel that this price may be unreasonable.
1890000	1892000	Qualcomm wants too much money.
1892000	1895000	He decided to talk to Qualcomm directly.
1895000	1897000	OK, so this picture is later.
1897000	1900000	Apple went to talk to Qualcomm.
1900000	1905000	After he went to talk, Apple said, OK, I can sign a contract with you.
1905000	1908000	This contract is the gray part below.
1908000	1911000	It includes BCPA, TA, FTA, SDA, ASDA.
1911000	1914000	These are all the abbreviations of this contract.
1914000	1919000	BCPA, for example, is full name is Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement.
1919000	1922000	TA is Transition Agreement, etc.
1922000	1924000	Anyway, it's an abbreviation.
1924000	1929000	In these contracts, Qualcomm and Apple went to talk.
1929000	1932000	Then Apple felt very uncomfortable.
1932000	1935000	You're going through my assembly plant in the middle.
1936000	1937000	I want to talk to you directly.
1937000	1939000	OK, I'll talk to you directly.
1939000	1940000	Qualcomm agreed.
1940000	1942000	After he agreed, he signed these contracts.
1942000	1946000	But he added some conditions to these contracts.
1946000	1947000	These conditions are fun.
1947000	1949000	This is what you see now.
1949000	1952000	Rebate Agreement and Chipset Supply Agreement.
1952000	1953000	These two.
1953000	1955000	It sounds very simple.
1955000	1957000	In fact, the specific content looks like this.
1957000	1959000	This is the lawsuit.
1959000	1962000	This is mentioned in the Apple lawsuit.
1962000	1964000	Of course, it contains a lot of confidential documents.
1964000	1967000	I don't know what the confidential thing is.
1967000	1969000	The main thing is these two.
1969000	1972000	One is that you have to promise me.
1972000	1977000	You want me to provide Qualcomm to provide you chips.
1977000	1985000	The US Federal Trade Commission uses a word called No License, No Chip, No License.
1985000	1987000	It's the other way around.
1987000	1988000	Sorry.
1988000	1989000	It's No License, No Chip.
1989000	1994000	He said, OK, you want me to supply my high-quality modern chip.
1994000	1996000	Yes, but you have to accept this price.
1996000	1999000	Accept this.
1999000	2003000	You have to accept a certain price for my SEP.
2003000	2008000	Then he found out inside Apple that the price was a bit higher than the market.
2008000	2011000	But Qualcomm said, what can you do?
2011000	2013000	If you don't accept this price.
2013000	2017000	Then I can't provide you with this modern chip.
2017000	2019000	So these two are bundled together.
2019000	2023000	The so-called bundle is to say that I'm going to sell you a modern chip today.
2023000	2027000	Yes, but you have to accept an Apple.
2027000	2030000	In fact, this case is still running.
2030000	2033000	The so-called price is not a friend.
2033000	2034000	The so-called price is not a friend.
2034000	2038000	It is possible that everyone in the market public thinks that these SEPs are 1%.
2038000	2040000	But sorry, I want 5% from you.
2040000	2043000	The 5% sales price.
2043000	2045000	But because Qualcomm's quality is good.
2045000	2047000	Then he is a market leader again.
2047000	2049000	Then there are a lot of patents.
2049000	2051000	So Apple has to accept this thing.
2051000	2053000	Okay, this is the first point.
2053000	2055000	His so-called no license, no chip.
2055000	2057000	The policy is that I must accept you.
2057000	2062000	You have to, you have to, you have to, Apple has to accept his contract terms.
2062000	2067000	In return, it means that you want me to use his, I use Qualcomm's modern chip.
2067000	2071000	But I have to accept a higher friend price.
2072000	2074000	The second point is.
2074000	2076000	Okay, you want me to supply this, right?
2076000	2082000	But Qualcomm, in order to make Apple feel that I did not treat you badly.
2082000	2084000	He provides a rebate from the top.
2084000	2087000	This rebate is a fixed total price.
2087000	2091000	That is to say, because you are my customer for a long time.
2091000	2094000	Use my communication chip.
2094000	2096000	Then I will give you a return.
2096000	2097000	Let you continue to use.
2097000	2099000	But the fun thing is coming again.
2099000	2101000	Always hurt everyone.
2101000	2105000	If I, because everyone is not learning law or business, it is in the mall.
2105000	2110000	All the conditions, all the benefits, or the so-called rebate, this kind of return.
2110000	2111000	I'll give you a sum of money.
2111000	2113000	Ah, it's all conditional.
2113000	2115000	Qualcomm said yes.
2115000	2117000	Uh, Apple said yes.
2117000	2118000	Then you give me back.
2118000	2119000	You give me a return.
2119000	2121000	But Qualcomm said yes.
2121000	2123000	I'll give you a return.
2123000	2125000	But you have to accept the following conditions.
2125000	2127000	The following conditions are two.
2127000	2129000	Ah, this condition includes the following.
2129000	2131000	Chipset Supply Agreement.
2131000	2133000	What does this condition include?
2133000	2137000	First, you have to continue to use my communication chip.
2137000	2139000	You can't jump.
2139000	2141000	You can't run to use Intel.
2141000	2143000	You can't run to use.
2143000	2145000	Ah, Samsung or whatever.
2145000	2148000	You can't run to use my competitor's chip.
2148000	2149000	Does this sound reasonable?
2149000	2151000	OK, it seems like nothing.
2151000	2153000	OK, what about the second point?
2153000	2154000	It's just fun.
2155000	2161000	You can't go to any government unit to investigate me.
2161000	2163000	Ah, you can't sue me.
2163000	2165000	You can't issue a patent lawsuit.
2165000	2168000	You can't use any other government.
2168000	2171000	You can't start a lawsuit to investigate me.
2171000	2174000	OK, that's actually controversial.
2174000	2177000	OK, one is that I provide a return.
2177000	2181000	Ah, but you have to continue to use my chip.
2182000	2185000	Ah, this is called the so-called Boundary Bait.
2185000	2188000	OK, the second is that you want to use.
2188000	2190000	You want me to provide a return.
2190000	2191000	You can, no problem.
2191000	2193000	But you can't sue me.
2193000	2195000	OK, so there are two points.
2195000	2197000	One is that I let you not investigate me.
2197000	2199000	It completely locks you up.
2199000	2203000	OK, the other point is that you can't jump.
2203000	2205000	You can't jump to another place.
2205000	2207000	And then you can't.
2208000	2211000	You can't sue me.
2211000	2213000	So this makes Apple very upset.
2213000	2217000	Because he thinks I can't use other people's.
2217000	2220000	Ah, I can't use other people's chips.
2220000	2224000	And then you use the so-called No License No Chip in front of me.
2224000	2225000	And then the price is so high.
2225000	2227000	OK, the price is so high.
2227000	2229000	And then you don't let me start a lawsuit.
2229000	2232000	And then I don't know what the hell you're doing.
2232000	2234000	And then you're the market monopoly.
2234000	2236000	And then the whole thing comes together.
2236000	2238000	Ah, that's just the whole case.
2238000	2240000	The whole thing comes together.
2240000	2242000	Just let Apple jump.
2242000	2246000	And, uh, it triggered a lot of, uh, the EU.
2246000	2249000	And that China, Taiwan, Taiwan.
2249000	2250000	Maybe you've heard of it.
2250000	2252000	He's also investigating this.
2252000	2253000	And then the United States.
2253000	2257000	And then the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating this whole thing.
2257000	2259000	What is his legitimacy?
2260000	2264000	OK, so what we're talking about in this paper is.
2264000	2269000	Say, uh, one thing we want to study is.
2269000	2273000	What is the reason behind what Qualcomm is doing?
2273000	2276000	Why does Qualcomm want to provide?
2276000	2280000	Uh, this is the return to Apple.
2280000	2282000	Because you can think about it.
2282000	2285000	If Qualcomm's quality is so good.
2285000	2286000	Right?
2286000	2287000	Right?
2287000	2288000	Good quality.
2288000	2289000	Ah, it's the market monopoly again.
2289000	2292000	Why does he provide a return to Apple?
2292000	2293000	Right?
2293000	2294000	Because I'm lying down.
2294000	2296000	I'm lying down and Apple's coming.
2296000	2298000	You can think about it.
2298000	2299000	That's the question.
2299000	2300000	I think it's interesting.
2300000	2303000	If you're a market monopoly.
2303000	2306000	And then basically everyone's products.
2306000	2308000	Almost all of them will use my modern chip.
2308000	2309000	And then.
2309000	2311000	And then my quality.
2311000	2313000	People can't catch up with me.
2313000	2314000	For example, he mentioned Intel in it.
2314000	2316000	Intel doesn't matter to him at all.
2316000	2318000	He can't catch up with me at all.
2318000	2319000	Ah, there's a very high entry barrier.
2319000	2320000	You might.
2320000	2322000	I don't know if you've learned this.
2322000	2324000	I personally think he's on the entry barrier.
2324000	2325000	It's pretty high.
2325000	2327000	The cost of this investment is very high.
2327000	2330000	Ah, so.
2330000	2332000	This question has always been this question.
2332000	2334000	It becomes the core of our paper.
2334000	2335000	That is, if Qualcomm.
2335000	2339000	He's in a position that's close to a market monopoly.
2339000	2341000	Or he's in a market leadership position.
2341000	2342000	And then?
2342000	2343000	The layout of the patent is so wide.
2343000	2346000	OK, and then the quality of the product is also very good.
2346000	2349000	So why did he provide this rebate to Apple?
2349000	2351000	Ah, that's what he did in the real world.
2351000	2353000	And provide this rebate.
2353000	2354000	This one.
2354000	2356000	I'm going to tell you about this contract.
2356000	2357000	This deadline.
2357000	2359000	It's not even a year or two.
2359000	2360000	It's three to five years.
2360000	2361000	During the period.
2361000	2364000	So, in fact, he continues to provide this rebate.
2364000	2365000	And then.
2365000	2367000	Provide such a return to this Apple.
2367000	2370000	And then the two requirements are that you have to continue to use it.
2370000	2371000	And then you can't investigate me.
2371000	2372000	And then.
2372000	2373000	Uh, you have to.
2373000	2375000	And then you have to accept my friend.
2375000	2376000	You have to accept me.
2376000	2378000	This seems to be similar.
2378000	2380000	This is not the price of the friend.
2380000	2382000	In fact, even the price of the friend is controversial.
2382000	2383000	I'm not going to.
2383000	2385000	Uh, not in today's.
2385000	2386000	Within the scope of the report.
2386000	2387000	Because.
2387000	2388000	Because you say everything.
2388000	2389000	Apple says you're not a friend.
2389000	2391000	Qualcomm says I'm a friend.
2391000	2392000	Because I include the whole.
2392000	2395000	This is the patent I authorize you to give.
2395000	2397000	It's all about this.
2397000	2398000	This know-how.
2399000	2400000	And this.
2400000	2401000	The so-called technical standards.
2401000	2402000	Of course.
2402000	2403000	The price is so high.
2403000	2404000	It's reasonable.
2404000	2405000	So, of course, it's not reasonable.
2405000	2406000	This is.
2406000	2407000	Uh, the industry's problem.
2407000	2408000	So, today.
2408000	2411000	The problem is on this rebate.
2411000	2413000	So, today, I'm going to tell you a little bit about it.
2413000	2414000	That is to say.
2414000	2415000	The point I focused on today.
2415000	2416000	It's also this paper.
2416000	2417000	Me and that.
2417000	2420000	The focus of the study with the classmate is.
2420000	2422000	Why Qualcomm, he will.
2422000	2425000	So insistent on providing rebate.
2425000	2426000	This thing.
2426000	2427000	OK.
2427000	2428000	Okay.
2428000	2429000	Uh.
2429000	2431000	I'll pause it again.
2431000	2435000	See if you have any understanding of this case.
2435000	2437000	Hey.
2437000	2440000	Do you understand the story I just told you?
2440000	2444000	Because I don't know if you understand this story.
2444000	2451000	Content.
2451000	2452000	Hello.
2452000	2453000	Do you understand?
2453000	2455000	This story.
2456000	2457000	OK.
2457000	2458000	All right.
2458000	2460000	I think if I didn't listen.
2460000	2461000	Uh, listen.
2461000	2462000	Does anyone not understand?
2462000	2463000	That's what I should say.
2463000	2465000	I don't understand which link.
2465000	2466000	OK.
2466000	2467000	If you don't understand.
2467000	2473000	Can you tell me which link you don't understand?
2473000	2475000	Because he's a little bit complicated about this thing.
2475000	2476000	Because I.
2476000	2477000	Uh.
2477000	2479000	This thing involves my graduation thesis.
2479000	2480000	So, he.
2480000	2481000	Some small and complex.
2481000	2484000	Some of the details of the industry's content.
2484000	2486000	Let's see if you have any.
2486000	2488000	Which side I just said a little bit.
2488000	2489000	I don't understand.
2489000	2492000	Is there?
2492000	2493000	Good.
2493000	2494000	54321.
2494000	2495000	Good.
2495000	2496000	Just pretend.
2496000	2497000	Just pretend you understand.
2497000	2498000	Good.
2498000	2499000	Good.
2499000	2500000	OK.
2500000	2501000	Good.
2501000	2502000	No one.
2502000	2503000	There is a response.
2503000	2504000	OK.
2504000	2505000	Just pretend to understand.
2505000	2506000	Good.
2506000	2507000	On the basis of this posture.
2507000	2508000	We know.
2508000	2510000	The love-hate relationship between Apple and Qualcomm.
2510000	2511000	It's just like this.
2511000	2513000	It was sued like this last year.
2513000	2514000	That.
2514000	2515000	This.
2515000	2516000	For me.
2516000	2517000	At the beginning of this paper.
2517000	2518000	First.
2518000	2519000	Uh.
2519000	2520000	He is a.
2520000	2521000	Uh.
2521000	2522000	The cross-section is a cross-domain.
2522000	2524000	But the cooperation paper is like this.
2524000	2526000	What I'm in charge of is the legal analysis.
2526000	2527000	Then my partner is.
2527000	2528000	Responsible for the study.
2528000	2530000	Game theory model.
2530000	2531000	The introduction.
2531000	2532000	And then.
2532000	2533000	And from a commercial perspective.
2533000	2534000	And.
2534000	2535000	Uh.
2535000	2536000	Economic perspective.
2536000	2537000	To analyze this whole thing.
2537000	2538000	The first is.
2538000	2540000	Everyone is already curious.
2540000	2542000	But from my point of view.
2542000	2544000	Is there a similar case in the past?
2544000	2546000	Or in this kind of debate.
2546000	2547000	The case.
2547000	2549000	How did they judge?
2549000	2551000	Or what is the result of their judgment?
2551000	2553000	Then I will report to you.
2553000	2554000	Just.
2554000	2555000	Simply put.
2555000	2557000	It's this thing.
2557000	2558000	This problem.
2558000	2559000	Even the court itself.
2559000	2560000	It's hard to get it done.
2560000	2562000	OK.
2562000	2563000	That.
2563000	2564000	Uh.
2564000	2565000	The picture.
2565000	2566000	What you see on the screen.
2566000	2567000	The red part.
2567000	2568000	Uh.
2568000	2569000	Represents.
2569000	2570000	The court is.
2570000	2571000	Uh.
2571000	2572000	The red part right.
2572000	2573000	The page.
2573000	2574000	These.
2574000	2575000	This red case is the court.
2575000	2576000	Sentence.
2576000	2577000	The defendant is like.
2577000	2578000	Uh.
2578000	2580000	This kind of company like Gaotong is illegal.
2580000	2582000	OK.
2582000	2584000	The black part is that I don't have a label.
2584000	2585000	I don't.
2585000	2587000	These cases in the black part.
2587000	2588000	Is.
2588000	2589000	The court believes.
2589000	2590000	Is.
2590000	2591000	Legally.
2591000	2592000	It's like this.
2592000	2593000	It's called.
2593000	2594000	You have to accept this.
2594000	2596000	If you want to use.
2596000	2597000	As if Gaotong.
2597000	2599000	The state of Gaotong I just talked about.
2599000	2600000	Is that if you want to use.
2600000	2601000	Use my.
2601000	2602000	Things you want.
2602000	2603000	Uh.
2603000	2604000	Become my supplier.
2604000	2605000	Can.
2605000	2606000	Uh.
2606000	2607000	Or I'm going to supply you with good stuff.
2607000	2608000	But you have to accept my conditions.
2608000	2609000	Or I.
2609000	2610000	Uh.
2610000	2611000	You can buy it.
2611000	2612000	But I.
2612000	2613000	You have to buy a certain amount.
2613000	2614000	Okay.
2614000	2615000	After buying a certain amount.
2615000	2616000	I'll give you a rebate.
2616000	2617000	It's a concept like this.
2617000	2618000	It's like this.
2618000	2619000	A transaction mode like this.
2619000	2620000	That's it.
2620000	2621000	These six cases.
2621000	2622000	I sorted it out.
2622000	2623000	That's because everyone is not legal.
2623000	2624000	OK.
2624000	2625000	That.
2625000	2626000	I won't say it one by one.
2626000	2627000	Ah.
2628000	2629000	That's actually the result.
2629000	2630000	His.
2630000	2631000	The result is analyzed.
2631000	2632000	The reason is also analyzed.
2632000	2633000	That.
2633000	2634000	Three red dots are.
2634000	2637000	These are the different courts.
2637000	2638000	For.
2638000	2639000	These cases.
2639000	2641000	The reason for the use.
2641000	2643000	So, as you can see.
2643000	2644000	A very special phenomenon is.
2644000	2645000	Hey.
2645000	2647000	On the subject of this rebate.
2647000	2649000	Or say this kind of bundle rebate.
2649000	2651000	Different courts have different reasons.
2651000	2652000	OK.
2652000	2653000	Also different results.
2653000	2654000	OK.
2654000	2655000	That.
2655000	2656000	I'll talk about it later.
2656000	2658000	That is, Qualcomm actually used this point.
2658000	2659000	Ah.
2659000	2660000	It's not a use.
2660000	2661000	That is to say, he should.
2661000	2662000	Maybe he saw this point.
2662000	2663000	We infer.
2663000	2664000	He saw this point.
2664000	2666000	It may also become his.
2666000	2667000	This.
2667000	2669000	To continue to use.
2669000	2671000	His bundle rebate.
2671000	2672000	To Apple.
2672000	2673000	OK.
2673000	2674000	This is a.
2674000	2675000	Our inference.
2675000	2676000	I'll mention it later.
2676000	2678000	This is my preliminary investigation.
2678000	2679000	Found that.
2679000	2680000	Ah.
2680000	2682000	If the defendant.
2682000	2683000	The black one.
2683000	2685000	The red case is illegal.
2686000	2687000	The black case is legal.
2687000	2688000	Then I'll see.
2688000	2689000	That red case.
2689000	2690000	What is illegal?
2690000	2691000	Common features.
2691000	2692000	The first.
2692000	2694000	Those illegal cases.
2694000	2695000	The red part.
2695000	2696000	I just showed you.
2696000	2697000	The red part.
2697000	2698000	These defendants.
2698000	2699000	In fact, all.
2699000	2700000	Ah.
2700000	2701000	Have some.
2701000	2703000	Market monopoly.
2703000	2704000	So.
2704000	2705000	If you are a.
2705000	2707000	Market monopoly.
2707000	2708000	Easy.
2708000	2709000	If you are a monopolist.
2709000	2711000	It may be easy to violate.
2711000	2712000	Antitrust law.
2712000	2713000	Ah.
2713000	2714000	This is in our.
2714000	2715000	Ah.
2715000	2717000	If you learn this in our law school.
2717000	2718000	Antitrust law.
2718000	2719000	Basically, this.
2719000	2720000	This.
2720000	2721000	This is a high probability.
2721000	2723000	If you have this market.
2723000	2725000	If the monopoly is basically easy.
2725000	2727000	This antitrust law.
2727000	2728000	This is.
2728000	2729000	Ah.
2729000	2730000	This is normal.
2730000	2731000	OK.
2731000	2732000	Then in this bundle.
2732000	2734000	In the context of the rebate.
2734000	2735000	It is also.
2735000	2736000	It's not an exception.
2736000	2737000	But we have seen.
2737000	2739000	The second point is very interesting.
2739000	2740000	We see the legal.
2740000	2742000	We compare these legal cases.
2742000	2743000	Ah.
2743000	2744000	It's the black one.
2744000	2745000	In those cases.
2745000	2746000	We found that.
2746000	2748000	The defendant is actually still possible.
2748000	2749000	Is legal.
2749000	2750000	Why?
2750000	2752000	Because imagine.
2752000	2753000	Today.
2753000	2754000	He's in front of him.
2754000	2755000	Uh.
2755000	2756000	That's what I just said.
2756000	2757000	In these black cases.
2757000	2758000	He has some.
2758000	2759000	Ah.
2759000	2760000	These judges.
2760000	2761000	Why?
2761000	2762000	In the same situation.
2762000	2764000	I think they are legal.
2764000	2766000	Because they don't have it at all.
2766000	2768000	Eliminate the effect.
2768000	2769000	OK.
2769000	2770000	In general.
2770000	2771000	Let's make it simple.
2771000	2772000	Is.
2772000	2774000	Anti-tax law is actually in the regulation.
2774000	2777000	Is a law of corporate behavior.
2777000	2778000	OK.
2778000	2780000	It is the law of market economy and corporate behavior.
2780000	2781000	So.
2781000	2782000	That.
2782000	2784000	The market economy must maintain a competitive attitude.
2784000	2786000	Instead of letting a person.
2786000	2787000	Independent or say.
2787000	2788000	Present a state of monopoly.
2788000	2790000	But imagine.
2790000	2791000	If he was originally today.
2791000	2792000	Although he is a.
2792000	2793000	Through.
2793000	2794000	Uh.
2794000	2795000	His sales behavior.
2795000	2797000	And then his innovative business model.
2797000	2798000	Achieve his.
2798000	2799000	The leadership position of the market.
2799000	2800000	But it's not monopoly.
2800000	2801000	Leadership position.
2801000	2802000	Then he wants to continue.
2802000	2803000	The.
2803000	2805000	When increasing his market share.
2805000	2806000	He might let.
2806000	2808000	Some other competitors.
2808000	2809000	Uh.
2809000	2811000	Some may have progress barriers.
2811000	2812000	Or what is the situation.
2812000	2814000	His elimination effect.
2814000	2815000	He might make some.
2815000	2817000	For example, killing competition or something.
2817000	2818000	His.
2818000	2820000	He might let some other competitors.
2820000	2821000	He can't come in.
2821000	2823000	Or potential competitors.
2823000	2825000	For example, like I just mentioned.
2825000	2826000	Intel.
2826000	2828000	Intel in the so-called.
2828000	2829000	This.
2829000	2830000	Computer CPU.
2830000	2831000	Everyone should know.
2831000	2832000	It's all done very well.
2832000	2833000	Ah.
2833000	2834000	This kind of patent.
2834000	2835000	The patent series are all very strong.
2835000	2837000	And then with this Microsoft.
2837000	2838000	In the late 90s.
2838000	2839000	It's almost.
2839000	2840000	This is.
2840000	2842000	It's almost all computers.
2842000	2843000	But.
2843000	2845000	He's in that communication chip.
2845000	2846000	He just can't stand still.
2846000	2848000	He just doesn't have the so-called.
2848000	2849000	This status.
2849000	2850000	That today.
2850000	2851000	Uh.
2851000	2852000	He's coming in today.
2852000	2853000	But in fact.
2853000	2854000	He's coming in.
2854000	2856000	He just needs to invest enough money.
2856000	2857000	In fact.
2858000	2860000	In fact, he is also doing it.
2860000	2861000	Just keep doing bad.
2861000	2862000	OK.
2862000	2864000	But it's not that he can't do it.
2864000	2865000	Ah.
2865000	2866000	There's a difference.
2866000	2867000	That is to say.
2867000	2868000	Let me talk about it again.
2868000	2869000	There's a difference.
2869000	2870000	It's the so-called can't do it.
2870000	2871000	That is to say, I.
2871000	2872000	I took advantage of some commercial behavior.
2872000	2873000	For example, I.
2873000	2874000	I join all the people.
2874000	2875000	I don't provide you with the material.
2875000	2876000	You can't do it.
2876000	2877000	But this doesn't work.
2877000	2878000	Ah.
2878000	2879000	This must be against.
2879000	2880000	This antitrust law.
2880000	2881000	Because this is against this.
2881000	2882000	This market competition.
2882000	2883000	The situation.
2883000	2884000	So now the situation is.
2884000	2885000	Hey.
2885000	2886000	We.
2886000	2887000	Observe the previous few black cases.
2887000	2888000	We found that.
2888000	2889000	Why are those cases legal?
2889000	2890000	Because of those potential intruders.
2890000	2891000	He wasn't excluded.
2891000	2892000	Enter this market.
2892000	2893000	He can still enter this market.
2893000	2894000	Competition.
2894000	2895000	It means that his entry barrier is low.
2895000	2896000	If the entry barrier is low.
2896000	2897000	The court sees that the entry barrier is low.
2897000	2898000	That's just to say.
2898000	2899000	You might come in today.
2899000	2900000	It's just that you chose not to come in.
2900000	2901000	Or you.
2901000	2902000	Maybe you have other commercial considerations.
2902000	2903000	Instead of coming in.
2903000	2904000	So.
2904000	2905000	Before this.
2905000	2906000	Before.
2906000	2907000	Let me go back again.
2907000	2908000	Before.
2908000	2909000	Before.
2909000	2910000	Before.
2910000	2911000	Before.
2911000	2912000	Before.
2912000	2913000	Before.
2913000	2914000	Before.
2914000	2915000	Before.
2915000	2916000	Before.
2916000	2917000	Before.
2917000	2918000	Why are these black cases from before legal?
2918000	2919000	Why are these Bando Rebellion legal?
2919000	2920000	Because.
2920000	2921000	Other competitors.
2921000	2922000	He.
2922000	2923000	It is not excluded.
2923000	2924000	It still came in.
2924000	2925000	It still joined this industry.
2925000	2926000	Continuing with.
2926000	2927000	These defendants are in competition.
2927000	2928000	Let's say the defendant is Gaoton.
2928000	2929000	It is still.
2929000	2930000	Still come in this industry to compete.
2930000	2931000	That's like what we're talking about today.
2931000	2932000	The case of Gaotong is not the only one.
2932000	2933000	Provide a modern chip.
2933000	2934000	Samsung also has.
2934000	2935000	Huawei also has.
2935000	2936000	OK, so it becomes.
2936000	2937000	It's me.
2937000	2938000	To provide a chip.
2938000	2939000	So.
2939000	2940000	Look at my phone.
2940000	2941000	You see.
2941000	2942000	I have a mobile phone.
2942000	2943000	I'm on his mobile phone.
2944000	2945000	So.
2945000	2946000	It becomes.
2946000	2947000	In this case.
2947000	2948000	In fact, there is a bit of a swing.
2948000	2949000	If you listen to me.
2949000	2950000	You know what I mean.
2950000	2951000	Although Gaotong.
2951000	2952000	He is in this market.
2952000	2953000	Based on monopoly status.
2953000	2954000	Based on this leadership status.
2954000	2955000	Then maybe.
2955000	2956000	There are some monopolies in sales.
2956000	2957000	Power.
2957000	2958000	Because his product quality is good.
2958000	2959000	But.
2959000	2960000	Other people are still in it.
2960000	2961000	Right.
2961000	2962000	Other players are also in it.
2962000	2963000	Other manufacturers are also in it.
2963000	2964000	So.
2964000	2965000	If you follow this.
2965000	2966000	The logic of the black case.
2966000	2967000	Then he might be illegal.
2967000	2968000	But according to the logic of the black case.
2968000	2969000	Then he might be illegal.
2969000	2970000	But according to the logic of the black case.
2970000	2971000	Then he might be illegal.
2971000	2972000	Then he might be illegal.
3032000	3033000	OK.
3033000	3034000	So on this matter.
3034000	3035000	In fact.
3035000	3036000	why.
3036000	3037000	Let me tell you.
3037000	3038000	Why Taiwan.
3038000	3039000	I personally think.
3039000	3040000	Why Taiwan.
3041000	3043000	Can't judge Gaotong so soon.
3043000	3044000	Illegal.
3044000	3045000	The reason is actually here.
3045000	3046000	The reason is actually here.
3046000	3047000	I'll share it with you.
3047000	3048000	I don't know if it's good to say that.
3048000	3049000	I don't know if it's good to say that.
3049000	3050000	But I personally think.
3050000	3051000	It is worth thinking about.
3051000	3052000	OK.
3052000	3053000	Every country has probably different.
3053000	3054000	OK.
3054000	3055000	Every country has probably different.
3055000	3056000	But I personally think.
3056000	3057000	Whether Gaotong is really illegal.
3057000	3058000	Whether Gaotong is really illegal.
3058000	3059000	Then you are like this.
3059000	3060000	A.
3060000	3061000	A law is going on.
3061000	3062000	Will you be influenced.
3062000	3063000	Other manufacturers are against this matter.
3063000	3064000	Other manufacturers are against this matter.
3064000	3065000	I think there are casualties.
3065000	3066000	I think there are casualties.
3066000	3067000	OK.
3067000	3068000	Since there are so many people in this business.
3068000	3069000	OK.
3069000	3070000	Since there are so many people in this industry.
3070000	3071000	Why is he being punished?
3071000	3072000	Why is he being punished?
3072000	3073000	You have to give a fair reason.
3073000	3074000	You have to give a fair reason.
3074000	3075000	The United States is a public debate country.
3075000	3076000	The United States is a public debate country.
3076000	3077000	So this thing no longer judged.
3077000	3078000	So this thing no longer judged.
3078000	3079000	So that's it for now.
3079000	3080000	So that's it for now.
3080000	3081000	So.
3081000	3082000	So.
3082000	3083000	The conclusion of this paper.
3083000	3084000	Is here, in this study.
3085000	3086000	And then there's a question in the paper.
3086000	3087000	That is the question in the paper.
3091000	3092000	The question is about why bottled readers continue to act on it.
3092000	3095000	The question is about why bottled readers continue to act on it.
3095000	3096000	Regardless of this green act.
3096000	3097000	Regardless of this green act.
3097000	3098000	Regardless of this green act.
3099000	3102000	Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.
3102000	3105000	Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.
3105000	3108000	Regardless of this green act which has already fallen.
3108000	3111000	Regardless of this green act which has already fallen.
3111000	3112000	Regardless of this red act which has already fallen.
3143000	3145000	After the model reads off,
3145000	3149000	After the model reads off,
3154000	3155000	we see some things in the model that we are spurred on.
3155000	3157000	we see some things in the model that we are spurred on.
3157000	3159000	We see some things in the model that we are spurred on.
3159000	3161000	Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.
3161000	3163000	Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.
3163000	3165000	Then we bring some possibilities of what the model might have in behind.
3165000	3166000	This is the case this model is one of the things.
3166000	3167000	And then from the business perspective.
3167000	3168000	and a law perspective
3168000	3169000	This is the case this model is one of the things.
3169000	3170000	Watching these things.
3171000	3172000	Then this is what we're doing.
3173000	3174000	One of the steps for how this paper answers the question.
3174000	3177000	One of the steps for how this paper answer the question.
3179000	3180000	Do you have any thoughts or questions?
3180000	3181000	Do you have any thoughts or questions?
3184000	3185000	Yes.
3189000	3190000	MRI is not in the scope of modem.
3194000	3195900	MRI is not in the scope of modem.
3197660	3198600	No blueprint is in the appraiser system
3198600	3200140	and has the blueprint design in a presupedit
3200600	3201700	and has the blueprint design in a prespedit
3207240	3208240	This is a bit complicated,
3210740	3211740	I believe if you're in engineering school,
3211740	3212740	I believe if you're in engineering school,
3212740	3214200	the math will be better than mine.
3214200	3214940	I just briefly talk about math
3214940	3217280	I just briefly talk about math
3217280	3218320	The story that we just heard
3218320	3221320	The story that we just heard
3221320	3224320	After hearing our story,
3224320	3225320	let's talk about assuming these mathematical models.
3225320	3227620	Let's talk about assuming these mathematical models.
3227640	3229900	First, for the game in the promotion theory,
3229900	3232140	First, for the game in the promotion theory,
3232140	3233440	we have three different games we play,
3233440	3236280	we have three different games we play,
3236280	3238280	One is One Stage Game
3238280	3240940	One is One Stage Game
3240940	3243660	is divided into the Exhaustive and Non-exhaustive.
3243660	3244940	OK
3244940	3247080	About Exhaustive, let me explain to you.
3247080	3249920	Just like the FRIEND I mentioned just now,
3249920	3251200	Just like the FRIEND I mentioned just now,
3251200	3253080	there is a so-called price issue.
3253080	3254760	Then why is there a FRIEND
3254780	3255620	What do you think is reasonable?
3255620	3258020	What do I think is unreasonable?
3258020	3262020	In fact, one of them is the amount
3262020	3265420	and the scope of authorization.
3265420	3266740	Apple thinks that
3266740	3269980	you sell me ModernChip today.
3269980	3271700	OK, you provide me with ModernChip.
3271700	3276020	The price of the sales
3276020	3278860	should include the price of the patent.
3278860	3280380	OK, this is a bit tricky.
3280380	3281900	Let me say it again.
3281920	3282840	Apple will think that
3282840	3285520	you provide me with ModernChip today.
3285520	3287440	OK, this is a price.
3287440	3290440	Let's say it's $100.
3290440	3292600	But it's not that cheap, $100.
3292600	3295040	OK, maybe this $100
3295040	3297240	already includes the price of the patent.
3297240	3300000	OK, so when you sell it to me,
3300000	3302600	there is a basic concept in the patent law.
3302600	3303600	I simply emphasize this.
3303600	3304880	You don't have to go into detail.
3304880	3306000	There is a concept in the patent law.
3306000	3311400	Once my patent is included in my product,
3311420	3313300	it will be sold together.
3313300	3317180	If this thing is bought by someone else,
3317180	3321180	for example, I have already paid once for Apple.
3321180	3323580	Do I have to pay again?
3323580	3324700	No.
3324700	3326140	Because Apple has already paid once.
3326140	3328700	It has already sold me the patent.
3328700	3332780	It has already sold me the price of ModernChip.
3332780	3336860	So why do I have to pay again?
3336860	3337220	Right?
3337220	3338220	Of course not.
3338220	3339500	So of course the core concept is
3339520	3341760	The core concept of Exaustive is that
3341760	3343760	there will be such a dispute because
3343760	3347520	Apple thinks that when Qualcomm provides ModernChip to me,
3347520	3350200	it already includes the price of all patents.
3350200	3353320	You shouldn't add another patent price
3353320	3355000	and raise it so high.
3355000	3356080	OK.
3356080	3359320	Qualcomm, of course, thinks no.
3359320	3360720	I authorize you
3360720	3362240	or I sell you ModernChip.
3362240	3367600	The patent I include is only a small part of my patent combination.
3367600	3369440	There are many patents.
3369460	3370980	You didn't use it.
3370980	3373620	So you have to pay extra.
3373620	3374820	Everyone should understand this.
3374820	3377860	Why do we design Exaustive and Non-Exaustive?
3377860	3378900	The reason is here.
3378900	3382260	Because this involves the business itself.
3382260	3384140	Now in this industry,
3384140	3386900	some of its game rules are played like this.
3386900	3387100	Right?
3387100	3393620	Because I originally supplied ModernChip to you.
3393620	3396460	It should include all prices,
3396460	3398100	including patent prices.
3398100	3399380	This is Apple's idea.
3399400	3401080	But Qualcomm doesn't think so.
3401080	3403960	Qualcomm thinks that I only give you a part.
3403960	3406760	There are many things you don't know.
3406760	3408520	So you have to pay more.
3408520	3410720	This is why I just said
3410720	3414520	Qualcomm's so-called No License, No Chip is reasonable.
3414520	3417000	Why does it dare to talk about this condition?
3417000	3418240	Because it dares to say
3418240	3420440	even if I supply ModernChip to you today,
3420440	3422000	I still have other patents that you haven't used.
3422000	3423280	So you have to pay more.
3423280	3425360	Otherwise, it's gone.
3425360	3425640	OK.
3425640	3429120	This is the so-called One Stage Non-Exhaustive.
3429300	3433140	Non-exhaustive is like a game.
3433140	3435660	Exhaustive contract game
3435660	3438580	is based on Apple's point of view.
3438580	3442020	Non-exhaustive is based on Qualcomm's point of view.
3442020	3444620	And then we go to the two-stage game.
3444620	3445300	This is interesting.
3445300	3448700	We go to the two-stage step
3448700	3451020	to run this model,
3451020	3453420	this Game Theory model.
3453420	3455260	In Exhaustive Game,
3455260	3456620	as we just mentioned,
3456640	3457760	that is to say,
3457760	3460400	because Apple thinks
3460400	3462200	you give me ModernChip,
3462200	3466040	it includes all patents.
3466040	3466440	OK.
3466440	3467760	Because it includes all patents.
3467760	3468920	So
3468920	3470040	the way it calculates
3470040	3473240	is the percentage of each chip.
3473240	3473880	That's it.
3473880	3474840	Non-exhaustive,
3474840	3479000	that may be because Qualcomm thinks
3479000	3482600	the patents in ModernChip are just a part of me.
3482600	3483320	OK.
3483320	3486520	So I have many other patents
3486540	3488460	that haven't been given to you yet.
3488460	3489980	So the money I added
3489980	3491900	is for the whole technology.
3491900	3493020	This is what Qualcomm said.
3493020	3494620	Qualcomm is very ambitious.
3494620	3496580	He said that my patent
3496580	3500220	laid out all the technical standards.
3500220	3501220	So what does he think?
3501220	3504260	What does he think Apple has to pay for?
3504260	3506060	The basis for Apple to pay for money
3506060	3507740	is the entire market value,
3507740	3509380	the value of the entire market,
3509380	3511740	not just the chip.
3511740	3512020	OK.
3512020	3514420	So this model
3514440	3516720	is based on the price.
3516720	3520640	The basic foundation of the price calculation method
3520640	3521680	is different.
3521680	3522200	OK.
3522200	3524320	In this exhaustive,
3524320	3526120	Apple's point of view
3526120	3528520	is that the price of patents
3528520	3532800	is calculated according to the percentage of each chip I sell.
3532800	3534880	But Qualcomm thinks it's wrong.
3534880	3538120	It should be calculated at the price of the entire market.
3538120	3538640	OK.
3538640	3538800	OK.
3538800	3542560	This is the calculation price of our two different games.
3542700	3545740	The price of the patent is different.
3545740	3549180	What about the two-stage game?
3549180	3549940	Intel,
3549940	3550700	we assume that
3550700	3552820	because Intel is a...
3552820	3553940	Although we just mentioned that
3553940	3556260	Intel is not a very good player
3556260	3558860	in the modern chip industry.
3558860	3561740	But it was mentioned in Qualcomm's petition.
3561740	3563100	It's a funny point.
3563100	3564140	Qualcomm's petition said
3564140	3565700	I don't know if you remember
3565700	3567820	that in 2016 or 2017,
3567820	3570620	in 2015, 2016, and 2017,
3570640	3573360	I forgot which year the iPhone 7 was launched.
3573360	3573560	OK.
3573560	3574560	In the past few years,
3574560	3578440	Apple has done so-called recycling in the iPhone 7.
3578440	3579920	They took the machine back.
3579920	3581960	One of the reasons is that there are some
3581960	3583920	problems with the quality of communication.
3583920	3585400	Then it is said that
3585400	3587440	this is what Qualcomm wrote in his petition.
3587440	3588280	It is said that
3588280	3591920	it is because Apple violated the contract.
3591920	3592680	It violated the contract.
3592680	3595920	It went to Intel
3595920	3598160	to use Intel's modern chip.
3598160	3600440	As a result, Intel's quality was not as good as Qualcomm's.
3601380	3604100	So it led to some of these mobile phones,
3604100	3604620	not all of them,
3604620	3607740	some of the mobile phones with Intel's
3607740	3608900	modern chip
3608900	3611020	had poor quality of communication.
3611020	3612100	It was bad.
3612100	3616300	Then it caused some customers to be unhappy.
3616300	3617860	So it was required to withdraw.
3617860	3620300	It was really withdrawn.
3620300	3620580	OK.
3620580	3624060	So under such a fact,
3624060	3626460	let's assume that
3626880	3629560	in the future, is it possible for Intel to
3629560	3631640	change its modern chip quality?
3631640	3633120	Assuming that Intel,
3633120	3633800	we assume that
3633800	3635120	this is an assumption.
3635120	3636320	Assuming that Intel
3636320	3639200	at a certain point in the future,
3639200	3640720	its product quality
3640720	3643720	becomes very close to Qualcomm.
3643720	3644200	OK.
3644200	3646880	Then how will this game play?
3646880	3649000	What will happen in the market?
3649000	3651720	Will Apple accept
3651720	3653600	this bundle rebate we just talked about?
3653620	3654980	And Qualcomm,
3654980	3657020	our most important role,
3657020	3660300	does it have a reason to provide this rebate?
3660300	3660580	OK.
3660580	3662740	This is our basic game.
3662740	3664180	Then,
3664180	3665220	this
3665220	3666300	mathematical model,
3666300	3667460	in fact, we have a few assumptions.
3667460	3671140	In fact, they are all based on the story we just heard.
3671140	3672060	So in fact,
3672060	3673780	they are all quite intuitive.
3673780	3674060	OK.
3674060	3677100	First, we assume that Qualcomm is a
3677100	3678060	very
3678060	3679820	high-quality in the market.
3679820	3680900	Provided to
3680900	3682460	and higher than Intel
3682460	3683180	in the first stage.
3683200	3685440	Everyone should be able to understand this.
3685440	3685800	OK.
3685800	3688280	And it has been like this in recent years.
3688280	3688640	OK.
3688640	3691960	And these manufacturers,
3691960	3693160	that is, Apple,
3693160	3694880	Apple and Qualcomm,
3694880	3696360	are actually a
3696360	3701440	measurement standard for their companies.
3701440	3701840	That is to say,
3701840	3704320	I want to get the maximum profit.
3704320	3707160	I think everyone should be able to understand this.
3707160	3707400	OK.
3707400	3708520	Third,
3708520	3710200	that is to say,
3710200	3712920	the game we play is a bit like
3712940	3715260	Apple is a follower.
3715260	3717740	Because Apple does not produce the so-called modern chip,
3717740	3719580	it does not make the modern chip.
3719580	3719860	OK.
3719860	3722580	So it's a bit like
3722580	3723340	this game is
3723340	3724220	the first Qualcomm,
3724220	3726420	it provides a contract
3726420	3727180	clause,
3727180	3729260	which includes the bundle rebate.
3729260	3730100	OK.
3730100	3730300	OK.
3730300	3732260	Then Apple only has two options,
3732260	3733260	accept or not.
3733260	3734580	That's it.
3734580	3734940	OK.
3734940	3736220	So the game we play is like this.
3736220	3737660	Apple accepts or not.
3737660	3737860	OK.
3737860	3739220	If you accept it,
3739220	3740460	for Qualcomm,
3740460	3742180	what is its profit?
3742200	3744320	Then what is Apple's profit?
3744320	3745400	If you don't accept it,
3745400	3747920	how does Qualcomm's profit change?
3747920	3749840	How does Apple's profit change?
3749840	3750160	OK.
3750160	3752640	So we use this pie
3752640	3754400	to denote the entire profit.
3754400	3756720	Then A, Q, and I are these players.
3756720	3758000	OK.
3758000	3759120	A is Apple,
3759120	3760520	Q is Qualcomm,
3760520	3761720	and I is Intel.
3761720	3762720	OK.
3762720	3762960	OK.
3762960	3765320	Then a few numbers.
3765320	3766920	In fact,
3766920	3769080	I will simply report to you.
3769080	3770600	It's a bit boring here.
3770620	3770820	OK.
3770820	3772340	That's just an assumption for everyone.
3772340	3774140	Then this is Q.
3774140	3775740	Q is this.
3775740	3777460	Qualcomm's quality.
3777460	3778020	Uh, yes.
3778020	3778940	Qualcomm's
3778940	3779860	Qualcomm chip quality.
3779860	3781300	Then CQ like this.
3781300	3782860	You can just look at it like this.
3782860	3783780	In fact,
3783780	3787180	the main thing is to explain to you that
3787180	3789660	we set these functions.
3789660	3791500	Then it also includes its demand function.
3791500	3792260	Demand function,
3792260	3793780	then its value,
3793780	3794100	that is to say,
3794100	3795860	we don't want it to be low.
3795860	3796420	You can know that
3796420	3798460	the demand function we set here
3798480	3802280	is D equals A minus BP plus Gamma Q.
3802280	3802600	OK.
3802600	3804840	Then we have to let this
3804840	3807160	A must be greater than or equal to zero.
3807160	3807520	OK.
3807520	3810840	So it's actually its demand function.
3810840	3812640	Then its price and quality.
3812640	3812880	OK.
3812880	3815360	Then I set it to avoid this model.
3815360	3815840	It's complicated.
3815840	3817000	We must be greater than or equal to D.
3817000	3819360	So A must be greater than or equal to the thing behind it.
3819360	3820320	It must be A.
3820320	3822200	Because A minus the back.
3822200	3822680	OK.
3822680	3824880	A, we set a market size here.
3824880	3826320	Then you can think about it.
3826320	3827920	Just be intuitive.
3827920	3828320	That is to say,
3828340	3830140	if A is the market size.
3830140	3831940	Because you have three players today.
3831940	3836020	So your market size must be greater than the two behind it.
3836020	3837900	Apple and Qualcomm.
3837900	3839460	Apple and Intel.
3839460	3843180	And Qualcomm and Intel.
3843180	3845220	The whole market share.
3845220	3846260	The market share.
3846260	3848820	And then what.
3848820	3849340	OK.
3849340	3851580	So simply put,
3851580	3852140	that is to say,
3852140	3854980	we set D to be greater than or equal to zero.
3854980	3856300	Simply put, that's it.
3856300	3856580	OK.
3856580	3857100	So you see,
3857120	3858720	so that's Maxima.
3858720	3859720	And then BCQ.
3859720	3860800	And then minus Gamma.
3860800	3863080	And then this BC1 minus Q1.
3863080	3865600	So the front is Qualcomm.
3865600	3867000	The back is Intel.
3867000	3867560	OK.
3867560	3869080	So it must be greater than this.
3869080	3870680	OK.
3870680	3875200	And then we set this contract.
3875200	3876000	OK.
3876000	3879200	Then WQ, we set it to be a cheap price.
3879200	3879560	OK.
3879560	3882600	Then Alpha, we set it to be a royalty percentage.
3882600	3885000	What's fun about us is that Alpha,
3885020	3886980	it's set to this.
3886980	3890260	Uh, we just said it was the condition of the front.
3890260	3891540	So it has an interval,
3891540	3894220	which means it's between 0 and 1.
3894220	3895060	OK.
3895060	3895580	OK.
3895580	3898500	So W is his cheap side.
3898500	3901220	I think this is basically what it is.
3901220	3902940	So we just denote.
3902940	3903180	OK.
3903180	3904380	So we just,
3904380	3906180	you might also mention,
3906180	3906460	that is to say,
3906460	3908140	what is that rebate?
3908140	3909420	We will provide a rebate.
3909420	3911340	That rebate is to provide a Gamma.
3911340	3912380	Because it's a rebate.
3912380	3914700	Why is it so fast to choose this Gamma?
3914720	3915760	Because it's from,
3915760	3917680	it's a fixed amount.
3917680	3917960	That is to say,
3917960	3919280	it's from the whole sale,
3919280	3922560	from this WQ or WI.
3922560	3925240	WQ is this Qualcomm chip.
3925240	3927000	WI is Intel's chip.
3927000	3928360	Because it's from this whole chip,
3928360	3930040	the total sales,
3930040	3931400	the total sales,
3931400	3932680	to be deducted.
3932680	3933360	So,
3933360	3936360	this is also in line with the reality.
3936360	3938400	Because the reality of this rebate,
3938400	3938880	uh,
3938880	3941120	the situation is also from this overall sales number,
3941120	3942840	and then the total,
3942860	3943500	and then to,
3943500	3944700	to provide you,
3944700	3945860	and then deduct a number.
3945860	3947980	Then this number is deducted from the total.
3947980	3950780	So we just set it to Gamma.
3950780	3951780	OK.
3951780	3952060	Uh,
3952060	3952860	it should be R.
3952860	3953340	R.
3953340	3953620	OK.
3953620	3954500	Set it to R,
3954500	3955300	like this.
3955300	3955860	OK.
3955860	3956060	OK.
3956060	3956660	So,
3956660	3957460	uh,
3957460	3959220	this is my good friend,
3959220	3961380	my other partner's conclusion.
3961380	3963340	Then I'll just show you,
3963340	3965500	appreciate the beauty of this math.
3965500	3967580	Because I really can't do this.
3967580	3968380	OK.
3968380	3968940	OK.
3968940	3970460	So,
3970460	3971500	actually, I'll tell you about it.
3971520	3973080	The result of our run.
3973080	3973320	OK.
3973320	3974960	Let's stop for a moment.
3974960	3977920	I think there should be no problem here.
3977920	3979600	I think everyone should,
3979600	3980720	I hope everyone is still awake.
3980720	3980960	OK.
3980960	3982520	It's just a mathematical model.
3982520	3982840	OK.
3982840	3985080	That's it.
3985080	3987800	The main thing is to know how to play our game.
3987800	3989160	I think everyone knows,
3989160	3989400	that is,
3989400	3993680	how our Game Theory model is set.
3993680	3995720	OK.
3995720	3996920	OK.
3996920	4000240	I think there should be no problem.
4000240	4001320	OK.
4001620	4002660	No problem.
4002660	4003100	Ah,
4003100	4006020	I don't understand Game Theory at all.
4006020	4006740	Crying.
4006740	4007220	Actually,
4007220	4007980	no,
4007980	4008820	Game Theory is,
4008820	4009100	you know,
4009100	4010340	everyone actually understands Game Theory.
4010340	4011020	Don't be too complicated.
4011020	4013140	Game Theory is actually a math.
4013140	4014540	So you can actually see it.
4014540	4015060	In fact,
4015060	4016380	it's actually a,
4016380	4016860	uh,
4016860	4019180	application of math.
4019180	4019500	OK.
4019500	4019700	So,
4019700	4020020	in fact,
4020020	4022500	it's not that much.
4022500	4024260	I think it's quite intuitive.
4024260	4025140	But I just,
4025140	4026180	that is to say,
4026180	4026580	I think,
4026580	4029380	I hope I can make it clear to everyone.
4029380	4030140	Because,
4030140	4030780	to be honest,
4030800	4031800	because of this PowerPoint,
4031800	4034400	I have to tell other people in the legal department.
4034400	4035800	The other people in the legal department,
4035800	4040200	they are completely less sensitive to math.
4040200	4043160	So I have to make it extremely simple.
4043160	4043840	OK.
4043840	4044720	If everyone,
4044720	4046240	if it's a little difficult to listen to,
4046240	4047920	maybe I have to review it.
4047920	4048200	OK.
4048200	4048760	Simply put,
4048760	4050400	how to play this game?
4050400	4051280	In fact,
4051280	4051560	anyway,
4051560	4052560	it's Qualcomm.
4052560	4054000	I provide a contract.
4054000	4054960	OK.
4054960	4055880	Provide this contract.
4055880	4059000	Then it has a rebate based on a certain price.
4059020	4060820	And then this rebate,
4060820	4061540	sorry,
4061540	4065220	this rebate is a fixed amount.
4065220	4065540	Like this,
4065540	4066340	and then this amount,
4066340	4068740	and then see if Apple wants to accept it.
4068740	4069020	Like this,
4069020	4070700	and then we look at the response of Intel.
4070700	4072540	Let's look at the response of Apple.
4072540	4074100	And then their profit maximization.
4074100	4075380	And then what is the two-stage?
4075380	4076500	Two-stage is good.
4076500	4079220	Assuming that Intel is at a certain time point in the future.
4079220	4081860	Its quality has risen to the same as Qualcomm.
4081860	4082100	Okay,
4082100	4083500	so let's look at that.
4083500	4083860	Today,
4083860	4085980	Apple provides this rebate.
4085980	4087340	What is the change in its profit?
4087340	4088420	What is the change in profit?
4088440	4089640	What is the change in Apple's profit?
4089640	4092400	What is the impact of Intel on this whole thing?
4092400	4092880	OK,
4092880	4094680	so the simple game is like this.
4094680	4096000	OK.
4096000	4096280	Okay,
4096280	4097400	so what?
4097400	4097640	In fact,
4097640	4100760	the result we came up with at the end was that we found that it was fun.
4100760	4102480	It's one-stage game.
4102480	4103640	It's the so-called one-stage game.
4103640	4107240	I just said that Qualcomm provides this bundle rebate.
4107240	4107720	Okay,
4107720	4108920	Apple accepts it or not.
4108920	4109920	That's it.
4109920	4113840	And then he set his quality to be much higher than Intel.
4113840	4114360	Simply put,
4114360	4115080	that's it.
4115080	4115240	Okay,
4115240	4117680	so you'll find that Qualcomm is actually intuitive.
4117700	4118820	It's actually very easy to look at.
4118820	4119500	Why?
4119500	4121540	Just like I just said,
4121540	4123380	Qualcomm is a market monopoly.
4123380	4124820	No one has a better quality than him.
4124820	4126420	Why does he provide rebate?
4126420	4127100	It doesn't make sense.
4128100	4128420	Why?
4128420	4130500	Because he doesn't allow it at all.
4130500	4131460	Because what does it mean to provide rebate?
4131460	4133780	It means that he can't maximize the profit.
4134700	4135020	Right?
4135020	4137100	He provides an amount to Apple.
4137100	4137860	What is he doing?
4137860	4138380	Right?
4138380	4139940	Because I don't provide it anyway.
4139940	4141100	Apple has to pay for it.
4142340	4143020	Yeah,
4143020	4144420	so Apple has to pay for it.
4144420	4146820	So why do I provide rebate to Apple?
4146840	4148680	I just maximize the profit.
4148680	4150520	So at the first stage,
4150520	4154640	the results of the model we made showed that
4154640	4155920	this is not necessary.
4156640	4157680	Boundary rebate is not necessary.
4158680	4159240	Okay,
4159240	4164080	so non-exhaustive actually didn't change much.
4164080	4165640	That's just because of this.
4165640	4167080	Because Alpha is still in this range.
4167080	4167480	So Alpha,
4167480	4167920	I just said,
4167920	4169040	it's the range of this Royalty.
4169040	4169760	It hasn't changed.
4170400	4170960	Okay,
4170960	4172200	so no matter what you do today,
4172200	4172640	this Alpha,
4172640	4176640	you calculate the entire market value.
4176660	4177700	It's the entire market value.
4177700	4178980	It's still just modern chip.
4178980	4181380	It doesn't actually affect high-speed communication.
4181380	4181660	Why?
4181660	4184460	High-speed communication still feels like I'm a market monopoly.
4184460	4186700	Why do I provide a rebate?
4186700	4188660	And then it affects my profit maximization.
4188660	4189820	So one stage,
4189820	4191460	and then non-exhaustive game is the same.
4191460	4194260	It's from a high-speed point of view.
4194260	4196460	He doesn't need to provide rebate to Apple at all.
4197740	4198340	But it's fun.
4198340	4199380	That's the third one.
4199380	4202860	We found that from two-stage game,
4202860	4205180	we found that Intel's quality has risen.
4206100	4206420	Okay,
4206440	4208240	but he's starting to have conditions.
4208240	4208880	That is to say,
4208880	4210360	it was not necessary before.
4210360	4212720	Then we went to two-stage game.
4212720	4214120	We found that this quality.
4215480	4216000	This quality,
4216000	4218560	when Intel's quality is close to high-speed communication,
4218560	4219160	we found that,
4219160	4219840	hey,
4219840	4221680	high-speed communication to some extent,
4221680	4225040	he has to provide rebate to Apple.
4226160	4226840	Oh,
4226840	4227280	okay,
4227280	4228040	that's it.
4228040	4228800	This is the red line.
4228800	4231760	This is the condition that we came up with mathematically.
4231760	4232840	That's the MQ.
4232840	4233880	That's bigger than this.
4233880	4234400	Okay,
4234420	4238300	so we found that the appearance of mathematics.
4238300	4238620	That is to say,
4238620	4243820	he has a condition that he has to provide rebate to Apple.
4243820	4244180	Otherwise,
4244180	4245540	he can't maximize the profit.
4246460	4246700	Okay,
4246700	4248660	that's the problem.
4249620	4249900	Okay,
4249900	4251060	that's the problem.
4251060	4253020	Why is there a condition?
4253740	4254180	Okay,
4254180	4257300	what about the business behind this condition?
4257300	4258940	What is the commercial consideration?
4260100	4260700	Okay,
4260700	4263420	so we thought about it.
4263440	4265320	We thought about it a lot.
4265320	4265960	Okay,
4265960	4267680	then we will find that,
4267680	4268120	the first.
4269520	4270680	In the two-stage game,
4270680	4271360	we found that,
4271360	4277080	if we assume that this cost of Intel,
4277080	4277440	uh,
4277440	4278200	not the cost,
4278200	4278680	wrong,
4278680	4279760	this quality,
4279760	4282880	the quality of modern chip is very close to high-speed communication.
4282880	4284240	If he is very close,
4284240	4286400	it means that Apple's,
4286400	4288280	this one plus one is high.
4288280	4290040	Apple's one plus one is high for high-speed communication.
4290040	4292160	This should be easy for everyone to think about.
4292160	4292640	Because why?
4292660	4294420	Because Apple has a choice.
4294420	4295540	I said I would choose Intel.
4296740	4298220	If you still provide that price,
4298220	4300060	I don't need your modern chip.
4300060	4300660	So in this case,
4300660	4302940	if everyone's quality is very close,
4302940	4305260	there will be a so-called price war.
4305260	4307540	I think this should be easier for everyone to understand.
4307540	4309620	When the price war occurs,
4309620	4312140	it will cause profit loss.
4312140	4313740	So in this inference,
4313740	4314340	we,
4314340	4316060	we boldly infer that,
4316060	4318860	why is there this red condition in front of it?
4318860	4320540	Why is this rebate produced?
4320540	4322260	This R is produced.
4322280	4325720	Why is there such a change in the two-stage game?
4325720	4327840	Because the one-stage does not need it in the front.
4327840	4329800	Why do you want two-stage?
4329800	4332320	The reason is because we infer that,
4332320	4333560	high-speed communication,
4333560	4335040	because of the game,
4335040	4336680	he has an assumption in this game.
4336680	4337280	Because of this,
4337280	4338880	we haven't learned the game theory.
4338880	4339640	So I'll put it simply.
4339640	4340240	This game theory,
4340240	4341080	he has a lot of,
4341080	4341880	he has an assumption.
4341880	4345640	The premise is that both sides are actually in the case of knowledge or full knowledge.
4345640	4347280	For market information,
4347280	4349000	and for this information of both sides,
4349000	4350280	it is a full-knowledge situation.
4350280	4351360	OK.
4351380	4354100	The so-called information includes the so-called patent information,
4354100	4355060	including price information,
4355060	4356100	including the case.
4356100	4357580	These are all full-knowledge.
4357580	4359660	Apple, Qualcomm, Intel all know.
4359660	4360060	OK.
4360060	4362260	In such a full-knowledge situation,
4362260	4363540	Apple, he may be,
4363540	4364220	not Apple,
4364220	4366700	Qualcomm, he may be able to predict that,
4366700	4368460	in the future, if,
4368460	4369260	and in real society,
4369260	4370420	I just mentioned that,
4370420	4372500	that Apple is really careless,
4372500	4373620	or whether it is careless,
4373620	4374500	or deliberately,
4374500	4375420	jump the bridge,
4375420	4377380	secretly use Intel's modern chip,
4377380	4379060	but the effect is not good.
4379060	4381220	Well, just based on this fact,
4381240	4382480	will there be a doubt?
4382480	4382960	That is to say,
4382960	4385040	Hey, Qualcomm will worry that,
4385040	4388920	if Intel's modern chip quality rises,
4388920	4390640	will it threaten my market,
4390640	4392240	market leadership?
4392240	4394040	It is possible.
4394040	4396440	If it really threatens,
4396440	4397920	then it will produce our previous,
4397920	4399200	this mathematical model,
4399200	4400960	will it produce such a result?
4400960	4401720	Right?
4401720	4403240	If it produces such a result,
4403240	4404560	isn't it just to say,
4404560	4405440	you can think about it.
4405440	4406160	Then,
4406160	4407320	why did he,
4407320	4408240	at the beginning,
4408240	4410560	regardless of his state,
4410580	4411460	regardless of other people's state,
4411460	4412380	regardless of Intel's state,
4412380	4414100	I will propose a rebate first.
4414100	4414700	What is the reason?
4414700	4415900	Because he is worried that,
4415900	4416300	in the future,
4416300	4417620	if anyone comes in,
4417620	4418740	Intel is just one of them,
4418740	4420020	we think of the object,
4420020	4420780	it may be Samsung,
4420780	4422020	it may be Huawei,
4422020	4422580	or others,
4422580	4423220	or Ericsson,
4423220	4424220	no matter.
4424220	4425180	These potential investors,
4425180	4425940	if his,
4425940	4428020	the quality of this modern chip has risen,
4428020	4430660	then it is possible to produce a price war.
4430660	4431820	If in our model,
4431820	4434860	the situation is like this.
4434860	4435900	Then, in order to avoid this,
4435900	4437380	the loss of the price war,
4437380	4438660	then I might as well,
4438660	4439700	at one stage,
4439920	4440560	at the beginning,
4440560	4443040	I will receive this rebate from Apple.
4443040	4444520	In case,
4444520	4446000	I am a bit like receiving a security fee,
4446000	4446680	I am in case,
4446680	4447200	in the future,
4447200	4448720	if there is a price war,
4448720	4449400	at least,
4449400	4450160	this,
4450160	4450640	this,
4450640	4452600	the loss of this profit,
4452600	4456360	I can make up for it from the previous rebate.
4456360	4458440	OK, I provide such a rebate,
4458440	4460280	I provide such a rebate to Apple,
4460280	4460880	in the future,
4460880	4462320	Apple will continue to use it,
4462320	4462600	right?
4462600	4463520	Because I provide such a rebate,
4463520	4464920	everyone,
4464920	4467400	although Apple is very happy,
4467420	4469780	is to get one more money,
4469780	4471380	but Qualcomm has a little loss,
4471380	4472020	but there is no difference,
4472020	4472340	why?
4472340	4473860	My loss today,
4473860	4477300	I am better than the future big loss.
4477300	4480380	If I have a little loss today,
4480380	4481140	but in the future,
4481140	4482100	if you today,
4482100	4485180	suppose we don't say that we can't breach the contract,
4485180	4487060	this is because Apple's private breach,
4487060	4488180	this is not good.
4488180	4490140	Tell everyone that private breach is not good.
4490140	4492500	If Qualcomm,
4492500	4496180	if Apple does not violate the contract,
4496200	4499200	it will continue to use Qualcomm chips in the future,
4499200	4500320	otherwise it will violate the contract,
4500320	4500920	right?
4500920	4504560	In order to allow this thing to continue to occur,
4504560	4505920	I will continue to provide rebate to you,
4505920	4508320	I provide a little loss to Qualcomm,
4508320	4510480	but I can always guard your Apple,
4510480	4513560	I don't want Apple to jump to Intel.
4513560	4515400	At least in the future,
4515400	4517520	this price war will not occur,
4517520	4518280	right?
4518280	4519600	So its logic,
4519600	4520840	the overall logic is like this,
4520840	4523200	because price war will occur in the future.
4523200	4524720	In order to avoid
4524740	4526900	such a high price war for Apple,
4526900	4528540	I might as well be in the first stage,
4528540	4529980	when I was in the first stage of the game,
4529980	4531340	I would lock you to death,
4531340	4532420	I would use Bundle Rebate,
4532420	4536020	I provide this Bundle Rebate Contract to force you to accept,
4536020	4536900	what are the conditions to accept?
4536900	4539500	I just mentioned that you can't jump to Intel,
4539500	4540700	then you can't sue me,
4540700	4541700	you can't jump to Intel,
4541700	4542540	these two conditions,
4542540	4547140	then you have to pay me such a high power,
4547140	4548540	Apple also has a loss,
4548540	4550620	in fact, the mathematical model just said,
4550620	4553420	that is, it actually has to deduct one,
4553440	4555800	that is, you have to deduct that Alpha,
4555800	4558160	the profit of Apple has to deduct that Alpha,
4558160	4561360	OK, then the profit of Qualcomm has to be added to Alpha,
4561360	4564200	because that is the Friend Royalty,
4564200	4565680	then my Friend Royalty,
4565680	4567160	if I charge a higher price,
4567160	4568400	conversely,
4568400	4569680	first, I charge a higher price,
4569680	4571680	I can make up for the future loss,
4571680	4575320	second, Qualcomm can also lock your Apple customers,
4575320	4578640	so the whole model's implication,
4578640	4581240	the core essence is here,
4581260	4582420	so to put it simply,
4582420	4584660	the essence of this model is here,
4584660	4587980	but it's not enough to say that,
4587980	4589980	this is just a business perspective,
4589980	4591780	what other reasons do we think that
4591780	4596940	Qualcomm can dare to keep doing this Boundary Bait?
4596940	4598780	Back to the legal point of view,
4598780	4600500	we just talked about this business point of view,
4600500	4603420	it is to avoid future losses,
4603420	4605380	so I have Boundary Bait here,
4605380	4607340	I lock Apple,
4607340	4610540	then collect a very high Friend rate,
4610560	4611800	OK, a little higher,
4611800	4612600	I don't know how high it is,
4612600	4614200	a little higher rate,
4614200	4615120	then lock you,
4615120	4617400	then for the future loss,
4617400	4619280	what about the law?
4619280	4622080	In fact, it will be found that the fact,
4622080	4623440	the fact of this case,
4623440	4625200	that is, the fact of Qualcomm,
4625200	4627200	in fact, with the previous six cases,
4627200	4628960	I will report the conclusion to everyone,
4628960	4630880	because I will not talk about the process,
4630880	4632560	the conclusion is that
4632560	4633640	Qualcomm's case
4633640	4636840	is different from the previous six cases,
4636840	4638160	OK, they are all different,
4638740	4640500	if everyone has some basic common sense
4640500	4642740	about American law,
4642740	4647260	different facts can not be used,
4647260	4649260	different facts will be compared,
4649260	4651860	compared later found that it is not to be used,
4651860	4652700	so that six cases,
4652700	4654460	regardless of whether you are legal or illegal,
4654460	4656820	can not be used in this case,
4656820	4658340	OK, this is a point,
4658340	4661060	the second split reasoning create possibility,
4661060	4662700	I just said that
4662700	4663860	there are red and black,
4663860	4665500	there are legal and illegal,
4665500	4667220	OK, Qualcomm sees this situation,
4667600	4668760	the court itself has been arguing for a long time,
4668760	4669960	you do not know at all,
4669960	4673280	you do not know whether it is legal or illegal,
4673280	4674800	the legal probability is 50%,
4674800	4676600	the illegal probability is also 50%,
4676600	4678200	but for business people,
4678200	4679280	everyone thinks that
4679280	4680560	whether I rush or not,
4680560	4681680	of course, rush,
4681680	4682160	right,
4682160	4683320	of course, I care about him,
4683320	4685080	anyway, there is a 50% chance that I will win,
4685080	4685600	right,
4685600	4687760	so then plus the previous few cases,
4687760	4689400	the facts are different from me,
4689400	4690360	then I have to rush,
4690360	4691480	because those cases
4691480	4694040	may not have anything to do with me,
4694060	4697260	OK, so these facts are different,
4697260	4701460	including the disagreement between the courts,
4701460	4703020	resulting in my personal opinion,
4703020	4705180	from the point of view of the law,
4705180	4705940	Qualcomm,
4705940	4708940	these situations also increased
4708940	4710740	Qualcomm will continue to execute
4710740	4713500	the right-hand man of Fund Rebate,
4713500	4714740	from the business,
4714740	4717340	he said that in order to make up
4717340	4719700	or to prevent future losses,
4719700	4720780	to the law,
4720800	4725800	he is not in line with the past cases,
4725800	4726120	OK,
4726120	4728320	then the reason is not sufficient,
4728320	4729440	nor is it consistent,
4729440	4730920	so that he has such a
4730920	4731800	legal right-hand man,
4731800	4735840	although there is a legal risk,
4735840	4737680	but this risk to him,
4737680	4739920	he thinks he can control,
4739920	4742880	so we found that
4742880	4744680	this problem
4744680	4746040	is that there is a business reason,
4746040	4747200	there is a legal reason,
4747200	4747880	OK,
4747900	4750740	business is that I have to prepare for the future,
4750740	4752700	for the future,
4752700	4754460	the legal reason is that
4754460	4755660	those six cases,
4755660	4756620	whether legal or illegal,
4756620	4757980	have nothing to do with him,
4757980	4760380	because this is my brand new Fund Rebate,
4760380	4760900	OK,
4760900	4762660	then the different point is that
4762660	4764820	the first six cases are all
4764820	4767220	the combination of products and products,
4767220	4769260	what is my product,
4769260	4770700	what is the combination of patents,
4770700	4772300	the first one has nothing to do with me,
4772300	4775460	so based on the business and legal reasons,
4775480	4778280	they all give me a very strong right-hand man,
4778280	4780480	let me continue to execute Fund Rebate,
4780480	4784160	even if he may also have a very high
4784160	4786360	risk of anti-Thoracic,
4786360	4786760	OK,
4786760	4789160	so this paper is actually basically here,
4789160	4791240	of course, when I concluded,
4791240	4792040	my paper,
4792040	4793680	when we concluded this paper,
4793680	4794600	I also mentioned one point,
4794600	4797240	that is,
4797240	4798200	in the end,
4798200	4798600	this case,
4798600	4799160	because this case,
4799160	4800120	if you are interested,
4800120	4800800	you can check it,
4800800	4803040	it is still in progress in the United States,
4803040	4804400	there is no conclusion,
4804620	4805500	that is,
4805500	4806860	this question is actually my graduation,
4806860	4808860	the real question of the graduation paper,
4808860	4809180	OK,
4809180	4810220	if you are interested,
4810220	4811820	you can talk to me in private,
4811820	4813700	because my graduation paper is from a different point of view,
4813700	4815700	then my graduation paper point of view is this question,
4815700	4816780	that is,
4816780	4818380	the court as such a role,
4818380	4821220	if he is judged to be legal,
4821220	4823580	his influence on Apple,
4823580	4827220	what is his influence on the public,
4827220	4831300	and if it is illegal,
4831300	4831700	right?
4831700	4833700	Then I just mentioned that
4833720	4834700	he is a
4834700	4836200	law of the jungle,
4836200	4838120	he may accidentally go the wrong way,
4838120	4840120	it may affect a lot of people,
4840120	4840240	yes,
4840240	4841840	if he is
4841840	4842680	very bold in the court,
4842680	4844800	what is his influence on the public
4844800	4846240	when he is judged to be illegal?
4846240	4847760	This is the future study,
4847760	4849040	that is,
4849040	4849640	including my paper,
4849640	4850400	I am also doing this thing,
4850400	4853360	then this paper is the last stop here,
4853360	4853880	that is,
4853880	4854680	if you are interested,
4854680	4856560	you are welcome to join in
4856560	4858360	and do this kind of research.
4858360	4858640	OK,
4858640	4860000	so
4860000	4861280	today my
4861280	4862240	sharing
4862260	4865100	is about to end here,
4865100	4866460	then
4866460	4867940	ah,
4867940	4868580	OK,
4868580	4869780	someone asked in the middle of the round,
4869780	4870740	so
4870740	4874340	my sharing is about to end here,
4874340	4875220	then
4875220	4877140	do I have to answer the question first?
4877140	4879340	Or
4879340	4880940	let us
4880940	4883420	applaud and thank Louis for today's
4883420	4884260	in-depth sharing,
4884260	4885020	thank you,
4885020	4886500	do you understand?
4886500	4889780	Everyone should understand, right?
4889800	4892440	I don't know what everyone's question is,
4892440	4894640	I'm very worried,
4894640	4895880	I think I want to talk about it,
4895880	4896800	you are very lucky,
4896800	4898720	because this is my first time talking,
4898720	4900960	it should not be the first time,
4900960	4902440	it seems a bit too much to say like this,
4902440	4907840	my first time sharing something related to my graduate thesis,
4907840	4910480	yes,
4910480	4911440	the question,
4911440	4913840	do I have to answer the question first?
4913840	4915120	Or how?
4915120	4916280	Louis,
4916280	4918040	let me stop recording first,
4918060	4920700	then we can start to answer the question,
4920700	4921500	OK,
4921500	4923500	no problem,
