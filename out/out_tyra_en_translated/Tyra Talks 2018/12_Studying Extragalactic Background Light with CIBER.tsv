0	14000	Hello everyone, welcome to this week's Terra Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. I am currently studying high-energy physics experiments at the University of California.
14000	19000	Before we officially start, let's first introduce what kind of organization Project Terra is.
19000	28000	In fact, as we wrote on the website, our goal is to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,
28000	35000	connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world, exchange results and trends in Taiwan's academic circles overseas,
35000	39000	and provide each other with a platform for effective communication.
40000	49000	To put it simply, we hope to establish a platform that helps Taiwanese from all over the world engage in research and work to communicate with each other quickly and timely.
49000	53000	We will hold a webcast like today every week.
53000	58000	The speakers are basically our members, and the audience can sign up online.
58000	64000	The topic of the speech is based on the results of the speaker's research, review his current development in his special field,
64000	68000	and share new ideas, plans, or opportunities for cooperation.
68000	73000	Project Terra is currently a fully self-funded, fully volunteer organization.
73000	78000	Our staff are basically all doctoral students and post-doctoral students.
78000	83000	You can see the About page on our website.
83000	91000	Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.
99000	105000	I want to add that we recently added a lot of staff who may not have been updated to the website.
105000	112000	The most important purpose of a project like this is to fully open up, share and cooperate.
112000	117000	The more friends who are willing to join us, share and help each other,
117000	121000	we can move towards the goals we all want.
121000	127000	I also hope that it will be helpful to Taiwan's academic circle and everyone's research career, or to transfer jobs in the future.
128000	135000	Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.
135000	145000	If you feel that you support our ideas, or are passionate about sharing your very passionate research,
145000	150000	you can consider joining our members, and you will continue to receive our speech and activity information.
150000	154000	Of course, you can also go to our Facebook fan page and continue to follow our news.
155000	158000	We also want to emphasize that we have no profit at all.
158000	163000	If you are willing to share with other Taiwanese, it will be the biggest reward for us.
163000	167000	It is also the biggest help to other friends who work in the academic circle.
167000	171000	This is the introduction of TARA.
171000	174000	Next, I want to introduce our speaker.
174000	178000	We are honored to invite Zheng Yunting today.
178000	183000	Zheng Yunting is currently studying physics at the California Institute of Technology.
183000	186000	He is currently a doctoral candidate.
186000	193000	Yunting graduated from the Department of Physics in 2014 and joined the Caltech Research Institute.
193000	195000	He is currently studying his doctorate.
195000	198000	His special field is observational cosmology.
198000	205000	He will introduce to us today that he is doing a data analysis project.
205000	207000	It is a rocket project.
208000	211000	There is one more thing to remind everyone.
211000	214000	In order to let the speaker feel our enthusiasm,
214000	218000	the microphone must be turned on when applauding, so that he can hear the voice.
218000	222000	Let's applaud and welcome Yunting to give us this speech.
230000	232000	Thank you everyone.
233000	236000	I am Zheng Yunting. I am studying my PhD at Caltech.
237000	241000	Thank you to my office mate, Zhang Yanyong, for the introduction.
241000	244000	The topic I am going to talk about today is
244000	248000	Measuring Extragalactic Background Light at Optical and Near-Infrared.
250000	252000	This is a project I am doing.
252000	254000	I am doing its data analysis.
254000	257000	What I am going to talk about today is more focused on
257000	261000	the background in this field.
261000	263000	What do we want to measure?
263000	264000	What do we want to understand?
264000	266000	What is a signal?
268000	273000	Let me start by introducing the history of our universe.
273000	275000	This is the universe we know so far.
275000	280000	We can start from the left.
280000	283000	The left is the earliest period.
283000	286000	We have inflation and Big Bang.
286000	290000	Inflation is the theory of explosion in Chinese.
291000	296000	Big Bang is the beginning of the universe.
296000	299000	In the very early period,
299000	303000	the universe is very small and hot.
303000	308000	Everything inside is very hot and oily.
308000	312000	As the universe expands,
312000	317000	the gas will expand.
317000	320000	At a certain point in time,
320000	324000	the temperature in the universe is low enough.
324000	328000	The electrons and protons in the gas
328000	331000	will combine to form hydrogen.
331000	334000	This process is called recombination.
334000	336000	After recombination,
336000	343000	there are a lot of photons in the universe.
343000	348000	Photons are easily scattered with free electrons.
348000	351000	After recombination,
351000	353000	there are almost no free electrons in the universe.
353000	361000	These photons will not become long.
361000	367000	We can see the photons emitted at that time.
367000	372000	This is called a cosmic microwave background or CMB.
372000	382000	This is the earliest signal we can measure in cosmology.
382000	389000	After recombination and CMB,
389000	395000	a lot of protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen.
396000	399000	During this period,
399000	404000	the universe is full of neutral hydrogen and hydrogen.
404000	407000	This period is called the Dark Age.
407000	410000	Because it is very dark,
410000	414000	there are no photons like the CMB at that time.
414000	419000	However, there are no stars and galaxies yet.
419000	423000	The universe during this period is completely black.
423000	426000	During this period,
426000	436000	there will be some density fluctuations in the universe.
436000	440000	These density fluctuations are because of gravity.
440000	443000	As time goes by,
443000	449000	there will be more matter coming in.
449000	455000	The main component is dark matter.
455000	463000	These dark matter may form heavier and condensed structures.
463000	465000	We call this dark matter halo.
465000	469000	Because there is a strong gravitational potential in the halo,
469000	476000	the background gases such as hydrogen will also gather here.
476000	481000	When the gathering becomes compact,
481000	492000	it will cause a fusion reaction and form the first star or galaxy.
492000	495000	After a period of time,
495000	500000	the universe begins to form stars and galaxies.
500000	503000	After these stars and galaxies form,
503000	506000	they will release a lot of photons.
506000	509000	If the energy of the photons is strong enough,
509000	515000	the energy gap between the hydrogen and the gas will be strong enough.
515000	518000	The gas will separate the hydrogen nearby.
518000	525000	You can see that there are some separated areas on this map.
525000	528000	We call this ionizing bubble.
529000	533000	This process is called reionization.
533000	536000	As time goes by,
536000	541000	there will be more and more stars and galaxies in the universe.
541000	544000	It will ionize the hydrogen nearby.
544000	546000	At the end,
546000	549000	if you have enough galaxies,
549000	553000	you will separate all the hydrogen in the universe.
553000	559000	The gases outside the galaxy are all ionized.
559000	562000	This is our current universe.
562000	567000	This is the history of the development of the universe.
567000	574000	What I'm going to study now is called an extra-galactic background light.
575000	578000	I have a question.
578000	583000	What if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
583000	586000	Oh, okay.
586000	589000	I see.
589000	593000	So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
593000	596000	I see.
596000	601000	So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
601000	604000	I see.
604000	607000	So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?
607000	610000	Can you see it clearly like this?
610000	613000	Actually, I think it's pretty clear.
613000	616000	Okay, then I'll do it like this.
616000	619000	I also think traffic lights are more convenient.
619000	623000	So, what I'm going to measure is the extra-galactic background light,
623000	626000	or EVL.
626000	631000	In the universe, the word galaxy is used to refer to our own galaxy.
631000	636000	In the universe, the word galaxy is used to refer to our own galaxy.
636000	641000	So, extra-galactic is outside our own galaxy.
641000	646000	Background light means everything outside the galaxy is called background.
646000	651000	So, the EVL we measure is the time and space that happened in the universe.
652000	657000	So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.
657000	662000	So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.
662000	667000	So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.
667000	672000	The frequency along which posters were laid out is locked on through that spectrum.
675000	678000	We call this spectrum the EDL.
678000	681000	We call this spectrum the EDL.
681000	684000	Specture on different wavelengths or language.
688000	691000	These data are gathered so far.
691000	696000	You can see that different wavelengths have different EDL measurements.
706000	709000	Let's talk about what each wavelength does.
709000	712000	We can look at the highest and lowest energy.
712000	715000	The highest energy is gamma ray and X-ray.
715000	718000	The main source of these high-energy photons are
718000	721000	active galactic nuclei.
721000	724000	These nuclei have a large black hole
724000	727000	in the center of each galaxy.
727000	730000	Sometimes these black holes may suck in
730000	733000	all kinds of messy gas and then
733000	736000	heat them up and release some radiation.
736000	739000	These radiations will have very strong energy.
739000	742000	These high-energy photons are called
742000	745000	active galactic nuclei.
745000	748000	The main source is from the galaxy cluster.
748000	751000	The center of the cluster has a large black hole.
751000	754000	The cluster itself has some very hot gas.
754000	757000	It has a very strong gravitational potential.
757000	760000	This is the main source of gamma ray and X-ray.
760000	763000	The main source of X-ray is gamma ray.
763000	766000	The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.
766000	769000	The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.
769000	772000	The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.
772000	775000	The main source of X-ray is gamma ray.
775000	778000	At the same time, the source of very low-energy radio
778000	781000	is also from something like AGN.
781000	784000	is also from something like AGN.
784000	787000	I don't know if you've heard of synchrotron radiation.
787000	790000	I don't know if you've heard of synchrotron radiation.
790000	793000	This is also when gas is heated
793000	796000	or accelerated to a very high speed.
796000	799000	This is also when gas is heated or accelerated to a very high speed.
799000	802000	Next is UV.
802000	805000	We didn't measure a lot of data for UV.
805000	808000	We didn't measure a lot of data for UV.
808000	811000	It's hard to see UV data
811000	814000	because it's a higher-energy photon
814000	817000	than 912 Armstrong.
817000	820000	because it's a higher-energy photon
820000	823000	than 912 Armstrong.
823000	826000	In our own galaxy,
826000	829000	it's easy to absorb
829000	832000	the UV photons.
832000	835000	So it's hard to see the background
835000	838000	of the UV astro-galaxy.
838000	841000	So it's hard to see the background
841000	844000	of the UV astro-galaxy.
844000	847000	The strongest peak is in the microwave.
847000	850000	The strongest peak is in the microwave.
850000	853000	The source of the microwave is from the Cosmic Microwave Background.
853000	856000	The source of the microwave is from the cosmic microwave
856000	858000	bakick-de normando radiation.
858000	861000	The source is from the Cosmic Microwave Background.
861000	864000	One is in the optical and the other in infrared.
864000	867000	These two are mostly stars pieces
867000	870000	emitted in different galaxies.
870000	873000	Star emission is in optical.
873000	876000	In infrared,
876000	879000	There's dust emission in the galaxy.
879000	882000	There's dust emission in the galaxy.
882000	885000	These dusts will suck
885000	888000	stellar lights
888000	891000	They will emit thermal radiation
891000	894000	They will emit thermal radiation
894000	897000	and it's in the infrared
897000	900000	You can see
900000	903000	This star's light
903000	906000	is emitted from as equal from the opposition
906000	909000	of the star to the star.
909000	912000	The wavelengths I will talk about today
912000	915000	are in the optical area.
915000	918000	are in the optical area.
918000	921000	If we zoom in
921000	924000	we can see a lot of different data
924000	927000	This is the far-infrared
927000	930000	This is the far-infrared
930000	933000	This is the far-infrared
933000	936000	This is the far-infrared
936000	939000	You can see a lot of different data
939000	942000	I will focus on this area
942000	945000	I will focus on this area
948000	951000	You can see a lot different data
951000	954000	and these data change
954000	957000	up to different values
957000	960000	up to different values
960000	962900	You can see data changing
962900	965900	These data are inconsistent
965900	968900	because they are used in different ways
968900	971900	because they are used in different ways
971900	974900	in Constraint EDL
974900	977900	There are 4 ways
977900	980900	I will introduce them
980900	983900	The first method is called Galaxy Counts
983900	986900	These data are from Galaxy Counts
986900	989900	Galaxy Counts means
989900	992900	I want to measure
992900	995900	in the near-infrared or optical background
995900	998900	I will use a telescope
998900	1001900	to look at a field
1001900	1004900	I can measure many galaxies in this field
1004900	1007900	I will add the light from the near-infrared
1007900	1010900	I will add the light from the near-infrared
1010900	1013900	I will say these are the extra-galactic backgrounds I measured
1013900	1016900	I will say these are the extra-galactic backgrounds I measured
1017900	1020900	You can only contain low-LE in EBL
1020900	1023900	You can only contain low-LE in EBL
1025900	1028900	You will only get the brightest galaxies

1031900	1034900	You can only get a few of them
1034900	1037900	You will only get a few of them
1037900	1041800	I also place multiple
1041840	1044900	You will only get a feliz
1044900	1047900	You will only get a few of them
1053240	1056240	I also explained the number of colors
1056240	1059240	I also explained the number of colors
1059240	1062240	I also explained the number of colors
1062240	1065240	I also explained the name
1065240	1068200	I also explained the name
1068200	1071200	I also explained the name
