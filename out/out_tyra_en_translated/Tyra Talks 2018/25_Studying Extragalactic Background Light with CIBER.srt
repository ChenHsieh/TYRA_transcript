00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello everyone, welcome to this week's Terra Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. I am currently studying high-energy physics experiments at the University of California.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Before we officially start, let's first introduce what kind of organization Project Terra is.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In fact, as we wrote on the website, our goal is to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world, exchange results and trends in Taiwan's academic circles overseas,

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and provide each other with a platform for effective communication.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To put it simply, we hope to establish a platform that helps Taiwanese from all over the world engage in research and work to communicate with each other quickly and timely.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We will hold a webcast like today every week.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The speakers are basically our members, and the audience can sign up online.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The topic of the speech is based on the results of the speaker's research, review his current development in his special field,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and share new ideas, plans, or opportunities for cooperation.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Project Terra is currently a fully self-funded, fully volunteer organization.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Our staff are basically all doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can see the About page on our website.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to add that we recently added a lot of staff who may not have been updated to the website.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The most important purpose of a project like this is to fully open up, share and cooperate.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The more friends who are willing to join us, share and help each other,

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
we can move towards the goals we all want.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I also hope that it will be helpful to Taiwan's academic circle and everyone's research career, or to transfer jobs in the future.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you feel that you support our ideas, or are passionate about sharing your very passionate research,

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you can consider joining our members, and you will continue to receive our speech and activity information.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Of course, you can also go to our Facebook fan page and continue to follow our news.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We also want to emphasize that we have no profit at all.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you are willing to share with other Taiwanese, it will be the biggest reward for us.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It is also the biggest help to other friends who work in the academic circle.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the introduction of TARA.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Next, I want to introduce our speaker.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We are honored to invite Zheng Yunting today.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Zheng Yunting is currently studying physics at the California Institute of Technology.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He is currently a doctoral candidate.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yunting graduated from the Department of Physics in 2014 and joined the Caltech Research Institute.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is currently studying his doctorate.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
His special field is observational cosmology.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He will introduce to us today that he is doing a data analysis project.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It is a rocket project.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There is one more thing to remind everyone.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In order to let the speaker feel our enthusiasm,

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the microphone must be turned on when applauding, so that he can hear the voice.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's applaud and welcome Yunting to give us this speech.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you everyone.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am Zheng Yunting. I am studying my PhD at Caltech.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you to my office mate, Zhang Yanyong, for the introduction.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The topic I am going to talk about today is

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Measuring Extragalactic Background Light at Optical and Near-Infrared.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is a project I am doing.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am doing its data analysis.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What I am going to talk about today is more focused on

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the background in this field.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What do we want to measure?

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do we want to understand?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What is a signal?

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me start by introducing the history of our universe.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the universe we know so far.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We can start from the left.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The left is the earliest period.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have inflation and Big Bang.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Inflation is the theory of explosion in Chinese.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Big Bang is the beginning of the universe.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In the very early period,

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the universe is very small and hot.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everything inside is very hot and oily.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
As the universe expands,

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the gas will expand.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
At a certain point in time,

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the temperature in the universe is low enough.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The electrons and protons in the gas

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
will combine to form hydrogen.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This process is called recombination.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
After recombination,

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
there are a lot of photons in the universe.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Photons are easily scattered with free electrons.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
After recombination,

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
there are almost no free electrons in the universe.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
These photons will not become long.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We can see the photons emitted at that time.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is called a cosmic microwave background or CMB.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is the earliest signal we can measure in cosmology.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After recombination and CMB,

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
a lot of protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
During this period,

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the universe is full of neutral hydrogen and hydrogen.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This period is called the Dark Age.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because it is very dark,

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
there are no photons like the CMB at that time.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
However, there are no stars and galaxies yet.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The universe during this period is completely black.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
During this period,

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
there will be some density fluctuations in the universe.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
These density fluctuations are because of gravity.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As time goes by,

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
there will be more matter coming in.

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The main component is dark matter.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
These dark matter may form heavier and condensed structures.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We call this dark matter halo.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because there is a strong gravitational potential in the halo,

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the background gases such as hydrogen will also gather here.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When the gathering becomes compact,

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
it will cause a fusion reaction and form the first star or galaxy.

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
After a period of time,

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the universe begins to form stars and galaxies.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After these stars and galaxies form,

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they will release a lot of photons.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If the energy of the photons is strong enough,

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the energy gap between the hydrogen and the gas will be strong enough.

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The gas will separate the hydrogen nearby.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can see that there are some separated areas on this map.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We call this ionizing bubble.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This process is called reionization.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
As time goes by,

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
there will be more and more stars and galaxies in the universe.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It will ionize the hydrogen nearby.

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
At the end,

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
if you have enough galaxies,

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you will separate all the hydrogen in the universe.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The gases outside the galaxy are all ionized.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is our current universe.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is the history of the development of the universe.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What I'm going to study now is called an extra-galactic background light.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have a question.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, okay.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I see.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I see.

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I see.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can you see it clearly like this?

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Actually, I think it's pretty clear.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay, then I'll do it like this.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I also think traffic lights are more convenient.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, what I'm going to measure is the extra-galactic background light,

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or EVL.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
In the literature, the word galactic refers to our own galaxy.

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, extra-galactic is outside our own galaxy.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Background light refers to everything outside the galaxy.

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So, the EVL we measure is the time in the history of the universe.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So, it's like this.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can see CMB from the beginning,

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and then there's Dark Age,

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and then there's a lot of stars and galaxies.

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And then they emit light.

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So, the spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So, the spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And these data on the diagram show the subjects all of the EMB measurements.

151
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And these data on the diagram show the subjects all of the EMB measurements.

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,

153
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,

155
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and I'm going to share a little bit about what each wavelength does for you.

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and I'm going to share a little bit about what each wavelength does for you.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So, let's look at the high-energy and low-energy one first.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The high-energy one is GAMMA RAY and X-ray.

159
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The high-energy one is GAMMA RAY and X-ray.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The main source of these high-energy photons is called

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the Active Galactic Nuclei from the AGM.

162
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The main source of these high-energy photons is called the Active Galactic Nuclei from the AGM.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
These are billions of black holes in the center of each galaxy

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
These are billions of black holes in the center of each galaxy

165
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
These black holes accelerate the heat emanated from galaxies

166
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
These black holes accelerate the heat emitted from galaxies

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
These black holes accelerate the heat emanated from galaxies

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
These black holes acceleration leads to både  coated with aurorae

169
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
These black holes acceleration leads to béocte

170
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
These black holes acceleration leads to béocte

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000

We also have low-bout of agaric compounds

182
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,040
which are synchrotron radiation

183
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,040
which is when gas is heated,

184
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
which is when gas is heated,

185
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
or accelerated to a very high speed.

186
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
We don't have much data on UV

187
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,040
We don't have much data on UV

188
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,040
We don't have much data on UV

189
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,080
and the experiment result was mere readings

190
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,080
And the experiment result was mean readings

191
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,080
And the experiment result was mere readings

192
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,080
So we very rarely meet UV in astro galactic.

193
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,080

194
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080

195
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:14,120
This peak was the oscillation of Cosmic microwave background in 30s

196
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,120


197
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:22,120
These are the two small bumps, one in the optical and one in the infrared.

198
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,120
These two mainly come from the star emission in each galaxy.

199
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Star emission is on the optical side.

200
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,120
In the infrared, it is the emission of dust in the galaxy.

201
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:52,120
These dusts absorb the starlight and emit thermal radiation.

202
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,120
This thermal radiation is in the infrared.

203
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:09,120
In the infrared, half of the starlight is emitted by the optical, and the other half is absorbed by the dust.

204
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:19,120
The wavelengths I'm going to talk about today are in the optical.

205
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:27,120
If we zoom in, we can see that there is a lot of different data here.

206
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,120
This is the fine infrared bump, and this is the optical down near infrared.

207
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,120
You can see that there is a lot of different data here.

208
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Each data is measured at a different value in the same wavelength.

209
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:58,120
The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.

210
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:06,120
The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.
