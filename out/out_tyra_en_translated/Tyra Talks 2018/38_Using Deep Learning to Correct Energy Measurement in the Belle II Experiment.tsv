0	15000	Welcome everyone to today's TARA speech. First of all, welcome everyone to listen to Huang Kun-hsieh to tell us about Python to play with particles physics experiment.
16000	29000	TARA is an online platform. Our goal is to use a free and cross-border way to connect young people all over the world who are engaged in research.
29000	39000	We can quickly share each other's results and ideas. We have a website and a fan group. The name of our fan group is Project TARA.
39000	42000	You can find us on Facebook.
42000	47000	Let me introduce today's speaker. Today's speaker is Huang Kun-hsieh.
47000	55000	It's quite interesting. When I was preparing to introduce the speaker, I did a little calculation. I think we have known each other for 10 years.
56000	61000	Huang Kun-hsieh studied at the University of Taiwan Physics Department and the University of Taiwan Physics Institute.
61000	68000	When he was in the doctor's class, he went to the University of Kyoto. During this period, he was engaged in the study of micro-needle telescope.
68000	76000	Later, he did T2K at the University of Kyoto. So Huang Kun-hsieh can be said to be a micro-needle expert.
77000	88000	After Huang Kun-hsieh got his doctorate, he went to Bell Institute to do hardware development. He is now a post-doctorate researcher.
88000	92000	The topic he will talk to us today is to use Python to play the particle physics experiment.
92000	97000	An example of using a convolutional neural network to correct gamma-ray energy measurement.
98000	103000	Without further ado, let's give a round of applause to welcome Huang Kun-hsieh.
103000	111000	Sorry, I forgot to say one thing. Please mute your microphone if you don't want to speak in the speech.
111000	117000	But when you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone so that our speaker can feel your enthusiasm.
117000	121000	Let's welcome Huang Kun-hsieh.
122000	127000	Thank you for the introduction. I have been a speech therapist for a long time.
127000	132000	I am very happy that you gave me the opportunity to speak here today.
132000	140000	Actually, my speech was shot in Taiwan.
140000	149000	So I'm sorry. If you have been to Taiwan, you may have heard the same thing over and over again.
149000	154000	My name is Huang Kun-hsieh. I am a post-doctorate student at Taiwan University.
154000	159000	I am currently working on a project called Bell 2.
159000	163000	I am currently doing a particle physics experiment.
163000	165000	I am studying the field of particle physics.
165000	168000	In the particle physics experiment, you may take a lot of data.
168000	170000	If you take data, you may need to do data analysis.
170000	177000	If you do data analysis, it is a very good language.
177000	182000	If you want to download it, you can download it here.
182000	186000	This is my own photo.
186000	190000	I am currently doing post-doctoral research at Taiwan University.
190000	195000	I am currently doing research in the field of particle physics.
195000	198000	I also like to use my voice.
198000	202000	What is my research?
202000	206000	The screen you are sharing is your PowerPoint.
206000	209000	It's not the part you play. You may have to re-share it.
209000	212000	Then choose that.
212000	225000	Oh, okay. Let's do it again.
225000	226000	Is there such a thing?
226000	229000	Choose the screen.
229000	230000	Yes.
230000	232000	Yes?
232000	238000	Okay.
238000	242000	What I'm doing now is in a Japanese studio.
242000	246000	There is an organization called KK.
246000	251000	If you want to listen to Japanese, it's Koe-nen-ruki-kasoku-ken-kyu-kiko.
251000	253000	It's simply called KK.
254000	258000	There is such a big research device called Bell 2.
258000	260000	It's a detector.
260000	264000	Mainly, we use Python to simulate and analyze.
264000	266000	There is also some data storage.
266000	269000	And even push the data to the whole world.
269000	273000	Because we have Google Earth that pushes the data to the whole world.
273000	276000	They will provide their computing resources.
276000	280000	Then I will talk about how to push the data to the whole world.
280000	283000	The first thing to talk about is particle physics.
283000	286000	I'm sorry.
286000	289000	Because the data I prepared is scientific.
289000	291000	Some people may not know what particle physics is.
291000	293000	So let's talk about what particle physics is.
293000	295000	At the beginning, for example, water molecules.
295000	296000	You must have heard of water molecules.
296000	298000	High school physics should have heard of water molecules.
298000	299000	There will be atoms in it.
299000	304000	Atoms will have electrons and the nucleus inside.
304000	308000	Electrons are the so-called basic particles.
308000	312000	In addition, you will find neutrons and neutrons in the nucleus.
312000	316000	Neutrons and neutrons are composed of quarks.
316000	322000	In fact, the most basic discovery is that there are electrons and quarks.
322000	329000	To form the universe we see in our daily lives.
329000	338000	Particle physics is to study the interaction between these basic particles and their group.
338000	343000	And how to form the law of the universe.
343000	350000	How do we study particle physics?
350000	352000	We usually do one thing.
352000	358000	We will use the accelerator to accelerate the particles to a very fast speed.
359000	361000	For example, like this animation.
361000	367000	Let the particles and the antiparticles accelerate to a very fast speed.
367000	370000	Then there will be a collision in the middle.
370000	373000	After we let it collide, it will produce a new one.
373000	379000	We rarely see this example in the current universe.
379000	382000	It's a more unfamiliar example.
382000	383000	In our daily lives.
383000	386000	It's not like that kind of thing.
386000	391000	We rarely see this kind of thing in the current universe.
391000	396000	So we study these new examples.
396000	398000	And see what their interaction is like.
398000	401000	Neutrons are one of them.
401000	410000	In fact, we have a lot of large-scale particle physics experiments.
410000	412000	There are many large-scale physics experiments in the world.
413000	415000	The first is the collision experiment.
415000	419000	For example, if you have heard of similar LHC.
419000	423000	What kind of experiments are there under LHC?
423000	425000	The biggest three experiments are actually four.
425000	427000	The biggest four experiments are CNS, ATLAS.
427000	429000	The other experiment is not included.
429000	432000	CNS, ATLAS, and LHC-B.
432000	435000	In addition, our protagonist today is BELL-2.
435000	437000	It is also a collision experiment.
438000	440000	It's about electrons.
440000	442000	It's about electrons and positive electrons.
442000	445000	That is, positive electrons.
445000	446000	Electrons are negative electrons.
446000	448000	Positive electrons are negative electrons.
448000	450000	It's a collision experiment.
450000	451000	There are also other kinds of experiments.
451000	453000	For example, T2K, which I used to participate in.
453000	455000	And then the pressure back in China.
455000	457000	Or SNOPLUS in Canada.
457000	459000	There are other examples.
459000	462000	For example, alpha in LHC.
463000	465000	Alpha in SNOPLUS.
465000	469000	And the Koto experiment in Japan.
469000	471000	I am very happy.
471000	473000	When we received the number on April 26th.
473000	476000	BELL-2 is the first operation.
476000	481000	This is a report at the time.
481000	483000	This is the release press.
483000	490000	And the first collision event.
491000	496000	That's why we're doing BELL-2 experiments.
496000	499000	Please give me three minutes.
502000	506000	At the beginning, the BELL-2 detector.
506000	510000	Actually, it's a detection of B particles.
510000	516000	B particles are rare in the universe.
517000	520000	We will learn about CP-Violation.
520000	522000	That is, the universe is not uniform.
522000	524000	With other new physics.
528000	529000	What is the universe not uniform?
529000	531000	If the universe is not uniform.
531000	534000	It will be with us.
534000	536000	That's why we only have materials now.
536000	538000	Related to our universe.
538000	540000	I have a YouTube video.
540000	542000	Please take a look.
542000	544000	I don't know if YouTube is okay.
544000	546000	Wait a minute, I'll play it again.
563000	566000	This is the theory of the Big Bang.
566000	571000	The universe after the Big Bang.
571000	572000	At the time of the Big Bang.
572000	574000	Matter and antimatter.
574000	576000	It should be the same level.
581000	583000	Now there's only matter in the universe.
583000	586000	Other antimatter has disappeared.
602000	605000	Matter and antimatter.
605000	607000	There should be a difference.
607000	609000	So they say.
609000	615000	In addition to the difference between the electron box and the symmetry.
615000	617000	There should be other differences.
617000	619000	Other differences are called CP-Violation.
631000	635000	Now known as the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.
635000	637000	It was a revolutionary theory.
637000	640000	Which introduced a model that contained six quarks.
640000	644000	Even though only three quarks were known at the time.
644000	646000	In 2001.
646000	650000	The Bell experiment successfully measured CP-Violation.
650000	652000	In B meson decays.
652000	655000	As predicted by the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.
662000	665000	There are six quarks.
665000	667000	Three or four quarks.
667000	669000	Three or four quarks decays.
669000	671000	They should have.
671000	675000	Matter and antimatter.
675000	677000	An asymmetry.
677000	680000	Later in the Bell experiment.
680000	682000	It was confirmed.
682000	684000	Now it's more accurate.
692000	693000	In 2008.
693000	696000	30 years after their theory paper was published.
696000	698000	Professor Kobayashi.
698000	700000	And Professor Masukawa.
700000	702000	Won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
702000	706000	Experimental confirmation of the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.
706000	709000	By the Bell and Babar experiments.
709000	712000	Greatly contributed to their Nobel Prize.
712000	717000	It's easy to get the Nobel Prize.
743000	745000	Electrons and neutrons.
745000	747000	Accelerate to the light.
747000	749000	Let them collide.
749000	751000	Then they will.
751000	754000	If the antimatter is converted to the electron.
754000	756000	They will produce.
756000	758000	Other kinds.
758000	760000	Heavier particles.
760000	761000	This annihilation.
761000	764000	Transforms the electron and positron.
764000	766000	Into a pair of B mesons.
766000	768000	Which consists of bottom quarks.
768000	771000	Two B mesons.
771000	773000	B mesons.
773000	775000	These two B mesons.
775000	777000	Will decay.
777000	779000	Because they have a lot of life.
786000	788000	They will decay.
788000	791000	Into other kinds.
791000	793000	Other kinds of particles.
793000	795000	Usually negative.
796000	798000	In your detector.
798000	800000	Measure their decay.
800000	802000	After the example.
802000	804000	Then calculate.
804000	806000	It should be B mesons.
825000	827000	Particles then pass through.
827000	829000	The central drift chamber.
829000	831000	Here they ionize the gas.
831000	833000	Which fills the detector.
833000	835000	In this way.
835000	837000	A particle's trajectory and momentum.
837000	839000	Is obtained.
839000	841000	Next comes the top counter.
841000	843000	And the aerogel rich counter.
846000	848000	A charged particle.
848000	850000	Emits Cherenkov radiation.
850000	852000	When it enters these detectors.
852000	854000	The timing and pattern information.
854000	856000	Of the detected Cherenkov radiation.
856000	859000	Tells us what kind of particle it is.
861000	864000	Then there is an electromagnetic calorimeter.
865000	867000	This detector precisely measures.
867000	869000	The energy of photons.
869000	871000	Electrons.
871000	873000	The outermost detector.
873000	875000	Is the long living neutral.
875000	877000	And muon detector.
877000	879000	It detects muons.
879000	881000	Which penetrate most of the detector.
881000	883000	And neutral chaos.
883000	885000	Which cannot be measured.
885000	887000	With the inner detectors.
911000	913000	It does not have an electrolyte.
913000	915000	Because the light does not have an electrolyte.
915000	917000	So it is in the middle.
917000	919000	Before it touches the ECL.
919000	921000	From the point of collision.
921000	923000	Before it touches the ECL.
923000	925000	It will not be detected.
925000	927000	Why is the ECL detected?
927000	929000	Because it is denser.
929000	931000	So it is easier for light.
931000	933000	It is easier to produce a reaction.
933000	935000	It will be here.
935000	937000	After the reaction.
937000	939000	It will be broken down into many kinds.
939000	941000	These electrons.
941000	943000	In the crystal.
943000	945000	It will glow in the crystal.
947000	949000	This crystal.
949000	951000	Will add a light sensor.
951000	953000	Photosensor.
953000	955000	You can look at the photosensor.
955000	957000	Its energy size.
957000	959000	The light on both sides.
959000	961000	The intensity of the light.
961000	963000	The intensity of the gamma radiation.
965000	967000	All the detectors.
967000	969000	This is the most important thing today.
979000	981000	If you want to go in.
981000	983000	I have a link here.
983000	985000	You can go back and see for yourself.
989000	991000	This is the history of the universe.
991000	993000	At the beginning of the big explosion.
993000	995000	The universe is very hot.
995000	997000	The universe is very cold.
997000	999000	Relatively cold.
999000	1001000	In the primordial universe.
1001000	1003000	We have a lot.
1003000	1005000	There will be a lot in the universe.
1005000	1007000	In real life.
1007000	1009000	In the cold universe.
1011000	1013000	There are many strange examples.
1013000	1015000	In the universe.
1019000	1021000	Our accelerator.
1021000	1023000	Super KKB.
1023000	1025000	He knows.
1025000	1027000	What we are not familiar with now.
1027000	1029000	Strange examples.
1029000	1031000	It often appeared in the universe.
1033000	1035000	These examples.
1035000	1037000	We can understand.
1037000	1039000	From the past to the present.
1041000	1043000	What happened.
1043000	1045000	There may be some.
1045000	1047000	Strange behavior.
1047000	1049000	The universe.
1049000	1051000	Only matter.
1051000	1053000	Still very mysterious.
1053000	1055000	OK.
1055000	1057000	CP violation.
1057000	1059000	Not familiar with the universe.
1059000	1061000	In 1960.
1061000	1063000	These two people.
1063000	1065000	Not discovered.
1065000	1067000	In the K-on ring.
1067000	1069000	Found in the K-on ring.
1069000	1071000	Found in the K-on ring.
1071000	1073000	Xiaoling and Yichuan in 1973.
1073000	1075000	They.
1075000	1077000	Established.
1077000	1079000	Three quarks era.
1079000	1081000	Six quarks.
1081000	1083000	In the standard model.
1083000	1085000	Six quarks.
1085000	1087000	But.
1087000	1089000	We will.
1091000	1093000	B quark decay.
1093000	1095000	There will be a CP violation.
1095000	1097000	In 1980.
1097000	1099000	These two people.
1099000	1101000	There will be a CP violation.
1101000	1103000	In the K-on ring.
1103000	1105000	OK.
1105000	1107000	You may not know.
1107000	1109000	Simply put.
1109000	1111000	Quarks and.
1111000	1113000	Quarks.
1113000	1115000	In fact, most of the quarks are the same.
1115000	1117000	In addition to.
1117000	1119000	They are not the same.
1119000	1121000	They are not the same.
1121000	1123000	Correct.
1123000	1125000	These two.
1125000	1127000	Charge and parity.
1127000	1129000	Quarks and quarks.
1129000	1131000	Different.
1131000	1133000	Quarks and quarks.
1133000	1135000	There is another.
1135000	1137000	In addition to these two properties.
1137000	1139000	Other different properties.
1139000	1141000	Will be called by us.
1141000	1143000	CP violation.
1143000	1145000	For example, like life.
1145000	1147000	Or like.
1147000	1149000	Decay branching ratio.
1149000	1151000	Only here.
1151000	1153000	B quark situation.
1153000	1155000	Of course there are other CP violations.
1155000	1157000	That kind.
1157000	1159000	Only here.
1159000	1161000	Life or decay ratio.
1161000	1163000	What is B quark?
1163000	1165000	What is B quark?
1165000	1167000	This is from the website.
1167000	1169000	Take it over.
1169000	1171000	B quark.
1171000	1173000	It is actually a B and a D.
1173000	1175000	To constitute.
1175000	1177000	It has B 0 and B 0 bar.
1177000	1179000	It has B plus and B minus.
1179000	1181000	Now the universe is.
1181000	1183000	The left side is more material.
1183000	1185000	The right side is less anti-material.
1185000	1187000	Of course now.
1187000	1189000	B quark is very rare.
1189000	1191000	Then.
1191000	1193000	How do we measure.
1193000	1195000	CP violation in B quark.
1195000	1197000	For example, life.
1197000	1199000	After the confrontation.
1199000	1201000	They will fly in the same direction.
1201000	1203000	B quark and B quark.
1203000	1205000	Will fly in the same direction.
1205000	1207000	The longer the life, the longer the flight.
1207000	1209000	The shorter the life, the shorter the flight.
1209000	1211000	That is.
1211000	1213000	Use this to measure B quark or B quark.
1213000	1215000	Life difference.
1215000	1217000	Of course there are some decay modes.
1217000	1219000	B is more.
1219000	1221000	But this.
1221000	1223000	At the same time to verify.
1223000	1225000	They should be.
1225000	1227000	It's different in life.
1227000	1229000	OK.
1229000	1231000	It has a lot of new physics.
1231000	1233000	For example, like.
1233000	1235000	Some of you may have heard of.
1235000	1237000	Maybe it's too difficult.
1237000	1239000	There will be some.
1239000	1241000	Intermediate particles.
1241000	1243000	It may not be.
1243000	1245000	The example we know.
1245000	1247000	So it will be different.
1247000	1249000	And the other one is.
1249000	1251000	Of course it's not just.
1251000	1253000	This is.
1253000	1255000	Yan Yong is also.
1255000	1257000	Researched.
1257000	1259000	His research is.
1259000	1261000	Direct detection.
1261000	1263000	The method.
1263000	1265000	B quark.
1265000	1267000	It's also direct detection.
1267000	1269000	OK.
1269000	1271000	Physics is over.
1271000	1273000	You should be blind.
1273000	1275000	Then.
1275000	1277000	It's more interesting to talk about this.
1277000	1279000	Because I am.
1279000	1281000	Most of them are.
1281000	1283000	People who do software.
1283000	1285000	So the next thing.
1285000	1287000	Should be more.
1287000	1289000	Talk about software.
1289000	1291000	And some examples.
1291000	1293000	For example, like.
1293000	1295000	You know this is.
1295000	1297000	Our Bell 2 detector.
1297000	1299000	It's actually.
1299000	1301000	Its channel number is very amazing.
1301000	1303000	There may be one.
1303000	1305000	One million pixels.
1305000	1307000	That.
1307000	1309000	You have a million pixels.
1309000	1311000	Then every time the collision occurs.
1311000	1313000	Then there will be a lot of B.
1313000	1315000	The event is to remember.
1315000	1317000	Of course, in addition to B.
1317000	1319000	There are a lot of background events.
1319000	1321000	So add up.
1321000	1323000	Very, very much.
1323000	1325000	Then our data size.
1325000	1327000	Then of course this is.
1327000	1329000	You are in the inside of the FPGA.
1329000	1331000	Then put this one million.
1331000	1333000	After throwing away the things you don't want.
1333000	1335000	Then the data size.
1335000	1337000	The size is probably one megabyte.
1337000	1339000	Then the trigger rate is your event rate.
1339000	1341000	If the accelerator is running.
1341000	1343000	Probably.
1343000	1345000	Maximum is 30.
1345000	1347000	30 kilohertz.
1347000	1349000	Like this.
1349000	1351000	This is the maximum.
1351000	1353000	Of course, it's not that high now.
1353000	1355000	The maximum is like this.
1355000	1357000	So the maximum data rate is probably.
1357000	1359000	34 gigabytes per second.
1359000	1361000	Of course, there are only two or three gigabytes now.
1361000	1363000	When running now.
1363000	1365000	Because we are not so high now.
1365000	1367000	That is to run.
1367000	1369000	The accelerator is not fully operational yet.
1369000	1371000	It's not fully operational yet.
1371000	1373000	So it's not as much as 30 gigabytes.
1373000	1375000	Then there are probably only two or three gigabytes.
1375000	1377000	A lot.
1377000	1379000	That.
1379000	1381000	But in fact, two or three gigabytes.
1381000	1383000	Then add some of your simulation.
1383000	1385000	The data produced is actually a lot.
1385000	1387000	Then this page here.
1387000	1389000	It's like this.
1389000	1391000	How much data does it have?
1391000	1393000	That's it.
1393000	1395000	The data is about 30 times a year.
1395000	1397000	Petabyte.
1397000	1399000	Up to 50 petabytes.
1399000	1401000	That's the data.
1401000	1403000	If you don't change the simulation.
1403000	1405000	It's probably 50 petabytes.
1405000	1407000	That's the experiment.
1407000	1409000	If you add the simulation.
1409000	1411000	It's about 200.
1411000	1413000	You can see that Google is about 98.
1413000	1415000	Then Google's search is 98.
1415000	1417000	Then Facebook Upload is 180.
1417000	1419000	Then Google's Internet Archive is 11.
1419000	1421000	11 bytes.
1421000	1423000	Petabyte.
1423000	1425000	It should be petabyte.
1425000	1427000	I forgot how to read it.
1427000	1429000	Then you can know that Bell can actually be with.
1429000	1431000	Google, Facebook.
1431000	1433000	Their data can be compared.
1433000	1435000	It means it's really big.
1435000	1437000	Of course, it's bigger.
1439000	1441000	We're really doing big data.
1441000	1443000	Then the following words are talking about.
1445000	1447000	It's more in-depth.
1447000	1449000	Because we're big data.
1449000	1451000	We need a set of processes.
1451000	1453000	To analyze our data.
1453000	1455000	This is how we do it.
1455000	1457000	Analyze the structure of our data.
1457000	1459000	Where do we put it?
1459000	1461000	Then we save it.
1461000	1463000	The data format is called MDST.
1465000	1467000	It's called Mini Data Summary Table.
1471000	1473000	We want to start with this MDST.
1473000	1475000	There are a lot of unorganized files in MDST.
1477000	1479000	For example, we just saw that.
1479000	1481000	There's no track in detail.
1483000	1485000	There's something else.
1485000	1487000	There's this one in ECL.
1487000	1489000	That's it.
1489000	1491000	We haven't sorted it out yet.
1491000	1493000	Particle or something.
1493000	1495000	Actually turn it into a particle.
1495000	1497000	Or something.
1497000	1499000	We haven't sorted it out yet.
1499000	1501000	We've introduced a module chain.
1501000	1503000	There's a data store.
1503000	1505000	These are a few things.
1505000	1507000	We're basically.
1507000	1509000	We're input data.
1509000	1511000	Put it in the data store.
1511000	1513000	Then put it in the data store.
1513000	1515000	We'll use the module.
1515000	1517000	Then use a path first.
1517000	1519000	Then put in what you need.
1521000	1523000	Put it in.
1523000	1525000	It's called a module.
1525000	1527000	It has different functions.
1527000	1529000	It's actually written in C14.
1529000	1531000	It's written in C14.
1533000	1535000	It's what you just did.
1535000	1537000	What's the track?
1537000	1539000	Then make it an example.
1539000	1541000	The example we see.
1543000	1545000	Then this path.
1545000	1547000	How to put this module in.
1547000	1549000	We use Python to do it.
1551000	1553000	There's something else.
1553000	1555000	After we're done.
1555000	1557000	We output data.
1557000	1559000	We have a root.
1559000	1561000	Our own format.
1563000	1565000	We'll develop a root format.
1565000	1567000	We can also use Python.
1567000	1569000	Analyze this root file.
1569000	1571000	An example like this.
1571000	1573000	For example.
1573000	1575000	We're done with the experiment.
1575000	1577000	We're going to put the NDST.
1577000	1579000	For example, module 1 is low.
1579000	1581000	NDST.
1581000	1583000	And then the particle list.
1583000	1585000	Take it out.
1585000	1587000	There's a track in there.
1587000	1589000	We'll put it in.
1589000	1591000	Turn it into a proton.
1591000	1593000	Or turn it into an electron.
1593000	1595000	Then there's a particle list.
1595000	1597000	And then put that.
1597000	1599000	Some particles.
1599000	1601000	For example, I'm going to make it a bmeson.
1601000	1603000	bmeson will change.
1603000	1605000	Many kinds.
1605000	1607000	It's his daughter's particle.
1607000	1609000	Then put these daughter's particles together.
1609000	1611000	Then combine it into bmeson.
1611000	1613000	Then there will be a new bmeson.
1613000	1615000	That's right.
1615000	1617000	Then we'll make some more choices.
1617000	1619000	It's bmeson.
1619000	1621000	The bmeson he made.
1621000	1623000	The quality is with us.
1623000	1625000	The bmeson we know is too far away.
1625000	1627000	So we don't want this bmeson.
1627000	1629000	Just make some choices.
1629000	1631000	And then write it out at the end.
1631000	1633000	It becomes a root file.
1633000	1635000	The function of Python is.
1635000	1637000	The first aspect is.
1637000	1639000	Build this path.
1639000	1641000	Build this module chain.
1641000	1643000	And then the other one is.
1643000	1645000	You're in the back of the root file.
1645000	1647000	You can use PyRooter to analyze.
1647000	1649000	Or use other packages.
1649000	1651000	Python packages for free.
1651000	1653000	What packages can be used?
1653000	1655000	I'll talk about it later.
1655000	1657000	Two more pages.
1657000	1659000	Let's start with what Rooter is.
1659000	1661000	If you're interested in what Rooter is.
1661000	1663000	Rooter is.
1663000	1665000	It's a way to do data storage.
1665000	1667000	Data analysis.
1667000	1669000	In Hynology Physicist.
1669000	1671000	Hynology Physicist.
1671000	1673000	You can go to his website.
1673000	1675000	I'll write some.
1675000	1677000	Installation instructions here.
1677000	1679000	The most important thing is.
1679000	1681000	Although it is written in C++.
1681000	1683000	You can also use C++ to do it.
1683000	1685000	But you can integrate with the other languages.
1685000	1687000	Such as Python and R.
1687000	1689000	Python is much more resourceful than R.
1689000	1691000	So it's better to use Python.
1691000	1693000	If you don't want to use C++.
1693000	1695000	There's a choice here.
1695000	1697000	You want to use.
1697000	1699000	You want to use Rooter.
1699000	1701000	Then Rooter is in C++.
1701000	1703000	You still use Python Rooter.
1703000	1705000	It's Python by default Rooter.
1705000	1707000	Then there's another option.
1707000	1709000	For example.
1709000	1711000	Rooter on NuPy.
1711000	1713000	Interface between Rooter.
1713000	1715000	Numerical Python.
1715000	1717000	Then there's another one.
1717000	1719000	Rooter Pandas.
1719000	1721000	You can put Rooter's file format.
1721000	1723000	Write it into Pandas DataFrame.
1723000	1725000	The easier one is.
1725000	1727000	Rooter Pandas.
1727000	1729000	Rooter NumPy.
1729000	1731000	You know it doesn't have.
1731000	1733000	It can also be used.
1733000	1735000	But I'm more used to Rooter Pandas.
1735000	1737000	With Rooter.
1737000	1739000	I like Rooter.
1739000	1741000	I use Rooter most often.
1741000	1743000	Then we build.
1743000	1745000	In fact, many people started to use Rooter Pandas.
1747000	1749000	There are some here.
1749000	1751000	It's the same installation instructions.
1751000	1753000	If you are interested.
1753000	1755000	You can install Rooter Pandas.
1755000	1757000	The installation method I wrote.
1757000	1759000	I've tried it myself.
1759000	1761000	Of course, there are other suggestions.
1761000	1763000	For example, PIP.
1763000	1765000	I've tried PIP.
1765000	1767000	I can't install it.
1767000	1769000	I think I can install it.
1771000	1773000	For example.
1773000	1775000	Then.
1775000	1777000	Like LHC.
1777000	1779000	Those experiments.
1779000	1781000	The four experiments.
1781000	1783000	We actually started.
1783000	1785000	Use Jupyter Notebook to start training.
1785000	1787000	It's our new energy.
1787000	1789000	To write analysis programs.
1793000	1795000	We call it StarKit.
1795000	1797000	It's usually three days.
1799000	1801000	There will be three days in about four months.
1801000	1803000	We'll have a meeting in four months.
1805000	1807000	The meeting is held once.
1807000	1809000	Then everyone gathers to have a meeting.
1809000	1811000	For new energy.
1811000	1813000	In the first three days of the collaboration meeting.
1813000	1815000	Then there will be a training.
1815000	1817000	Called StarKit Workshop.
1817000	1819000	Then there will be a meeting for three days.
1821000	1823000	In fact, everyone sits down.
1823000	1825000	Then teach the new energy.
1825000	1827000	How to do our direct analysis.
1827000	1829000	Data processing.
1829000	1831000	Then we use Jupyter Notebook.
1831000	1833000	To do this thing.
1833000	1835000	You can see Jupyter Notebook.
1835000	1837000	Its characteristics are unmistakable.
1837000	1839000	You can see it directly.
1839000	1841000	For example.
1841000	1843000	If you use Lulupandas.
1843000	1845000	You can make it into a table.
1845000	1847000	Then count, min, etc.
1847000	1849000	If you draw a picture.
1849000	1851000	You can keep it on top.
1851000	1853000	Then it's easier for people to see.
1853000	1855000	Of course, this is actually production.
1855000	1857000	You may not need to use Jupyter Notebook.
1857000	1859000	The big advantage of Jupyter Notebook.
1859000	1861000	If you are.
1861000	1863000	Teaching.
1863000	1865000	Or some.
1865000	1867000	After the root analysis.
1867000	1869000	After.
1869000	1871000	If you want to call the picture again.
1871000	1873000	It will be better.
1873000	1875000	There are some.
1875000	1877000	This picture is.
1877000	1879000	How to do software training in high-performance.
1879000	1881000	Basic C++.
1881000	1883000	Basic Data Science.
1883000	1885000	Programming.
1885000	1887000	For example, RootData.
1887000	1889000	Python, Git.
1889000	1891000	Then there are some training.
1891000	1893000	For example, Advanced Root.
1893000	1895000	Then there are others.
1895000	1897000	Then even someone.
1897000	1899000	I want to write NVIDIA.
1899000	1901000	OpenCL.
1901000	1903000	CUDA or OpenCL.
1903000	1905000	There are some.
1905000	1907000	The right side is the training course.
1907000	1909000	For example, like Bell 2 training course.
1909000	1911000	With Atlas CNX HCB.
1911000	1913000	Then there are some advanced training courses.
1913000	1915000	For example, I went to INFN last year.
1915000	1917000	SDC School.
1917000	1919000	That is.
1919000	1921000	After you finish learning.
1921000	1923000	But.
1923000	1925000	Everything is a little bit like this.
1925000	1927000	Then.
1927000	1929000	There is.
1929000	1931000	Here is also possible.
1931000	1933000	Software people may be more interested.
1933000	1935000	Maybe it has nothing to do with physics.
1935000	1937000	I am also participating in this area.
1937000	1939000	In the Bell era.
1939000	1941000	Is.
1941000	1943000	K1K.
1943000	1945000	About ten years ago.
1945000	1947000	We are using Cluster.
1947000	1949000	Central Cluster.
1949000	1951000	Provide everyone Central Cluster.
1951000	1953000	Then everyone comes in.
1953000	1955000	Calculate.
1955000	1957000	But Bell 2.
1957000	1959000	It is obvious.
1959000	1961000	Its accelerator.
1961000	1963000	Already 50 times.
1963000	1965000	So it will.
1965000	1967000	It will be more even rate.
1967000	1969000	Backlight rate will be more.
1969000	1971000	Even rate.
1971000	1973000	Will be more.
1973000	1975000	So of course.
1975000	1977000	There is a lot of backlight.
1977000	1979000	Then we need more.
1979000	1981000	CPU and memory.
1981000	1983000	If it is only K1K.
1983000	1985000	Maybe you only give him money.
1985000	1987000	Then ask him to pay for it.
1987000	1989000	Maybe not.
1989000	1991000	But we have 25 countries.
1991000	1993000	Then 100 institutes.
1993000	1995000	100 institutions participate in this experiment.
1995000	1997000	Then each institution.
1997000	1999000	A little machine to do it.
1999000	2001000	But each institution.
2001000	2003000	It may have different Cluster.
2003000	2005000	Then it may have different grades.
2005000	2007000	Even some institutions.
2007000	2009000	It may be from Amazon.
2009000	2011000	Or Google.
2011000	2013000	Then buy their Cloud Service.
2013000	2015000	That's all right.
2015000	2017000	Then we are very welcome.
2017000	2019000	They do this thing.
2019000	2021000	Then we need to say.
2023000	2025000	There are two important things.
2025000	2027000	So we have to find a way.
2027000	2029000	For example, everyone.
2029000	2031000	Still want to log in.
2031000	2033000	K1K Cluster.
2033000	2035000	Then we can put the job.
2035000	2037000	Is what we need to calculate.
2037000	2039000	We spread all over the world.
2039000	2041000	Is within these 100 institutions.
2041000	2043000	What they provide.
2043000	2045000	What each institution provides.
2045000	2047000	Calculation resources.
2047000	2049000	Then of course they are.
2049000	2051000	Their resources are different.
2051000	2053000	For example, some Cluster.
2053000	2055000	Then of course.
2055000	2057000	Our information will also spread all over the world.
2059000	2061000	Then here.
2061000	2063000	Then we say.
2063000	2065000	How do we do it?
2065000	2067000	There is a software.
2067000	2069000	Then from LCCB.
2069000	2071000	This experiment.
2071000	2073000	LCCB developed this experiment.
2073000	2075000	Our opponent developed it.
2075000	2077000	Then called Dirac.
2077000	2079000	Called Distribute Infrastructure.
2079000	2081000	With Remote Agent Control.
2083000	2085000	When he developed it.
2085000	2087000	He also considered.
2087000	2089000	Everyone will use different things.
2089000	2091000	It's very simple.
2091000	2093000	User Interface.
2093000	2095000	Then you are below.
2095000	2097000	All kinds of Cloud Cluster.
2097000	2099000	If you are interested.
2099000	2101000	GitHub is here.
2101000	2103000	If you look at it yourself.
2103000	2105000	GitHub is here.
2105000	2107000	Then everyone will notice.
2107000	2109000	It's all written in Python.
2109000	2111000	In GitHub.
2111000	2113000	100% is Python.
2113000	2115000	I plug my mouth.
2115000	2117000	Kun Xian's speech.
2117000	2119000	The link of the video.
2119000	2121000	I put it on the side.
2121000	2123000	The place to chat.
2123000	2125000	There is a link.
2125000	2127000	If you want to see those webpages.
2127000	2129000	Go back and look at the webpages.
2129000	2131000	I just didn't copy it.
2131000	2133000	You can go and see.
2137000	2139000	Build Dirac.
2139000	2141000	Build is.
2141000	2143000	Bring LCCB Dirac.
2143000	2145000	Then put your database in.
2145000	2147000	This way.
2147000	2149000	The picture on the left.
2149000	2151000	Data transmission.
2151000	2153000	Data transmission.
2153000	2155000	Green is successful.
2155000	2157000	Red is a failure.
2157000	2159000	You can see the Japanese team.
2159000	2161000	To the United States has been a failure.
2161000	2163000	I don't know what happened.
2163000	2165000	Have been a failure.
2165000	2167000	Other places are successful.
2167000	2169000	More.
2169000	2171000	The prototype is a success.
2171000	2173000	The ratio of failure.
2173000	2175000	Basically we are.
2175000	2177000	We did the experiment.
2177000	2179000	After.
2179000	2181000	Because we are at the end.
2181000	2183000	Will save a copy.
2183000	2185000	Then we will.
2185000	2187000	Push to the United States.
2187000	2189000	BNL.
2189000	2191000	Blue Heaven.
2191000	2193000	In New York.
2193000	2195000	There is a copy.
2195000	2197000	Experimental data.
2197000	2199000	There are some others.
2199000	2201000	Do you have 100 institutes?
2201000	2203000	100 institutes.
2203000	2205000	Every institute.
2205000	2207000	There are a few more.
2207000	2209000	A few more.
2209000	2211000	There will be a total of three.
2211000	2213000	After we do the experiment.
2213000	2215000	We will put two copies of data.
2215000	2217000	Push out to BNL.
2217000	2219000	With other sites.
2219000	2221000	So every site will have.
2221000	2223000	Their own.
2223000	2225000	Data copy.
2227000	2229000	Of course.
2229000	2231000	This is actually the data of the experiment.
2231000	2233000	For example, the simulation.
2233000	2235000	Put it on BNL.
2235000	2237000	Or put it on KK.
2237000	2239000	Put it on other sites.
2239000	2241000	For example, Taiwan also has.
2241000	2243000	In the computer.
2243000	2245000	We also provide resources to them.
2245000	2247000	There is also a storage unit.
2247000	2249000	It will be stored there.
2249000	2251000	Then.
2251000	2253000	For example, I submitted a job.
2253000	2255000	I may need a certain file.
2255000	2257000	He will go to the database.
2257000	2259000	I submitted a job.
2259000	2261000	This job.
2261000	2263000	For example, Italy.
2263000	2265000	This is a job in Italy.
2265000	2267000	For example.
2267000	2269000	In Bologna.
2269000	2271000	In Bologna.
2271000	2273000	He will look for nearby.
2273000	2275000	For example, I want a file.
2275000	2277000	Where is the file in the database?
2277000	2279000	Where is it?
2279000	2281000	He will look for nearby.
2281000	2283000	Nearby storage unit.
2283000	2285000	See if he has it.
2285000	2287000	This is pretty much the case.
2287000	2289000	This time frame.
2289000	2291000	Time relationship.
2291000	2293000	I do not speak in great detail.
2293000	2295000	It is probably such a frame.
2295000	2297000	To do the analysis.
2297000	2299000	OK, then the last thing is.
2299000	2301000	To support.
2301000	2303000	The spirit of implementation.
2303000	2305000	So I say.
2305000	2307000	A case of NNW.
2307000	2309000	In fact, in the high-end.
2309000	2311000	We also started to try.
2311000	2313000	Now we continue to learn to do it.
2313000	2315000	This is the first thing.
2315000	2317000	Then it is just mentioned.
2317000	2319000	EHOMEDIC CHROMETER.
2319000	2321000	This.
2321000	2323000	You can see that it is in.
2323000	2325000	It shines here.
2325000	2327000	Then it is the same.
2327000	2329000	After the gamma ray hits in.
2329000	2331000	It will be decomposed.
2331000	2333000	This is a CSI crystallization.
2333000	2335000	CSI crystallization.
2335000	2337000	Then the decomposition will shine.
2337000	2339000	Of course.
2339000	2341000	It is impossible that only one will shine.
2341000	2343000	This is BELL VR.
2343000	2345000	Everyone is interested.
2345000	2347000	You can download it.
2347000	2349000	The download is here.
2349000	2351000	VR.
2351000	2353000	It has VR.
2353000	2355000	For example.
2355000	2357000	A gamma ray runs in.
2357000	2359000	Then it will.
2359000	2361000	It will decompose a lot of things.
2361000	2363000	Run out.
2363000	2365000	Of course it decomposes a lot of things.
2365000	2367000	It can not only be in one ECL.
2367000	2369000	It is distributed in several ECLs.
2369000	2371000	This VR is really interesting.
2371000	2373000	That.
2373000	2375000	Yes.
2375000	2377000	You can download it.
2377000	2379000	Then.
2379000	2381000	For example.
2381000	2383000	A gamma ray runs in.
2383000	2385000	It will decompose.
2385000	2387000	Then decompose into other things.
2387000	2389000	Then.
2389000	2391000	This is CSI.
2391000	2393000	It is our luminous body.
2393000	2395000	Then it will be divided.
2395000	2397000	Then here.
2397000	2399000	Because.
2399000	2401000	This luminous body will shine.
2401000	2403000	It actually supports the structure.
2403000	2405000	For example, like steel.
2405000	2407000	Aluminum plate.
2407000	2409000	Then it will not shine.
2409000	2411000	So you can't measure it here.
2411000	2413000	Because it may be outside.
2413000	2415000	Lack of energy.
2415000	2417000	It is anyway.
2417000	2419000	Electrolytes in matter.
2419000	2421000	Loss of energy.
2421000	2423000	This is called CSI leakage.
2423000	2425000	Then it may leak to the back.
2425000	2427000	In fact, there will be a leak.
2427000	2429000	What is it actually?
2429000	2431000	For example, like this.
2431000	2433000	The simulation is actually like this.
2433000	2435000	A gamma ray comes in from the right.
2435000	2437000	Then there will be a lot at the back.
2437000	2439000	Leakage.
2439000	2441000	Leakage out.
2441000	2443000	The structure will also have some.
2443000	2445000	Leakage.
2445000	2447000	What will this cause?
2447000	2449000	For example, there is a mode.
2449000	2451000	It is called B plus to low plus.
2451000	2453000	I do not know.
2453000	2455000	Anyway, the back will become.
2455000	2457000	A lot of gamma rays.
2457000	2459000	Then there is a pi plus.
2459000	2461000	Anyway, I remember a lot of gamma rays.
2461000	2463000	Then we are from this.
2463000	2465000	A lot of gamma rays and pi plus.
2465000	2467000	Then we combine it into B plus.
2467000	2469000	Of course, our B plus.
2469000	2471000	The energy of its low mass.
2471000	2473000	Is from this pi plus.
2473000	2475000	Combined with a lot of gamma rays.
2475000	2477000	Then we.
2477000	2479000	If there is a leakage.
2479000	2481000	You will find that OK.
2481000	2483000	B plus energy.
2483000	2485000	It will not be a good one.
2485000	2487000	That is.
2487000	2489000	For example, like the standard.
2489000	2491000	Standard distribution is not.
2491000	2493000	It will be like this.
2493000	2495000	This curve is like this.
2495000	2497000	It will have a tail here.
2497000	2499000	It has a lot of low energy places.
2499000	2501000	Event here.
2501000	2503000	Because it is inaccurate.
2503000	2505000	It will have leakage there.
2505000	2507000	That.
2507000	2509000	This problem appears.
2509000	2511000	Let's take a look.
2511000	2513000	What is ECL?
2513000	2515000	ECL is like this.
2515000	2517000	Eight thousand.
2517000	2519000	Arranged mess.
2519000	2521000	I think it's hard to do.
2521000	2523000	So let's do something simple at the beginning.
2523000	2525000	Do something simple at the beginning.
2525000	2527000	30x30.
2527000	2529000	Crystal array.
2529000	2531000	30x30.
2531000	2533000	Because this is my special.
2533000	2535000	It is done by PyCon.
2535000	2537000	Then this simulation.
2537000	2539000	If you are interested, you can take a look.
2539000	2541000	Here.
2541000	2543000	For everyone.
2543000	2545000	If we measure the energy.
2545000	2547000	In fact, it is the energy of each individual crystal.
2547000	2549000	Then put it together.
2549000	2551000	Just add it up like this.
2551000	2553000	Is that OK?
2553000	2555000	This is the traditional way we measure energy.
2555000	2557000	OK.
2557000	2559000	After the gamma ray hits.
2559000	2561000	It has energy for each crystal.
2561000	2563000	Measure the energy.
2563000	2565000	Then we measure the energy of each crystal.
2565000	2567000	All add up.
2567000	2569000	This is the way we measure energy.
2569000	2571000	Like this.
2571000	2573000	But it will leak.
2573000	2575000	For example, like this.
2575000	2577000	The gamma ray hits in.
2577000	2579000	Hit here.
2579000	2581000	Some leaked.
2581000	2583000	It will become OK.
2583000	2585000	Energy is gone.
2585000	2587000	For example, we hit.
2587000	2589000	Gamma ray energy.
2589000	2591000	Is 200mEV.
2591000	2593000	Then we hit 10,000 times.
2593000	2595000	Then we measure the energy.
2595000	2597000	How is the energy of the gamma ray?
2597000	2599000	Its distribution will be like this.
2599000	2601000	Yes.
2601000	2603000	Of course, there are also 200.
2603000	2605000	Most of the words.
2605000	2607000	Will not reach 200.
2607000	2609000	Even some words.
2609000	2611000	150, 125.
2611000	2613000	It will not be able to measure all.
2613000	2615000	Measure the energy.
2615000	2617000	Is not accurate.
2617000	2619000	Measure the energy is not accurate.
2619000	2621000	How to do it?
2621000	2623000	Just add it up.
2623000	2625000	Not good enough.
2625000	2627000	Then we.
2627000	2629000	This question.
2629000	2631000	Is a return question.
2631000	2633000	Your true energy is 200.
2633000	2635000	Then your prediction.
2635000	2637000	Is.
2637000	2639000	Your prediction.
2639000	2641000	You want to measure now.
2641000	2643000	How much is the energy?
2643000	2645000	Is a return question.
2645000	2647000	Yes.
2647000	2649000	But now you have total.
2649000	2651000	Other crystal patterns.
2651000	2653000	In fact, I thought later.
2653000	2655000	A method is.
2657000	2659000	For example, you go to see alone.
2659000	2661000	The energy distribution of the crystal.
2661000	2663000	Then this is.
2663000	2665000	Gamma ray energy.
2665000	2667000	Is a crystal.
2667000	2669000	Slightly to the right.
2669000	2671000	Its energy distribution.
2671000	2673000	It's a little different.
2673000	2675000	Then we suspect.
2675000	2677000	Is not hit in the middle.
2677000	2679000	The energy distribution.
2679000	2681000	Will be different from the middle.
2681000	2683000	Then he measured.
2683000	2685000	The degree of leakage.
2685000	2687000	Should be different.
2689000	2691000	This is.
2691000	2693000	Our energy distribution.
2693000	2695000	Pattern.
2695000	2697000	Is a picture.
2697000	2699000	The picture inside.
2701000	2703000	The picture inside is different.
2703000	2705000	For example, people are different.
2705000	2707000	Animals are different.
2707000	2709000	If the distribution is different.
2709000	2711000	That means.
2711000	2713000	Energy will be different.
2713000	2715000	That's simple.
2715000	2717000	That's OK.
2717000	2719000	Then we.
2719000	2721000	There should be.
2721000	2723000	There should be a way to do this.
2723000	2725000	Then we think of.
2725000	2727000	CNN.
2729000	2731000	If you have time.
2731000	2733000	You can go to see.
2733000	2735000	Course.
2735000	2737000	CNN.
2739000	2741000	I think.
2741000	2743000	The most detailed should be him.
2745000	2747000	CNN.
2747000	2749000	Different patterns on the map.
2749000	2751000	Find some characteristics.
2751000	2753000	Then use the machine learning method.
2753000	2755000	Find the characteristics of the machine.
2755000	2757000	Then do it.
2757000	2759000	This is the actual simulation.
2759000	2761000	Result.
2761000	2763000	Hit the energy here.
2763000	2765000	There is a pattern here.
2765000	2767000	If you have learned.
2767000	2769000	Machine learning.
2769000	2771000	Our target is.
2771000	2773000	Y2.
2773000	2775000	Usually use this.
2775000	2777000	Y2.
2777000	2779000	What we want to do.
2779000	2781000	We want to predict.
2781000	2783000	How much is the real energy?
2783000	2785000	We use.
2785000	2787000	This energy.
2787000	2789000	Put it at the bottom.
2789000	2791000	Total energy.
2791000	2793000	We just.
2793000	2795000	Put it on top of the energy.
2795000	2797000	Y2 is like this.
2799000	2801000	The advantage of doing this is.
2801000	2803000	If you look at the front.
2803000	2805000	Because it is less than 200.
2805000	2807000	Between 0 and 1.
2807000	2809000	Between 0 and 1.
2809000	2811000	Our prediction.
2811000	2813000	Prediction is the result of our CNN.
2813000	2815000	Then we put the prediction.
2815000	2817000	Divided by our Dtotal.
2817000	2819000	You can get our.
2819000	2821000	The energy predicted by CNN.
2821000	2823000	The loss function.
2823000	2825000	Prediction minus Y2.
2825000	2827000	If you know.
2827000	2829000	What is CNN?
2829000	2831000	If you want to know what CNN is.
2831000	2833000	You can also ask me in person.
2833000	2835000	Our neural network.
2835000	2837000	The structure is like this.
2837000	2839000	I'm sorry.
2839000	2841000	Because I put it directly.
2841000	2843000	Production neural network.
2843000	2845000	Put it in the simulation.
2845000	2847000	It's a bit too complicated.
2847000	2849000	After the image.
2849000	2851000	We use.
2851000	2853000	I want to.
2853000	2855000	My idea is to use that.
2855000	2857000	Google has one.
2857000	2859000	There is a competition called Imagine.
2859000	2861000	There is a.
2863000	2865000	The method of Inception.
2865000	2867000	He used.
2867000	2869000	He used parallel.
2869000	2871000	Then use three different sizes.
2871000	2873000	3x3, 5x5, 7x7.
2873000	2875000	Then start to layer by layer.
2875000	2877000	I only use one layer.
2877000	2879000	Inception, I only use one layer.
2879000	2881000	Use this method.
2881000	2883000	Find characteristics.
2883000	2885000	Is different.
2885000	2887000	Size of things.
2887000	2889000	Why do I.
2889000	2891000	This 30x30 also uses this method.
2891000	2893000	Because this method is actually.
2893000	2895000	Use real ECL method.
2895000	2897000	I'm sorry.
2897000	2899000	Use it directly.
2899000	2901000	Then at the end.
2901000	2903000	Then pull it.
2903000	2905000	Then convolution.
2905000	2907000	Below.
2907000	2909000	Then pull it flat.
2909000	2911000	Then get it at the end.
2911000	2913000	Use Sigma function.
2913000	2915000	My target function.
2915000	2917000	My target is limited to 0 to 1.
2917000	2919000	Then do it at the end.
2921000	2923000	If you go.
2923000	2925000	I'm going to hit 4000.
2927000	2929000	I'm going to hit 10,000.
2929000	2931000	10,000.
2931000	2933000	4G EV.
2933000	2935000	4000 EV Gamma Ray.
2935000	2937000	I originally got.
2937000	2939000	The energy distribution should be like this.
2939000	2941000	Red like this.
2941000	2943000	Very ugly with a big tail.
2943000	2945000	Now it's green.
2945000	2947000	I feel.
2947000	2949000	You see the middle is back to 4000.
2949000	2951000	It seems a little bigger.
2951000	2953000	Although the tail is still there.
2953000	2955000	But there are tails on both sides.
2955000	2957000	Not so long.
2957000	2959000	Then the last result here.
2959000	2961000	Although a little bad.
2961000	2963000	Because I didn't go all the way.
2963000	2965000	OK.
2965000	2967000	This is.
2967000	2969000	The picture on the left is.
2969000	2971000	How much is the real energy?
2971000	2973000	From 500 to 5000.
2973000	2975000	Then.
2975000	2977000	The axis is your real.
2977000	2979000	Total energy minus your true energy.
2979000	2981000	Then divided by your true energy.
2981000	2983000	The more absolute value.
2983000	2985000	It means that you make more mistakes.
2985000	2987000	Absolute value means that you make more mistakes.
2987000	2989000	Then we are in high energy.
2989000	2991000	Not bad.
2991000	2993000	You can see.
2993000	2995000	Up to 2000.
2995000	2997000	It's almost the same as the original method.
2997000	2999000	Low energy is a little worse.
2999000	3001000	Sorry.
3001000	3003000	I didn't finish persuading.
3003000	3005000	Really want to persuade.
3005000	3007000	More than a week.
3007000	3009000	Then you can persuade it.
3009000	3011000	I didn't optimize it.
3011000	3013000	I didn't optimize it.
3013000	3015000	I didn't optimize it.
3015000	3017000	Low energy is not very good.
3017000	3019000	Then on the right.
3019000	3021000	If you look at it.
3021000	3023000	It will have that.
3023000	3025000	This peak will have an rns.
3025000	3027000	Mean square root.
3027000	3029000	nse or nse.
3029000	3031000	Sorry, rns.
3031000	3033000	Assuming you are normal distribution.
3033000	3035000	Then look at it.
3035000	3037000	Uh.
3037000	3039000	Sigma is its rns.
3039000	3041000	Then look at rns.
3041000	3043000	Then look at rns.
3043000	3045000	Red is the original method.
3045000	3047000	Green is my method.
3047000	3049000	Green is OK.
3049000	3051000	High energy is better than them.
3051000	3053000	Low energy is not very good.
3053000	3055000	This is my temporary persuasion.
3055000	3057000	Sorry.
3059000	3061000	Simple CNN is still not good enough.
3061000	3063000	So.
3063000	3065000	We are.
3065000	3067000	I did a lot of modifications in private.
3067000	3069000	For example, the target function has been modified.
3069000	3071000	When there are some patterns.
3071000	3073000	We split it into several.
3073000	3075000	Neural network to train separately.
3075000	3077000	Then put it together at the end.
3077000	3079000	This is another way.
3079000	3081000	We hope to use this method.
3081000	3083000	To solve the real.
3083000	3085000	Fail2 problem.
3085000	3087000	Of course, there are other problems.
3087000	3089000	For example, every csi crystal.
3089000	3091000	Assuming.
3091000	3093000	This simulation is the same.
3093000	3095000	But in fact.
3095000	3097000	Fail's csi crystal.
3097000	3099000	There are more than 100.
3099000	3101000	Although 8000.
3101000	3103000	There are more than 100.
3103000	3105000	There are more than 100.
3105000	3107000	Then there is.
3107000	3109000	The shape is not like 2D.
3109000	3111000	Weird distribution.
3111000	3113000	It is 3D.
3113000	3115000	It is also 2D.
3115000	3117000	It is also 2D.
3117000	3119000	But it is a cylinder distribution.
3119000	3121000	Then there are some.
3121000	3123000	There are some.
3123000	3125000	For example.
3125000	3127000	Or.
3127000	3129000	There are some.
3129000	3131000	Weird gamma rays.
3131000	3133000	That thing.
3133000	3135000	Need to overcome.
3135000	3137000	So we have a long way to go.
3137000	3139000	Thank you for your participation today.
3139000	3141000	If you use neural network.
3141000	3143000	If you use neural network.
3143000	3145000	Google DeepGin.
3145000	3147000	Can put the wolf.
3147000	3149000	Can put the wolf.
3149000	3151000	Or put the little flower.
3151000	3153000	There are some references today.
3153000	3155000	There are some references today.
3155000	3157000	You can take a look.
3157000	3159000	If it's just Bell.
3159000	3161000	Bell 2's predecessor.
3161000	3163000	It also has open data.
3163000	3165000	You can play if you are interested.
3165000	3167000	Bell 2 is also planning.
3167000	3169000	Open data.
3169000	3171000	It's a pity.
3171000	3173000	There is not so much open data.
3173000	3175000	That's it.
3175000	3177000	Thank you Kun Xian.
3177000	3179000	Thank you Kun Xian.
3179000	3181000	Thank you Kun Xian.
3181000	3183000	Does anyone have any questions?
3183000	3185000	Does anyone have any questions?
3185000	3187000	What is that?
3187000	3189000	More than 100 kinds of CSI.
3189000	3191000	More than 100 kinds of CSI.
3191000	3193000	Is it different in ratio.
3193000	3195000	And there are impurities and so on.
3195000	3197000	Is it different in ratio.
3197000	3199000	Is it different in ratio.
3199000	3201000	Is it different in ratio.
3201000	3203000	It's a little different.
3203000	3205000	So what is it with him.
3205000	3207000	The ratio of CSMI is different.
3207000	3209000	The ratio of CSMI is different.
3209000	3211000	It's all the same.
3211000	3213000	It's all the same.
3213000	3215000	But it's a little different.
3215000	3217000	But it's a little different.
3217000	3219000	But it's a little different.
3219000	3221000	But it's a little different.
3221000	3223000	Hello.
3223000	3225000	Hello.
3225000	3227000	I want to ask a question.
3227000	3229000	I just saw you write.
3229000	3231000	When you are in TransCNN.
3231000	3233000	Your loss function is used.
3233000	3235000	That is.
3235000	3237000	That is the ratio.
3237000	3239000	MSE.
3239000	3241000	Is there any special reason?
3241000	3243000	Is there any special reason?
3243000	3245000	Because intuitively.
3245000	3247000	I think you want energy.
3247000	3249000	I think you want energy.
3249000	3251000	Not the ratio.
3251000	3253000	Not the ratio.
3253000	3255000	Not the ratio.
3255000	3257000	It's a good idea.
3257000	3259000	It's a good idea.
3259000	3261000	It's a good idea.
3261000	3263000	Thank you.
3263000	3265000	Thank you.

3409160	3410240	I heard that you will have the
3410240	3412240	Ooooo.
3412880	3414880	Ooooo.
3414880	3416880	Ooooo.
3416880	3418880	Ooooo.
3418880	3420880	Ooooo.
3420880	3422880	Ooooo.
3422880	3424880	Ooooo.
3424880	3426880	Ooooo.
3426880	3428880	Ooooo.
3428880	3430880	Ooooo.
3430880	3432880	Ooooo.
3432880	3434880	Ooooo..
3435380	3437380	Like the middle finger and keon.
3437380	3439380	Like the middle finger and keon.
3439380	3441380	Like the middle finger and keon.
3441380	3443380	No, no. They are similar.
3443380	3445380	Middle finger and electron.
3445380	3447380	They are obviously different in pose shapes.
3447380	3449380	Or gamma ray.
3449380	3451380	Middle finger and gamma ray have different pose shapes.
3451380	3453380	They can be divided by pose shapes.
3453380	3455380	Because one is fully battery.
3455380	3457380	Because one is fully battery.
3457380	3459380	And the other is
3459380	3461380	Hedronic shower.
3461380	3463380	I'm sorry for those who
3463380	3465380	don't have time to make examples.
3465380	3467380	One is Hedronic shower and the other is Hedronic shower.
3467380	3469380	I've heard of it.
3469380	3471380	So that's how they can be divided.
3471380	3473380	So that's how they can be divided.
3473380	3475380	If both are gamma ray
3475380	3477380	and you say this is backlight gamma ray
3477380	3479380	and this is signal gamma ray.
3479380	3481380	Of course, if it's Hedronic shower,
3481380	3483380	it can be divided.
3483380	3485380	Just look at it and you'll know.
3485380	3487380	Just look at it and you'll know.
3487380	3489380	Just look at it and you'll know.
3489380	3491380	Anyone else have questions?
3491380	3493380	Anyone else have questions?
3497380	3499380	Let me talk about it again.
3499380	3501380	We'll post this video
