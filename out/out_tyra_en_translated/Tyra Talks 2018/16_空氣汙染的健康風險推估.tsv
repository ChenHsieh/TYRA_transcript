0	13000	Hello everyone, welcome to today's Taira speech. I am today's host, Lin Bo-xuan, and today I am very happy to invite our speaker, Huang Jiao-yan.
13000	19000	He is now the first EQ in North Carolina to serve as Environmental Consultant.
19000	22000	This speaker's self-introduction is actually quite cool.
22000	26000	He has been in the air-conditioning environment research for more than ten years.
26000	31000	Recently, he gave up atmospheric chemistry research and started to be a policy analyst civil servant.
31000	36000	Today he will share with us the story of Taichung Power Plant.
36000	40000	The slogan is very simple, if you are afraid of death, you must listen carefully.
40000	44000	Then I will leave the time to Jiao-yan, thank you everyone.
44000	51000	Before we start, I would like to applaud and encourage everyone to remember to turn on the sound so that the audience can hear.
51000	56000	Huang Jiao-yan is so handsome.
56000	58000	Thank you, thank you.
58000	62000	Jiao-yan, please start your speech.
62000	81000	Today, I would like to talk about the impact of certain fixed pollutants on the downstream or the overall health risks of Taiwan.
81000	85000	Why do I want to mention Taichung Power Plant?
85000	89000	The main reason is that Mr. Zhuang Bin-jie published an article a few years ago.
89000	97000	He used his own air pollution model to run the Taichung Power Plant PN2.5.
97000	115000	The PN2.5 is a model that shows the impact on the overall health risks of Taiwan.
115000	121000	However, I think his analysis has some errors or bugs.
122000	147000	The main reason I want to talk about Taichung Power Plant is that in the past two months, we have been discussing whether Taichung Power Plant should be converted to a natural gas or maintain the current super-nearby coal-fired power plant.
148000	158000	Mr. Zhuang Bin-jie and Mr. Zhang Chang-chuen from Taichung Power Plant have done a lot of analysis.
158000	175000	I would like to discuss with you what these studies tell us about the real content or the story.
175000	185000	First of all, we need to discuss what air pollution is. Mr. Zhang Chang-chuen discussed what air pollution is in May.
185000	206000	Simply put, any material that is unbearable in the atmosphere is air pollution. The U.S. Department of Environment now defines six standard pollutants, including carbon dioxide, SO2, PN2.5, and NOx.
207000	210000	There are 187 harmful pollutants.
210000	227000	These pollutants will be released into the atmosphere through man-made or natural emissions.
227000	254000	Natural emissions include forest fires, VOCs, and chemical or physical reactions.
254000	269000	At the end, the pollutants will descend back to the ground, causing the human body to breathe in the pollutants.
269000	279000	There are two main levels of air pollution risk. One is inhalation, and the other is exhalation.
279000	291000	Inhalation is very simple. For example, when you stand next to a car and the engine is turned on, NOx and particles are released, and you breathe in these pollutants.
292000	297000	Most of these pollutants are not harmful to the human body, but they are long-term.
298000	303000	Another type of air pollution risk is intact.
304000	316000	Intact pollutants are harmful air pollutants that are released into the atmosphere and descend back to the ground.
316000	329000	These pollutants will be released into the air through biological accumulation, such as milk, fish, or fruits.
330000	333000	Most of these pollutants are not heavy metals, but they are organic.
334000	341000	Today, we will focus on the inhalation part.
342000	349000	We are currently discussing the PN2.5 and ozone part.
349000	365000	Before discussing the Taiwan part, I would like to discuss the current distribution of global air pollution.
365000	375000	This graph shows the global distribution of PN2.5 in 2013.
376000	385000	In this area, there are mainly deserts, so there are relatively small particles.
386000	392000	In China, it is mainly human-made pollutants such as fuel cells and mobile pollutants.
392000	399000	In northern India, it is mainly human-made pollutants.
400000	412000	In the Amazon, it is a natural pollutant, but it emits a lot of VOCs, which is volatile organic matter.
412000	421000	These pollutants will be released into the atmosphere through light reflection to produce secondary particles.
422000	428000	We will also see relatively high PN2.5 in non-rainforest areas.
429000	438000	In the US, PN2.5 is relatively low.
438000	443000	This is a graph of global air pollution in 2013.
