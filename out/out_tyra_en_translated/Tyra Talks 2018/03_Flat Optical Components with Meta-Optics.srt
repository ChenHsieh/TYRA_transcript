1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay, let's get started.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh, I hear the recording has started.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today is

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Phylogenetic Components with Meta-Optics.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Because my main research background is

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the interaction between light and matter,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and then, through this interaction,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we can further manipulate light's behavior.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the main application we want to do is

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
how to reduce the size of the current

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
phylogenetic components on the market.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For example, transparency or bias.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, what is meta?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll talk about it later.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The word meta-optics is actually

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the Greek word for meta.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll talk about it later.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Before we get into the topic,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to share a picture.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know if you've seen this picture.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is from the ancient Roman era.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The picture on the left is from the ancient Roman era.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a wine cup.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's amazing about this is

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you can see that the colors are different.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But they are actually the same cup.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The color is different because

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
they found that when they put the light source outside,

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the color of the cup is green.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But if they put the light source inside the cup,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the cup will turn red.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That is to say, the material on the cup is very special.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you look at the cup from the perspective of reflection,

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
it is green.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But if you put the light source inside,

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the color you see is transparent.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So after you put the light source inside the cup,

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the color you see is red.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
At this time, people think this is amazing.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They also use this kind of material

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
to make church colored glass.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We all know that

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
churches in Europe

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
have very beautiful colored glass.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why are there so many different colors?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The reason is the same as the cup.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The principle of its operation is very similar.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why does this phenomenon occur?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Later, people found that

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
there is a thing called localized surface plasma.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What does this mean?

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why doesn't it move?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They found that

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
if we have a colored light source,

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
it will interact with a metal nanoparticle.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
After interacting with it,

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it will accumulate some free electrons

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
on the surface of the nanoparticle

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
under the appropriate conditions.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
These free electrons

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
will allow it to produce a similar dipole inside,

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
an H-ray dipole or a magnetic dipole.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let it further produce,

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
let it radiate electrons from other dipoles.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then we will see different colors.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
When will this phenomenon occur?

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It mainly occurs

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
when our nanoparticles

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
are smaller than the dipole of the colored light.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This thing will only occur.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So the high-angle cup,

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the colored high-angle cup,

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
later they did a further study

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and found that the high-angle cup

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
actually contained a lot of gold particles of different size.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is gold particle.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The size of these metal particles

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
compared with the dipole of the visible light,

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the visible light dipole is about 400 to 700 nanometers.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Compared with it, it is smaller than the size of the dipole.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So they thought that

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the reason for the different color

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
may come from this

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
local surface plasmon resonance.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The result of localized surface plasmon resonance.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
After this resonance,

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
what special phenomenon will we have?

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It actually has a lot of advantages that we can control,

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that is, we can have.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For example, they found that

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
this resonance has a bias with the dipole of the colored light.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The bias is the direction in which the electron waves resonate.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can see that this picture may be more obvious.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For example, the color here is very colorful,

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
very beautiful,

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
there are five or six colors.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Here you can't see any color at all.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
These two pictures are actually the same sample

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
color.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Their only difference is that

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
they changed the direction of the dipole of the colored light.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This red and white arrow is the direction of its dipole resonance.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When the direction of the dipole of the colored light

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
is along the y-axis,

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
they will see that the chip above

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
will produce different colors.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In fact, you can imagine that

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the chip uses some micro-imaging technology

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to make some metal disks

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that are smaller than visible wavelengths.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Like this disk.

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then they change its diameter or cycle.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We can see different colors

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
in the reflected light part.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But when they turn a bias,

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the colors are all gone.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So you can use it to do something.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For example, this thing can be used to make

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
color filters that have a bias control feature.

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Another special thing is that

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
we used to know that

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
for example,

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
why are we so interested in this thing now?

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For example, we know that gold is often used to make decorations.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For example, rings and necklaces.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But gold,

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
as long as we use gold to make a decoration,

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
whether I pinch it into a square,

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
a circle,

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
or a ring,

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
its color is yellow.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But like I just said,

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
if we put this gold,

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
all the particles here are gold,

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
but they are at a very small scale.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If its scale is smaller than the wavelength,

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we can find that

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
as its size changes,

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the colors we see are different.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is very different from the optical phenomenon

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that we see on the object.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The main reason for this is because

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
of the localized surface plasma.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The next feature is that

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
if the two metals are very close together,

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
there is a very small nano gap

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
between the two metal particles,

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
there will be a very strong near-field coupling.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The two of them will interweave each other.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This interweaving will make them

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
a bit like the simple electronics we learned before.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's like the feeling of end-to-end power generation.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because its scale is very small,

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
the more end-to-end power it can accumulate,

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the stronger the near-field power generation it produces.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If it is very close,

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
the interweaving between the two

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
will cause it to have a stronger field enhancement.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Finally, this resonance

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
has a lot to do with the surrounding environment.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It is very sensitive to the environment.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That is to say,

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
if the surrounding environment's resolution changes,

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
its resonance wavelength,

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
which is the color we saw in the original factory, will change.

166
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
For example, this stick now,

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
if it is in the air,

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I see blue.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But if I put it in the water

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and look at it again,

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
it may turn red.

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This feature

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
is also used by some people

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
to say that we can do some sound sensing.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It is based on the change in color

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
to judge what is the object

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
in the surrounding environment.

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
OK.

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
After introducing the Localized Surface Plasma,

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will tell you

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
what is Metamaterial.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
As I said,

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the word Meta

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
comes from Greek.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It means the same in English.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Metamaterial is a kind of material.

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It has some features.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
These features are not found in natural materials.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We call it Metamaterial.

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Simply put,

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we can use the shape of it

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
or the distance between the particles

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
to change its optical properties.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
These are called Metamaterial.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why do we have these features?

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It should be said that

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
we need to produce Metamaterial properties.

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What is the strict condition?

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
As I said,

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
we generally know that natural materials

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
are composed of atoms.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
For example, CO2, H2O.

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because we know that

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the distance between them is very small.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If I take the surface plasma as 500 nm,

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
which is about the surface plasma of green light,

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
as an example,

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
these two

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
have a very, very big difference in their magnitude.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So its optical properties

211
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
are mainly determined by this molecule or atom.

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
For example, gold is AU.

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No matter how I rub it,

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
it is yellow.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Metamaterial is what I just said.

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If we now put the distance

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
or size between the particles

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to be reduced to the original size,

219
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
which is the level of the magnetic field,

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
which is about Lambda over 4 to Lambda over 10,

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
at this magnitude,

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
we can use man-made methods

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to change the optical properties of the material itself.

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then we can further manipulate

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
some of the behavior of light or electromagnetic waves.

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This can be produced by the resonance

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
at the magnitude of the magnetic field.

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
By using this method to manipulate light,

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we call it metamaterial.

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It is mainly triangular.

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Although my structure is very small,

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
its thickness in the z-direction can be very thick.

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
My very thick is only compared with the surface plasma of green light.

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
For example, it can be one or two microns.

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let me ask you a question.

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
10 to 100 microns?

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No, 1 to 10 microns is fine.

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It can be several microns.

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So 10 nanometers to 100 micrometers is fine.

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The magnitude I'm talking about here is a bit broad.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mainly because the example I gave earlier is visible light.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But the advantage of this thing is that

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
my work plasma may not necessarily be visible light.

244
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can even be a microwave wave.

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So 10 micrometers is Terahertz?

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
100 microns.

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If it is 100 microns,

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it should be 3 Terahertz.

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If I'm not mistaken.

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's about the range of Terahertz.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's far away.

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So its work plasma can be very broad.

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Here is a very special example.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The metamaterial I just mentioned.

255
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When I first saw this phenomenon,

256
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
there was no such word as metamaterial.

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's called left-hand material.

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Why is it called left-hand material?

259
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Because they found that

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
the structure of man-made

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
can control the behavior of light.

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We know that the characteristic of light transmission

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
mainly comes from the refractive index of the ring.

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So they thought,

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is it because of the refractive index?

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Metamaterial is used to manipulate

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
the refractive index of the ring.

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's why it affects the behavior of light.

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Here is a schematic diagram.

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We used to study chemistry in high school.

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If a cup is an empty cup,

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the air refractive index is 1.

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If I put a chopstick here, it will be straight.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If I put a refractive index of 1.3 in it,

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it's probably water.

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We know that because of the refractive index,

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it looks like the chopstick is broken.

278
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But if we put a negative refractive index in it,

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the chopstick we see at this time will look like this.

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is actually just an experiment.

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is not the result of the experiment.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Another interesting thing is that

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
if we have this negative refractive index,

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
we usually know that the beam of light will be full.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In other words, the beam of light is orange here.

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If it is a beam of light,

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
it is along N1sinθ1 and N2sinθ2.

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So it keeps refracting.

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But if the material in the middle

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is a negative refractive material,

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
the beam of light and the beam of refractive light

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
will be located on both sides of the beam.

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This makes them very interested.

294
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That is to say,

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
is it true that because of these characteristics,

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
we can create some real

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
boundaries that naturally cannot exist,

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and then achieve some

299
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
light and snow characteristics that we can't imagine at all?

300
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This kind of negative refractive index,

301
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I am trying to prove it here.

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But in fact, there is already an experiment to prove

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that this thing is really feasible.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But I didn't put their experiment results here.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It is to prove that by

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
properly designing the size of this material,

307
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
or the elements of the material itself,

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
they can achieve the negative refractive index phenomenon.

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think I can skip here.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Next, I will talk about

311
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the Metamaterial I just mentioned.

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I just said it can be very thick,

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
it can be three-dimensional.

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But in fact, our main purpose is to

315
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
control the light.

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Can we further reduce the element?

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They want to say,

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
if I make Metamaterial only one layer,

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because I just said that Metamaterial can be many layers,

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
it means that it can be very thick.

321
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If I only have one layer,

322
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
can I achieve the same effect?

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This one-layer Metamaterial,

324
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
they call it Metasurface.

325
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A surface that is the same as a general surface.

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes, so it's called Metasurface.

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Here is an example.

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
For example, I now have a metal stick.

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
After I inject a electromagnetic wave into it,

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
because this magnitude is much smaller

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
than the injected light wave field,

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
so I can directly use the concept of

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
injecting electromagnetic waves to

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
see the result of this resonance.

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So if my injected light wave field

336
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
vibrates along this direction,

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I can theoretically accumulate positive and negative electrons

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
at both ends of the stick.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This accumulated positive and negative electron

340
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
can make us equivalent to an electrode.

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
After this electrode vibrates,

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
another electromagnetic wave will be radiated.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If we take a closer look at this structure

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
of penetrating light waves and phase light waves,

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
under a fixed wavelength,

346
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
it is obvious that

347
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
if the length of the stick changes,

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
just like I just said,

349
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
because this material,

350
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
this Metasurface or Metamaterial,

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
has a lot to do with its

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
resonance characteristics and size.

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So when I make the length longer

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
or shorter,

355
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
we can see that its resonance wave

356
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
will gradually be flattened.

357
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
At this time,

358
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
if I look at a fixed wavelength,

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
its magnitude or phase

360
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
can be changed.

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
A point that everyone is very concerned about

362
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
is the phase.

363
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is this a simulation?

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, this is a simulation.

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Both of these are simulations.

366
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If we can manipulate the phase,

367
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
we can further manipulate

368
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave,

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
which is the characteristics of its transmission.

370
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
For example, if I now have a

371
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
sample substrate,

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and I record a flat wave,

373
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
if I put some of the

374
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Metasurface nanostructure on the surface,

375
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
because its size is different,

376
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the phase deviation they feel

377
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
will be different.

378
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The different phase deviations

379
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
will make the phase delay

380
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
of the original wave

381
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
different,

382
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
which means that after the original interference,

383
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
they can reconstruct

384
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
another wave front.

385
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And this wave front

386
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
is completely different from the Metasurface.

387
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Although this magnitude is less than

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the Metasurface wavelength,

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we can control the electromagnetic wave

390
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
characteristics

391
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
with the Metasurface nanostructure.

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Here are some examples of applications.

393
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is probably

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
to say that

395
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
we can not only manipulate the electromagnetic wave

396
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
government and phase,

397
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
in fact, the wavelength and deviation

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
can be manipulated

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
by Metasurface.

400
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
For example, they can

401
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
do some optical image

402
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
or do some deviation conversion,

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
which I will introduce later.

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Here is a very simple image

405
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that is, why this thing

406
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
can be so interesting

407
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and help us to design some

408
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
flat optical components.

409
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I use the simplest one before

410
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
is our deflection law

411
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to explain to you.

412
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
For example, if we used

413
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hagen's principle to explain

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the deflection of this thing,

415
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
that is, if I have two materials

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
in the space now,

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the deflection rate is N1 and N2 respectively.

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
After the deflection wave comes in,

419
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
every point on this interface

420
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
is reflected by the deflection light,

421
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can think of it as a

422
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
two-point light source.

423
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So here is a little bit gray,

424
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
gray and white dots,

425
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
round dots.

426
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I just split it

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
into a very small point

428
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
in each space.

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This small point is reflected by the deflection light

430
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and interacts with the deflection light.

431
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think of it as a two-point light source.

432
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The deflection wave

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
coming out of the point light source

434
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
will be a circle.

435
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This circle will eventually

436
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
reconstruct another deflection wave in the original factory.

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because each of them

438
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
has the same surface,

439
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
the phase coming out of their radiation

440
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
has no delay.

441
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So their

442
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
original transmission

443
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
will be as flat as the deflection light,

444
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
which is the tradition.

445
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How did they explain this thing

446
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
with Higgins before?

447
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
When I am now in the diagonal direction,

448
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you can see that the red part

449
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
is the wave front.

450
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This wave front

451
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
touches the time on this interface

452
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
will be different.

453
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It will first touch the point on the left.

454
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So after the point on the left is touched by the light,

455
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it will be regarded as the first

456
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
two-point light source

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
to start radiation.

458
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Then this point is touched.

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But because it is slower to be touched,

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
it will produce

461
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
this radiation slower.

462
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In this way,

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to the end here.

464
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Because the time they were touched

465
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
is different, we can think of it as

466
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
their radiation

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is different.

468
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So you can see that the shape of the radiation

469
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
produced by them is different from here.

470
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The radiation is getting smaller from left to right.

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This will cause

472
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the wave front to be oblique.

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Bing Jie, Zhang Yang has a question.

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He has a question.

475
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He said

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Transmittance's light source

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
is mainly a design decision.

478
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What about Resonance's Q-factor?

479
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
How high and low can it be now?

480
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This thing?

481
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
How high can the Q-factor be?

482
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How is it determined?

483
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Q-factor

484
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
has a lot of things.

485
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It will be affected by a lot of things.

486
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
First of all, the most intuitive

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
is its loss.

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Because the material I designed here

489
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
is made of metal.

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The metal in the visible light,

491
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
or the part outside the mirror,

492
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
after it has been resonance,

493
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
because of the dipole,

494
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
we can think of it as

495
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
a movement of free current.

496
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This part will cause

497
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The second thing that will affect it

498
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
is the loss of the original radiation.

499
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In theory, we divide it into two categories.

500
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
One is Intrinsic.

501
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
One is Extrinsic.

502
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Intrinsic is the heat radiation

503
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that the material itself produces.

504
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The other is the loss of the original radiation

505
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
caused by the original radiation.

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I classify both of them as the part of the loss.

507
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This part will reduce my Q-factor.

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The other part is whether my cavity

509
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
is strong enough.

510
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because my current structure

511
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is based on the loss of the original radiation.

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So even if there is a shock

513
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
on it,

514
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can think of it as a movement of free current.

515
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But this movement of free current

516
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
cannot be perfect

517
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
because this cavity is not very strong.

518
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If I want a very strong cavity,

519
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
in theory, we should have

520
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
almost 100% reflectivity on both sides.

521
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
At this time, my Q-factor can be very high.

522
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But because of my current structure,

523
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I just wait for it to accumulate

524
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and let it accumulate radiation on both sides.

525
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But this cavity is not that strong.

526
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So my Q-factor will be reduced.

527
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
These factors

528
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
result in the

529
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Plasmon Resonance

530
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
produced by this kind of metal.

531
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Its Q-factor will not be too high.

532
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
As far as I know,

533
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
if it is made of metal,

534
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
without considering

535
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
any cavity,

536
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
that is, without considering any mirror,

537
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that is, the perfect mirror in this system,

538
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
its Q-factor

539
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
can only reach a few hundred.

540
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is already the highest.

541
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But usually it is only a few tens.

542
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He said he understood.

543
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
OK, thank you.

544
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Then,

545
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
if I have the

546
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
nanoparticle I just talked about,

547
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I am now

548
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
in the same direction.

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But because of my nanoparticle,

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
each nanoparticle has a different size.

551
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The size is different,

552
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
just like what I just showed in this picture.

553
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Under the same wavelength,

554
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the phase delay

555
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
felt by each different size will be different.

556
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
At this time,

557
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
it works as if

558
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
each particle,

559
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
although they both feel the

560
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
electromagnetic wave,

561
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
but after their resonance,

562
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
the radiation phase will also be delayed.

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is very interesting.

564
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It allows us to achieve

565
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
transparency.

566
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
In theory,

567
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I am transparent.

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But if I design the structure

569
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
appropriately above,

570
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can see that it is written out.

571
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I can use

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Momentum's picture to explain it.

573
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't think it needs to be explained.

574
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Basically, it is the phase delay.

575
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Here is a simple experiment result.

576
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If I design a stick

577
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
of different lengths on the surface,

578
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
you can see that

579
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Can you go back to the page

580
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and explain Momentum? I don't quite understand.

581
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Momentum, in theory,

582
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
we know that its K

583
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is 2π除λ.

584
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If I have

585
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
different structures here,

586
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
in theory, I can equate it to

587
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
each structure

588
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
can provide a

589
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
horizontal momentum.

590
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
How does this horizontal momentum decide?

591
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This horizontal momentum is determined by

592
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
2π除λ.

593
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What does this λ mean?

594
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This λ of 2π除λ

595
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
means that my structure

596
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
has a phase delay

597
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
from 0 to

598
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the minimum length of 360 degrees.

599
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That is, I can see it as a

600
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
pixel of light.

601
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
A pixel of light.

602
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If a pixel of light is λ,

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
we know that its K is 2π除λ.

604
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Because I have a

605
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
phase change of T,

606
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I can equate it to

607
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
the horizontal momentum of

608
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
2π除λ on this

609
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
surface.

610
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And these two

611
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Momentum boxes

612
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
can let us see through the light.

613
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
These two boxes

614
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
are obviously in this direction.

615
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
This is why we can

616
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
achieve the phenomenon of

617
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
paranormal penetration.

618
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
This is a

619
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
simple experiment result.

620
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
After designing different

621
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
lengths of sticks on the

622
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
surface, if my light

623
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
is perpendicular to the light,

624
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I want to see if it can

625
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
reflect back in the opposite direction.

626
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is the result of the experiment.

627
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is the result of the calculation.

628
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The curve of different colors represents

629
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
different angles of light.

630
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Black is when the light

631
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is perpendicular to the light,

632
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and white is when the light

633
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
is perpendicular to the light.

634
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The reflection angle is

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
about 45 degrees.

636
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This proves that we

637
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
give it a horizontal momentum

638
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
in the horizontal direction.

639
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why don't I see through the light here?

640
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Because the structure of this design

641
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
has a thick metal at the bottom.

642
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This thick metal helps

643
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
us block all the light.

644
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So we only see the reflected light.

645
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Why do we only see the reflected light here?

646
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You can also see that

647
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
when the light is perpendicular to the light,

648
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
if you look at the scattering,

649
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you can see that the light

650
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
is perpendicular to the light.

651
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Let me ask you a question.

652
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What wavelength is the light

653
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
reflected?

654
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The working wavelength is

655
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
about 780 nm.

656
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This is the boundary between

657
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the reflected light and the reflected light.

658
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
After doing this demo,

659
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
we also want to demonstrate

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
that its efficiency can be very high.

661
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You can see that the efficiency of the calculation

662
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
can be more than 90%.

663
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The experimental beam is also 80%.

664
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm talking about the time when the reflection was recorded.

665
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So why do we have to choose this wavelength?

666
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Because the inter-beam scattering

667
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
is at 550 nm,

668
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
so if we use gold to make

669
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the inter-beam scattering,

670
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
its resonance will never happen before 550 nm.

671
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Because the loss is too big.

672
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So the farther we work from 550 nm,

673
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
in theory, its efficiency can be better.

674
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Of course, this is just the characteristic of the material itself.

675
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Other factors also affect

676
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
its efficiency, such as

677
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
structural design.

678
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This is the final optimization result.

679
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I want to share with you

680
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
most of my work.

681
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The first part is that we want to use aluminum

682
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to make a visible Metasurface,

683
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and then make some

684
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
flat components.

685
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The other part is that

686
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
we want to make a transparent mirror.

687
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Why do we want to make a transparent mirror?

688
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Because what I just said is

689
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
that the most important thing

690
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
about Metasurface now

691
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
is that it can greatly reduce

692
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the size of the components

693
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
we can buy on the market.

694
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
For example,

695
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the simplest

696
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and most impressive

697
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
is the iPhone

698
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
or our smartphone

699
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
camera lens.

700
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
After the iPhone 6,

701
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
you can find that

702
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
its body is actually very thin,

703
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
but its lens protrudes a piece.

704
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
This is because

705
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
when the body becomes thin,

706
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
it has to maintain

707
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the resolution of the image

708
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
it takes

709
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
.

710
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This premise

711
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
will cause it to

712
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
not be able to greatly reduce

713
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
the size of the mirror.

714
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It has to insert a lot of different mirror groups

715
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and stack them up,

716
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
so that the image produced after taking pictures

717
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
will be clearer,

718
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
so that some contrast and color difference can be eliminated.

719
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I will introduce this later.

720
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't know if I have enough time,

721
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
so I may be a little faster.

722
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
In fact, if you

723
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
take a look at the

724
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
current direction of the

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
battery wave,

726
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
we call it bias.

727
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
In fact, whether it is

728
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
the linear bias of the y-direction

729
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
or the linear bias of the x-direction,

730
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
or when it rotates,

731
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
it produces a circular bias.

732
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No matter what the bias is,

733
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I can split its positive and negative

734
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
into three components, x, y, and z.

735
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I can easily stack

736
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
these three components

737
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
in the same way.

738
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I should say that I can split

739
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
any bias light into these three components.

740
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So our future design

741
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
will be based on this logic.

742
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Bias is actually quite useful

743
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
in life.

744
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
For example, 3D images are the most common.

745
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
If you go to see a 3D movie,

746
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
it will give you a 3D glasses.

747
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
These 3D glasses are

748
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
what the left eye sees

749
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and what the right eye sees.

750
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Its bias is also perpendicular to each other.

751
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
When it causes this illusion,

752
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
the image you see will look like a 3D.

753
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So why do you see

754
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
that the image is foggy when you take off your glasses?

755
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because your two eyes

756
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
detect the image of two biases at the same time.

757
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Or

758
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
we often see that

759
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
some people who play photography

760
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
will know that

761
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
they will put some filters related to bias

762
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
in front of the lens,

763
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
which can shoot some light

764
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
on some slower

765
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
or stronger surface

766
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
to make

767
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
them more clear.

768
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Or

769
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
do some

770
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
biological or chemical molecules detection.

771
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Because some biological or chemical molecules

772
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
will take the initiative

773
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
to bias

774
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
the bias of the light.

775
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Different molecules

776
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
have different angles of bias.

777
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Some are big and some are small.

778
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Some people use this thing

779
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
to make chemical molecules

780
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
detection.

781
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What are the

782
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
most common

783
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
ways to manipulate

784
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
bias on the market?

785
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let me give you three examples.

786
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The first one is linear bias.

787
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
For example,

788
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
if there is a dirty battery,

789
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the battery factory is messy.

790
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
If you want to turn it into a pure

791
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
battery factory,

792
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
for example,

793
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
the battery factory is a

794
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
horizontal wire.

795
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
If the battery factory is along this wire,

796
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
it will be absorbed.

797
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The volume of the battery

798
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
will be penetrated.

799
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So it uses this method

800
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
to filter out the bias it doesn't want.

801
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
This is what I found on the Internet.

802
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You can buy it on the market.

803
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because we need to effectively

804
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
absorb all the light in the x-direction.

805
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So its thickness must be thick enough.

806
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Usually this thickness is about a millimeter.

807
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This diameter is one inch.

808
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
This diameter is half an inch.

809
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Another one is that after we produce

810
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
linear bias, we want to do

811
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
a rotation of bias light.

812
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
For example, the linear bias of the

813
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
green light is 45 degrees.

814
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If I want to rotate it to negative 45 degrees,

815
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we will use 1 in 2 waves.

816
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The main thing is that this material

817
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
itself can provide different

818
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
phase differences

819
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
in the x- and y-directions,

820
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
so that when the light penetrates,

821
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
the bias of the x-direction

822
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
slowly slows down,

823
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and the y-direction slowly speeds up,

824
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
so that the x- and y-directions

825
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
of the green light are in the positive direction

826
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
respectively.

827
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
After coming out, it will become

828
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
a negative and a positive,

829
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and then use this method to rotate it.

830
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because it has to accumulate

831
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
enough bias delay,

832
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
so its thickness must be thick enough.

833
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Or to produce linear bias light.

834
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This is to give the

835
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
x- and y-dimensions

836
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
an additional bias delay,

837
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
so that the angle of the bias delay

838
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
is large enough that the

839
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
x- and y-directions of the x- and y-directions

840
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
are exactly 90 degrees.

841
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Then it can become the original bias light.

842
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It also has to have enough bias delay,

843
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
so its thickness must also be very thick.

844
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What are the benefits of using linear bias light?

845
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We don't need to use the thickness of

846
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
the minimiter level,

847
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
we can produce any bias light we want.

848
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
For example, we provide a

849
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
design method called

850
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Geometry Faced Metasurface,

851
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
which is a superimposed interface that combines

852
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
the positions of the x- and y-directions.

853
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What does this mean?

854
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
For example, if I have a stick now,

855
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I record a right-handed light

856
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and look at the penetration of the left-handed light.

857
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
At this time, because the

858
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
bias light of the penetrating light

859
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
is different from the recorded light,

860
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
so I call it conversion efficiency.

861
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We can see that the conversion efficiency is here.

862
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Then I look at the x- and y-directions of the

863
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
bias light, and I will see a value.

864
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
At this time, if I rotate it

865
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
a theta angle, this theta angle is

866
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
the angle with the y-axis.

867
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We will find a very magical thing

868
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that its efficiency will hardly change,

869
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and its

870
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
position will change to 2 theta.

871
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Then,

872
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
as long as I let it rotate

873
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
at the same angle

874
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
on this surface,

875
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I can make

876
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
its position change from 0

877
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to 2π.

878
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Every time I rotate a theta angle,

879
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
its bias delay will become 2 theta.

880
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Another interesting point is that

881
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
if the same structure,

882
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the direction of my rotation is exactly the same,

883
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
but at this time I turn into a left-handed light

884
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and look at the penetration of the right-handed light.

885
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
At this time, I will find a

886
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
more interesting thing,

887
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
its bias delay can reach 360 degrees,

888
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but it is from 0 to 360 and becomes

889
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
0 to negative 360.

890
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
This thing can help us design

891
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
some components that can be manipulated by bias.

892
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
For example, if you look at it with the right-handed light,

893
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
it will become a focal penetration.

894
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
If you look at it with the left-handed light,

895
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
it will become a scattered penetration.

896
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
In other words, I can combine

897
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
many different optical functions

898
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
on the same optical component,

899
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and its

900
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
magnitude is very thin.

901
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The thickness of this metal is only

902
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
50 nanometers,

903
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
so it is much smaller

904
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
than the previous

905
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
50 nanometers.

906
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This is what we are talking about,

907
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
because its magnitude is very small,

908
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
so the concept we propose here is that

909
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
we can integrate all the different chips

910
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
on the same sample.

911
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Then after I enter the color light,

912
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I hit different chips

913
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and the reflected light can produce a different fragrance.

914
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Compared with the general traditional components,

915
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I want to produce the original light,

916
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
for example, I at least need a

917
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
linear light,

918
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
a linear polarizer,

919
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and a quarter wave,

920
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
to produce the original light.

921
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But now if I only use our metasurface,

922
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
my thickness only needs about

923
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
dozens of nanometers to complete

924
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
this thing.

925
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Let me tell you

926
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
why we use aluminum,

927
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because I just mentioned that gold,

928
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because its intervention coefficient is around 500 to 550 nanometers,

929
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
so it is impossible

930
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
to work on the entire optical spectrum.

931
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Silver can work on the entire optical spectrum,

932
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
but there is a big disadvantage of silver,

933
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
which is that it is very easy to oxidize,

934
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
so the components cannot last long.

935
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So we choose aluminum here.

936
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Here is a demo for everyone,

937
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that is to say,

938
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
we use LISO to pattern

939
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
some different aluminum sticks

940
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
of different lengths and sizes,

941
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and its color will change drastically.

942
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
This is its tradition.

943
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Indeed, its resonance can

944
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
expand from 400 nanometers of blue light

945
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to 750 nanometers of red light.

946
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Here is the design of the component.

947
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I won't talk about it.

948
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Simply put, we optimized

949
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
its structure dimension

950
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
so that it can produce the highest

951
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
work efficiency.

952
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Next, I will tell you

953
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
how to use the same component

954
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
to achieve the production

955
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
of any parameter.

956
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
First of all,

957
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
after I design a stick here,

958
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
as I just said,

959
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I make it rotate

960
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
in the direction of change.

961
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I can let it produce 0 to 2π

962
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and I can produce an abnormal reflection.

963
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The interesting thing about this abnormal reflection

964
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is that my rotation angle is fixed,

965
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
so if I enter the color light

966
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
at this time,

967
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
it will produce an abnormal reflection

968
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
of the right light here.

969
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Conversely, if I enter the color light

970
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and it is the right light,

971
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it will produce an abnormal reflection

972
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
of the left light,

973
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
but it is on the other side

974
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and it is already achieved.

975
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
If I enter a linear parameter light,

976
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
which is horizontal,

977
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I mean the x-parameter light.

978
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Because the x-parameter light

979
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
can be regarded as the addition of

980
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
the right light and the left light,

981
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
so it can let me produce

982
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the left and right parameters at the same time.

983
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So I use a simple rotation

984
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
to achieve the adjustment of the original parameter light

985
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
if I enter the color light as a linear parameter light.

986
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
How do I produce any linear parameter light?

987
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We introduce another

988
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
parameter light that looks exactly the same as it,

989
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
but the rotation direction of the structure is opposite.

990
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
The first group of rotation is clockwise,

991
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and the second group of rotation is counterclockwise.

992
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
In this case,

993
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
when I enter a linear parameter light,

994
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I can achieve the reflection of

995
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the right and left parameters at the same time on the same side.

996
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Then I make a spatial parallelism

997
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
between the two of them.

998
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This parallelism will make a difference

999
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
in the position between the two of them.

1000
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This difference in the position

1001
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
can be determined by this d.

1002
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
As mentioned earlier,

1003
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
the difference in the position

1004
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
can be equal to 2πd divided by Lx.

1005
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Lx is the length.

1006
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So you can see that the difference in the position

1007
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
can be changed by the change in d.

1008
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So after the two of them interfere with each other,

1009
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
they can be multiplied into

1010
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
different linear parameters.

1011
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
For example, if d is 0,

1012
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
it means that the difference in the position

1013
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
between the two original parameters is 0.

1014
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
At this time, their reflection light

1015
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
will also be an x-parameter light.

1016
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's a bit like a mirror.

1017
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If I let its d

1018
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
be designed to

1019
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
have a difference in the position

1020
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
of π,

1021
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
it will become a y-parameter light.

1022
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That is, Lx's reflection light will become y.

1023
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
In this way, I can make it

1024
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
a positive 45-degree linear light

1025
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
or a negative 45-degree linear light.

1026
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So it's all reflected.

1027
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Now there's no way to do the refraction.

1028
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Isn't it just a projection?

1029
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
We can do projection here,

1030
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but the efficiency of projection will be very low.

1031
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Because I just said that the loss of metal is relatively large.

1032
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So our demo here is mainly reflected.

1033
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The work I will do later will be projected.

1034
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But our material will be converted from metal

1035
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
to electrolyte.

1036
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
OK, good, continue.

1037
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Then here is its SEM map.

1038
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That is, we integrate

1039
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the six samples together.

1040
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Then the optical system.

1041
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Here is a test result.

1042
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We usually use

1043
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
this POSCALISphere

1044
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
to show

1045
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
what the

1046
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
refraction of light

1047
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
is.

1048
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
In fact, this map is very simple to see.

1049
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If this map is the earth,

1050
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
its north pole represents the purest right-axis light.

1051
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The south pole is the purest left-axis light.

1052
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The four points on the equator

1053
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
represent the

1054
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
linear light.

1055
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
The four points in the east, west, south and north

1056
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
represent the purest

1057
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
x, y, positive 45

1058
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and negative 45-degree linear light.

1059
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And these three maps are based on

1060
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the experiment results of these three

1061
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
green light wavelengths.

1062
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The black dots are the theoretical results

1063
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
of ideal prediction.

1064
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And the

1065
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
black dots with colors

1066
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
are the results of our experiment measurement.

1067
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It can be said that they are almost very match.

1068
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Some may have some miscalculations,

1069
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
but they are still quite close to our theoretical prediction results.

1070
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Then it proves that we can

1071
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
achieve different equilibrium states

1072
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
based on our experimental results.

1073
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

1074
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

1075
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This is an acoustic-optic modulator.

1076
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
We want to design a different structure,

1077
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and make it a stick-length.

1078
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So the resonance will only be produced

1079
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
when the polarity of the infrared light is along the length.

1080
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That's when I see the image.

1081
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
If I rotate the polarity of the light,

1082
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
the image will disappear.

1083
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
When the white light comes in,

1084
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I hope to see RGB in the original.

1085
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
If I rotate the polarity of the light,

1086
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I will see different images.

1087
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I skip the design principle.

1088
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This is a sample picture.

1089
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
This is the experiment result.

1090
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
If the white light comes in,

1091
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I can see the RGB pattern in the original.

1092
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
The same is reflected.

1093
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
If I slowly rotate the polarity of the light,

1094
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I will see that the image will disappear.

1095
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
This is the first part of

1096
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
making a polarity-dependent holographic image.

1097
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The second part is the lens.

1098
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
The lens is widely used in our daily life.

1099
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
For example, a microscope or a camera lens.

1100
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The main thing is to focus on the lens.

1101
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There are several big problems with the lens.

1102
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
One of them is the difference between the two.

1103
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The difference is the light coming in from different angles.

1104
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It will be focused in different places.

1105
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
If I want to make a full-color image,

1106
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
there will be a big difference.

1107
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The difference is that the light comes in from different angles,

1108
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
but it will be focused in different places.

1109
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This makes it impossible for us to make a full-color image.

1110
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
In order to satisfy this problem,

1111
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
they will stack two lenses together

1112
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
to compensate for the difference in color.

1113
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They can be focused at the same point

1114
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
in different places.

1115
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
This makes it possible to make a full-color image.

1116
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is why we can't make full-color images.

1117
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Because they have to stack many lenses together

1118
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
so that they can be focused at the same point

1119
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
in different places.

1120
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Theoretically, if you add one more lens,

1121
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
you can only make a full-color image.

1122
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
For example, if I want to make a full-color image,

1123
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
you can imagine that I need at least ten or twenty lenses.

1124
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It may not be enough.

1125
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Here is a picture.

1126
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Why is the lens of our smart phone so thick?

1127
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Because it has a lot of different lenses in it.

1128
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
In order to satisfy the compensation of the difference in color,

1129
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
the picture we take will not have distortion.

1130
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Or the color will not run away.

1131
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's the same as what you see with your eyes.

1132
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This is why we want to use MetaServer as a lens.

1133
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I just mentioned that we used to use metal.

1134
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
We want to make a high-efficiency lens.

1135
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
If I use metal,

1136
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
all the examples I just mentioned can only be reflective.

1137
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
On the other hand, if I want to make a penetrative lens,

1138
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I have to convert it into an anodized material.

1139
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Anodized material does not have a distortion rate,

1140
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
so there will be no heat loss when it is compensated.

1141
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Without heat loss,

1142
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
it can greatly reduce the efficiency of work.

1143
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Here is a history.

1144
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This may also be skipped.

1145
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
First of all, we use GetInNitro as a material.

1146
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It has a high enough distortion rate in visible light.

1147
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We want to use anodized material to make MetaService.

1148
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
The prerequisite is that its distortion rate is at least greater than 2.

1149
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Because anodized material is not like metal,

1150
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
it has a free electron accumulation.

1151
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So its resonance must rely on the displacement current.

1152
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
If the displacement current has resonance,

1153
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
it means that the distortion rate itself

1154
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
must be large enough to compare with the surrounding environment.

1155
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Only then can it produce a strong enough displacement current

1156
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
to produce anodized material accumulation.

1157
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
At least, as far as I can see,

1158
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
if compared with air, it is at least 2.

1159
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Similarly, we use PPFace,

1160
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
which is the MetaService of GeometryFaceFace,

1161
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
which is the rotating method I just mentioned,

1162
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
to adjust its anodization.

1163
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Why do we need to adjust its anodization?

1164
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Because we are going to make a focal length.

1165
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
To make a focal length means that

1166
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I am now inserting a plane light into it.

1167
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The light in different positions

1168
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
will feel that its anodization delay is different.

1169
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It can only reach the same point.

1170
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So this is the anodization distribution

1171
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
that I have to satisfy in different structures in the space.

1172
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Then this is the final design result.

1173
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
If I insert an experiment,

1174
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
this is the experimental electronic microscope photo.

1175
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This is the MetaService Lens we designed.

1176
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
We call it MetaLens.

1177
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
In order to detect its anodization,

1178
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
when we insert a light into it,

1179
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
this ultraviolet transceiver

1180
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
will focus on a certain point in a certain space.

1181
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
We use a flat platform at the back

1182
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
to detect how good its anodized light band is.

1183
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It can be seen that

1184
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
when we match it to its anodized surface,

1185
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
we can see a very beautiful green highlight.

1186
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I inserted a green light and laser at this time.

1187
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
If I move away from it, it will not focus.

1188
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
In addition to the green light,

1189
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
we can also do different things.

1190
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
How far is the distance?

1191
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
How far can it move?

1192
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You mean this stage?

1193
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes.

1194
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The stage we bought at that time was quite high.

1195
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It can move up to 7mm.

1196
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
What about its step size?

1197
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Its step size can be up to 500nm.

1198
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
OK.

1199
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yes.

1200
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Thank you.

1201
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Go on.

1202
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Not only the green light,

1203
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
we can also do red, blue, and green.

1204
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Just change its size.

1205
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Just like what I just said.

1206
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Because it also has a resonance.

1207
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The resonance depends on its size.

1208
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Yes.

1209
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Next, in addition to doing positive focal length,

1210
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
we can also do oblique focal length.

1211
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's the same on a flat surface.

1212
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
But this thing

1213
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
is very difficult to do in traditional optical anodizing.

1214
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Because traditional optical anodizing

1215
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
is mainly done by hand

1216
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
to achieve the surface frequency I want.

1217
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Anodizing is a glass with a curve.

1218
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Different thicknesses

1219
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
will cause different fragmentation.

1220
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If I want to use traditional anodizing

1221
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
to do oblique focal length,

1222
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
you can imagine that

1223
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
this curve

1224
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
will become a curve on one side.

1225
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
This is very difficult

1226
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
in terms of technology.

1227
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Our technology is very simple.

1228
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I just need to change

1229
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
the distribution of the surface structure

1230
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
and move its center

1231
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
to the left a little bit

1232
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
or to the right a little bit.

1233
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Then I can do oblique focal length.

1234
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
For example, this picture.

1235
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yes.

1236
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
This is the experiment result.

1237
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You can see that red, blue, and green are focused.

1238
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
The dotted line

1239
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
refers to the position of the lens.

1240
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
The focal length is in the upper right corner.

1241
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
We designed it in the upper right corner.

1242
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
We proposed an application for this.

1243
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
If we integrate all of them

1244
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
on the same chip,

1245
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
it's the same because it's very small.

1246
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So we can easily

1247
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
integrate them all together.

1248
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
At this time,

1249
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
after I insert a wide-screen light source,

1250
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I will see different colors

1251
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
with different color distribution.

1252
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I can use it to divide the light.

1253
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
For example,

1254
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
this is our sample photo.

1255
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
If I insert a red light now,

1256
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I can see that it focuses in the upper right corner.

1257
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's the same sample.

1258
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
If I insert a green light now,

1259
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I can see that it focuses

1260
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
in the upper left and lower right.

1261
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
If I insert a blue light,

1262
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
it focuses in the lower left.

1263
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
If I insert three wavelengths at the same time,

1264
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I can see the effect of dividing the light.

1265
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
The biggest application of this

1266
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
is on CMOS.

1267
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
CMOS is a very important component

1268
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
in the current image sensor.

1269
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Traditionally,

1270
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
a micro lens must be made.

1271
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It must be focused first

1272
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and then go through a filter

1273
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and then go through a detector.

1274
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Because the detector can't distinguish colors,

1275
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
that's why it has to put a filter here.

1276
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That's the reason.

1277
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It must first determine

1278
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
that this filter can only receive blue light.

1279
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So it has to put a blue light filter here

1280
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
to filter out the white light in front,

1281
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
red light and green light.

1282
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
This causes

1283
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
the red light and green light

1284
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
of this part to be wasted

1285
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and pushed back and forth.

1286
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
But for our sample,

1287
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
we can put all the white light in

1288
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and put all the red light here,

1289
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
green light in the middle,

1290
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and blue light on the other side.

1291
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
We can effectively use

1292
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
all the energy of the green light

1293
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
to greatly increase its S-N ratio.

1294
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
The other biggest advantage

1295
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
is what I just said.

1296
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Our thickness is only 600 nanometers.

1297
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Traditionally, it's about 1 to 10 microns.

1298
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So we can shrink down

1299
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
its physical dimension.

1300
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Another thing we want to do

1301
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
is to eliminate the color difference.

1302
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
As I just said,

1303
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
different wavelengths

1304
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
will focus on different positions.

1305
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
This is the work of people in the past.

1306
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
This is our work.

1307
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Traditionally,

1308
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
different wavelengths of green light

1309
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
would focus on different positions in the space.

1310
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So it's hard to make a full-color image.

1311
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
After some special designs,

1312
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
we provide different color compensation

1313
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
in different positions

1314
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
to create a white light focus point.

1315
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
We're just doing a demo here.

1316
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So we're using a metal part

1317
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to do a reflective demonstration.

1318
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
This is the design principle.

1319
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I won't talk about it.

1320
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'll just show you the result.

1321
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
This is the sample photo.

1322
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
This is the measurement result.

1323
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
This is the calculation result.

1324
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You can see that

1325
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
my wavelength has changed

1326
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
from 1.2 microns to 1.65 microns.

1327
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Basically, its focal length

1328
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
hasn't changed at all.

1329
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
If I do a different

1330
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
transparent measurement,

1331
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
you can see that

1332
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
when the green light wavelength changes,

1333
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
its focal length

1334
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
remains at the same position.

1335
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
If I compare it with

1336
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
traditional Meta Lens

1337
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
or other traditional Lens,

1338
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
in the same wavelength,

1339
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
its deviation is quite large.

1340
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So it proves that

1341
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
we can completely eliminate color difference.

1342
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
This is another example.

1343
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'll skip it.

1344
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Another example is

1345
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
what we just talked about.

1346
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
The biggest use of transparency

1347
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
is when we want to make a full-color image.

1348
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Reflectivity is actually very capable of making a full-color image.

1349
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So our work here

1350
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
is to make a transparency

1351
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
with high efficiency

1352
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
to eliminate color difference

1353
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and further apply it to make a full-color image.

1354
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
This is what we just talked about.

1355
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Why can we use

1356
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
the material of the interface

1357
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
to adjust the fragrance?

1358
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Mainly because

1359
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
there is a big difference in reflectivity.

1360
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So it can produce

1361
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
a cavity-like resonance inside.

1362
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So different wavelengths

1363
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
can produce different

1364
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
resonance.

1365
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Different wavelengths

1366
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
can produce different fragrance delay.

1367
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This is our photo.

1368
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Our studio is located in the visible light.

1369
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So the refractive wavelength range is from 400 to 640.

1370
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We can actually eliminate it to 660.

1371
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But because of the deviation here,

1372
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I only show it to 640.

1373
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
The last is to make a full-color image.

1374
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
After I use a photo to come in,

1375
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
we use our metalance to eliminate color difference.

1376
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
We want to be able to

1377
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
make a full-color image analysis.

1378
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This is a full-color photo

1379
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
we made with our transparency.

1380
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You can see that

1381
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
even the white or yellow

1382
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
colors are very clear.

1383
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Compared with the original photo,

1384
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
there is not much difference in color.

1385
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
This proves that

1386
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
we can eliminate color difference

1387
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
in the entire refractive wavelength range

1388
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and make a full-color image application.

1389
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That's about it.

1390
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Sorry, I talked a little too fast.

1391
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Because the time is a bit delayed.

1392
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
This is my report today.

1393
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Thank you everyone.

1394
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I don't know if there are any questions.

1395
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
If I talk too fast later.

1396
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I think it's good.

1397
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yeah, no problem.

1398
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Can you hear me?

1399
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yes, we can hear you now.

1400
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
My question is

1401
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Basically, your device

1402
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
is roughly scaled as

1403
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
the working frequency.

1404
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Basically, right?

1405
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yes, it's smaller than the frequency.

1406
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I mean, it should have the same effect.

1407
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
If today you want

1408
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
the wavelength of your work

1409
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
to be doubled,

1410
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
basically, the length

1411
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
is scaled to be about 2.

1412
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So the area is about 4.

1413
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
No, no, no.

1414
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's not a linear scale.

1415
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It's not a linear scale?

1416
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
No, it's not.

1417
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Because of the resonance.

1418
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So it's different from the material.

1419
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
For example,

1420
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
this thing is very intuitive.

1421
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
For example.

1422
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
For example, I just talked about

1423
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
this thing.

1424
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
For example, if we produce resonance,

1425
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
we can think of it as

1426
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
the resonance here.

1427
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So if you say

1428
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the wavelength of my work

1429
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
is doubled,

1430
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
in theory, the length should be doubled.

1431
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
The premise of this thing is

1432
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
that the resolution of the structure itself does not change.

1433
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Oh.

1434
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But now I have different wavelengths.

1435
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The resolution of the material will change.

1436
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So its equivalent wavelength,

1437
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
the effective lambda

1438
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
is actually lambda over n.

1439
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
This n is also the wavelength function.

1440
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Oh, yeah.

1441
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yes, so it's not a linear scale.

1442
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Now for this kind of material,

1443
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
can you do it in

1444
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
millimeter wave

1445
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
or infrared

1446
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and deep IR

1447
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
device?

1448
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yes, it can be Terahertz or microwave.

1449
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
On the contrary, the most people do microwave.

1450
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Now there are several American companies

1451
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
established to do this principle

1452
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
are doing microwave.

1453
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Because microwave is easy to do

1454
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and the loss is super low.

1455
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Then the military use is the widest.

1456
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And its materials are basically

1457
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
for example, aluminum

1458
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
or some silicon base.

1459
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
This kind of cheaper and easy to make material

1460
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
can be done, basically.

1461
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Yes, that's right.

1462
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So the metal part

1463
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
is actually quite long,

1464
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
but why the metal part

1465
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
has not been commercial product

1466
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The main reason is here.

1467
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Because metal is not yet silicon

1468
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
part fabrication compatible.

1469
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So why do we want to do

1470
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
gallium nitride later?

1471
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's the reason.

1472
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because gallium nitride

1473
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
is at least a semiconductor company.

1474
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Now the current manufacturing can be compatible.

1475
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Let me tell you

1476
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
why I want to ask this question.

1477
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Maybe you can think about it.

1478
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Because we are looking for

1479
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Terahertz absorber,

1480
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
but it has to be very, very

1481
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
low radioactivity.

1482
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So we have a very, very big

1483
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
material limit.

1484
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So we are looking for

1485
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
material limit is very, very big.

1486
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
We can't use some

1487
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
very fancy elements, you know.

1488
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So if you can do this thing,

1489
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
it should be usable.

1490
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
And it's quite sophisticated.

1491
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What do you think your Terahertz

1492
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
needs?

1493
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
We need it to be

1494
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
able to adjust its optical quality

1495
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
in Terahertz.

1496
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Not only optical quality,

1497
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
but also the quality of EM wave.

1498
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But all the materials it uses

1499
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
have to be very low radioactivity.

1500
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
In other words,

1501
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
its natural isotope has to be very low.

1502
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So we don't have

1503
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
many materials we can use.

1504
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But if you can use some pure elements,

1505
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
such as silicon,

1506
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
or aluminum, or some

1507
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
not alloy, or that kind of

1508
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
super heavy metal, or super heavy metal,

1509
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
you can do it.

1510
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That's a very good choice.

1511
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
For example, can you accept gold and copper?

1512
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Copper, yes, gold and copper.

1513
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But what do you want to use?

1514
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
For example, silver, or something weird

1515
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
that you can't read Chinese, that's not OK.

1516
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
If it's Terahertz,

1517
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
gold and copper

1518
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
can be used.

1519
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
These are very common materials.

1520
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
On the other hand,

1521
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Terahertz is less likely to see

1522
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
electrolytes, because electrolytes

1523
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
in Terahertz's resolution

1524
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
doesn't seem to be able to reach

1525
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
such a high value.

1526
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Because usually

1527
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
in the natural world,

1528
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
the refractive index of electrolytes

1529
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
will become smaller as the wavelength increases.

1530
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So it's visibility

1531
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
will be the highest,

1532
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
and then slowly decay.

1533
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So in my mind,

1534
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I haven't seen anyone

1535
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
use electrolytes in Terahertz,

1536
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
such as silicon, or gallium nitride,

1537
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
or germanium, not germanium,

1538
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
but silicon nitride,

1539
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
this kind of electrolyte material

1540
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to make Terahertz components.

1541
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
There's a lot of metal,

1542
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
like I said, a lot of copper and gold.

1543
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
OK, thank you.

1544
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You're welcome.

1545
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Ian, you just mentioned

1546
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
radioactivity.

1547
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
What kind of radioactivity do you mean?

1548
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Do you mean the radiation

1549
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
response in space?

1550
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
No, I mean the radioactivity

1551
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
of the material itself.

1552
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Like bananas have beta decay,

1553
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
something like that.

1554
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh, OK.

1555
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So the radioactivity

1556
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
will be higher in space?

1557
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, if you want to use

1558
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
something that's at the bottom

1559
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
of the elemental cycle,

1560
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
it won't work.

1561
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
The reason why it won't work

1562
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
is because...

1563
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Because it will naturally

1564
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
have the same value

1565
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and then it will easily decay.

1566
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Then the decay will release

1567
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
particles, and the particles

1568
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
will affect the quality

1569
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
of the material.

1570
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I didn't quite understand

1571
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
what kind of material

1572
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
do you usually use

1573
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
in the microwave range?

1574
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Aluminum or gallium nitride?

1575
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
No, if it's microwave,

1576
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
the most common thing

1577
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
is copper, because

1578
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
copper can print

1579
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
the pattern they want

1580
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
directly.

1581
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So the pattern they print

1582
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
is like the nanostructure

1583
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
of the microwave.

1584
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Because the wavelength of the microwave

1585
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
is dozens of millimeters,

1586
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
or even centimeters.

1587
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So it's easier to make?

1588
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah, it's easier to make.

1589
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And what they print

1590
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
is a large area.

1591
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You can stick it

1592
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
on the wall of your house.

1593
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Oh, I see.

1594
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Are there any other materials

1595
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
that can do the same thing?

1596
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Well,

1597
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the most common metal

1598
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
is

1599
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
gallium nitride.

1600
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
No, not copper.

1601
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It's gallium aluminum.

1602
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
These three are the most common.

1603
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Oh, thank you.

1604
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And if it's...

1605
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
No, you go first.

1606
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah, and if it's

1607
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
gallium aluminum,

1608
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
there are a lot of choices.

1609
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
For example,

1610
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
as long as it's high enough.

1611
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So silicon,

1612
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
gallium nitride,

1613
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
silicon nitride,

1614
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
titanium oxide,

1615
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and gallium phosphide.

1616
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But gallium phosphide has adsorption,

1617
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
so the effect may not be as good.

1618
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You have a video

1619
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
where the light hits

1620
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
the left and right

1621
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
of the picture.

1622
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Oh.

1623
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
This one?

1624
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah.

1625
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This one?

1626
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
No, the first one.

1627
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The first one.

1628
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The one you just showed.

1629
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah.

1630
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Oh, so how efficient is it?

1631
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
If you

1632
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
hit the light directly,

1633
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
if it's linearly polarized,

1634
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
it will turn left and right.

1635
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
This one,

1636
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
in practice...

1637
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Let me see.

1638
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
In practice, it's about

1639
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
30% to

1640
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
50%

1641
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
efficient.

1642
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
OK.

1643
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And this is its wavelength.

1644
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah, the next one is the wavelength.

1645
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
In theory,

1646
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
we expect it to be 70% or so.

1647
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
But after we published this,

1648
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
there was one thing

1649
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
that we didn't consider.

1650
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
When we calculated this,

1651
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
we knew that aluminum oxidizes easily.

1652
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So when it oxidizes,

1653
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
there will be 3 to 5 nanometers of aluminum oxide on the surface.

1654
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
This will affect its resonance and reduce its efficiency.

1655
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So this picture is actually talking about this.

1656
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
This is someone else's work.

1657
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
He's talking about pure aluminum.

1658
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
If I design it,

1659
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
its resonance is this high.

1660
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
And after the aluminum oxidizes,

1661
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
it will slowly turn right a little bit.

1662
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Then the efficiency will drop a little bit.

1663
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
This is also seen in our experiment.

1664
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Indeed, our simulation

1665
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
hopes that its peak is here.

1666
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But our experimental result

1667
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
is to turn right,

1668
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and then to fall down.

1669
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
So at that time,

1670
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
there was speculation that the efficiency of this result could not be so high.

1671
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
It's because when we calculated it,

1672
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
when we optimized the structure,

1673
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
we didn't consider the influence of aluminum oxidization.

1674
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The question I want to ask is

1675
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
if

1676
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm sorry, I'll ask it again.

1677
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
If the positive light

1678
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
keeps reducing

1679
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
the energy,

1680
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
in the end,

1681
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
it will become

1682
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
a single light

1683
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
or several lights.

1684
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Then it will have to

1685
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
reflect

1686
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
these two lights

1687
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
at the same time

1688
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Will there be some

1689
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
state of entanglement?

1690
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Or you don't care about this?

1691
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
We don't care about this.

1692
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But what you're talking about is

1693
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
actually

1694
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
what I want to do next.

1695
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Because

1696
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
now the most common

1697
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
entanglement following source

1698
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
is to use BBO,

1699
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
this kind of non-linear crystal

1700
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
to produce entanglement of

1701
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
linear light.

1702
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But it's linear light.

1703
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
So I actually thought about this thing at that time.

1704
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
If I am now a linear light entanglement,

1705
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
both are H plus V

1706
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
entanglement,

1707
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I put the light through this source.

1708
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
What is H plus V?

1709
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
The state of H plus V.

1710
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
H is horizontal, V is vertical.

1711
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's the entanglement of X and Y.

1712
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
If I turn the green light

1713
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
into the state of H plus V entanglement,

1714
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
can I have

1715
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
spatial entanglement at the same time?

1716
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Or does it become hyper-entanglement?

1717
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm not sure about this.

1718
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But I actually wanted to do this thing at that time.

1719
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Because I'm not sure

1720
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
whether it's H or V.

1721
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So after it comes in,

1722
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I can't be sure

1723
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
whether it runs to the left

1724
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
or to the right.

1725
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Because if it's H,

1726
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
the left is the right.

1727
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
If it's V, the left is the left.

1728
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I think this thing

1729
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
is likely to be established.

1730
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Because this kind of element

1731
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
has already been done.

1732
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
We mainly use laser light,

1733
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
which is a bunch of photons

1734
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
to integrate with this structure.

1735
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
If I only have single photons now,

1736
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
it has already been proven that

1737
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
it will also work.

1738
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
In the case that single photons

1739
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
will also work,

1740
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
entanglement should be established.

1741
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It should have a chance

1742
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
to happen.

1743
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So what I'm going to do

1744
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
is to use entanglement photons

1745
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
to transfer to the spin

1746
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
of quantum dot.

1747
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So you're doing quantum light.

1748
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yes.

1749
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And then

1750
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
what I'm going to do

1751
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
is what I just said.

1752
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
But now

1753
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
the entanglement is

1754
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
vertical and horizontal.

1755
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yes.

1756
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
If this can be done

1757
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
with left and right entanglement,

1758
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
it should be...

1759
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yes, you do it first.

1760
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And then after you're sure,

1761
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
you should think about it.

1762
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Before I came here,

1763
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I...

1764
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Are there any other questions?

1765
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
OK.

1766
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Everyone has no questions.

1767
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Audience.

1768
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
OK.

1769
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Thank you, Ping Jie.

1770
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Thank you.

1771
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You have a good grasp of time.

1772
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Actually,

1773
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I talked a little too fast.

1774
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Anyway,

1775
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
if you have any questions later,

1776
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you can tell me.

1777
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Yes.

1778
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
If you really did it in the end,

1779
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
will you continue to do this

1780
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
in Caltech?

1781
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I didn't do this in Caltech.

1782
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
OK.

1783
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You can ask Cai Ding Ping later.

1784
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yes.

1785
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Because if this is done,

1786
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
then...

1787
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
We should...

1788
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
We are planning to do this

1789
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
recently.

1790
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But...

1791
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
OK.

1792
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Yes.

1793
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Have you come up with a good approach?

1794
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Or do you already have some approaches?

1795
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Just what you just said about BBO.

1796
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It can only produce linear light.

1797
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yes.

1798
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
It can only produce linear light.

1799
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Yes.

1800
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
If it can produce...

1801
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Because if you want to produce

1802
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
spin,

1803
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
you have to use circular polarizer.

1804
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yes.

1805
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
So...

1806
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Yes.

1807
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
That's what we are thinking about.

1808
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
No problem.

1809
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
OK.

1810
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
OK.

1811
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
That's all for today.

1812
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Thank you.

1813
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Thank you.

1814
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Bye bye.
