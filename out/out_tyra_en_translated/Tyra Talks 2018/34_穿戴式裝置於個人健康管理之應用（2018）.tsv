0	7000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.
7000	10000	I am the host for this week, Lin Yu-Wei.
10000	14000	I am very happy to invite our speaker today, Zhou Zhijie.
14000	17000	He obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at NTU,
17000	21000	and is currently a doctor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Lincoln.
21000	24000	Under the guidance of Professor Dai Yu-Chang,
24000	29000	he has been conducting research on wearable devices and biomimics for medical purposes.
29000	34000	Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.
34000	38000	Let's give a round of applause to welcome Zhijie and his speech today.
38000	40000	Remember to turn on the microphone.
45000	50000	Now let's give the microphone to our speaker today, Zhijie.
50000	52000	Thank you, Yu-Wei, for the introduction.
52000	55000	Hello, everyone. I am Zhou Zhijie.
56000	65000	Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.
70000	73000	Without further ado, let's get to the topic.
74000	77000	First of all, I would like to introduce to you
77000	86000	why wearable devices have become a hot topic in recent years.
86000	92000	Basically, it can be divided into several aspects.
92000	97000	The first is the concept of non-invasive.
97000	104000	The concept of non-invasive means that the device does not need to enter our body.
104000	111000	You may have been to the hospital for injections or blood draws.
111000	120000	Once something enters your body, the first reaction is pain.
121000	130000	In addition to the pain, the immune system will also react to foreign bodies.
130000	139000	For example, some white blood cells or other immune cells will attack foreign objects.
139000	148000	Basically, it will cause a lot of inflammation, swelling, pain, and heat.
148000	156000	Therefore, wearable devices basically avoid such risks.
156000	163000	Many technology giants like Apple and Fitbit
163000	170000	want to study non-invasive devices first
170000	174000	and see where their limits can be pushed.
174000	182000	Then they will consider the so-called minimally invasive devices.
182000	189000	In fact, there is a huge barrier between non-invasive and minimally invasive.
189000	195000	Whether it is from the perspective of devices or from the perspective of government agencies like the FDA,
195000	202000	the biggest barrier is still entering the body.
202000	209000	Once you enter the body, there is a lot of risk.
209000	217000	Stay outside the body is a very low-risk device.
217000	223000	Basically, wearable devices have become so popular recently.
223000	228000	Next is the so-called big clinical data.
228000	235000	I believe everyone has heard of big clinical data.
235000	245000	The meaning of big clinical data is that this device can provide some diagnostic information.
245000	248000	This diagnosis is also a bit tricky.
248000	253000	How can we determine the value of the diagnosis?
253000	261000	What metrics are really useful?
261000	269000	The third part is the so-called Autonomous Sensing.
269000	274000	Autonomous Sensing is not as complicated as you think.
274000	280000	Just put the wearable device on your body and it will automatically start to measure.
280000	285000	Then you don't need to intervene.
285000	293000	Then it can continuously send this data out in a wireless way.
293000	298000	The advantage is that even if you are not conscious, for example, when you are sleeping,
298000	303000	this device can still continue to measure and send the data out.
303000	308000	So it can let us see some things that we couldn't see before.
308000	313000	For example, when you are sleeping, it can help you measure the cycle of sleep,
313000	318000	or the heartbeat when you are resting, and so on.
318000	324000	The fourth aspect is that it is very easy to compare with portable devices,
324000	329000	such as mobile phones, smartphones, or even tablets.
329000	335000	Basically, these portable devices can be used as a relay station.
335000	340000	You can imagine that your wearable sensor is a bit like a place to send signals.
340000	345000	Then store these signals in the portable device.
345000	350000	Basically, the computing power of these portable devices is relatively strong,
350000	355000	and the bandwidth to upload data is relatively high.
355000	360000	On the one hand, it can be used as a relay station, and on the other hand,
360000	365000	it can be used as a place to send signals.
365000	370000	There are a lot of benefits that you can think about.
370000	375000	Next, I will talk about the logic of why we want to use wearable devices
375000	380000	to monitor the health of our body.
380000	385000	There is a study in Stanford,
385000	390000	which is called digital health.
390000	395000	It is a comparison of regular visits to the hospital
395000	400000	and digital health.
400000	405000	The so-called digital health is actually
405000	410000	collecting all the data that should be collected at the hospital,
410000	415000	digitizing it,
415000	420000	and then processing these digitized data.
420000	425000	This study is actually very simple.
425000	430000	There are only two main variables.
430000	435000	One is to measure the skin temperature,
435000	440000	and the other is to measure the heart rate.
440000	445000	If I put the sensor on the patient
445000	450000	for a long time,
450000	455000	the patient will inevitably get sick.
455000	460000	The heart rate and skin temperature
460000	465000	when the patient is sick
465000	470000	are basically the same.
470000	475000	The heart rate and skin temperature
475000	480000	are basically the same.
480000	485000	The heart rate and skin temperature
485000	490000	are basically the same.
490000	495000	The heart rate and skin temperature
495000	500000	are basically the same.
500000	505000	The heart rate and skin temperature
505000	510000	are basically the same.
510000	515000	The heart rate and skin temperature
515000	520000	are basically the same.
520000	525000	The heart rate and skin temperature
525000	530000	are basically the same.
530000	535000	The heart rate and skin temperature
535000	540000	are basically the same.
540000	545000	The heart rate and skin temperature
545000	550000	are basically the same.
550000	555000	The heart rate and skin temperature
555000	560000	are basically the same.
560000	565000	The wearable sensor has some information in it.
565000	570000	How do we get this information out?
570000	575000	How do we get this information out?
575000	580000	How do we get this information out?
580000	585000	We have big clinical data.
585000	590000	It takes about 24 hours to get this data.
590000	595000	It takes about 24 hours to get this data.
595000	600000	It can be useful when you sleep.
600000	605000	It can be useful when you sleep.
605000	610000	It can be useful when you sleep.
610000	615000	Heart rate...
615000	620000	Heart rate...
620000	625000	Heart rate...
625000	630000	Heart rate...
630000	635000	It's basically when you wake up.
635000	640000	Can you tell if a person is healthy or sick?
640000	645000	It's from the data we get from these sensors.
645000	650000	For example, a disease has a certain distribution in the data space of this sensor.
650000	655000	So this is a very interesting question.
655000	660000	Before wearable devices appeared,
660000	665000	it was basically completely blank.
665000	670000	The information we can get in Sleep is very limited.
670000	675000	However,
675000	680000	there are some privileges at this stage of sleep.
680000	685000	For example, when you sleep, your body basically doesn't move.
685000	690000	It's great for sensors.
690000	695000	Because you have less noise in your daily life.
695000	700000	For example, your motion noise.
700000	705000	Or when you do other things during the day, your heart rate suddenly changes.
705000	710000	But when you sleep, it doesn't.
710000	715000	Some wearable sensors are already measuring
715000	720000	heart rate during rest and sleep.
720000	725000	I'll show you some data later.
725000	730000	Location
730000	735000	It mainly depends on where our sensors can be placed in the body.
735000	740000	This is a research done by Georgia Tech.
740000	745000	It looks at how the motion impedance is affected
745000	750000	when your sensors are placed in various parts of the body.
750000	755000	The motion impedance is when your sensors are placed in a specific body location.
755000	760000	What impact does it have on your activity?
760000	765000	On the left is the male, on the right is the female.
765000	770000	You can see that the range is a little different.
770000	775000	You can see where our wearable devices are often placed.
775000	780000	For example, the bowl.
780000	785000	It's a good place to put it.
785000	790000	This is another metric.
790000	795000	It tells us
795000	800000	what sensor is most suitable for measuring
800000	805000	when it is placed in a specific location.
805000	810000	For example,
810000	815000	the red bar
815000	820000	is used to measure whole body motion.
820000	825000	It measures the movement of the whole body.
825000	830000	You can imagine that your limbs are often moving.
830000	835000	But if you want to track the center of the body,
835000	840000	the red bar is used to measure the center of the body.
840000	845000	For example, the joint stretch
845000	850000	is measured by the elbow and the knee joint.
850000	855000	The last one is
855000	860000	where the sensor is placed.
860000	865000	This is interesting.
865000	870000	You can compare it with the two pictures.
870000	875000	For example, many devices are placed in the wrist
875000	880000	or ankle.
890000	895000	Next, I will talk about
895000	900000	the future of wearable devices.
900000	905000	The trend is like this.
905000	910000	From the era of personal computers,
910000	915000	the market trend is to reduce the size of the computer.
915000	920000	From personal computers to portable devices,
920000	925000	to wearable devices.
925000	930000	The so-called computing unit
930000	935000	is getting closer to the body.
935000	940000	The advantage is that you don't need much delay
940000	945000	to make computing.
945000	950000	This is the size of the market of wearable devices.
950000	955000	This is the size of the market of wearable devices.
955000	960000	This is the size of the market of wearable devices.
960000	965000	At first, the market size was the largest.
965000	970000	But when Apple Watch appeared,
970000	975000	it appeared around the middle of 2015.
975000	980000	It immediately ate up the market share.
980000	985000	From 2016 to 2017,
985000	990000	the largest was Apple Watch.
990000	995000	The largest was Apple Watch.
995000	1000000	The largest was Apple Watch.
1000000	1005000	The largest was Apple Watch.
1005000	1010000	The next is the trend I imagine.
1010000	1015000	From 2000, the so-called smartphone has appeared.
1015000	1020000	In 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.
1020000	1025000	In 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.
1025000	1030000	PPG is a method of optical heart detection.
1030000	1035000	PPG is a method of optical heart detection.
1035000	1040000	Motion is basically an accelerometer.
1040000	1045000	ECG is a heart rate map.
1045000	1050000	Blood pressure is basically easy to get information.
1050000	1055000	Blood pressure is basically easy to get information.

1571000	1576000	it is not the simplest medical device.
1576000	1581000	It is not the simplest medical device.
1581000	1586000	It is not as invasive as class 3.
1586000	1591000	It is not as invasive as class 3.
