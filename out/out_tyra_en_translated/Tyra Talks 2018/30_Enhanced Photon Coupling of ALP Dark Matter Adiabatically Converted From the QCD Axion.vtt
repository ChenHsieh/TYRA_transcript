00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TAR Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
I am very grateful to my good friend, He Shuyu, for being willing to give us this speech on the upcoming New Year's holiday.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
First of all, let me introduce He Shuyu. He is currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at Tohoku University in Japan.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
His field of study is mainly in the field of particle cosmology, and he is exploring how to understand the evolution of early universes from the perspective of particle interaction.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Most of his work is related to dark matter, and he did not mention it in the introduction he gave me.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
But before he came, he was doing physics with Mr. He Xiaogang at NTU, so it is actually very related to his current research.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
I have also had a few years of overlap with him in Caltech, where I am now, so we are very good friends.

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
His main research recently is Exxon. They think this is one of the most popular candidates for dark matter.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
The topic he is going to talk to us about today is also related to Exxon.

01:09.000 --> 01:20.000
His topic is Enhanced Photon Coupling of APL. APL is Exxon-like Particle, Dark Matter Adiabatically Converted from QCD Exxon.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
A little reminder, if you want to applaud, remember to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Let's applaud and welcome He Shuyu to give us today's speech.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
OK, you can start now.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Is there a full screen now?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
What do you mean by full screen?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I am recording a video here, so I have to press the full screen, right?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Is this OK?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yes, I think this is OK.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
OK, then I will start right away.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Zhang Yiyang has already introduced it to me, so I will talk about it directly.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
The topic I want to talk about today is Exxon.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
Exxon itself interacts with light.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
The interaction between light and Exxon is very small.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
In other words, we can't really detect it in the current experiment.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
The main purpose of this work is to enhance the coupling with photons from a phenomenal point of view.

02:23.000 --> 02:33.000
Our main method is to match the effect with the so-called MaxMixing of ALP.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I will talk about the rest of the details in the following slides.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
Before that, I have to give you some preparation knowledge.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Maybe not everyone is familiar with Exxon.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Some people may not even know what DocuMator is.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
So I will do some basic introduction in the front.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Then we will start directly.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
The first thing you see now is the so-called example physical standard model.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Then we generally call it Standard Model.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Or SM, take the first English letter.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Basically, the standard model is very simple.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It is divided into two categories.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
One is the so-called material.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
The left side is the so-called material.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
The right side is the so-called basic interaction.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
The material is actually divided into two categories.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
One is called quark.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
The other is called hydrogen.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
For example, everyone is more familiar with Electron.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
It belongs to the category of hydrogen.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
The other one may not be familiar to everyone.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
But in fact, everyone is more familiar with it.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
It is the so-called magnet.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Like a magnet, there is a so-called

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
You can see this U quark on the picture.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
This up quark is composed of this down quark.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
The same is true for neutrons.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So these are the more familiar particles.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Of course, there are other quarks.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
This is a new example found later.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
In addition to the material,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Of course, there is also the so-called interaction.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
The interaction is basically divided into these categories.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
The first one, everyone sees this G.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
We call it Grouon.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
It is a so-called strong interaction particle.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
What about strong interaction?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
We generally call it QCD.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
That is, quantum quark dynamic.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
We will see this word later.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Because this is related to the so-called CP problem we will discuss later.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The second one is the so-called electromagnetic effect.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
This should be the most familiar to everyone.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Maybe from high school,

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Even in everyday life, you can know

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
This interaction.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
What about the electromagnetic effect of this magnet?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We use light to transmit.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
The electromagnetic effect in our field

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
We like to call it QED.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
That is, quantum electrodynamic.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
In addition to these two effects, there is also the so-called weak effect.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
The weak effect is generally used to describe

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
The so-called beta decay phenomenon.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Have you noticed that in addition to these interactions,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
There is also an interaction

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Not written on this table

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
The so-called gravitational effect

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
But because of the current standard model

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I didn't include this gravity.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Because I didn't find the so-called gravity.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
The so-called graviton is the gravity value.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
It is not included in the standard model.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
That may be something else that everyone may be familiar with.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
but

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
This is the so-called Higgs particle.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
What about this Higgs particle?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It should be 2012.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I remember when I was a substitute

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Found this Higgs particle

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Higgs particle is generally

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
The origin of this mass

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Is the source of the value

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
What about my research today?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It has something to do with Higgs, but it doesn't have much to do with it.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I mainly focus on the so-called

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
This part of the skeleton

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Because this skeleton will lead to

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
The so-called action problem

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
it is good

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Of course, although

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Although the quantum mechanics model is currently

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
It is very tested by the experiment.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I can't say it's perfect.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
But at least most of the current

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Some of the phenomena we see can be used

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Use the particle physics standard model to explain

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Of course, there are some shortcomings.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Because there are some problems

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
The standard model is incomprehensible

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
For example, the first so-called dark matter

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I will introduce it later.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
There is also the so-called strong CP problem.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
This is what I translated directly.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Generally, we call it a strong CP problem.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
There is also the so-called

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
There is also the so-called medium quality

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
For example, just inside this table

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Did you see this green one?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The bottom three particles

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
This is the so-called neutrino

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Because in neutrino

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Because neutrino is in the standard model

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
It has no quality

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
But because through

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We see this neutrino oscillation

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
This implies that neutrino must have quality

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
But the standard model

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Our neutrino can't have quality

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
So this is also a standard model

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
There is also the so-called dark energy

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Generally, this may be possible

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Use the so-called cosmology constant to explain

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
There is also the so-called current gravity

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Today my

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The study is more related to the first

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
The so-called dark matter and this

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
This strong CP problem

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Let's introduce the so-called dark matter first.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
How do you know that there is a dark matter?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We can start with this

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
This so-called star rotation curve

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Look at

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
This star rotation curve, I remember

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It should be Rubin

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Rubin said

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
He is a female scientist

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
But it seems to have passed away a few years ago

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
If I remember correctly

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
This star rotation is very simple

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
That is to say

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
We may have learned this Newton's law

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So we can predict that a object

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Just a planet

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Do this to the solar system

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
If the shape

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
What about the speed of this shape?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
It should be with the sun

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Or the center of the star

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What about this distance?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Yes, when it's far away

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
You should see this star

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
The speed changes with the distance

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It should be this red picture on the picture

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
That is to say

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
If it's far away, it's the distance

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
If the center is far away, the speed should be going down

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
But what we see is not like this

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
What we see is this

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
The white part is

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
He is at speed

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
When it's far away, it's a constant

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
This is a mystery

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
This is the Newton's law

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
The gravity law to explain

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Of course there are many

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Ideas to deal with this problem

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
That

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
It's easier to say

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Maybe there are some objects

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
We can't see it, but it will provide gravity

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
If you have additional gravity

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
You can explain this speed

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Why is it still a constant far away?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Of course there are other theories

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Like the so-called modified gravity

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
That is to say, Newton's law

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It's not what we usually see

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
For example, FMA may have some corrections

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That can also explain this

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Star curve

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
So why is it that the object value

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It's a little bit bigger

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Because we have a lot of this

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Astronomical evidence

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I just looked at this picture and said that the upper left corner

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
This is the star curve you just talked about

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
In addition, there is also the so-called gravity

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And this mirror seems to be wrong

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
That is to say

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
If there is a

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Invisible object

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Then it will provide gravity

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
If there is a

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
For example, the star is behind this

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Invisible object

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Because you know

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
According to the relativity theory

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
The light passes through a place where gravity is very strong

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
So this light

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
From behind this star

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It will bend

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Then let us see

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It will be a circle

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Instead of a point

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
This is the so-called gravitational effect

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
In addition, there is the so-called CMB spectrum

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
CMB is the so-called cosmic microwave background

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
radiation

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It is a microcosmic microwave background

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That is to say

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
If we assume that dark matter exists

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
At the same time, there is dark energy

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
We can

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Use the cosmological model

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
To fit this so-called Park spectrum

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
You can see this picture

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
This black dot is a good fit

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Of course, there are some parameters to adjust

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But it is roughly

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
The cosmological model

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Can also explain this Park spectrum

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Then this

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Must assume the existence of dark matter

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
The last more famous is the so-called

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Bury cluster

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
The so-called Bury cluster is

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
When we find that the two clusters are contrasting

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
We can see this x-ray

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
This

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
That signal

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Simply put, I found that in fact

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
In addition to

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
This visible part is what you just saw on the picture

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
This

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
The red and purple part we see

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Part of it is that it goes straight through each other

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And then there is no interaction

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
In fact, that can explain

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It may be an evidence of dark matter

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
This phenomenon seems to be general

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
This correctional gravity seems to be

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
It's better to explain

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So the last thing is dark matter

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
So we have a lot of evidence

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Show the existence of dark matter

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
But I still believe that many people

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
To challenge the idea of ​​dark matter

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
At present, the mainstream still thinks

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Dark matter is a more feasible

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
A way

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
it is good

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
This is the so-called Cosmic Pi

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It is based on the so-called

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
The standard model of cosmology

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
We can measure this

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Dark energy, dark matter

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And the so-called Baryon, which is the so-called

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Like the standard model just now

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
The table of particles

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
In this

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
The purple part is probably

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
If its effect can form a bond state

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Then we can call this bond state

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
This Baryon

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
That is to say, we are currently

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Except

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
For example, I currently see these stars in the universe

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Most of them are

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
This Baryon and some

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Electrons, some leptons

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
This one takes up only 5% of the universe's energy

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Just very little

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
On the contrary, dark energy and dark matter

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
It takes up a very high proportion

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Like this dark matter

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
It takes up about a quarter of the universe

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Energy

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Of course, today I will focus on

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
On this dark matter

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
What about dark energy

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Generally, of course

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Some people often use this

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Cosmic parameter or some

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
The so-called quintessence

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
It seems to be called the fifth element

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
To explain

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Why does dark energy exist?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That is to say, we have observed

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
This universe is accelerating expansion

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
If we assume this dark energy

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Can explain this phenomenon very well

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It seems to have won the Nobel Prize

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
A few years ago because someone observed

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
The accelerating expansion of the universe

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
And won the Nobel Prize

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Of course we are familiar with this Baryon

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
There are some problems

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Maybe you have heard of the so-called antimatter

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
The universe has so-called positive matter and antimatter

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Why is there more positive matter in the universe?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Antimatter is less, this is also a problem

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
For example, why did I just leave this 5% positive matter?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
This theoretical chemist

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Still studying it

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Anyway, today I will focus on

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
On this dark matter

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Since we are studying dark matter

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Of course we have to understand its nature

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
It has a few simple

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Simple nature

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
The first one is because it is

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
It is invisible

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
That is, we just talked about

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Neurotransmitter

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Before we do this prediction

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
We did not realize that this dark matter exists

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So it means that it is with our general battery

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Batteries do not interact

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
It means that the dark matter

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It is electromagnetic

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
In addition

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Since it exists

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
It has existed until now

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It means it is

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Its lifespan is longer than that of the universe

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
So it has to be very stable

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
It is very easy to change

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
But it's not that it won't change

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It changes very slowly

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Because in fact, some astronomical phenomena

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Can also be explained by dark matter

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
For example, dark matter can

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Change into light

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
To explain

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Unidentified signals

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
According to what I just said

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
This CMB and the so-called universe

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Early nuclear fusion

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Observation prediction

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
That is, it will not be like what we just said

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Some

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
The substance composed of nucleus or neutrinos

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
It is a baryon

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Matter

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
What about the last

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
If it is formed from a star structure

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Its movement speed is probably moving

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
But its movement speed is not very fast

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
This is mainly because we observe this star structure

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Formation to judge

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
That is, if

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Because dark matter itself has quality

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Its quality is very large

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Of course it will be in the universe

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Will have its own distribution

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
In other words, if it is dark matter

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
If it is in a place

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
If it moves very fast today

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Then it is more dispersed

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
On the contrary, if it moves very slowly today

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It is easier to gather in a certain place

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
If

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
If there is a lot of dark matter in a certain place

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It means it will provide more gravity

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
That's the general so-called

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
These heavy materials are easier

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Slightly attracted

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Gathered in dark matter

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
This density is relatively high

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Then gradually form stars

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Then we currently see the universe

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Are relatively close to the star structure

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
This implies that this

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Dark matter

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Its speed is much less than the speed of light

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Of course there is also the so-called

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Borrowing light

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Just

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Just

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Very close to the speed of light

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Of course there is a borrowing in the middle

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Borrowing dark matter

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I don't know how to say it in Chinese

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Maybe it's called cold dark matter

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
In general, we study dark matter that is less than the speed of light

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
We call it cold dark matter

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Is cold dark matter

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
What's next

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Let's talk about a few possible dark matter candidates

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
We just talked about

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Just introduce the nature of dark matter

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Of course, if you think about it

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
What kind of particle is it

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Of course there are a lot of models

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I can only use English here

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
The first one is more popular

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Is this so-called

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Massive particle

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
The first one I just talked about is dark matter

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Because it has to be with this

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
General matter interaction is very weak

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Otherwise we should be able to measure it easily

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
The other one is that it must provide

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Very strong gravity

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
So it probably has to be a very heavy particle

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
So this so-called

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Massive particle

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Is more popular

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Generally we call it WIMP

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
WIMP

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
WIMP also has a lot of options

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
It may be

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
A kind of Sushi particle

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Sushi is translated into Chinese as super symmetry

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It may be

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
The latest super symmetry

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Super symmetry example

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Like the so-called neutrino

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It may also be the so-called

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The latest one is called KK particles

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
KK this thing

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Is related to this

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Extra-dimensional model

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
But my topic today is not to discuss

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The so-called WIMP

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
What I'm going to discuss today is the other candidates below

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
The first one, the so-called action

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
That Chinese

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Maybe just turn it into the axis

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It seems that there is no

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
May not be

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Someone said that in the file

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But I just turned it into an axis

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Of course there are other candidates

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Like the so-called standard neutrinos

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Or the so-called SIMP

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
SIMP is the topic I studied a few years ago

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
This S is actually strongly

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It is

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
It is different from this weakly

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It is a strong massive particle

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
The work I did a few years ago

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Is to combine this SIMP with neutrinos

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I gave this speech at TERA last year

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Today I will give another

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Different theme is related to action

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
How about this WIMP

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
How to detect it? I think this

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Maybe Zhang Yong is more familiar

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
He may have a few speeches before

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Related to this WIMP

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Experiment

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Today I will focus on this WIMP experiment

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I will mention a little later

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
How do we use experiments to detect this action

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
it is good

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Then

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Enter the topic behind me

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Because I was probably in the first 20 pages

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Is to do some basic introduction

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
What about the back?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
It's basically what I said before

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So basically it's more difficult

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
More mathematical

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
It's hard to understand

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
This is my last slide

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
To explain the so-called strong CP problem

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Before

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Some

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Terminology

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
What I'm talking about here is the so-called symmetry

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
The first P

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
We call it parity

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
So-called mirror symmetry

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Everyone may be familiar with this

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
If you look at it from a mathematical point of view

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
For example, put x into negative x

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Put a negative sign

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Then we call it mirror symmetry

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
In fact, for a long time, physicists believe

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
All physical laws should be mirror symmetry

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Of course, this law

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Of course, it should be known

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Yang and Li

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Found that our universe is

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Irregular

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Mirror symmetry is not a good symmetry

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Should not

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Not a good symmetry

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It's not a symmetry in our nature

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
For example, I just talked about this

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
In our standard model, this has a negative effect

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
The negative effect itself

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
This interaction is valid

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
This parity symmetry

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Okay, the second one is the so-called

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Charge conjugation

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
We use C to represent that it is

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The Chinese text should be translated directly

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
The reason is quite simple

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It is so-called the opposite of this electric

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
But the quality does not change

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So just inside the table, for example, electron

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We know that electron itself also has an antimatter

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It's called positron

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The charge itself

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The same direction but the opposite

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
So we can simply say we can do

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Charge conjugation

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Did you hear it?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Did you hear it?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
My head didn't jump out, sorry

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Then we can do a power equation

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Change its electric

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
In fact, we found that

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
C is not a good symmetry

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Then there is the so-called time reversal

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
It's actually very similar to this

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Basically, you change the direction of time

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Theoretically, it is to change T to T

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Then I just talked about

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
P is not symmetrical, C is not symmetrical

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Then you will think about some strange symmetries

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
So someone considers whether C and P are symmetrical

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Even a theory

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Don't just do P conversion

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
You also do C conversion, then we call C and P symmetrical

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
That's the same for a while

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
After Yang Zhengning found that P is not symmetrical

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
We think that C and P are very good symmetries

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Yes, then later

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
In this so-called

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
The decay

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We found that C and P are not symmetrical

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
This is also a Nobel Prize

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
So our conclusion is that

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
C and P and T and C and P

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
C and P are not symmetrical

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Then we can go further

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
For example, C and P and T are not symmetrical

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
So far

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The answer is

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Because I have not found that C and P are symmetrical

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Destroy this phenomenon

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Unless we measure this

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The quality of antimatter and real matter is different

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Otherwise our current

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
The conclusion is that C and P are very good

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
This symmetry

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Anyway

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
My conclusion here is that

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
C and P are not symmetrical

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
OK, so far there is no problem

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Can ask first

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Have it

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Or do you understand

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
If you have a question

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Remember to turn on the microphone

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Otherwise you may talk for a long time

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I found that I did not turn on the microphone

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It seems that everyone understands

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
OK

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I want to ask

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
So here

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Can mention a little bit

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Verify it separately

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Symmetry and asymmetry

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
What is it

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
That's it

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I am not

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
For example, you can go to this

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Wu Dayou is doing this

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
He should be doing

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Wu Jianxiong

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Wu Jianxiong

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
He is a female scientist

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Measure this

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
This is the beta decay phenomenon

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Yes

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Found that this is not asymmetric

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
If you look up this in Wikipedia

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Asymmetry should mention this experiment

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
What about C and P

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
C and P

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
You can take the so-called C and P

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
You can also find it online

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Their experiment

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
He found this

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Kaon

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Charge Kaon

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
There are several types of Kaon

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Long Life

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Long Life

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Joe Life

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Because there are some asymmetry

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Long Life and Joe Life

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Maybe two lights or three lights

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I am two lights and three lights

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
This

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Final state

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Wu Jianxiong should be

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
C and P

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Final state C and P

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
C and P are different

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
If your final state is two lights or three lights

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I found that this KL

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I forgot if it was KL

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
It should be KL

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Long Life

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
If you wait long enough

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It will actually decay

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
One final state

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I forgot if it was two lights or three lights

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Check this detail

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Zhang Yong, do you remember

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I don't remember

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
When I was doing

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
We are doing B behind me

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I know you are doing B

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Anyway, this has nothing to do with Kaon

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Anyway, this has nothing to do with Kaon

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I've seen the story before

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
But I didn't prepare this story today

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Sorry

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Is there any other questions?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
If not, let's go straight to my research topic

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Of course, the next step is more

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
English

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
More mathematical

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
it is good

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Then I will directly cut the topic and talk about this so-called action

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Especially

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
QCD action

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So why

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
This idea

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
In other words, it comes from this

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
In QCD, we have this so-called strong CP problem

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
In other words, in QCD, we have this so-called strong CP problem

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
In other words, I just said

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
In the natural world, CP is not very symmetrical

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
In the natural world, CP is not very symmetrical

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
So mathematicians can write some

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Destroy CP symmetry

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
The theory of interaction

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
There is a very complicated mathematical formula on the screen

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
There is a very complicated mathematical formula on the screen

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It's called Lagrangian

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
It's called Lagrangian

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
In other words

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Because CP is not symmetrical

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Because CP is not symmetrical

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So we can write this

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
In this strong effect

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
So we can write this

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
In our theory

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It represents

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
This strong effect

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
This strong effect

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Of course you can write this

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
There is no problem

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But we found

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
If you go from here

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
This so-called Neutron EDM

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
EDM is called Electrodipole Moment

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
EDM is called Electrodipole Moment

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
It's a kind of

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
It's a kind of

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
We found from the experiment

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
We found from the experiment

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
We found from the experiment

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
This interaction

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
There is a factor called strong CP phase

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
This theta must be less than 10

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
This theta must be less than 10

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Of course this number

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
To some physics

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It's very uncomfortable

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
We naturally have this

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It's called

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
It's called Neutron

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It's called Neutron

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It may be 0.1 or

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
It may be 0.1 or

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It may be 0.1 or

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
10 to the negative 10 is a little bit small

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
10 to the negative 10 or negative 10

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Is a little bit

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Is a little bit

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Of course you can't say

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
The natural world

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You can choose such a small number

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Who knows

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You don't know how the natural world works

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
But from the view of the theoretical student

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
This theta term has two

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Of course I won't

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I won't introduce this contribution

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Basically it has two

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Physics

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
It's made up of completely different physics

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Then this is a problem

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
That is to say, if you look at this theta

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Equals theta 0 plus this

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
What is this determining thing

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Because the two of them are different physics

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Then ask why these two

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Different physics

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
They will be so good

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Cancel to each other

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
That's a very

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
It's a problem

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Basically it's a reaction

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That is to say, why is this theta so small

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Then give everyone a little feeling

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
For example, you can imagine that this

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
This theta is

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
The simple mathematician on the right side of the screen

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It may be this 10 to the negative 11

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Then it will be equal to

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
For example, if this theta is set to 1

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Then the second one behind this

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
It may be 0.999999

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Then you become

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
This

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Just this two different physics

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
It's just a little bit

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
It's a fine-tuning

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Then this is in our physics

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't like it

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So we don't need to solve this problem

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Then this is the so-called strong CP problem

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
That

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Of course, there are many theories to explain this strong CP problem

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Then the most popular at the moment

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
The so-called introduction

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
The so-called action

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Then this general mechanism is called

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Perseverance mechanism

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Or abbreviated as PQ mechanism

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Then in this mechanism

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
The so-called strong CP phase

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
It's not a simple

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Parameter

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It is a dynamic parameter

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Then I don't do too much here

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
This

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
This action theory introduction

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I just introduced it directly

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
For example, in the mathematical world just now

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
We only have a theta term

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But I added another one

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
There is a second one in this box

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Then there is a big A divided by a FA

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Then this A is the so-called action

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
A constant

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It has something to do with this

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
A symmetry destruction

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Maybe you don't need to know this

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
This detail you know this is a

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
A constant that is very important

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Because it will be with us later

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
This photon has something to do with this action

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Good

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
What about the introduction of this action?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
When we do the calculation, we will find that it is at a very high temperature

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Just look at this picture

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The picture below

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
When you are at a very high temperature

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
This T represents this temperature

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The temperature is far greater than this

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
QCD

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
When this QCD action

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
This QCD action

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Its potential

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Its potential is very flat

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
When its temperature is very low

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Through this QCD

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
What is called non-circulation

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Non-circulation effect

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Its potential will be raised

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
So it means that at the beginning

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
It may be sitting well

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
This red part

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
After it is raised, it starts to fall

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Falling in this blue part

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
This potential

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
The smallest part

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Potential minima

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Just in this position

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Just put this theta

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Cancel it

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Theta plus A

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Define it as theta effective

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Just in this minima

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Theta effective will be equal to zero

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
This theta will be

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
This action

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Generally called vacuum expectation value

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Will cancel it

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
So this theta effective

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Is a very small number

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
That can explain why

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
We observe that this theta

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Is the negative ten of the original value

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
That is, it is almost equal to zero

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Yes, so action

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
It actually

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
The appearance is to explain this

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Strong C problem

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
This is the so-called

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
This part

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Is there any problem with this?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Still OK

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Understand

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Anyway, it is to introduce some things

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Then cancel some things

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
That's it

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
The first one is canceled, so we don't see it in practice

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Then I will talk about

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Some action properties

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
We just said why

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
That

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
The same as I just said

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
It will pass through this QCD

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Non-circulation

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Non-circulation is called non-perturbative

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
The effect can be calculated

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Just look at the formula

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
This T is the temperature

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
If the temperature is very high

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
This ma represents

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
The mass of the action

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
It will go to zero when the temperature is very high

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
When the temperature is very low

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
It will approach a constant

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
This constant is called zero temperature mass of QCD action

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It can also be calculated

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
As long as you know

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
As long as you know that QCD is at a very high temperature

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
It is non-circulation

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And when it is at a very low temperature

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It is a mass

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Its mass relationship is at a very low temperature

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It has this relation

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It can be connected to the constant I just mentioned

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
No connection

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
There is a unit on the picture here

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I don't know if you are familiar with this

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
There should be

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
This is the so-called electron volt

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
We are talking about 1.6 times 10

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Minus 19

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Yes

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Why this is the mass

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Then you can use energy to represent

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
That's because we're in high energy

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
We are used to making this light speed into 1

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
In other words, you can say that energy is actually the mass

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
OK

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So we use this unit to represent the mass

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It's called EV

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
This GV is convenient

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It's 10 to the power of 9

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
But there are other abbreviations

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Such as NEV or KEV

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
If you do experiments

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You should be familiar with this

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
This abbreviation

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
G or

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
KEV or GV

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Anyway, QCD action

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Its mass

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It has something to do with the constant

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It has something to do with the constant

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Let me tell you in advance

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
We will mention a kind of action light particle

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's a kind of light particle

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It is not satisfied with the above relationship

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So that means

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Its quality and its

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Its decay constant

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It has nothing to do with

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
They are two free parameters

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Yes

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Then there will be some

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
There are some operations

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Because it is after all two free parameters

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Anyway

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
What's more special

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
We found that this QCD action

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It can not only solve

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Strong C problem

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It is also a good dark matter candidate

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
That is to say, I just said

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
QCD action

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
When it is very low temperature, it will form a potential

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It just happens to be echoing the potential

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And just this phenomenon

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
What about this model

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
We can

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
See it as a dark matter

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
A model

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Yes

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Then we can

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Can I ask a question

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Please ask

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
You just said the temperature in the front page

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Is it the temperature of the universe

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
After the particle

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's Proxima

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
It's the radiation temperature

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Then when is it in the universe

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Will

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Will reach the TQCD

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Hello

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
How much will the universe temperature reach

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
That's the TQCD

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
You mean Lambda QCD

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Lambda QCD

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
TQCD is the same as Lambda QCD

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It's almost the same

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Maybe a few times

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
TQCD

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Let me see if I remember correctly

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
More than 100 MeV

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Because QCD

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The scale of QCD is probably

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Hundreds of MeV

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
It's probably a value

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Yes

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
So TQCD

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Is it before inflation

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
After

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
When it's low temperature

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Is inflation high

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Is it before CMB

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
CMB

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Should be earlier

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
CMB

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
You have to have CMB

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Let me see

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
What is the temperature of CMB

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
It should be

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Are you doing astronomy

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Do you remember

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I want to think about it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
What is the temperature

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
CMB temperature

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I don't remember

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It should be a little later

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Should

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
If you want to type EGV

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Corresponds to how much temperature

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I should check this

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
OK

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Thank you

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Ok

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The formula above

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Of course you don't have to remember it

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
This is us

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Since we theorize that this action

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
It can form this atocometer when it vibrates

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Then we can estimate this

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Its energy density

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
What is the energy density

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Then you can use this formula to represent

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
As long as you know

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Omega A in this equation

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It's this Omega A again

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
It represents the energy density of action

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
So far we have observed that the energy density

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's about 0.1

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Or 0.12

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
So that means this FA

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
This formula is FA

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Roughly it's about

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
10 to the 12th square

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
GEV

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Basically it can't change

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
OK

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
This formula

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Is the position of this action

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
So of course you can

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
You can adjust this formula

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
And then you change this FA

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
But that's more fine-tuning

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
For example, you can assume that if

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
The universe

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
This action

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
At the beginning of the vibration

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
It's very close to this

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Top of this

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Does that mean it will slide slower

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
If number 5 slides slower

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Its energy density will be higher

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
So this theory

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
If theta is close to pi

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
This will contribute a lot

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Very big

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
In this case, this FA

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You can make it smaller

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Yes, that's a little bit more fine-tuning

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But we don't like it

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
So generally this theta initial

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
We won't assume it's that big

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Generally speaking, this FA

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's close to 10 to the 12th square

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
GEV

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Then it can explain this wind speed

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
About 0.1

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
OK

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Then let's talk about this action

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Why can't we see photons

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Generally the same is through this interaction

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
To describe

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Just put this on

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
It should be the left index of the first line

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
It's LA Gamma Gamma

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Yes, this F is represented by light

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Yes, you don't have to remember this

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
If it's not a theory

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
You just need to know that this represents

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Action and two

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
The interaction of light

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
What about the intensity of this interaction

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
We can use this

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
GA Gamma Gamma

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
We call this GA Gamma Gamma

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Action Photon Coupling

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Then we can find out

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
This coupling will be with Gamma

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
This decay constant

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's a contrast

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
That is to say, if the decay constant is bigger

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
This coupling is smaller

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
OK

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
The one on the bottom right is the so-called

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It's used to describe this action

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
How to interact with the light

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
That's usually through this

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Loop of loop

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Induce out

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Of course you don't need to know this detail

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Sorry

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
If you want to

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That is to say, I just said

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
QCD action

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Can be done

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
So if you want to meet this

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
We observe this

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
What about the energy density

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
This FA

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
12 square GV

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Then you bring it into this formula

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
You will find this A Gamma Gamma

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It should be about

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
10 to the negative 10th square

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
GV inverse

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
That's great

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Because this coupling is small

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
QCD action

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It won't be easy to change into light

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So it's not stable

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
So it's in line with what we just said

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
One of the properties of dark matter

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
That's because

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
This A Gamma Gamma is very small

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
So in practice

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
It's not easy to measure it

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Of course we can do it again

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
We can introduce this experiment in the future

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Of course there is a chance

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
it is good

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
So let me show you this experiment

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
That's a few

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Measurement action

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
This experiment

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
This picture was made by my boss

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Because it's too beautiful

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
There are several types

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
There are indirect and non-indirect

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
My research

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
What about my theory

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I will focus on this

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Direct part

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
You can see it on the picture

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Related words

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Like the middle

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
The one on the second row in the middle

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
This solar action

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
This solar action

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Because action will work with light

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
So we can predict

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
It may be from this solar system

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Then we can use

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Maybe it's a telescope

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
There is a so-called

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Or the second one

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Or these experiments

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Then there is the so-called

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Cosmic

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Cosmological action

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Cosmic action is what we just said

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It may be from the early universe

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
These actions

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Then we can use

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
To measure WIMP

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Let's say

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
It can work with these nuclear principles

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Then we will measure these

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
For example

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Because

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
If the nuclear principle works with this action

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
It may rebound

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
There will be some signals

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Then we can measure

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Related to these experiments

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Like the so-called

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Or the Casper

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
On the table

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Directly listed

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
This is the experimental picture

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Of course it's a bit complicated

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You can see this

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
This gray band

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
It is the so-called QCD action

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
If you want to satisfy it as a document

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Then it has to be painted

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
This red point

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
So you can see it

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Quite close to the so-called

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
ADMS sensitivity

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
So there is a chance in the future

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
ADMS

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Perspective

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
If they can

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Improve this sensitivity

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Maybe you can measure this

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Document

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Of course there are other experiments

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Like the one I just mentioned

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Measure solar action

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Its current upper bound is a bit higher

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
So in the future

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
They can lower the upper bound

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Also have the opportunity

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
To measure this QCD action

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You may see

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Another one

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
This brown

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
This brown band

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
This corresponds to the so-called ELF document

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Let me go back here

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
What is ELF document

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
The same thing

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
You can go back to the previous one

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
There is a bunch of

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Constraint

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I gave a talk a while ago

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
I can't answer the question

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Is it a problem of experiment?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
No, it's like this

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Because I am

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Thermorelic

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Then your axiom is not thermorelic

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Then there is a person who does astronomy

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
He asked me

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Now this kind of axiom

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Or ELF

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
It's actually a

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
The relationship between the measurement and the photon coupling

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
And its mass

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Then it's a bit like a positive relationship

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
A value relationship

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
It can be extended indefinitely

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
But how heavy can it be

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
If it is a document

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
It can be very heavy

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Even the weight of a moon

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Then my idea is

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It's just very heavy

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
If it's very heavy, it's very big

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Then we should have seen it earlier

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
But I got an answer

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
It seems to be

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Large-scale structure

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
There is a constraint

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Thermorelic can't be light

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Or non-thermal can't be heavy

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
This is actually

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I know a little

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You see this in the picture

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
The quality of the axiom

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I just drew this range

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
In fact

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
You can't be too light

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
That is, its current lower bound seems to be

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Negative 22eV

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
This will correspond to

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
The so-called Fuzzy document

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Fuzzy document

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Fuzzy document

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
This seems to be done by some groups in Taiwan University

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
In other words, if you

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
If the document is too light

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
What to do with this

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
It's not easy, this material wave is too long

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
That is, you will become

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The magnitude of the universe

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
These quantum effects came out

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Then they do astronomy

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
It seems to see these

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Some small-scale

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Differences

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
So if you

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Some constraints

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
So this

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Document can't be too light

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Light to negative 22eV

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
It has some lower bound

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
But I don't really understand

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Where is the upper bound of the axiom

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Oh, I know, I see

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Basically, as long as it exceeds 10

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Negative 10.5

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Negative 11

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
It's all ruled out

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Cache

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
OK, I see

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Of course you can lower

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
This can be very low

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
But as I said, it can't be too small

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
it is good

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
This is actually a very good question

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Back to action

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Elp

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Originally from this

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Theoretical theory

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
For example, we are in the theoretical theory

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
They predict a lot of action particles

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Then we call these action particles

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Action light particles

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
That's the same as taking this

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Then I'm in my back pocket

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I'll use this

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
代表

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Its nature is exactly the same as this

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Just say it

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Because it has nothing to do with qcd

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
So its quality is not from qcd

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
It's from another

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Like the so-called hidden qcd

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I don't know how to say it

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Hidden is

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
It's another qcd

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Its quality is not direct from this

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Our general standard model qcd

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
That's the same

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
It can't see the light

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Then it can also be

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
This dark matter candidate

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
The formula is basically

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Very similar to the qcd action

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
So basically it's exactly the same

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
It's exactly the same as qcd

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
The difference is that it

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
This is with this qcd

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The effect has nothing to do with it

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Ok

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
So basically I'm q

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Elp's introduction is only one page

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
It's quite simple

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Then we will calculate this

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
This one

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Action with this photon coupling

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Then I found that his

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
It must correspond to this on the map

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
This brown

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
This band

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So obviously this brown

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It's much smaller than this qcd

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
So of course we hope

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
If we don't see qcd action

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Then there are some extra particles

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
We can measure

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Because it has some motivation

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
But you have to believe

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
You have to believe that this theory is right

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Of course

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Of course it is

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
That is to say

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
That is to say you can

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Allow this particle to exist

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
OK

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Is there a problem here?

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
If not, I will

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
In

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
So far, it's basically

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Action's introduction

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
That is to say, this thing is basically

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Everyone knows

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Everyone knows

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So i

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
I will start my research later

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
How to connect action

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
qcd action with qcd

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
qcd action

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
The relationship between qcd and qcd

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
This is what I will talk about later

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Before I finish

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Everyone may have a question

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Why is it called action?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
This is a very interesting story

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Does anyone know?

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
I'm not familiar with action

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
In fact, I also

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I'll check it out later

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Because it's really weird

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Basically, this story is very simple

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Maybe everyone is watching me

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
My friend

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Huang Zhong helped me make a promotional poster

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
He put a poster

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Something like a drink

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That's not a drink

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
That is a cleaner

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Why is it called action?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
This has a lot to do with this cleaner

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
That is to say the first

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
You can see this

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I divided this action into two parts

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
The front is axi

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
That is to say

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
We just saw this

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
qcd

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Why does it appear?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Mainly with us in theoretical

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
ActionCurrentAnomaly

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Has a relationship

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
You just need to know

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Connection with

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
ActionCurrent

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
You also know

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Physics likes to put the name of Paracord

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
What is it called?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Or Positron

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
That's the end of ON, right?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
So this

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
What about the Nobel Prize in 2004?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
The Wheeljack

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
He is because of this so-called

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Progressive Freedom

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
This is like

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I just quoted his article

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
He said it directly

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Maybe a few years ago he went to the supermarket

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
He saw this

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Cleaner

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
It looks like a washing powder

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
He saw the box

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Many colors of this

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Washing powder

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Then he called this washing powder

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I immediately realized that this may be a good name

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Because the first one

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
It's the end of ON, and then there's AIX

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
That has something to do with the axis

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
The point is that we just introduced the action

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
The purpose is to put this

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
qcd

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
So he wrote here

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
When I notice a new particle that

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Clean up the problem with an action

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So he realized that this is a very good name

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
So he took it

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Of course there are other

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Others

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Think of other names

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Like this Weinberg is also a Nobel Prize

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
He thought of other names

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
But later this Weinberg also agreed that this action

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
It's closer

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
So it's been applied until now

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
He called it action

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Okay, that's just an exaggeration

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Just explain a little bit

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
You will find that physicists

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
There are quite a few stories about particle names

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
For example

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
There is a quark in this table

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Does anyone know how quark is named?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Quark is also a Nobel Prize

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
It's Gilman

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
He came up with an idea

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Then he thought about it for a while

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Later he found that it was like reading a novel

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
This duck in this novel

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
It seems to be called quack quack quack

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
He thinks it's good, so he took it

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
So this

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
This particle is called quark

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Yes, this is very

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Very interesting

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I can only say that physics sometimes

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
It's quite unexpected

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Then I will put this

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
The basic introduction of action is finished

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
If there is no problem

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I will introduce the research directly

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I will bring the research part very soon

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Because it is more detailed and related to time

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I'll just talk about it

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Just say

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
It can explain

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Can explain this

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
At the same time

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
If you believe

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
If you believe

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Then

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Assuming they exist at the same time

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
In our natural world

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
We predict what kind of phenomenon it should have

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
OK

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
That

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
If we assume that there is a so-called quality mixing between them

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
What kind of effect will it have

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
This time I will give you

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Give this answer

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
This is called level crossing

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
What is the Chinese translation of level crossing?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Level crossing

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
This picture is

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Assuming that QC action

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
There is no so-called mixing with this alpha

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Without mixing

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Green and red lines on the picture

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
It represents the evolution of their mass

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
You will find that

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
This is the first one

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Green is QC action

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I just said that when it is very low temperature

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
It has quality, but there is no quality at very high temperature

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
So its quality evolution

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
It should be like this green picture

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Then alpha, because it has nothing to do with QC effect

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
So its mass

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Let's assume it is constant

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Here I have to assume

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
The mass of alpha must be less than this

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Action

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
At a very low temperature mass

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
The reason is that

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
If there is no maxmixing

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Nothing happens

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
If you turn on this maxmixing today

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
You see this picture

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
There are some changes

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
You will find that this green line

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
It should be going up

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
It is at a certain time

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
It suddenly turned to the original

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
The direction of the alp

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
The same alp

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
This is at a very

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
At a very high temperature

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
This is its original evolution

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
But it is still at a certain time

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
It will run up

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Run to the action part

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Then we call this phenomenon

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Level crossing between QC action and alp

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Then this phenomenon

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Actually not

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
Only appeared in my research

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
If you do

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Neutrino mass physics

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
It is very similar to the so-called Neutrino vibration

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It is very similar to the so-called Neutrino vibration

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Neutrino in matter

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
There will also be this level crossing phenomenon

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Then this is the answer

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
If you put this maxmixing today

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
If you turn it on

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Then its

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
There will be a so-called level crossing phenomenon

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
So if there is a level crossing

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
We mean

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
This

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
QC action and alp

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
There will be a so-called heat transfer

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
The so-called heat transfer is

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Its particle

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Density

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Is small

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
From A to this

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
This

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
This

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Diabetic conversion

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
In Chinese, it may be translated as the heat transfer

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
There are some conditions

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I may need to mention it later

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
So if this

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Ok, this is the answer

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
So I won't repeat it again

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
If there is this

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
We will predict that

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
The energy density of this action

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
It will be suppressed

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
By this maxmixing

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Because this

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Its energy density is with this

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Quality and its particle

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
The product is the product

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
So if you have this today

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Level crossing

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Your QC action

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
It's very low temperature

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
It's more like an alp

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
The alp particle is in front of us

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Its energy density is less than this ma

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
So you can predict that its quality will be

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Suppressed by this ratio

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Then it's obvious

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
You will open up some new space

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
In our research

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
OK, this is the model part

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
That's the same

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
This

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
On the left of the first line

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
QC action potential

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
It's a cosine potential

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
We just saw a few in the front

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
It's like a positive potential

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Mathematical description

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
On the right, it's like a description

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
How to make this action

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
There is a maxmixing

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
OK, if you have maxmixing

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
This

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
It's not a physical state

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
We have to do a cross-section

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
The cross-section process is below

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
You can see that it is through a rotation matrix

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Then this is their eigenvalue

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Maybe everyone does

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Maybe you are more familiar with eigenvalue

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
This is the true value

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Although I just saw this on the picture

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
The red line and the green line

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
The so-called eigenvalue evolution

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Then we have to assume

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
mphi is less than ma

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Because it's obvious if you

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
If this condition is met

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
This green line

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
What about this line

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Or this red line

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Less than this

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Green is

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Green at

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
The part of this line

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
It will have this level crossing

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
In other words, if the red is far above the green

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Obviously, there will be no level crossing

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Happening

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
So this is

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
eigenvalue evolution

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Here I have a special assumption

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
This

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Elp's decay function

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
To be smaller than this

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Qc action

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
A little bit

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
This is some mathematical definition

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Hello

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
it is good

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Let's talk about the assumption

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
If you assume

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
mphi is bigger than ma

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
You will find this

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
eigenvalue

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
There will be a big splitting

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
In some sense

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
There is no level crossing

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
it is good

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
The picture on the right is

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Dynamic

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Because of time

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
This is just a mixed angle formula

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
You don't have to look at it

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Its evolution

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
This is the evolution of mixed angle

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Obviously, you can see

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Assuming that the conditions we just talked about

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
This mixed angle

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Just at this level crossing

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
It will have a big change

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
On the other hand

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
In other cases

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Did not happen

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
So we say that the level crossing is in this condition

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
In this f5

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It will have this

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Level crossing

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Hello

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Is there a problem

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Hello

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
No

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
This is a mathematical definition of level crossing

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I won't talk about it

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Some noise

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Is it ok

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Ok

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Let's talk about this

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
To meet some of the conditions of absolute conversion

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
This is qcd

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Before that, I will pay attention to qcd

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Some of its dynamics

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
This

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
On the picture, its equation is

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
This qcd

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Its equation of motion

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Its dynamic equation is

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Basically, it is a two-dimensional equation

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Two-dimensional equation

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Ok

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
On the picture

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
This is the so-called Hubble parameter

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Maybe everyone has heard of this

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Hubble constant

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Basically, it has something to do with Hubble parameter

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This ma

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
The same is the qcd

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Its mass

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
It has something to do with temperature

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
At very high temperature

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
This Hubble parameter is relatively large

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So you can ignore this third item

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Then you solve it, you will find that it is a

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Over-damping solution

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
That is, at high temperature

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Its mass is almost constant

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
At very low temperature

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
You can put this second item

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
This Hubble parameter is ignored

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
If you ignore the second item

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
It is a very simple so-called

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Over-damping solution

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Its equation is getting smaller and smaller

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Because the universe is expanding

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
That's like this picture

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
For example, when it is very low temperature

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
It will continue to vibrate

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Then its equation is getting smaller and smaller

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
This is what I just said

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
When it is very low temperature

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
It will oscillate near the potential mirror

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Roughly speaking, this qc action

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Start oscillating

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
At this Hubble parameter

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Roughly equal to this qc action mass

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yes

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
it is good

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
If you want to

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Calculate this

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
qc action energy density

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Generally, we will define this

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So-called actual number

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Then calculate it

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Actual number is conserved

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
If it is conserved, it is very good

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Because you know that mathematicians like to use this energy to calculate

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Anyway

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
We can solve the equation of motion

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
We can calculate this

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Actual number density

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
We find that it is constant at very low temperature

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
That

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
The reason it is constant is because

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It is a

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Because this vibration is a decoupling process

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
The condition of the decoupling process is to satisfy

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Its

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
External time scale is bigger than

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Internal time scale

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
In our system

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
External time scale is

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
The oscillation rate of the universe

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Or

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Or Hubble time

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
The time of the universe

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
The time of the universe

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Internal time scale is

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Vibration

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Vibration cycle

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
In other words, if you today

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
What about this oscillation cycle

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
For example, this

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
This

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
What about the expansion speed

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
If it is still slow, it is

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It is a decoupling process

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
In this case, this

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Actual number will be a conserved

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Quantity

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Ok

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
In our system, in our research

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Because we have introduced two particles

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
So the decoupling condition will be a little different

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Because

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I just said that in level crossing

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You will have a big

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Big change

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Mixed angle

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So in fact, we will have an additional internal time scale

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We use delta t to represent

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Yes, you can use this formula

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Write down

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
What about the so-called internal time scale

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
In addition to the single action case

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
We only have one

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
It's just a

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Vibration cycle

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
If you have two particles

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You naturally predict that there will be two oscillation cycles

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
In addition to that, we will find

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
We found that there is a third cycle

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
In other words, if two oscillation cycles today

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
In the same phase

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
We identify this as the third cycle

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Yes, you can calculate

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Is 2π ÷ this mass difference

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Between this mass eigenstates

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Ok

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Then we will require this condition

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That is to say

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
This internal time scale is much larger than this

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Internal time scale

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Then we can find out this condition

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You may not need to remember

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Anyway, we can solve this

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
This in our model

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Action number density

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
This is the result

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Let's read this picture

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Hello

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Can you go back to the first two pages

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Ok, which page

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Go back one page

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Next page

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Next page

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Next page

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Is it forward or backward?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I think we are talking about different directions

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I want to ask you

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Basically

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Your cycle is

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Contrary to the mass difference

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
But the mass scale is already very small

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So the mass difference should be smaller

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So this thing

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Actually

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The phase of these two states

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
For us humans

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
The time of this experiment

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
This time

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Is about the scale of the ear

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It is constant phase, right?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You said mass difference?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You said this mass difference

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
What is the value of this value?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
This delta t

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
This delta t

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You said this delta t?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
You said this delta t?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
You said this delta t?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
How small is this delta t?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
How small is this delta t?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I said the oscillation cycle

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I said the oscillation cycle

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
This cycle

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
This cycle

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I said this ELP is

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I said this ELP is

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
EEV

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
For example, the current universe

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
For example, 3K

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
This happened at level crossing

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
This happened at level crossing

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Because we want to discuss

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Will there be this so-called absolute conversion at level crossing?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But isn't it still oscillating now?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Or did I misunderstand?

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
But his mass

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
We use this picture

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
We use this picture

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
For example

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
This one

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
For example, you see this green

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
This is corresponding to

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Light mode

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
It's close to ELP mass

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's close to ELP mass

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And this heavy mode is close to QCD mass

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And this heavy mode is close to QCD mass

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So it's still vibrating

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So it's still vibrating

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But there is still energy density

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
But the vibration is very small

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
But there is still energy density

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So it's basically just a constant

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So you can adjust

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So you can adjust

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
It's smaller than QCD

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's smaller than QCD

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Even if it's QCD axion

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Even if it's QCD axion

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
You have to move down

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
You have to move down

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Wait for that one

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
The green one

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Is that M5?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The horizontal axis is mass

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
The vertical axis is photon coupling

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
The vertical axis is mass

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
The vertical axis is mass

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
The density is lower

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
The density is lower

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
First, density

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
You are talking about

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
photon coupling

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
With mass

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
With mass

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I'll mentioned it later

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
You are talking about

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
how it can enhance

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Because the quality is low

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I will see

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
If you scan out in parameter space

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
If you scan out in parameter space

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
If you scan out in parameter space

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
The decay constant

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Can be smaller

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I'll show the conclusion

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I'll show the conclusion

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Is it an hour?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Is it an hour?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Is it an hour?

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Anyway, this is

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
The two actions

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
The evolution of number density

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
If you have absolute process condition

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I just defined gamma

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
If gamma is greater than 1

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
You can have absolute conversion

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
If you

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
If gamma is less than 1

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You will find the green one will suddenly become

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
The red one

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
In this case, the absolute conversion

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Is not perfect

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You can skip it

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Anyway

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
The result is

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
If we impose the density

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
To solve the parameter space

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
We find

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The decay constant of the ELP

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Divided by the MFA

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
In this graph

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It can be smaller than 1

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
The MFA

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Can be smaller than

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The MFA

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
The MFA

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
If the MFA is 10 to the power of 12

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
As I said

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
If you want to satisfy the density of the object

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
It should be 10 to the power of 12

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
In this case, the GA gamma gamma

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The front coupling is 10 to the power of 15

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So today

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
The MFA

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
If the MFA is smaller than 1

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It means we will have an enhancement

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
As we know

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
As we can see

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
The coupling is

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The decay constant is inversely proportional

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So if you can

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Reduce the MFA

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
We expect to have an enhancement

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
So basically

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
This is our final result

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
The result is the color contours on the graph

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
We found

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
For example, the red bar

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Corresponds to

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
The MFA is equal to

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
3 times 12 square GEV

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
We can

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Have a bigger MFA

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Because we just talked about

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Mass suppression

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
If you have mass suppression

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
The MFA can be increased

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
At the same time

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The MFA

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
The

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Elbow decay constant

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It can be very small

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So it will have an enhancement

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It will be higher than the

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
The middle band

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Enhanced by

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
1000 times or 100 times

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
This is good

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
This mechanism

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Can be

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Measured by

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Solenoid action

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
It can be measured

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
This is our model

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Advantage

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
This is the conclusion

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I think

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
This is a more detailed part

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I think

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
That's about it

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Any questions

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Before you ask questions

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
First of all

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Let's applaud

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Thank you for your speech

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Do you have any questions?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
You can ask questions now

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
This is a theoretical thing

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Can you hear me

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Yes

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Then

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Your theory is very interesting

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We have an experiment

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
About two or three years later

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
There may be some preliminary results

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Which experiment are you doing

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
We have an experiment with LC circuit

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Can you hear me

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Can you hear me

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Can you repeat your question

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Can you hear me

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Can you hear me

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
No

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Just a little bit

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Try again

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Sorry

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Your theory is very interesting

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
We have an experiment

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
At Los Alamos

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Can measure your 10 to 7

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
To 10 to minus 10

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
EV range

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Maybe two or three years later

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Yes

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Your value range is also

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Just your range

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
10 to 7

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
10 to minus 10 EV range

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
My question is

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Is your value range the same as the picture?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Almost

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Almost the same

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
That's not bad

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
You can test your theory

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
But I have a question

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Do you consider

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
If it is two

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Then you will have like

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Neutrino oscillation

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Yes, there will be such a phenomenon

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
This is also a possibility

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I mentioned this to the boss

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But he probably means

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It should be the same phenomenon

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
If you add one more x

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Like particle

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You said it wouldn't change

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Will there be a stronger enhancement

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
There may be a stronger enhancement

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yes

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Our mechanism is

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
But we didn't say

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
You can consider more complex models

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I agree

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
OK

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Thank you

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Do you have any questions?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Hello

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I have a simple question

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Just now

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
You were talking about

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Axiom can handle CP

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Strong CP problem

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
My network is a bit of a problem

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
So I don't seem to hear it clearly

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Can you say it again?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Sorry

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
You said how to solve strong CP problem

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Go back

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
This is strong CP problem

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
This is

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
In QCD, we can choose this term

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Yes, basically

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Just add a particle

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
In this term

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And then

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
When it's very low temperature

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
This

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Axiom will fall to this potential minima

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
This is called

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
It's also vacuum

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It's the vacuum of the axiom

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
This vacuum can just cancel out this CP term

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So this will disappear

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
If this disappears

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It's very small

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
So it can be explained

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Why the upper bound is so small

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
10-11-2

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So it's very simple

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Just a cancellation

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I see

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I'm from NingTai

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Now there are many

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
People

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
They said they want to be in NingTai

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Find this axiom in the range

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
They mainly do

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
What I want to do is

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Find a normal insulator

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
And a topological insulator

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
On their boundary

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Their

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Maxwell equation

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
There will also be this theta term

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
But

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
On the boundary

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Theta term

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Must be integer or semi-integer

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
This is

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
For this integer semi-integer theta

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Does it make any sense in high energy?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Or is it actually

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It's important

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
How much is this theta

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
It doesn't matter at all

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Because this theta is a

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
How to say

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
You can't say it's not important

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
But some people know this

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
You said it's 2π or 2π

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Yes, it's integer semi-integer

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Think about it

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Ok

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I can't think of anything special

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Ok

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Let me see

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
But here

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
This is a different theta

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
There is another theta here

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Confused

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
This is a different theta

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Not this

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Different theta

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
This theta is basically

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Is to cancel something

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
In high energy

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Axiom can also be seen as

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Boundary

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Is it related to boundary effect?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Um

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Wow

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
There is

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Related to boundary

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
But it should not be your

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Topological boundary

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Why is this theta term

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Because I just talked about

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Axiom

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
For example, the electrical effect is

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Vector current

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Do you know

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Axiom current

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Passive integral

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Boundary term is

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Non-managed

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Um

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
So it's actually related to boundary

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
But not your boundary

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Oh ok

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I'm sure

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'm not familiar with

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Your boundary

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yes

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Actually

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Actually

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
There should be a correspondence

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
There should be a correspondence

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
But I'm not familiar with your boundary

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Anyway, this term is actually

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
From that you

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
That

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Passive integral

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
That

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
EMM

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
EMM

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
What is EMM

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
This is QCD

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
QCD

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
That

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Volume

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You can change it to a surface

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Yes

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Ok

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Thank you

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Do you have any questions?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
That

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
That

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Say something

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
I used to be with

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Teacher Cui

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
That

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Sorry

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I want to interrupt you

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
You might want

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Do you turn on the sound at the same time

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Then turn on the microphone again

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Because your response is quite big

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
You may have to adjust it to see if you know

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
What's the situation

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
If you are using headphones

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You can turn it into a standard headset or not

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Try using headphones or something

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Otherwise you can't hear it

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Can you try again

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Sorry

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I'm trying

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Ok

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
It's almost the same

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
You can only hear it if you speak a little slower

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Sorry

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I mean

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
That is

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I am also in Taiwan University

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
That

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
So let me add

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
That is about

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
The best quality

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Can you tell me

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Hey

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Actually, I didn't hear it clearly

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
it is good

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Hey

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Hey

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
That response is quite big

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I didn't hear what you said

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Hey

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Hey

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Hey

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Let's give him time to adjust

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Or you can also type

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Does anyone else have a problem

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Of course

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Wait for me to talk a little

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I don't know where it is

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
But this kind of thing

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
This concept has been developed for a long time

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
This is not a new thing

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
But in recent years

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Maybe Wimper's experiments

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
May be recorded in the future

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I guess

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Do you have any comments

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Don't say that

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
We don't want to lose our jobs

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Isn't your philosophy to explore

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
No

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Just kidding

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I personally have no opinion

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I personally feel

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Things that can be tested should be tested as much as possible

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
This has data

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I think so

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Just now

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Please say

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Hey

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Did someone talk just now

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Let me talk

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Because

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It seems that Action has started to pop up again in recent years

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Experiments seem to be

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Because I remember that there were quite a few experiments at the German conference

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Improving their sensitivity

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Japan has also started to do it recently

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Because the mainstream in Japan

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Is Sucy

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
But because of LC

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Can't see

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
So now

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Sucy

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Start to be more visual

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Of course people are still doing it

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
So Action may be

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
In the next few years

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
A public topic

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Just now

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
The previous

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Collaborator

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I may not have heard it clearly

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Hello, can you hear me now

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Try again

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
You say

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
You just say

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Let's see if we can hear you

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
So

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I want to talk about

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Action

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Action

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
OK

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank you

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Just say

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Like this

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You can measure

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Your

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Things

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
How many

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
If the mass of Action is too low

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
His

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
His

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Will smooth out

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Smaller

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It will be measured

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
It's not the same as the actual measurement

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
So

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
The mass

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Is not

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Oh

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
24

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I remember it wrong

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Do you say 10-24 EV

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I heard the speech

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
10-22

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Because

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Because

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Other

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
A little bit

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Alpha

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
You can use

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Galaxy

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Measure his mass

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
This is another observation

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Some other observations

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
The output is like this

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
OK

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
But

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
The

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Low limit is

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
24 or 23

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
24 or 23 OK

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Thank you

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
OK

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Do you have any questions

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
You say

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
I want to ask the question

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Is with the other

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Do you have any questions

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
You ask

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I heard you ask

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
He just said that

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
What is his material

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
There will be

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
U1

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
The battery

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
That's why

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
High-end words

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Is the battery

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
There is no

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
He is U1

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
U1

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You can

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
There is no

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Do you have any simple views

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Wait a minute

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
U1

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Is it related to the battery

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Wait a minute

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Battery

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Are you Li Zhaolong

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yes

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I think it should be

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Because this question seems to have been discussed with you before

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
U1 can give

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
What do you say

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
U1 can

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
U1 does not have this

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Only

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I don't know if this is

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Related to others

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
U1

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
U1

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
U1 can take it off

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I can ask

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
The neighbor

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
The question

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Is that student still there

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Is that student still there

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I want to ask

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Hello

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I am

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
You just said that

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Is in the material

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
There will be

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
E.B

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Related to Torb

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That object

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Why in that case

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Abelian

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Why is this car still there

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Should be

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I'm not very clear

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But in that

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Topological insulator

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Boundary

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
It is indeed

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Non-Abelian

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
The reason

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I'm not sure

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
You really look at those

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It's the Hamiltonian

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Those

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It is non-Abelian

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
It should be related to this

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
If I remember correctly

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
But

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I'm doing experiments

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I'm not very clear

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Why is this

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Thank you

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Ok

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
That

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I can trouble

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Can you go back to your first page

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
The first page of the video

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
This

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
It's really a cover

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
That

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Because

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Most of what I said today is

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Then there is a framework

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
In fact, the details

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
He has already voted in the archive

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
1806095551

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Of course you can go

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Look at this paper

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You can also find the way to contact He Shuyu

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So if you want to contact He Shuyu

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Is to discuss the details

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Then please contact him in person

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Then our speech today

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Everyone applaud again

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Thank you He Shuyu

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
That Tina

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
You can stop recording

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
If you are still there
