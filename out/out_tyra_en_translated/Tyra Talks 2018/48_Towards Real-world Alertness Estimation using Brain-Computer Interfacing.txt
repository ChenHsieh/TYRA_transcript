I am today's host, I am Hong Shaoming, I am now working in California as a postdoctoral researcher.
Without further ado, let's introduce today's speaker, Dr. Wei Qunshu.
Dr. Qunshu graduated from the College of Electrical Engineering, and stayed in California to study electrical engineering.
After graduating, he went to UCSD to study biotechnology, and his professor is Professor Zong Ziping.
He is mainly interested in using the perspective of engineering to use brain-to-brain meetings to study human behavior.
Over the past few years, he has published nearly 10 conference papers and two journal papers.
Without further ado, let's listen to his presentation.
The title is Towards Real-World Awareness Estimation Using Brain-Computer Interface.
Let's welcome him.
Thank you Shaoming for the introduction.
Today, I will introduce how we measure brain activity and monitor our alertness using a brain-computer interface.
If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt.
We can easily have a discussion.
First, I will briefly introduce the brain.
Our brain is a tube of about 3 pounds, about 1,000 grams.
The outermost part of the brain has many folds.
These folds are composed of many neurons in the brain.
There are about 8.6 billion neurons.
We know that the brain has very strong computing power.
However, compared to our most powerful computers, its performance is very good.
In terms of energy consumption, it is 100,000 times more efficient than a normal CPU.
Therefore, the brain can only operate at 12 to 25 watts.
This wattage is equivalent to the wattage of a light bulb.
So you can imagine that in some comics, when the character thinks of a point, he will draw a light bulb.
It's actually pretty close.
Because the brain's power consumption is the power of a light bulb.
The structure of the neural network is composed of cells.
There are many vectors.
The vector part collects information from other neural networks around it.
After the information is compiled into the neural network, it will decide whether to power up.
If you want to power up, you can use the axis.
Then you can power up to other neural networks.
In this way, complex networks can be used to control the whole person.
Here is a brain signal that I use more often.
It's called a brain wave.
It's EEG.
Many people have been exposed to EEG.
Especially when a newborn is born, we often do a brain test to see if his vision or hearing is normal.
How does EEG occur?
There are many neural networks in our brain.
Especially the skin.
Many neural networks are arranged.
There are some rules in the structure.
The arrangement of the rules allows the neural network to have an additional effect when it is powering up.
The change in the electrical field can be so great that you can feel the change in the electrical field outside the scalp.
The change in the electrical field becomes our brain wave signal after some processing.
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt me.
Our brain wave signal is...
I have a question.
There is a line below.
BlueJeans meeting is sharing your screen with bluejeans.com.
You have to press the hide button.
Oh, okay.
Or you can block it a little bit.
I'm sorry.
You can continue.
Thank you.
Okay.
Let's continue.
This is the brain wave signal.
It is a real-time signal.
You can see that it is like a time series.
It is a time series.
In order to measure the whole brain, we will try to arrange electrical fields outside the scalp.
So we will have a lot of brain waves on both sides at the same time.
We will analyze the energy of brain waves in terms of frequency.
The frequency depends on whether the signal is fast or slow.
The high frequency is the fast part.
The low frequency is the slow part.
So we will divide delta.
It is a low frequency activity of less than 3.5 Hz.
It is a very slow vibration.
If you go higher, it will be divided into theta wave, alpha wave, or beta wave.
The higher the frequency, the faster the vibration.
Our brain can be divided into different bands.
By observing the energy of the band, we can get a lot of information.
Let me introduce the location of the channel of the brain.
It has a standard way of dividing.
The name of the channel is divided into points.
Frontal is the channel at the beginning of F.
Central is the channel at the beginning of C.
Central parietal is the channel at the beginning of O.
Occipital is the channel at the beginning of O.
We can do this frequency analysis for each channel.
We can combine the change of time with the change of frequency.
We can see the energy of different bands over time.
This can tell us a lot of information about the state of this person.
We can design experiments to see if the brain changes.
We can find some characteristics in different states.
Reflect the brain in different states.
The brain interface is where we read the signals of the brain.
Then we go through some signal processing, including frequency analysis.
Or you can use a lot of other different signal processing methods to get different characteristics.
Then we use the processed signals to make it recognizable.
Then we can convert it into some commands to control.
For example, a mechanical arm or a wheel or a mouse cursor.
Or to input text or some messages.
We call this the brain computer interface.
In short, it's BCI.
What can BCI do?
As I just said, it can convert into commands.
So when we play video games, we can use it to control the movement of your character.
Of course, including the wheel and the mechanical arm.
Of course, it can also be used to monitor a person's cognitive state.
Including whether you want to sleep.
This extends to my main area of expertise.
Monitoring the level of awareness.
The level of awareness is related to drowsy driving.
A lot of people fall asleep while driving.
This news happened on July 18th.
It was recently that a drowsy driving incident happened.
It was recently that a drowsy driving incident happened.
Did you turn on the sound in the group chat?
Or we don't need to hear the sound?
Yes, so we can't hear the sound?
I didn't hear it.
Let's see what to do.
What to do?
I can't do it.
Can you play it on your computer?
Okay.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
I can hear you.
I can hear you.
Can you hear me now?
Yes.
Max.
And then after 11 hours a day, we have to shut down and have 10 hours of sleep.
We now have to carry electronic recording devices on our vehicles.
Rio says his students learn to make driving plans to avoid getting fatigued,
and they're encouraged to stop to power nap or just stretch their legs.
It does give you more stamina.
You're more alert.
Because when you're not alert, you know, you can't make good decisions.
And that's what truckers like Rudy live by.
I start closing, you got to pull over and take a nap.
GoMana, 8 News Now.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says drowsy driving
causes up to 1.2 million crashes every year in this country,
and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.
That's nearly twice as many as distracted driving.
And that's two deaths and three injuries.
And drowsy driving can cause up to 1.2 million crashes every year,
and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.
So if we can avoid drowsy driving,
if we can effectively monitor drowsy driving,
and then manage it,
maybe we can avoid some of the deaths and injuries caused by this.
And then there was a comment in the news
that if you find that your eyes are closing,
then you should stop driving.
But with drowsy driving,
I discussed with Shaoming last time
if you can monitor drowsy driving
with your eyes or blinkers.
But there's a problem.
Is there a way to catch it before it closes its eyes
that it's actually unable to pay attention to driving?
This part may want to use brainwaves to break through this problem.
If we use the brain-machine interface to do this alertness monitoring,
we will first, of course,
measure its brainwaves from the driver.
After we get this EEG signal,
after some processing,
we use machine learning to build a model
that can convert EEG data into alertness.
After we know its alertness,
we can try to give it some feedback.
For example, we can wake it up,
or we can make the car stop driving,
stop on the side of the road,
or force it to rest.
There are some ways to intervene.
My research is mainly about how we deal with this signal,
how we build a machine learning model
that can monitor alertness very well.
We can accurately determine whether to make some interventions.
I have a question.
I want to clarify a little bit.
Are you saying that your research is about
the state of mental relaxation,
or the state of actually falling asleep?
It's the state of waking up to almost falling asleep.
It's not really asleep yet.
I haven't studied the state of the brain after falling asleep.
I want to capture the state of the brain before falling asleep.
I have experience in driving,
and I know that my eyes were open at that time,
but the image was blurred and black,
and I wasn't looking at the road anymore.
I was a little out of my mind,
and then I suddenly woke up,
and I felt a little shaky.
I started to shake a little.
So it's about getting into the time point.
It depends on when you can't support the alertness,
and then you fall asleep.
I have another question.
You want to identify a signal,
and then you think you want to identify this signal
is the state you're talking about now.
Yes.
Do you have a contrast group?
For example, you track his eyes,
and then you say,
I define that the behavior of the eyes
is the state of mind to fall asleep.
Then I look for the corresponding brain wave.
Or I tell the victim to write,
yes, I feel like I'm going to fall asleep now.
What is your calibration?
This question is very good.
How do we define our so-called alertness?
I'm going to talk about it next.
Because we think alertness is related to your reaction time.
So we use reaction time
to give us an objective way of measuring.
Just like you said,
using the eyes or the way of subject return.
The part of the eyes is that
the movement of the eyes is also a physiological signal.
So whether he can react directly to this behavior
is another experiment.
His role is the same as the brain wave.
It just depends on which physiological signal
can make it easier for us to be more accurate
to determine whether it is alert or not.
Subject report is a subjective assessment.
Subjective assessment will have some deviations.
That is to say, the word that the subject reported
is not very objective
to express the state he just experienced.
Many researchers think
a more objective way of judging
is to look at his reaction time.
Next, I will talk about
how we measure brain waves
and at the same time measure his reaction time.
And how to define it.
Finally, I will talk about
how to define alertness.
Does this answer your question?
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
I will talk about our experiment
and how to get the data we want.
We put the subject in a simulated driving car.
The car has a 360-degree projection screen.
The car is on a dynamic platform.
We drive inside
to simulate the real driving situation.
This is a device in the brain center
of the University of Transportation,
the brain science center.
In this experiment,
we do a task to maintain the lane.
To maintain the lane,
the subject must maintain the car
on the lane.
The car will automatically make him turn left.
We force the subject to adjust
the direction of the car on a regular basis.
The scene is on a straight highway.
But the car will turn to the left
or to the right.
Not necessarily.
It will turn once every 6 to 10 seconds.
We see that the subject
feels that the car is turning to the left.
He moves the steering wheel
to guide the car.
We see when the subject
moves the steering wheel.
This is the reaction time.
Every 6 to 10 seconds,
we can measure the reaction time.
We hope that
from the brain wave before the lane,
we can predict
the reaction time.
This is the role of prediction.
Next, I will talk about
how to deal with the reaction time
and how to get
the alertness estimate.
As mentioned,
every 6 to 10 seconds,
we will have a response time sample.
On the y-axis,
I draw the response time.
I choose log.
On the horizontal axis,
I draw the time.
The unit is divided.
This is the length of the whole experiment.
The length of the experiment is not certain.
This is shorter.
It is only 45 minutes.
Most of the experiments
took more than an hour.
About an hour and a half.
We sometimes ask the same subject
to come back and do it.
We finally collected
Let me see.
There is nothing here.
We finally collected
more than 30 subjects.
There are 50 to 60 car experiments.
Let's talk about
every point here.
These are the RTs we just measured.
10 to the power of 0 is about 1 second.
When it wakes up,
in less than 1 second,
we can get the car back.
After a while,
the car is not in a good condition.
After the alertness starts to decline,
we will see some
longer reaction times.
In fact, the reaction is that
its alertness becomes worse.
We need to process this RT data.
Because RT is not a range.
Only one side has a range.
The other side has no range.
Let's make a regularization of it first.
Turn it into a value of 0 to 1.
The way to regularize it
is to use its cumulative distribution function.
Then map it to a value with a range.
Let's do a smoothing here.
For smoothing,
I use a 90-second moving window
to turn this
jumpy value
into a smoother value.
This is because
we only sample RT once every 6 to 10 seconds.
If you look at this data
with too high frequency,
it is more meaningless.
If we use a smoothing,
we can get rid of
some misanalysis of this data.
So we use this
alertness deficit index
as a ground truth
in our behavior.
Does anyone have any questions?
Let's assume that
RT directly reflects
the level of alertness of this person.
If RT is longer,
alertness should be one of the factors.
Yes.
So it depends on the design of the experiment.
Let's also assume that
the experiment design
only affects RT.
We try to eliminate
other factors that may affect RT.
Because similar experiments
will also be used
to study
mind-wandering.
Mind-wandering and alertness
are related,
but not exactly the same.
For example,
when your subject drives,
he starts to think about other things.
His RT becomes longer.
In your definition,
this is a lack of alertness.
Yes.
But for you,
it is acceptable.
So our alertness
is based on
the alertness defined by RT.
If the subject doesn't react,
like you said,
he may be thinking about other things.
Yes.
Of course,
the instruction of our experiment
is to teach them to focus.
Yes.
What we can do is only up to here.
Because I think this may affect
your EEG data in the future.
Imagine that
there are three reasons for his RT to become longer.
Yes.
Do you actually catch three patterns?
The three patterns are different.
For example,
when you train your data,
your accuracy will be lower.
Because your data
is not high enough.
Sometimes it may be because of A,
sometimes because of B,
sometimes because of C.
Yes.
So it's impossible to be completely accurate.
And like you just said,
mind-wandering,
we can't control it.
But for us,
when his RT becomes longer,
it's actually quite long.
For example, 5 seconds.
If he really thinks about other things for 5 seconds
and doesn't follow our instructions
to guide him,
I don't know what to do.
OK.
In terms of concept,
if you have a test...
But what we see is
that he really feels like he is dead.
Yes.
There may be some trials.
Like you said,
there may be other factors.
And then there are some
miscommunications on it.
This part can't be ruled out.
Yes.
OK.
In terms of concept,
if your test can separate
things that affect RT
from each other,
then you deal with these...
When you deal with this information,
you deal with it separately.
Your model will be cleaner.
Ideal situation.
Ideal situation.
But of course,
you can't cover so many different factors
at the same time.
Yes.
Yes.
In terms of brain science,
we often have this problem.
You can't control what the subject is thinking.
That's right.
Yes.
OK.
It's a bit awkward.
Actually, I have a different idea about this.
Yes.
If you want to throw this data
into machine learning,
if there are three reasons,
whether he wants to sleep
or he's thinking about something crazy,
the pattern recognition of your algorithm
may be persuaded to
identify three different reasons.
But for whatever reason,
it will indicate that
this person is now
lying and not paying attention.
Isn't that good?
That's possible.
So in the end,
in the end,
his algorithm can
be oriented for whatever reason.
It can prevent your RT from getting longer.
No, I think this time
we have to go back to the original question.
What do you want to detect?
Yes.
For example,
let's say you want to promote a policy.
What you want to know is
that in this case,
you want to avoid drowsy driving.
Yes, this whole thing
is set for drowsy driving.
But you later found that
the other important factor
that affects their driving
or the traffic situation
is mind wandering.
Even if you can
detect mind wandering at the same time,
but when you are making a policy,
these two are completely different things.
How do you avoid A and avoid B?
Completely different.
So in the end,
if it is from the point of view of brain science,
what we want to know is
what happened
during that period of time.
The reason I ask this question is like this.
Yes, but there may be
I think what you said is possible.
When machine learning is done,
it may be able to identify
all the patterns
as a lack of awareness.
This is also possible.
Yes.
So,
like what Yan-Yong mentioned,
if I use machine learning,
it will learn
the relationship between data.
Then you get
a whole thing
that affects RT.
I don't know what it is.
Yes.
Then,
in addition,
we have
just discussed
assuming that
some different cognitive phenomena
can be disassembled.
It can be seen independently.
Or there is some interaction between them.
If we want to
use our data
to disassemble
different cognitive states
and the impact on RT,
in fact,
there is no way to do it
with just one experiment.
It may still be necessary
to do different experiments
to estimate
which cognitive state
will affect RT.
Here,
our experiment
tries to say
that there is only one effect.
Try,
but can't guarantee.
If we say
in this trial,
for example,
90% of it
is as we imagined
because of
Drowsy.
Because we let him do it
after lunch.
Then we asked him to drive
that highway
in a full-time lab.
So we hope
to let him
take a nap in this way.
So at least
in this process,
it may be
closer to
what we hope
to trigger.
Is that OK?
OK.
My question has been answered.
OK.
Because this part is
I will talk about it later.
In fact, this is very troublesome.
Because many cognitive states
do not have
a good objective definition.
In the future,
I think
there are some
whether it is
brain interface
or cognitive science
to move forward.
In fact, this is a big problem.
OK.
Then I will continue to talk about my research.
OK.
Then,
just mentioned that
our brain waves
can be divided into
some features of different platforms.
So here is
some of my
processing
process
list it out.
Then EEG,
we will
do a
re-referencing
for different channels.
That is to say,
we will
we are taking
that
all channels
EEG of all channels
to reduce
their overall average.
This part
can remove
some impurities.
Then we do
bandpass filtering.
Because the brain wave
can measure to
EEG
is actually limited.
It is probably
energy below 50 Hz.
But there are some
low frequency fluctuations
may come from
some
moving around
or
it
device itself
caused noise.
So we will
use a
usually use 1 to 50 Hz
or almost this band
to put this
brain wave filter.
Then we get
something that
really like brain wave.
But there are still
a lot of artifacts.
Then we will
downsampling
is to reduce
our computing time.
Then we do
subbandpass filtering.
That is to say,
we divide the brain wave
into
brain waves of different platforms.
Just like the one
in front of you
is faster
and slower.
Then they are
from delta,
zeta, alpha
to beta brain waves.
Then we go
to its energy
and then
do
the same as we do
a smoothing.
That is,
corresponding to
the smoothing we just did,
we are now using
90-second
moving window
to make a
brain wave energy
characteristic
to do smoothing.
Then get our
data.
So we have
brain wave energy now.
Then we just
have an
alertness index.
So we
now take
these two things
to make a comparison.
Then this
every small picture
its Y
means
the energy of
EEG.
Then X
means
the alertness
index
just now.
So
X
to the right
is that
it
reacts slower and slower.
Then
Y
up
is that
EEG
the energy of that platform
is getting stronger and stronger.
So here are
delta, zeta, alpha, beta
different platforms.
Then we
then I put
a few channels
out.
There is a frontal
front
and then central.
Then
Z is the
midline part
is the middle
is the middle of the front
and then the middle of the
middle
parietal
middle
and then
the
back
the back
middle.
Then in
its own position
it
different platforms
and then
its
EEG energy
changes
with
some
relationships.
Like the delta part
it is a positive
like this 0.77
is a
related factor.
Yes,
like alpha
here we can see
it is a
negative
it is
negative
0.28
that is
become
when you
alertness
down
after
the
alpha
platform
will
decrease
and then
this part
first
the
situation
will be
different.
So we
here I
use a
related factor
a
distribution
map
to see
that
a certain
experiment
brain wave
with
the
relationship
of
alertness.
Here is
to show
its
related factors
with
color.
Red is
positive
and
green is
negative.
So this
picture
shows
this experiment
we got
the result of
brain wave
and alertness.
This
picture
will
change
with
time
and
with
different
people.
Here
I
will
talk
first.
