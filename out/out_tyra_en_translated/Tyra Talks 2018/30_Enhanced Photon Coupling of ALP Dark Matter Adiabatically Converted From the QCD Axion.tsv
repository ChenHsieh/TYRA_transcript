0	10000	Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's TAR Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.
10000	19000	I am very grateful to my good friend, He Shuyu, for being willing to give us this speech on the upcoming New Year's holiday.
19000	28000	First of all, let me introduce He Shuyu. He is currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at Tohoku University in Japan.
28000	37000	His field of study is mainly in the field of particle cosmology, and he is exploring how to understand the evolution of early universes from the perspective of particle interaction.
37000	45000	Most of his work is related to dark matter, and he did not mention it in the introduction he gave me.
45000	52000	But before he came, he was doing physics with Mr. He Xiaogang at NTU, so it is actually very related to his current research.
52000	57000	I have also had a few years of overlap with him in Caltech, where I am now, so we are very good friends.
57000	66000	His main research recently is Exxon. They think this is one of the most popular candidates for dark matter.
66000	69000	The topic he is going to talk to us about today is also related to Exxon.
69000	80000	His topic is Enhanced Photon Coupling of APL. APL is Exxon-like Particle, Dark Matter Adiabatically Converted from QCD Exxon.
80000	87000	A little reminder, if you want to applaud, remember to turn on the microphone so that our speakers can hear.
87000	91000	Let's applaud and welcome He Shuyu to give us today's speech.
92000	95000	OK, you can start now.
95000	98000	Is there a full screen now?
98000	100000	What do you mean by full screen?
100000	103000	I am recording a video here, so I have to press the full screen, right?
103000	105000	Is this OK?
105000	106000	Yes, I think this is OK.
106000	108000	OK, then I will start right away.
108000	113000	Zhang Yiyang has already introduced it to me, so I will talk about it directly.
114000	120000	The topic I want to talk about today is Exxon.
120000	125000	Exxon itself interacts with light.
125000	130000	The interaction between light and Exxon is very small.
130000	134000	In other words, we can't really detect it in the current experiment.
135000	143000	The main purpose of this work is to enhance the coupling with photons from a phenomenal point of view.
143000	153000	Our main method is to match the effect with the so-called MaxMixing of ALP.
153000	157000	I will talk about the rest of the details in the following slides.
157000	162000	Before that, I have to give you some preparation knowledge.
162000	164000	Maybe not everyone is familiar with Exxon.
164000	166000	Some people may not even know what DocuMator is.
166000	170000	So I will do some basic introduction in the front.
170000	172000	Then we will start directly.
172000	176000	The first thing you see now is the so-called example physical standard model.
176000	180000	Then we generally call it Standard Model.
180000	185000	Or SM, take the first English letter.
186000	188000	Basically, the standard model is very simple.
188000	189000	It is divided into two categories.
189000	191000	One is the so-called material.
191000	194000	The left side is the so-called material.
194000	197000	The right side is the so-called basic interaction.
197000	202000	The material is actually divided into two categories.
202000	204000	One is called quark.
204000	206000	The other is called hydrogen.
206000	209000	For example, everyone is more familiar with Electron.
209000	212000	It belongs to the category of hydrogen.
212000	216000	The other one may not be familiar to everyone.
216000	221000	But in fact, everyone is more familiar with it.
221000	222000	It is the so-called magnet.
222000	225000	Like a magnet, there is a so-called
225000	228000	You can see this U quark on the picture.
228000	231000	This up quark is composed of this down quark.
231000	233000	The same is true for neutrons.
233000	236000	So these are the more familiar particles.
236000	238000	Of course, there are other quarks.
239000	244000	This is a new example found later.
244000	247000	In addition to the material,
247000	249000	Of course, there is also the so-called interaction.
249000	252000	The interaction is basically divided into these categories.
252000	254000	The first one, everyone sees this G.
254000	256000	We call it Grouon.
256000	260000	It is a so-called strong interaction particle.
260000	261000	What about strong interaction?
261000	263000	We generally call it QCD.
263000	266000	That is, quantum quark dynamic.
266000	268000	We will see this word later.
268000	272000	Because this is related to the so-called CP problem we will discuss later.
272000	275000	The second one is the so-called electromagnetic effect.
275000	277000	This should be the most familiar to everyone.
277000	279000	Maybe from high school,
279000	282000	Even in everyday life, you can know
282000	284000	This interaction.
284000	287000	What about the electromagnetic effect of this magnet?
287000	290000	We use light to transmit.
291000	293000	The electromagnetic effect in our field
293000	295000	We like to call it QED.
295000	298000	That is, quantum electrodynamic.
298000	301000	In addition to these two effects, there is also the so-called weak effect.
301000	303000	The weak effect is generally used to describe
303000	308000	The so-called beta decay phenomenon.
311000	314000	Have you noticed that in addition to these interactions,
314000	316000	There is also an interaction
316000	318000	Not written on this table
318000	320000	The so-called gravitational effect
320000	322000	But because of the current standard model
322000	324000	I didn't include this gravity.
324000	326000	Because I didn't find the so-called gravity.
326000	328000	The so-called graviton is the gravity value.
328000	332000	It is not included in the standard model.
332000	336000	That may be something else that everyone may be familiar with.
336000	338000	but
338000	340000	This is the so-called Higgs particle.
340000	342000	What about this Higgs particle?
342000	344000	It should be 2012.
344000	346000	I remember when I was a substitute
346000	348000	Found this Higgs particle
348000	350000	Higgs particle is generally
350000	352000	The origin of this mass
352000	354000	Is the source of the value
354000	356000	What about my research today?
356000	358000	It has something to do with Higgs, but it doesn't have much to do with it.
358000	360000	I mainly focus on the so-called
360000	362000	This part of the skeleton
362000	364000	Because this skeleton will lead to
364000	366000	The so-called action problem
366000	368000	it is good
368000	370000	Of course, although
370000	372000	Although the quantum mechanics model is currently
372000	374000	It is very tested by the experiment.
374000	376000	I can't say it's perfect.
376000	378000	But at least most of the current
378000	380000	Some of the phenomena we see can be used
380000	382000	Use the particle physics standard model to explain
382000	384000	Of course, there are some shortcomings.
384000	386000	Because there are some problems
386000	388000	The standard model is incomprehensible
388000	390000	For example, the first so-called dark matter
390000	392000	I will introduce it later.
392000	394000	There is also the so-called strong CP problem.
394000	396000	This is what I translated directly.
396000	398000	Generally, we call it a strong CP problem.
398000	400000	There is also the so-called
400000	402000	There is also the so-called medium quality
402000	404000	For example, just inside this table
404000	406000	Did you see this green one?
406000	408000	The bottom three particles
408000	410000	This is the so-called neutrino
410000	412000	Because in neutrino
412000	414000	Because neutrino is in the standard model
414000	416000	It has no quality
416000	418000	But because through
418000	420000	We see this neutrino oscillation
420000	422000	This implies that neutrino must have quality
422000	424000	But the standard model
424000	426000	Our neutrino can't have quality
426000	428000	So this is also a standard model
428000	430000	There is also the so-called dark energy
430000	432000	Generally, this may be possible
432000	434000	Use the so-called cosmology constant to explain
434000	436000	There is also the so-called current gravity
436000	438000	Today my
438000	440000	The study is more related to the first
440000	442000	The so-called dark matter and this
442000	444000	This strong CP problem
444000	446000	Let's introduce the so-called dark matter first.
448000	450000	How do you know that there is a dark matter?
450000	452000	We can start with this
452000	454000	This so-called star rotation curve
454000	456000	Look at
456000	458000	This star rotation curve, I remember
458000	460000	It should be Rubin
460000	462000	Rubin said
462000	464000	He is a female scientist
464000	466000	But it seems to have passed away a few years ago
466000	468000	If I remember correctly
468000	470000	This star rotation is very simple
470000	472000	That is to say
472000	474000	We may have learned this Newton's law
474000	476000	So we can predict that a object
476000	478000	Just a planet
478000	480000	Do this to the solar system
480000	482000	If the shape
482000	484000	What about the speed of this shape?
484000	486000	It should be with the sun
486000	488000	Or the center of the star
488000	490000	What about this distance?
490000	492000	Yes, when it's far away
492000	494000	You should see this star
494000	496000	The speed changes with the distance
496000	498000	It should be this red picture on the picture
498000	500000	That is to say
500000	502000	If it's far away, it's the distance
502000	504000	If the center is far away, the speed should be going down
504000	506000	But what we see is not like this
506000	508000	What we see is this
508000	510000	The white part is
510000	512000	He is at speed
512000	514000	When it's far away, it's a constant
514000	516000	This is a mystery
516000	518000	This is the Newton's law
518000	520000	The gravity law to explain
520000	522000	Of course there are many
522000	524000	Ideas to deal with this problem
524000	526000	That
526000	528000	It's easier to say
528000	530000	Maybe there are some objects
530000	532000	We can't see it, but it will provide gravity
532000	534000	If you have additional gravity
534000	536000	You can explain this speed
536000	538000	Why is it still a constant far away?
538000	540000	Of course there are other theories
540000	542000	Like the so-called modified gravity
542000	544000	That is to say, Newton's law
544000	546000	It's not what we usually see
546000	548000	For example, FMA may have some corrections
548000	550000	That can also explain this
550000	552000	Star curve
552000	554000	So why is it that the object value
554000	556000	It's a little bit bigger
556000	558000	Because we have a lot of this
558000	560000	Astronomical evidence
560000	562000	I just looked at this picture and said that the upper left corner
562000	564000	This is the star curve you just talked about
564000	566000	In addition, there is also the so-called gravity
566000	568000	And this mirror seems to be wrong
568000	570000	That is to say
570000	572000	If there is a
572000	574000	Invisible object
574000	576000	Then it will provide gravity
576000	578000	If there is a
578000	580000	For example, the star is behind this
580000	582000	Invisible object
582000	584000	Because you know
584000	586000	According to the relativity theory
586000	588000	The light passes through a place where gravity is very strong
588000	590000	So this light
590000	592000	From behind this star
592000	594000	It will bend
594000	596000	Then let us see
596000	598000	It will be a circle
598000	600000	Instead of a point
600000	602000	This is the so-called gravitational effect
602000	604000	In addition, there is the so-called CMB spectrum
604000	606000	CMB is the so-called cosmic microwave background
606000	608000	radiation
608000	610000	It is a microcosmic microwave background
610000	612000	That is to say
612000	614000	If we assume that dark matter exists
614000	616000	At the same time, there is dark energy
616000	618000	We can
618000	620000	Use the cosmological model
620000	622000	To fit this so-called Park spectrum
622000	624000	You can see this picture
624000	626000	This black dot is a good fit
626000	628000	Of course, there are some parameters to adjust
628000	630000	But it is roughly
630000	632000	The cosmological model
632000	634000	Can also explain this Park spectrum
634000	636000	Then this
636000	638000	Must assume the existence of dark matter
638000	640000	The last more famous is the so-called
640000	642000	Bury cluster
642000	644000	The so-called Bury cluster is
644000	646000	When we find that the two clusters are contrasting
646000	648000	We can see this x-ray
648000	650000	This
650000	652000	That signal
652000	654000	Simply put, I found that in fact
654000	656000	In addition to
656000	658000	This visible part is what you just saw on the picture
658000	660000	This
660000	662000	The red and purple part we see
662000	664000	Part of it is that it goes straight through each other
664000	666000	And then there is no interaction
666000	668000	In fact, that can explain
668000	670000	It may be an evidence of dark matter
670000	672000	This phenomenon seems to be general
672000	674000	This correctional gravity seems to be
674000	676000	It's better to explain
676000	678000	So the last thing is dark matter
678000	680000	So we have a lot of evidence
680000	682000	Show the existence of dark matter
682000	684000	But I still believe that many people
684000	686000	To challenge the idea of ​​dark matter
686000	688000	At present, the mainstream still thinks
688000	690000	Dark matter is a more feasible
690000	692000	A way
692000	694000	it is good
694000	696000	This is the so-called Cosmic Pi
696000	698000	It is based on the so-called
698000	700000	The standard model of cosmology
700000	702000	We can measure this
702000	704000	Dark energy, dark matter
704000	706000	And the so-called Baryon, which is the so-called
706000	708000	Like the standard model just now
708000	710000	The table of particles
710000	712000	In this
712000	714000	The purple part is probably
714000	716000	If its effect can form a bond state
716000	718000	Then we can call this bond state
718000	720000	This Baryon
722000	724000	That is to say, we are currently
724000	726000	Except
726000	728000	For example, I currently see these stars in the universe
728000	730000	Most of them are
730000	732000	This Baryon and some
732000	734000	Electrons, some leptons
734000	736000	This one takes up only 5% of the universe's energy
736000	738000	Just very little
738000	740000	On the contrary, dark energy and dark matter
740000	742000	It takes up a very high proportion
742000	744000	Like this dark matter
744000	746000	It takes up about a quarter of the universe
746000	748000	Energy
748000	750000	Of course, today I will focus on
750000	752000	On this dark matter
752000	754000	What about dark energy
754000	756000	Generally, of course
756000	758000	Some people often use this
758000	760000	Cosmic parameter or some
760000	762000	The so-called quintessence
762000	764000	It seems to be called the fifth element
764000	766000	To explain
766000	768000	Why does dark energy exist?
768000	770000	That is to say, we have observed
770000	772000	This universe is accelerating expansion
772000	774000	If we assume this dark energy
774000	776000	Can explain this phenomenon very well
776000	778000	It seems to have won the Nobel Prize
778000	780000	A few years ago because someone observed
780000	782000	The accelerating expansion of the universe
782000	784000	And won the Nobel Prize
784000	786000	Of course we are familiar with this Baryon
786000	788000	There are some problems
788000	790000	Maybe you have heard of the so-called antimatter
790000	792000	The universe has so-called positive matter and antimatter
792000	794000	Why is there more positive matter in the universe?
794000	796000	Antimatter is less, this is also a problem
796000	798000	For example, why did I just leave this 5% positive matter?
798000	800000	This theoretical chemist
800000	802000	Still studying it
802000	804000	Anyway, today I will focus on
804000	806000	On this dark matter
808000	810000	Since we are studying dark matter
810000	812000	Of course we have to understand its nature
812000	814000	It has a few simple
814000	816000	Simple nature
816000	818000	The first one is because it is
818000	820000	It is invisible
820000	822000	That is, we just talked about
822000	824000	Neurotransmitter
824000	826000	Before we do this prediction
826000	828000	We did not realize that this dark matter exists
828000	830000	So it means that it is with our general battery
830000	832000	Batteries do not interact
832000	834000	It means that the dark matter
834000	836000	It is electromagnetic
836000	838000	In addition
838000	840000	Since it exists
840000	842000	It has existed until now
842000	844000	It means it is
844000	846000	Its lifespan is longer than that of the universe
846000	848000	So it has to be very stable
848000	850000	It is very easy to change
850000	852000	But it's not that it won't change
852000	854000	It changes very slowly
854000	856000	Because in fact, some astronomical phenomena
856000	858000	Can also be explained by dark matter
858000	860000	For example, dark matter can
860000	862000	Change into light
862000	864000	To explain
864000	866000	Unidentified signals
868000	870000	According to what I just said
870000	872000	This CMB and the so-called universe
872000	874000	Early nuclear fusion
874000	876000	Observation prediction
876000	878000	That is, it will not be like what we just said
878000	880000	Some
880000	882000	The substance composed of nucleus or neutrinos
882000	884000	It is a baryon
884000	886000	Matter
886000	888000	What about the last
888000	890000	If it is formed from a star structure
890000	892000	Its movement speed is probably moving
892000	894000	But its movement speed is not very fast
894000	896000	This is mainly because we observe this star structure
896000	898000	Formation to judge
898000	900000	That is, if
900000	902000	Because dark matter itself has quality
902000	904000	Its quality is very large
904000	906000	Of course it will be in the universe
906000	908000	Will have its own distribution
908000	910000	In other words, if it is dark matter
910000	912000	If it is in a place
912000	914000	If it moves very fast today
914000	916000	Then it is more dispersed
916000	918000	On the contrary, if it moves very slowly today
918000	920000	It is easier to gather in a certain place
920000	922000	If
922000	924000	If there is a lot of dark matter in a certain place
924000	926000	It means it will provide more gravity
926000	928000	That's the general so-called
928000	930000	These heavy materials are easier
930000	932000	Slightly attracted
932000	934000	Gathered in dark matter
934000	936000	This density is relatively high
936000	938000	Then gradually form stars
938000	940000	Then we currently see the universe
940000	942000	Are relatively close to the star structure
942000	944000	This implies that this
944000	946000	Dark matter
946000	948000	Its speed is much less than the speed of light
948000	950000	Of course there is also the so-called
950000	952000	Borrowing light
952000	954000	Just
954000	956000	Just
956000	958000	Very close to the speed of light
958000	960000	Of course there is a borrowing in the middle
960000	962000	Borrowing dark matter
962000	964000	I don't know how to say it in Chinese
964000	966000	Maybe it's called cold dark matter
966000	968000	In general, we study dark matter that is less than the speed of light
968000	970000	We call it cold dark matter
970000	972000	Is cold dark matter
972000	974000	What's next
974000	976000	Let's talk about a few possible dark matter candidates
976000	978000	We just talked about
978000	980000	Just introduce the nature of dark matter
980000	982000	Of course, if you think about it
982000	984000	What kind of particle is it
984000	986000	Of course there are a lot of models
986000	988000	I can only use English here
988000	990000	The first one is more popular
990000	992000	Is this so-called
992000	994000	Massive particle
994000	996000	The first one I just talked about is dark matter
996000	998000	Because it has to be with this
998000	1000000	General matter interaction is very weak
1000000	1002000	Otherwise we should be able to measure it easily
1002000	1004000	The other one is that it must provide
1004000	1006000	Very strong gravity
1006000	1008000	So it probably has to be a very heavy particle
1008000	1010000	So this so-called
1010000	1012000	Massive particle
1012000	1014000	Is more popular
1014000	1016000	Generally we call it WIMP
1016000	1018000	WIMP
1018000	1020000	WIMP also has a lot of options
1020000	1022000	It may be
1022000	1024000	A kind of Sushi particle
1024000	1026000	Sushi is translated into Chinese as super symmetry
1026000	1028000	It may be
1028000	1030000	The latest super symmetry
1030000	1032000	Super symmetry example
1032000	1034000	Like the so-called neutrino
1034000	1036000	It may also be the so-called
1036000	1038000	The latest one is called KK particles
1038000	1040000	KK this thing
1040000	1042000	Is related to this
1042000	1044000	Extra-dimensional model
1044000	1046000	But my topic today is not to discuss
1046000	1048000	The so-called WIMP
1048000	1050000	What I'm going to discuss today is the other candidates below
1050000	1052000	The first one, the so-called action
1052000	1054000	That Chinese
1054000	1056000	Maybe just turn it into the axis
1056000	1058000	It seems that there is no
1058000	1060000	May not be
1060000	1062000	Someone said that in the file
1062000	1064000	But I just turned it into an axis
1064000	1066000	Of course there are other candidates
1066000	1068000	Like the so-called standard neutrinos
1068000	1070000	Or the so-called SIMP
1070000	1072000	SIMP is the topic I studied a few years ago
1072000	1074000	This S is actually strongly
1074000	1076000	It is
1076000	1078000	It is different from this weakly
1078000	1080000	It is a strong massive particle
1080000	1082000	The work I did a few years ago
1082000	1084000	Is to combine this SIMP with neutrinos
1084000	1086000	I gave this speech at TERA last year
1086000	1088000	Today I will give another
1088000	1090000	Different theme is related to action
1092000	1094000	How about this WIMP
1094000	1096000	How to detect it? I think this
1096000	1098000	Maybe Zhang Yong is more familiar
1098000	1100000	He may have a few speeches before
1100000	1102000	Related to this WIMP
1102000	1104000	Experiment
1104000	1106000	Today I will focus on this WIMP experiment
1106000	1108000	I will mention a little later
1108000	1110000	How do we use experiments to detect this action
1110000	1112000	it is good
1112000	1114000	Then
1114000	1116000	Enter the topic behind me
1116000	1118000	Because I was probably in the first 20 pages
1118000	1120000	Is to do some basic introduction
1120000	1122000	What about the back?
1122000	1124000	It's basically what I said before
1124000	1126000	So basically it's more difficult
1126000	1128000	More mathematical
1128000	1130000	It's hard to understand
1130000	1132000	This is my last slide
1132000	1134000	To explain the so-called strong CP problem
1134000	1136000	Before
1136000	1138000	Some
1138000	1140000	Terminology
1140000	1142000	So
1142000	1144000	What I'm talking about here is the so-called symmetry
1144000	1146000	The first P
1146000	1148000	We call it parity
1148000	1150000	So-called mirror symmetry
1150000	1152000	Everyone may be familiar with this
1152000	1154000	If you look at it from a mathematical point of view
1154000	1156000	For example, put x into negative x
1156000	1158000	Put a negative sign
1158000	1160000	Then we call it mirror symmetry
1160000	1162000	In fact, for a long time, physicists believe
1162000	1164000	All physical laws should be mirror symmetry
1164000	1166000	Of course, this law
1166000	1168000	Of course, it should be known
1168000	1170000	Yang and Li
1170000	1172000	Found that our universe is
1172000	1174000	Irregular
1174000	1176000	Mirror symmetry is not a good symmetry
1176000	1178000	Should not
1178000	1180000	Not a good symmetry
1180000	1182000	It's not a symmetry in our nature
1182000	1184000	For example, I just talked about this
1184000	1186000	In our standard model, this has a negative effect
1186000	1188000	The negative effect itself
1188000	1190000	This interaction is valid
1190000	1192000	This parity symmetry
1192000	1194000	Okay, the second one is the so-called
1194000	1196000	Charge conjugation
1196000	1198000	We use C to represent that it is
1198000	1200000	The Chinese text should be translated directly
1200000	1202000	The reason is quite simple
1202000	1204000	It is so-called the opposite of this electric
1204000	1206000	But the quality does not change
1206000	1208000	So just inside the table, for example, electron
1208000	1210000	We know that electron itself also has an antimatter
1210000	1212000	It's called positron
1212000	1214000	The charge itself
1214000	1216000	The same direction but the opposite
1216000	1218000	So we can simply say we can do
1218000	1220000	Charge conjugation
1222000	1224000	Did you hear it?
1226000	1228000	Did you hear it?
1232000	1234000	My head didn't jump out, sorry
1234000	1236000	Then we can do a power equation
1238000	1240000	Change its electric
1240000	1242000	In fact, we found that
1242000	1244000	C is not a good symmetry
1246000	1248000	Then there is the so-called time reversal
1248000	1250000	It's actually very similar to this
1250000	1252000	Basically, you change the direction of time
1252000	1254000	Theoretically, it is to change T to T
1256000	1258000	Then I just talked about
1258000	1260000	P is not symmetrical, C is not symmetrical
1262000	1264000	Then you will think about some strange symmetries
1264000	1266000	So someone considers whether C and P are symmetrical
1266000	1268000	Even a theory
1268000	1270000	Don't just do P conversion
1270000	1272000	You also do C conversion, then we call C and P symmetrical
1272000	1274000	That's the same for a while
1274000	1276000	After Yang Zhengning found that P is not symmetrical
1276000	1278000	We think that C and P are very good symmetries
1278000	1280000	Yes, then later
1280000	1282000	In this so-called
1282000	1284000	The decay
1284000	1286000	We found that C and P are not symmetrical
1288000	1290000	This is also a Nobel Prize
1292000	1294000	So our conclusion is that
1294000	1296000	C and P and T and C and P
1296000	1298000	C and P are not symmetrical
1298000	1300000	Then we can go further
1300000	1302000	For example, C and P and T are not symmetrical
1302000	1304000	So far
1304000	1306000	The answer is
1306000	1308000	Because I have not found that C and P are symmetrical
1308000	1310000	Destroy this phenomenon
1310000	1312000	Unless we measure this
1312000	1314000	The quality of antimatter and real matter is different
1314000	1316000	Otherwise our current
1316000	1318000	The conclusion is that C and P are very good
1318000	1320000	This symmetry
1320000	1322000	Anyway
1322000	1324000	My conclusion here is that
1324000	1326000	C and P are not symmetrical
1326000	1328000	OK, so far there is no problem
1328000	1330000	Can ask first
1330000	1332000	Have it
1336000	1338000	Or do you understand
1338000	1340000	If you have a question
1340000	1342000	Remember to turn on the microphone
1342000	1344000	Otherwise you may talk for a long time
1344000	1346000	I found that I did not turn on the microphone
1348000	1350000	It seems that everyone understands
1350000	1352000	OK
1352000	1354000	I want to ask
1356000	1358000	So here
1358000	1360000	Can mention a little bit
1360000	1362000	Verify it separately
1362000	1364000	Symmetry and asymmetry
1364000	1366000	What is it
1366000	1368000	That's it
1370000	1372000	I am not
1372000	1374000	For example, you can go to this
1374000	1376000	Wu Dayou is doing this
1376000	1378000	He should be doing
1378000	1380000	Wu Jianxiong
1380000	1382000	Wu Jianxiong
1382000	1384000	He is a female scientist
1384000	1386000	Measure this
1386000	1388000	This is the beta decay phenomenon
1388000	1390000	Yes
1390000	1392000	Found that this is not asymmetric
1392000	1394000	If you look up this in Wikipedia
1394000	1396000	Asymmetry should mention this experiment
1396000	1398000	What about C and P
1398000	1400000	C and P
1400000	1402000	You can take the so-called C and P
1402000	1404000	You can also find it online
1404000	1406000	Their experiment
1406000	1408000	He found this
1408000	1410000	Kaon
1410000	1412000	Charge Kaon
1412000	1414000	There are several types of Kaon
1414000	1416000	Long Life
1416000	1418000	Long Life
1418000	1420000	Joe Life
1420000	1422000	Because there are some asymmetry
1422000	1424000	Long Life and Joe Life
1424000	1426000	Maybe two lights or three lights
1426000	1428000	I am two lights and three lights
1428000	1430000	This
1430000	1432000	Final state
1432000	1434000	Wu Jianxiong should be
1434000	1436000	C and P
1436000	1438000	Final state C and P
1438000	1440000	C and P are different
1440000	1442000	If your final state is two lights or three lights
1442000	1444000	I found that this KL
1444000	1446000	I forgot if it was KL
1446000	1448000	It should be KL
1448000	1450000	Long Life
1450000	1452000	If you wait long enough
1452000	1454000	It will actually decay
1454000	1456000	One final state
1456000	1458000	I forgot if it was two lights or three lights
1458000	1460000	Check this detail
1460000	1462000	Zhang Yong, do you remember
1462000	1464000	I don't remember
1464000	1466000	When I was doing
1466000	1468000	We are doing B behind me
1468000	1470000	I know you are doing B
1470000	1472000	Anyway, this has nothing to do with Kaon
1472000	1474000	Anyway, this has nothing to do with Kaon
1474000	1476000	I've seen the story before
1476000	1478000	But I didn't prepare this story today
1478000	1480000	Sorry
1480000	1482000	Is there any other questions?
1484000	1486000	If not, let's go straight to my research topic
1486000	1488000	Of course, the next step is more
1488000	1490000	English
1490000	1492000	More mathematical
1492000	1494000	it is good
1494000	1496000	Then I will directly cut the topic and talk about this so-called action
1496000	1498000	Especially
1498000	1500000	QCD action
1500000	1502000	So why
1502000	1504000	This idea
1504000	1506000	In other words, it comes from this
1506000	1508000	In QCD, we have this so-called strong CP problem
1508000	1510000	In other words, in QCD, we have this so-called strong CP problem
1510000	1512000	In other words, I just said
1512000	1514000	In the natural world, CP is not very symmetrical
1514000	1516000	In the natural world, CP is not very symmetrical
1516000	1518000	So mathematicians can write some
1518000	1520000	Destroy CP symmetry
1520000	1522000	The theory of interaction
1522000	1524000	There is a very complicated mathematical formula on the screen
1524000	1526000	There is a very complicated mathematical formula on the screen
1526000	1528000	It's called Lagrangian
1528000	1530000	It's called Lagrangian
1530000	1532000	In other words
1532000	1534000	Because CP is not symmetrical
1534000	1536000	Because CP is not symmetrical
1536000	1538000	So we can write this
1538000	1540000	In this strong effect
1540000	1542000	So we can write this
1542000	1544000	In our theory
1544000	1546000	It represents
1546000	1548000	This strong effect
1548000	1550000	This strong effect
1550000	1552000	Of course you can write this
1552000	1554000	There is no problem
1554000	1556000	But we found
1556000	1558000	If you go from here
1558000	1560000	This so-called Neutron EDM
1560000	1562000	EDM is called Electrodipole Moment
1562000	1564000	EDM is called Electrodipole Moment
1564000	1566000	It's a kind of
1566000	1568000	It's a kind of
1568000	1570000	We found from the experiment
1570000	1572000	We found from the experiment
1572000	1574000	We found from the experiment
1574000	1576000	This interaction
1576000	1578000	There is a factor called strong CP phase
1578000	1580000	This theta must be less than 10
1580000	1582000	This theta must be less than 10
1582000	1584000	Of course this number
1584000	1586000	To some physics
1586000	1588000	It's very uncomfortable
1588000	1590000	We naturally have this
1590000	1592000	It's called
1592000	1594000	It's called Neutron
1594000	1596000	It's called Neutron
1596000	1598000	It may be 0.1 or
1598000	1600000	It may be 0.1 or
1600000	1602000	It may be 0.1 or
1602000	1604000	10 to the negative 10 is a little bit small
1604000	1606000	10 to the negative 10 or negative 10
1606000	1608000	Is a little bit
1608000	1610000	Is a little bit
1610000	1612000	Of course you can't say
1612000	1614000	The natural world
1614000	1616000	You can choose such a small number
1616000	1618000	Who knows
1618000	1620000	You don't know how the natural world works
1620000	1622000	But from the view of the theoretical student
1622000	1624000	This theta term has two
1624000	1626000	Of course I won't
1626000	1628000	I won't introduce this contribution
1628000	1630000	Basically it has two
1630000	1632000	Physics
1632000	1634000	It's made up of completely different physics
1634000	1636000	Then this is a problem
1636000	1638000	That is to say, if you look at this theta
1638000	1640000	Equals theta 0 plus this
1640000	1642000	What is this determining thing
1642000	1644000	Because the two of them are different physics
1644000	1646000	Then ask why these two
1646000	1648000	Different physics
1648000	1650000	They will be so good
1650000	1652000	Cancel to each other
1652000	1654000	That's a very
1654000	1656000	It's a problem
1656000	1658000	Basically it's a reaction
1658000	1660000	That is to say, why is this theta so small
1660000	1662000	Then give everyone a little feeling
1662000	1664000	For example, you can imagine that this
1664000	1666000	This theta is
1666000	1668000	The simple mathematician on the right side of the screen
1668000	1670000	It may be this 10 to the negative 11
1670000	1672000	Then it will be equal to
1672000	1674000	For example, if this theta is set to 1
1674000	1676000	Then the second one behind this
1676000	1678000	It may be 0.999999
1678000	1680000	Then you become
1680000	1682000	This
1682000	1684000	Just this two different physics
1684000	1686000	It's just a little bit
1686000	1688000	It's a fine-tuning
1688000	1690000	Then this is in our physics
1690000	1692000	I don't like it
1692000	1694000	So we don't need to solve this problem
1694000	1696000	Then this is the so-called strong CP problem
1696000	1698000	That
1698000	1700000	Of course, there are many theories to explain this strong CP problem
1700000	1702000	Then the most popular at the moment
1702000	1704000	The so-called introduction
1704000	1706000	The so-called action
1706000	1708000	Then this general mechanism is called
1708000	1710000	Perseverance mechanism
1710000	1712000	Or abbreviated as PQ mechanism
1712000	1714000	Then in this mechanism
1714000	1716000	The so-called strong CP phase
1716000	1718000	It's not a simple
1718000	1720000	Parameter
1720000	1722000	It is a dynamic parameter
1722000	1724000	Then I don't do too much here
1724000	1726000	This
1726000	1728000	This action theory introduction
1728000	1730000	I just introduced it directly
1730000	1732000	For example, in the mathematical world just now
1732000	1734000	We only have a theta term
1734000	1736000	But I added another one
1736000	1738000	There is a second one in this box
1738000	1740000	Then there is a big A divided by a FA
1740000	1742000	Then this A is the so-called action
1744000	1746000	A constant
1746000	1748000	It has something to do with this
1748000	1750000	A symmetry destruction
1750000	1752000	Maybe you don't need to know this
1752000	1754000	This detail you know this is a
1754000	1756000	A constant that is very important
1756000	1758000	Because it will be with us later
1758000	1760000	This photon has something to do with this action
1760000	1762000	Good
1762000	1764000	What about the introduction of this action?
1764000	1766000	When we do the calculation, we will find that it is at a very high temperature
1766000	1768000	Just look at this picture
1768000	1770000	The picture below
1770000	1772000	When you are at a very high temperature
1772000	1774000	This T represents this temperature
1774000	1776000	The temperature is far greater than this
1776000	1778000	QCD
1778000	1780000	When this QCD action
1780000	1782000	This QCD action
1782000	1784000	Its potential
1784000	1786000	Its potential is very flat
1786000	1788000	When its temperature is very low
1788000	1790000	Through this QCD
1790000	1792000	What is called non-circulation
1792000	1794000	Non-circulation effect
1794000	1796000	Its potential will be raised
1796000	1798000	So it means that at the beginning
1798000	1800000	It may be sitting well
1800000	1802000	This red part
1802000	1804000	After it is raised, it starts to fall
1804000	1806000	Falling in this blue part
1806000	1808000	This potential
1808000	1810000	The smallest part
1810000	1812000	Potential minima
1812000	1814000	Just in this position
1814000	1816000	Just put this theta
1816000	1818000	Cancel it
1818000	1820000	Theta plus A
1820000	1822000	Define it as theta effective
1822000	1824000	Just in this minima
1824000	1826000	Theta effective will be equal to zero
1826000	1828000	This theta will be
1828000	1830000	This action
1830000	1832000	Generally called vacuum expectation value
1832000	1834000	Will cancel it
1834000	1836000	So this theta effective
1836000	1838000	Is a very small number
1838000	1840000	That can explain why
1840000	1842000	We observe that this theta
1842000	1844000	Is the negative ten of the original value
1844000	1846000	That is, it is almost equal to zero
1846000	1848000	Yes, so action
1848000	1850000	It actually
1850000	1852000	The appearance is to explain this
1852000	1854000	Strong C problem
1854000	1856000	This is the so-called
1856000	1858000	This part
1858000	1860000	Is there any problem with this?
1862000	1864000	Still OK
1866000	1868000	Understand
1870000	1872000	Anyway, it is to introduce some things
1872000	1874000	Then cancel some things
1874000	1876000	That's it
1876000	1878000	The first one is canceled, so we don't see it in practice
1878000	1880000	Then I will talk about
1880000	1882000	Some action properties
1882000	1884000	We just said why
1884000	1886000	That
1886000	1888000	The same as I just said
1888000	1890000	It will pass through this QCD
1890000	1892000	Non-circulation
1892000	1894000	Non-circulation is called non-perturbative
1894000	1896000	The effect can be calculated
1896000	1898000	Just look at the formula
1898000	1900000	This T is the temperature
1900000	1902000	If the temperature is very high
1902000	1904000	This ma represents
1904000	1906000	The mass of the action
1906000	1908000	It will go to zero when the temperature is very high
1908000	1910000	When the temperature is very low
1910000	1912000	It will approach a constant
1912000	1914000	This constant is called zero temperature mass of QCD action
1914000	1916000	It can also be calculated
1918000	1920000	As long as you know
1920000	1922000	As long as you know that QCD is at a very high temperature
1922000	1924000	It is non-circulation
1924000	1926000	And when it is at a very low temperature
1926000	1928000	It is a mass
1928000	1930000	Its mass relationship is at a very low temperature
1930000	1932000	It has this relation
1932000	1934000	It can be connected to the constant I just mentioned
1934000	1936000	No connection
1936000	1938000	There is a unit on the picture here
1938000	1940000	I don't know if you are familiar with this
1940000	1942000	There should be
1942000	1944000	This is the so-called electron volt
1944000	1946000	We are talking about 1.6 times 10
1946000	1948000	Minus 19
1948000	1950000	Yes
1950000	1952000	Why this is the mass
1952000	1954000	Then you can use energy to represent
1954000	1956000	That's because we're in high energy
1956000	1958000	We are used to making this light speed into 1
1958000	1960000	In other words, you can say that energy is actually the mass
1960000	1962000	OK
1962000	1964000	So we use this unit to represent the mass
1964000	1966000	It's called EV
1966000	1968000	This GV is convenient
1968000	1970000	It's 10 to the power of 9
1970000	1972000	But there are other abbreviations
1972000	1974000	Such as NEV or KEV
1974000	1976000	If you do experiments
1976000	1978000	You should be familiar with this
1978000	1980000	This abbreviation
1980000	1982000	G or
1982000	1984000	KEV or GV
1984000	1986000	Anyway, QCD action
1986000	1988000	Its mass
1988000	1990000	It has something to do with the constant
1990000	1992000	It has something to do with the constant
1992000	1994000	Let me tell you in advance
1994000	1996000	We will mention a kind of action light particle
1996000	1998000	It's a kind of light particle
1998000	2000000	It is not satisfied with the above relationship
2000000	2002000	So that means
2002000	2004000	Its quality and its
2004000	2006000	Its decay constant
2006000	2008000	It has nothing to do with
2008000	2010000	They are two free parameters
2010000	2012000	Yes
2012000	2014000	Then there will be some
2014000	2016000	There are some operations
2016000	2018000	Because it is after all two free parameters
2018000	2020000	Anyway
2020000	2022000	What's more special
2022000	2024000	We found that this QCD action
2024000	2026000	It can not only solve
2026000	2028000	Strong C problem
2028000	2030000	It is also a good dark matter candidate
2030000	2032000	That is to say, I just said
2032000	2034000	QCD action
2034000	2036000	When it is very low temperature, it will form a potential
2036000	2038000	It just happens to be echoing the potential
2038000	2040000	And just this phenomenon
2040000	2042000	What about this model
2042000	2044000	We can
2044000	2046000	See it as a dark matter
2046000	2048000	A model
2048000	2050000	Yes
2050000	2052000	Then we can
2052000	2054000	Can I ask a question
2054000	2056000	Please ask
2056000	2058000	You just said the temperature in the front page
2058000	2060000	Is it the temperature of the universe
2060000	2062000	After the particle
2062000	2064000	It's Proxima
2064000	2066000	It's the radiation temperature
2066000	2068000	Then when is it in the universe
2068000	2070000	Will
2070000	2072000	Will reach the TQCD
2072000	2074000	Hello
2074000	2076000	How much will the universe temperature reach
2076000	2078000	That's the TQCD
2078000	2080000	You mean Lambda QCD
2080000	2082000	Lambda QCD
2082000	2084000	TQCD is the same as Lambda QCD
2084000	2086000	It's almost the same
2086000	2088000	Maybe a few times
2088000	2090000	TQCD
2090000	2092000	Let me see if I remember correctly
2092000	2094000	More than 100 MeV
2094000	2096000	Because QCD
2096000	2098000	The scale of QCD is probably
2098000	2100000	Hundreds of MeV
2100000	2102000	It's probably a value
2102000	2104000	Yes
2104000	2106000	So TQCD
2106000	2108000	Is it before inflation
2108000	2110000	After
2110000	2112000	When it's low temperature
2112000	2114000	Is inflation high
2114000	2116000	Is it before CMB
2118000	2120000	CMB
2120000	2122000	Should be earlier
2124000	2126000	CMB
2126000	2128000	You have to have CMB
2128000	2130000	Let me see
2130000	2132000	What is the temperature of CMB
2132000	2134000	It should be
2134000	2136000	Are you doing astronomy
2136000	2138000	Do you remember
2138000	2140000	I want to think about it
2140000	2142000	What is the temperature
2142000	2144000	CMB temperature
2144000	2146000	I don't remember
2146000	2148000	It should be a little later
2148000	2150000	Should
2150000	2152000	If you want to type EGV
2152000	2154000	Corresponds to how much temperature
2154000	2156000	I should check this
2156000	2158000	OK
2158000	2160000	Thank you
2160000	2162000	Ok
2162000	2164000	The formula above
2164000	2166000	Of course you don't have to remember it
2166000	2168000	This is us
2168000	2170000	Since we theorize that this action
2170000	2172000	It can form this atocometer when it vibrates
2172000	2174000	Then we can estimate this
2174000	2176000	Its energy density
2176000	2178000	What is the energy density
2178000	2180000	Then you can use this formula to represent
2180000	2182000	As long as you know
2182000	2184000	Omega A in this equation
2184000	2186000	It's this Omega A again
2186000	2188000	It represents the energy density of action
2188000	2190000	So far we have observed that the energy density
2190000	2192000	It's about 0.1
2192000	2194000	Or 0.12
2194000	2196000	So that means this FA
2196000	2198000	This formula is FA
2198000	2200000	Roughly it's about
2200000	2202000	10 to the 12th square
2202000	2204000	GEV
2204000	2206000	Basically it can't change
2206000	2208000	OK
2208000	2210000	This formula
2210000	2212000	Is the position of this action
2212000	2214000	So of course you can
2214000	2216000	You can adjust this formula
2216000	2218000	And then you change this FA
2218000	2220000	But that's more fine-tuning
2220000	2222000	For example, you can assume that if
2222000	2224000	The universe
2224000	2226000	This action
2226000	2228000	At the beginning of the vibration
2228000	2230000	It's very close to this
2230000	2232000	Top of this
2232000	2234000	Does that mean it will slide slower
2234000	2236000	If number 5 slides slower
2236000	2238000	Its energy density will be higher
2238000	2240000	So this theory
2240000	2242000	If theta is close to pi
2242000	2244000	This will contribute a lot
2244000	2246000	Very big
2246000	2248000	In this case, this FA
2248000	2250000	You can make it smaller
2250000	2252000	Yes, that's a little bit more fine-tuning
2252000	2254000	But we don't like it
2254000	2256000	So generally this theta initial
2256000	2258000	We won't assume it's that big
2258000	2260000	Generally speaking, this FA
2260000	2262000	It's close to 10 to the 12th square
2262000	2264000	GEV
2264000	2266000	Then it can explain this wind speed
2266000	2268000	About 0.1
2268000	2270000	OK
2270000	2272000	Then let's talk about this action
2272000	2274000	Why can't we see photons
2274000	2276000	Generally the same is through this interaction
2276000	2278000	To describe
2278000	2280000	Just put this on
2280000	2282000	It should be the left index of the first line
2282000	2284000	It's LA Gamma Gamma
2284000	2286000	Yes, this F is represented by light
2286000	2288000	Yes, you don't have to remember this
2288000	2290000	If it's not a theory
2290000	2292000	You just need to know that this represents
2292000	2294000	Action and two
2294000	2296000	The interaction of light
2296000	2298000	What about the intensity of this interaction
2298000	2300000	We can use this
2300000	2302000	GA Gamma Gamma
2302000	2304000	We call this GA Gamma Gamma
2304000	2306000	Action Photon Coupling
2306000	2308000	Then we can find out
2308000	2310000	This coupling will be with Gamma
2310000	2312000	This decay constant
2312000	2314000	It's a contrast
2314000	2316000	That is to say, if the decay constant is bigger
2316000	2318000	This coupling is smaller
2318000	2320000	OK
2320000	2322000	The one on the bottom right is the so-called
2322000	2324000	It's used to describe this action
2324000	2326000	How to interact with the light
2326000	2328000	That's usually through this
2328000	2330000	Loop of loop
2330000	2332000	Induce out
2332000	2334000	Of course you don't need to know this detail
2334000	2336000	Sorry
2336000	2338000	If you want to
2338000	2340000	That is to say, I just said
2340000	2342000	QCD action
2342000	2344000	Can be done
2344000	2346000	So if you want to meet this
2346000	2348000	We observe this
2348000	2350000	What about the energy density
2350000	2352000	This FA
2352000	2354000	12 square GV
2354000	2356000	Then you bring it into this formula
2356000	2358000	You will find this A Gamma Gamma
2358000	2360000	It should be about
2360000	2362000	10 to the negative 10th square
2362000	2364000	GV inverse
2364000	2366000	That's great
2366000	2368000	Because this coupling is small
2368000	2370000	QCD action
2370000	2372000	It won't be easy to change into light
2372000	2374000	So it's not stable
2374000	2376000	So it's in line with what we just said
2376000	2378000	One of the properties of dark matter
2378000	2380000	That's because
2380000	2382000	This A Gamma Gamma is very small
2382000	2384000	So in practice
2384000	2386000	It's not easy to measure it
2386000	2388000	Of course we can do it again
2388000	2390000	We can introduce this experiment in the future
2390000	2392000	Of course there is a chance
2392000	2394000	it is good
2394000	2396000	So let me show you this experiment
2396000	2398000	That's a few
2398000	2400000	Measurement action
2400000	2402000	This experiment
2402000	2404000	This picture was made by my boss
2404000	2406000	Because it's too beautiful
2406000	2408000	There are several types
2408000	2410000	There are indirect and non-indirect
2410000	2412000	My research
2412000	2414000	What about my theory
2414000	2416000	I will focus on this
2416000	2418000	Direct part
2418000	2420000	You can see it on the picture
2420000	2422000	Related words
2422000	2424000	Like the middle
2424000	2426000	The one on the second row in the middle
2426000	2428000	This solar action
2428000	2430000	This solar action
2430000	2432000	Because action will work with light
2432000	2434000	So we can predict
2434000	2436000	It may be from this solar system
2436000	2438000	Then we can use
2438000	2440000	Maybe it's a telescope
2440000	2442000	There is a so-called
2442000	2444000	Or the second one
2444000	2446000	Or these experiments
2446000	2448000	Then there is the so-called
2448000	2450000	Cosmic
2450000	2452000	Cosmological action
2452000	2454000	Cosmic action is what we just said
2454000	2456000	It may be from the early universe
2456000	2458000	These actions
2458000	2460000	Then we can use
2460000	2462000	To measure WIMP
2462000	2464000	Let's say
2464000	2466000	It can work with these nuclear principles
2466000	2468000	Then we will measure these
2468000	2470000	For example
2470000	2472000	Because
2472000	2474000	If the nuclear principle works with this action
2474000	2476000	It may rebound
2476000	2478000	There will be some signals
2478000	2480000	Then we can measure
2480000	2482000	Related to these experiments
2482000	2484000	Like the so-called
2484000	2486000	Or the Casper
2486000	2488000	On the table
2488000	2490000	Directly listed
2490000	2492000	This is the experimental picture
2492000	2494000	Of course it's a bit complicated
2494000	2496000	You can see this
2496000	2498000	This gray band
2498000	2500000	It is the so-called QCD action
2500000	2502000	If you want to satisfy it as a document
2502000	2504000	Then it has to be painted
2504000	2506000	This red point
2506000	2508000	So you can see it
2508000	2510000	Quite close to the so-called
2510000	2512000	ADMS sensitivity
2512000	2514000	So there is a chance in the future
2514000	2516000	ADMS
2516000	2518000	Perspective
2518000	2520000	If they can
2520000	2522000	Improve this sensitivity
2522000	2524000	Maybe you can measure this
2524000	2526000	Document
2526000	2528000	Of course there are other experiments
2528000	2530000	Like the one I just mentioned
2530000	2532000	Measure solar action
2532000	2534000	Its current upper bound is a bit higher
2534000	2536000	So in the future
2536000	2538000	They can lower the upper bound
2538000	2540000	Also have the opportunity
2540000	2542000	To measure this QCD action
2542000	2544000	You may see
2544000	2546000	Another one
2546000	2548000	This brown
2548000	2550000	This brown band
2550000	2552000	This corresponds to the so-called ELF document
2552000	2554000	Let me go back here
2554000	2556000	What is ELF document
2556000	2558000	The same thing
2558000	2560000	You can go back to the previous one
2560000	2562000	There is a bunch of
2562000	2564000	Constraint
2564000	2566000	I gave a talk a while ago
2566000	2568000	I can't answer the question
2568000	2570000	Is it a problem of experiment?
2570000	2572000	No, it's like this
2572000	2574000	Because I am
2574000	2576000	Thermorelic
2576000	2578000	Then your axiom is not thermorelic
2578000	2580000	Then there is a person who does astronomy
2580000	2582000	He asked me
2582000	2584000	Now this kind of axiom
2584000	2586000	Or ELF
2586000	2588000	It's actually a
2588000	2590000	The relationship between the measurement and the photon coupling
2590000	2592000	And its mass
2592000	2594000	Then it's a bit like a positive relationship
2594000	2596000	A value relationship
2596000	2598000	It can be extended indefinitely
2598000	2600000	But how heavy can it be
2600000	2602000	If it is a document
2602000	2604000	It can be very heavy
2604000	2606000	Even the weight of a moon
2606000	2608000	Then my idea is
2608000	2610000	It's just very heavy
2610000	2612000	If it's very heavy, it's very big
2612000	2614000	Then we should have seen it earlier
2614000	2616000	But I got an answer
2616000	2618000	It seems to be
2618000	2620000	Large-scale structure
2620000	2622000	There is a constraint
2622000	2624000	Thermorelic can't be light
2624000	2626000	Or non-thermal can't be heavy
2626000	2628000	This is actually
2628000	2630000	I know a little
2630000	2632000	You see this in the picture
2632000	2634000	The quality of the axiom
2634000	2636000	I just drew this range
2636000	2638000	In fact
2638000	2640000	You can't be too light
2640000	2642000	That is, its current lower bound seems to be
2642000	2644000	Negative 22eV
2644000	2646000	This will correspond to
2646000	2648000	The so-called Fuzzy document
2648000	2650000	Fuzzy document
2650000	2652000	Fuzzy document
2652000	2654000	This seems to be done by some groups in Taiwan University
2654000	2656000	In other words, if you
2656000	2658000	If the document is too light
2658000	2660000	What to do with this
2660000	2662000	It's not easy, this material wave is too long
2662000	2664000	That is, you will become
2664000	2666000	The magnitude of the universe
2666000	2668000	These quantum effects came out
2668000	2670000	Then they do astronomy
2670000	2672000	It seems to see these
2672000	2674000	Some small-scale
2674000	2676000	Differences
2676000	2678000	So if you
2678000	2680000	Some constraints
2680000	2682000	So this
2682000	2684000	Document can't be too light
2684000	2686000	Light to negative 22eV
2686000	2688000	It has some lower bound
2688000	2690000	But I don't really understand
2690000	2692000	Where is the upper bound of the axiom
2692000	2694000	Oh, I know, I see
2694000	2696000	Basically, as long as it exceeds 10
2696000	2698000	Negative 10.5
2698000	2700000	Negative 11
2700000	2702000	It's all ruled out
2702000	2704000	Cache
2704000	2706000	OK, I see
2706000	2708000	Of course you can lower
2708000	2710000	This can be very low
2710000	2712000	But as I said, it can't be too small
2712000	2714000	it is good
2714000	2716000	This is actually a very good question
2716000	2718000	Back to action
2718000	2720000	Elp
2720000	2722000	Originally from this
2722000	2724000	Theoretical theory
2724000	2726000	For example, we are in the theoretical theory
2726000	2728000	They predict a lot of action particles
2728000	2730000	Then we call these action particles
2730000	2732000	Action light particles
2732000	2734000	That's the same as taking this
2734000	2736000	Then I'm in my back pocket
2736000	2738000	I'll use this
2738000	2740000	代表
2740000	2742000	Its nature is exactly the same as this
2742000	2744000	Just say it
2744000	2746000	Because it has nothing to do with qcd
2746000	2748000	So its quality is not from qcd
2748000	2750000	It's from another
2750000	2752000	Like the so-called hidden qcd
2752000	2754000	I don't know how to say it
2754000	2756000	Hidden is
2756000	2758000	It's another qcd
2758000	2760000	Its quality is not direct from this
2760000	2762000	Our general standard model qcd
2762000	2764000	That's the same
2764000	2766000	It can't see the light
2766000	2768000	Then it can also be
2768000	2770000	This dark matter candidate
2770000	2772000	The formula is basically
2772000	2774000	Very similar to the qcd action
2774000	2776000	So basically it's exactly the same
2776000	2778000	It's exactly the same as qcd
2778000	2780000	The difference is that it
2780000	2782000	This is with this qcd
2782000	2784000	The effect has nothing to do with it
2784000	2786000	Ok
2786000	2787000	So basically I'm q
2787000	2788000	Elp's introduction is only one page
2788000	2790000	It's quite simple
2790000	2792000	Then we will calculate this
2792000	2794000	This one
2794000	2796000	Action with this photon coupling
2796000	2798000	Then I found that his
2798000	2800000	It must correspond to this on the map
2800000	2802000	This brown
2802000	2804000	This band
2804000	2806000	So obviously this brown
2806000	2808000	It's much smaller than this qcd
2808000	2810000	So of course we hope
2810000	2812000	If we don't see qcd action
2812000	2814000	Then there are some extra particles
2814000	2816000	We can measure
2816000	2818000	Because it has some motivation
2818000	2820000	But you have to believe
2820000	2822000	You have to believe that this theory is right
2822000	2824000	Of course
2824000	2826000	Of course it is
2826000	2828000	That is to say
2828000	2830000	That is to say you can
2830000	2832000	Allow this particle to exist
2832000	2834000	OK
2834000	2836000	Is there a problem here?
2836000	2838000	If not, I will
2838000	2840000	In
2840000	2842000	So far, it's basically
2842000	2844000	Action's introduction
2844000	2846000	That is to say, this thing is basically
2846000	2848000	Everyone knows
2848000	2850000	Everyone knows
2850000	2852000	So i
2852000	2854000	I will start my research later
2854000	2856000	How to connect action
2856000	2858000	qcd action with qcd
2858000	2860000	qcd action
2860000	2862000	The relationship between qcd and qcd
2862000	2864000	This is what I will talk about later
2864000	2866000	Before I finish
2866000	2868000	Everyone may have a question
2868000	2870000	Why is it called action?
2870000	2872000	This is a very interesting story
2872000	2874000	Does anyone know?
2878000	2880000	I'm not familiar with action
2880000	2882000	In fact, I also
2882000	2884000	I'll check it out later
2884000	2886000	Because it's really weird
2886000	2888000	Basically, this story is very simple
2888000	2890000	Maybe everyone is watching me
2892000	2894000	My friend
2894000	2896000	Huang Zhong helped me make a promotional poster
2896000	2898000	He put a poster
2898000	2900000	Something like a drink
2900000	2902000	That's not a drink
2902000	2904000	That is a cleaner
2904000	2906000	Why is it called action?
2906000	2908000	This has a lot to do with this cleaner
2908000	2910000	That is to say the first
2910000	2912000	You can see this
2912000	2914000	I divided this action into two parts
2914000	2916000	The front is axi
2916000	2918000	That is to say
2918000	2920000	We just saw this
2920000	2922000	qcd
2922000	2924000	Why does it appear?
2924000	2926000	Mainly with us in theoretical
2926000	2928000	ActionCurrentAnomaly
2928000	2930000	Has a relationship
2932000	2934000	You just need to know
2934000	2936000	Connection with
2936000	2938000	ActionCurrent
2938000	2940000	You also know
2940000	2942000	Physics likes to put the name of Paracord
2942000	2944000	What is it called?
2944000	2946000	Or Positron
2946000	2948000	That's the end of ON, right?
2948000	2950000	So this
2950000	2952000	What about the Nobel Prize in 2004?
2952000	2954000	The Wheeljack
2954000	2956000	He is because of this so-called
2956000	2958000	Progressive Freedom
2958000	2960000	This is like
2960000	2962000	I just quoted his article
2962000	2964000	He said it directly
2964000	2966000	Maybe a few years ago he went to the supermarket
2966000	2968000	He saw this
2968000	2970000	Cleaner
2970000	2972000	It looks like a washing powder
2972000	2974000	He saw the box
2974000	2976000	Many colors of this
2976000	2978000	Washing powder
2978000	2980000	Then he called this washing powder
2980000	2982000	I immediately realized that this may be a good name
2982000	2984000	Because the first one
2984000	2986000	It's the end of ON, and then there's AIX
2986000	2988000	That has something to do with the axis
2988000	2990000	The point is that we just introduced the action
2990000	2992000	The purpose is to put this
2992000	2994000	qcd
2994000	2996000	So he wrote here
2996000	2998000	When I notice a new particle that
2998000	3000000	Clean up the problem with an action
3000000	3002000	So he realized that this is a very good name
3002000	3004000	So he took it
3004000	3006000	Of course there are other
3006000	3008000	Others
3008000	3010000	Think of other names
3010000	3012000	Like this Weinberg is also a Nobel Prize
3012000	3014000	He thought of other names
3014000	3016000	But later this Weinberg also agreed that this action
3016000	3018000	It's closer
3018000	3020000	So it's been applied until now
3020000	3022000	He called it action
3022000	3024000	Okay, that's just an exaggeration
3024000	3026000	Just explain a little bit
3026000	3028000	You will find that physicists
3028000	3030000	There are quite a few stories about particle names
3030000	3032000	For example
3034000	3036000	There is a quark in this table
3036000	3038000	Does anyone know how quark is named?
3040000	3042000	Quark is also a Nobel Prize
3042000	3044000	It's Gilman
3044000	3046000	He came up with an idea
3046000	3048000	Then he thought about it for a while
3048000	3050000	Later he found that it was like reading a novel
3050000	3052000	This duck in this novel
3052000	3054000	It seems to be called quack quack quack
3054000	3056000	He thinks it's good, so he took it
3056000	3058000	So this
3058000	3060000	This particle is called quark
3060000	3062000	Yes, this is very
3062000	3064000	Very interesting
3064000	3066000	I can only say that physics sometimes
3066000	3068000	It's quite unexpected
3068000	3070000	Then I will put this
3070000	3072000	The basic introduction of action is finished
3072000	3074000	If there is no problem
3074000	3076000	I will introduce the research directly
3076000	3078000	I will bring the research part very soon
3078000	3080000	Because it is more detailed and related to time
3080000	3082000	I'll just talk about it
3082000	3084000	Just say
3084000	3086000	It can explain
3086000	3088000	Can explain this
3088000	3090000	At the same time
3090000	3092000	If you believe
3092000	3094000	If you believe
3094000	3096000	Then
3096000	3098000	Assuming they exist at the same time
3098000	3100000	In our natural world
3100000	3102000	We predict what kind of phenomenon it should have
3102000	3104000	OK
3104000	3106000	That
3106000	3108000	If we assume that there is a so-called quality mixing between them
3108000	3110000	What kind of effect will it have
3110000	3112000	This time I will give you
3112000	3114000	Give this answer
3114000	3116000	This is called level crossing
3116000	3118000	What is the Chinese translation of level crossing?
3118000	3120000	Level crossing
3120000	3122000	This picture is
3122000	3124000	Assuming that QC action
3124000	3126000	There is no so-called mixing with this alpha
3126000	3128000	Without mixing
3128000	3130000	Green and red lines on the picture
3130000	3132000	It represents the evolution of their mass
3132000	3134000	You will find that
3134000	3136000	This is the first one
3136000	3138000	Green is QC action
3138000	3140000	I just said that when it is very low temperature
3140000	3142000	It has quality, but there is no quality at very high temperature
3142000	3144000	So its quality evolution
3144000	3146000	It should be like this green picture
3146000	3148000	Then alpha, because it has nothing to do with QC effect
3148000	3150000	So its mass
3150000	3152000	Let's assume it is constant
3152000	3154000	Here I have to assume
3154000	3156000	The mass of alpha must be less than this
3156000	3158000	Action
3158000	3160000	At a very low temperature mass
3160000	3162000	The reason is that
3162000	3164000	If there is no maxmixing
3164000	3166000	Nothing happens
3166000	3168000	If you turn on this maxmixing today
3168000	3170000	You see this picture
3170000	3172000	There are some changes
3172000	3174000	You will find that this green line
3174000	3176000	It should be going up
3176000	3178000	It is at a certain time
3178000	3180000	It suddenly turned to the original
3180000	3182000	The direction of the alp
3182000	3184000	The same alp
3184000	3186000	This is at a very
3186000	3188000	At a very high temperature
3190000	3192000	This is its original evolution
3192000	3194000	But it is still at a certain time
3194000	3196000	It will run up
3196000	3198000	Run to the action part
3198000	3200000	Then we call this phenomenon
3200000	3202000	Level crossing between QC action and alp
3202000	3204000	Then this phenomenon
3204000	3206000	Actually not
3206000	3208000	Only appeared in my research
3208000	3210000	If you do
3210000	3212000	Neutrino mass physics
3212000	3214000	It is very similar to the so-called Neutrino vibration
3214000	3216000	It is very similar to the so-called Neutrino vibration
3216000	3218000	Neutrino in matter
3218000	3220000	There will also be this level crossing phenomenon
3220000	3222000	Then this is the answer
3222000	3224000	If you put this maxmixing today
3224000	3226000	If you turn it on
3226000	3228000	Then its
3228000	3230000	There will be a so-called level crossing phenomenon
3230000	3232000	So if there is a level crossing
3232000	3234000	We mean
3234000	3236000	This
3236000	3238000	QC action and alp
3238000	3240000	There will be a so-called heat transfer
3240000	3242000	The so-called heat transfer is
3242000	3244000	Its particle
3244000	3246000	Density
3246000	3248000	Is small
3248000	3250000	From A to this
3250000	3252000	This
3252000	3254000	This
3262000	3264000	Diabetic conversion
3264000	3266000	In Chinese, it may be translated as the heat transfer
3268000	3270000	There are some conditions
3270000	3272000	I may need to mention it later
3272000	3274000	So if this
3274000	3276000	Ok, this is the answer
3276000	3278000	So I won't repeat it again
3278000	3280000	If there is this
3280000	3282000	We will predict that
3282000	3284000	The energy density of this action
3284000	3286000	It will be suppressed
3286000	3288000	By this maxmixing
3288000	3290000	Because this
3290000	3292000	Its energy density is with this
3292000	3294000	Quality and its particle
3294000	3296000	The product is the product
3296000	3298000	So if you have this today
3298000	3300000	Level crossing
3300000	3302000	Your QC action
3302000	3304000	It's very low temperature
3304000	3306000	It's more like an alp
3306000	3308000	The alp particle is in front of us
3308000	3310000	Its energy density is less than this ma
3310000	3312000	So you can predict that its quality will be
3312000	3314000	Suppressed by this ratio
3314000	3316000	Then it's obvious
3316000	3318000	You will open up some new space
3318000	3320000	In our research
3320000	3322000	OK, this is the model part
3322000	3324000	That's the same
3324000	3326000	This
3326000	3328000	On the left of the first line
3328000	3330000	QC action potential
3330000	3332000	It's a cosine potential
3332000	3334000	We just saw a few in the front
3334000	3336000	It's like a positive potential
3336000	3338000	Mathematical description
3338000	3340000	On the right, it's like a description
3340000	3342000	How to make this action
3342000	3344000	There is a maxmixing
3344000	3346000	OK, if you have maxmixing
3346000	3348000	This
3348000	3350000	It's not a physical state
3350000	3352000	We have to do a cross-section
3352000	3354000	The cross-section process is below
3354000	3356000	You can see that it is through a rotation matrix
3356000	3358000	Then this is their eigenvalue
3358000	3360000	Maybe everyone does
3360000	3362000	Maybe you are more familiar with eigenvalue
3362000	3364000	This is the true value
3364000	3366000	Although I just saw this on the picture
3366000	3368000	The red line and the green line
3368000	3370000	The so-called eigenvalue evolution
3370000	3372000	Then we have to assume
3372000	3374000	mphi is less than ma
3374000	3376000	Because it's obvious if you
3376000	3378000	If this condition is met
3378000	3380000	This green line
3380000	3382000	What about this line
3382000	3384000	Or this red line
3384000	3386000	Less than this
3386000	3388000	Green is
3388000	3390000	Green at
3390000	3392000	The part of this line
3392000	3394000	It will have this level crossing
3394000	3396000	In other words, if the red is far above the green
3396000	3398000	Obviously, there will be no level crossing
3398000	3400000	Happening
3400000	3402000	So this is
3402000	3404000	eigenvalue evolution
3404000	3406000	Here I have a special assumption
3406000	3408000	This
3408000	3410000	Elp's decay function
3410000	3412000	To be smaller than this
3412000	3414000	Qc action
3414000	3416000	A little bit
3416000	3418000	This is some mathematical definition
3418000	3420000	Hello
3420000	3422000	it is good
3422000	3424000	Let's talk about the assumption
3424000	3426000	If you assume
3426000	3428000	mphi is bigger than ma
3428000	3430000	You will find this
3430000	3432000	eigenvalue
3432000	3434000	There will be a big splitting
3434000	3436000	In some sense
3436000	3438000	There is no level crossing
3438000	3440000	it is good
3440000	3442000	The picture on the right is
3442000	3444000	Dynamic
3444000	3446000	Because of time
3446000	3448000	This is just a mixed angle formula
3448000	3450000	You don't have to look at it
3450000	3452000	Its evolution
3452000	3454000	This is the evolution of mixed angle
3454000	3456000	Obviously, you can see
3456000	3458000	Assuming that the conditions we just talked about
3458000	3460000	This mixed angle
3460000	3462000	Just at this level crossing
3462000	3464000	It will have a big change
3464000	3466000	On the other hand
3466000	3468000	In other cases
3468000	3470000	Did not happen
3470000	3472000	So we say that the level crossing is in this condition
3472000	3474000	In this f5
3474000	3476000	It will have this
3476000	3478000	Level crossing
3478000	3480000	Hello
3480000	3482000	Is there a problem
3482000	3484000	Hello
3484000	3486000	No
3486000	3488000	This is a mathematical definition of level crossing
3488000	3490000	I won't talk about it
3498000	3500000	Some noise
3500000	3502000	Is it ok
3502000	3504000	Ok
3506000	3508000	Let's talk about this
3508000	3510000	To meet some of the conditions of absolute conversion
3510000	3512000	This is qcd
3512000	3514000	Before that, I will pay attention to qcd
3514000	3516000	Some of its dynamics
3516000	3518000	This
3518000	3520000	On the picture, its equation is
3520000	3522000	This qcd
3522000	3524000	Its equation of motion
3524000	3526000	Its dynamic equation is
3526000	3528000	Basically, it is a two-dimensional equation
3528000	3530000	Two-dimensional equation
3530000	3532000	Ok
3532000	3534000	On the picture
3534000	3536000	This is the so-called Hubble parameter
3536000	3538000	Maybe everyone has heard of this
3538000	3540000	Hubble constant
3540000	3542000	Basically, it has something to do with Hubble parameter
3542000	3544000	This ma
3544000	3546000	The same is the qcd
3546000	3548000	Its mass
3548000	3550000	It has something to do with temperature
3550000	3552000	At very high temperature
3552000	3554000	This Hubble parameter is relatively large
3554000	3556000	So you can ignore this third item
3556000	3558000	Then you solve it, you will find that it is a
3558000	3560000	Over-damping solution
3560000	3562000	That is, at high temperature
3562000	3564000	Its mass is almost constant
3564000	3566000	At very low temperature
3566000	3568000	You can put this second item
3568000	3570000	This Hubble parameter is ignored
3570000	3572000	If you ignore the second item
3572000	3574000	It is a very simple so-called
3574000	3576000	Over-damping solution
3576000	3578000	Its equation is getting smaller and smaller
3578000	3580000	Because the universe is expanding
3580000	3582000	That's like this picture
3582000	3584000	For example, when it is very low temperature
3584000	3586000	It will continue to vibrate
3586000	3588000	Then its equation is getting smaller and smaller
3588000	3590000	This is what I just said
3590000	3592000	When it is very low temperature
3592000	3594000	It will oscillate near the potential mirror
3596000	3598000	Roughly speaking, this qc action
3598000	3600000	Start oscillating
3600000	3602000	At this Hubble parameter
3602000	3604000	Roughly equal to this qc action mass
3604000	3606000	Yes
3606000	3608000	it is good
3608000	3610000	If you want to
3610000	3612000	Calculate this
3612000	3614000	qc action energy density
3614000	3616000	Generally, we will define this
3616000	3618000	So-called actual number
3618000	3620000	Then calculate it
3620000	3622000	Actual number is conserved
3622000	3624000	If it is conserved, it is very good
3624000	3626000	Because you know that mathematicians like to use this energy to calculate
3626000	3628000	Anyway
3628000	3630000	We can solve the equation of motion
3630000	3632000	We can calculate this
3632000	3634000	Actual number density
3634000	3636000	We find that it is constant at very low temperature
3636000	3638000	That
3638000	3640000	The reason it is constant is because
3640000	3642000	It is a
3642000	3644000	Because this vibration is a decoupling process
3644000	3646000	The condition of the decoupling process is to satisfy
3646000	3648000	Its
3648000	3650000	External time scale is bigger than
3650000	3652000	Internal time scale
3652000	3654000	In our system
3654000	3656000	External time scale is
3656000	3658000	The oscillation rate of the universe
3658000	3660000	Or
3660000	3662000	Or Hubble time
3662000	3664000	The time of the universe
3664000	3666000	The time of the universe
3666000	3668000	Internal time scale is
3668000	3670000	Vibration
3670000	3672000	Vibration cycle
3672000	3674000	In other words, if you today
3674000	3676000	What about this oscillation cycle
3676000	3678000	For example, this
3678000	3680000	This
3680000	3682000	What about the expansion speed
3682000	3684000	If it is still slow, it is
3684000	3686000	It is a decoupling process
3686000	3688000	In this case, this
3688000	3690000	Actual number will be a conserved
3690000	3692000	Quantity
3692000	3694000	Ok
3694000	3696000	In our system, in our research
3696000	3698000	Because we have introduced two particles
3698000	3700000	So the decoupling condition will be a little different
3700000	3702000	Because
3702000	3704000	I just said that in level crossing
3704000	3706000	You will have a big
3706000	3708000	Big change
3708000	3710000	Mixed angle
3710000	3712000	So in fact, we will have an additional internal time scale
3712000	3714000	We use delta t to represent
3714000	3716000	Yes, you can use this formula
3716000	3718000	Write down
3720000	3722000	What about the so-called internal time scale
3722000	3724000	In addition to the single action case
3724000	3726000	We only have one
3726000	3728000	It's just a
3728000	3730000	Vibration cycle
3730000	3732000	If you have two particles
3732000	3734000	You naturally predict that there will be two oscillation cycles
3734000	3736000	In addition to that, we will find
3736000	3738000	We found that there is a third cycle
3738000	3740000	In other words, if two oscillation cycles today
3740000	3742000	In the same phase
3742000	3744000	We identify this as the third cycle
3744000	3746000	Yes, you can calculate
3746000	3748000	Is 2π ÷ this mass difference
3748000	3750000	Between this mass eigenstates
3750000	3752000	Ok
3752000	3754000	Then we will require this condition
3754000	3756000	That is to say
3756000	3758000	This internal time scale is much larger than this
3758000	3760000	Internal time scale
3760000	3762000	Then we can find out this condition
3762000	3764000	You may not need to remember
3764000	3766000	Anyway, we can solve this
3766000	3768000	This in our model
3768000	3770000	Action number density
3770000	3772000	This is the result
3772000	3774000	So
3774000	3776000	Let's read this picture
3776000	3778000	Hello
3778000	3780000	Can you go back to the first two pages
3780000	3782000	Ok, which page
3782000	3784000	Go back one page
3784000	3786000	Next page
3786000	3788000	Next page
3788000	3790000	Next page
3790000	3792000	Is it forward or backward?
3792000	3794000	I think we are talking about different directions
3794000	3796000	I want to ask you
3796000	3798000	Basically
3798000	3800000	Your cycle is
3800000	3802000	Contrary to the mass difference
3802000	3804000	But the mass scale is already very small
3804000	3806000	So the mass difference should be smaller
3806000	3808000	So this thing
3808000	3810000	Actually
3810000	3812000	The phase of these two states
3812000	3814000	For us humans
3814000	3816000	The time of this experiment
3816000	3818000	This time
3818000	3820000	Is about the scale of the ear
3820000	3822000	It is constant phase, right?
3822000	3824000	You said mass difference?
3824000	3826000	You said this mass difference
3826000	3828000	What is the value of this value?
3828000	3830000	This delta t
3830000	3832000	This delta t
3832000	3834000	You said this delta t?
3834000	3836000	You said this delta t?
3836000	3838000	You said this delta t?
3838000	3840000	How small is this delta t?
3840000	3842000	How small is this delta t?
3842000	3844000	I said the oscillation cycle
3844000	3846000	I said the oscillation cycle
3846000	3848000	This cycle
3848000	3850000	This cycle
3850000	3852000	I said this ELP is
3852000	3854000	I said this ELP is
3854000	3856000	EEV
3856000	3858000	For example, the current universe
3858000	3860000	For example, 3K
3860000	3862000	This happened at level crossing
3862000	3864000	This happened at level crossing
3864000	3866000	Because we want to discuss
3866000	3868000	Will there be this so-called absolute conversion at level crossing?
3868000	3870000	But isn't it still oscillating now?
3870000	3872000	Or did I misunderstand?
3872000	3874000	But his mass
3874000	3876000	We use this picture
3876000	3878000	We use this picture
3878000	3880000	For example
3880000	3882000	This one
3882000	3884000	For example, you see this green
3884000	3886000	This is corresponding to
3886000	3888000	Light mode
3888000	3890000	It's close to ELP mass
3890000	3892000	It's close to ELP mass
3892000	3894000	And this heavy mode is close to QCD mass
3894000	3896000	And this heavy mode is close to QCD mass
3896000	3898000	So it's still vibrating
3898000	3900000	So it's still vibrating
3900000	3902000	But there is still energy density
3902000	3904000	But the vibration is very small
3904000	3906000	But there is still energy density
3906000	3908000	So it's basically just a constant
3908000	3910000	So you can adjust
3910000	3912000	So you can adjust
3912000	3914000	It's smaller than QCD
3914000	3916000	It's smaller than QCD
3916000	3918000	Even if it's QCD axion
3918000	3920000	Even if it's QCD axion
3920000	3922000	You have to move down
3922000	3924000	You have to move down
3924000	3926000	Wait for that one
3926000	3928000	The green one
3928000	3930000	Is that M5?
3930000	3932000	The horizontal axis is mass
3932000	3934000	The vertical axis is photon coupling
3934000	3936000	The vertical axis is mass
3936000	3938000	The vertical axis is mass
3938000	3940000	The density is lower
3940000	3942000	The density is lower
3942000	3944000	First, density
3944000	3946000	You are talking about
3946000	3948000	photon coupling
3948000	3950000	With mass
3950000	3952000	With mass
3952000	3954000	I'll mentioned it later
3954000	3956000	You are talking about
3956000	3958000	how it can enhance
3958000	3960000	Because the quality is low
3960000	3962000	I will see
3962000	3964000	If you scan out in parameter space
3964000	3966000	If you scan out in parameter space
3966000	3968000	If you scan out in parameter space
3968000	3970000	The decay constant
3970000	3972000	Can be smaller
3972000	3974000	I'll show the conclusion
3974000	3976000	I'll show the conclusion
3976000	3978000	Is it an hour?
3978000	3980000	Is it an hour?
3980000	3982000	Is it an hour?
3982000	3984000	Anyway, this is
3986000	3988000	The two actions
3988000	3990000	The evolution of number density
3990000	3992000	If you have absolute process condition
3992000	3994000	I just defined gamma
3994000	3996000	If gamma is greater than 1
3996000	3998000	You can have absolute conversion
3998000	4000000	If you
4000000	4002000	If gamma is less than 1
4002000	4004000	You will find the green one will suddenly become
4004000	4006000	The red one
4006000	4008000	In this case, the absolute conversion
4008000	4010000	Is not perfect
4010000	4012000	You can skip it
4012000	4014000	Anyway
4014000	4016000	The result is
4016000	4018000	If we impose the density
4018000	4020000	To solve the parameter space
4020000	4022000	We find
4022000	4024000	The decay constant of the ELP
4024000	4026000	Divided by the MFA
4026000	4028000	In this graph
4028000	4030000	It can be smaller than 1
4030000	4032000	The MFA
4032000	4034000	Can be smaller than
4034000	4036000	The MFA
4036000	4038000	The MFA
4038000	4040000	If the MFA is 10 to the power of 12
4040000	4042000	As I said
4042000	4044000	If you want to satisfy the density of the object
4044000	4046000	It should be 10 to the power of 12
4046000	4048000	In this case, the GA gamma gamma
4048000	4050000	The front coupling is 10 to the power of 15
4050000	4052000	So today
4052000	4054000	The MFA
4054000	4056000	If the MFA is smaller than 1
4056000	4058000	It means we will have an enhancement
4058000	4060000	As we know
4060000	4062000	As we can see
4062000	4064000	The coupling is
4064000	4066000	The decay constant is inversely proportional
4066000	4068000	So if you can
4068000	4070000	Reduce the MFA
4070000	4072000	We expect to have an enhancement
4072000	4074000	So basically
4074000	4076000	This is our final result
4076000	4078000	The result is the color contours on the graph
4078000	4080000	We found
4080000	4082000	For example, the red bar
4082000	4084000	Corresponds to
4084000	4086000	The MFA is equal to
4086000	4088000	3 times 12 square GEV
4088000	4090000	We can
4090000	4092000	Have a bigger MFA
4092000	4094000	Because we just talked about
4094000	4096000	Mass suppression
4096000	4098000	If you have mass suppression
4098000	4100000	The MFA can be increased
4100000	4102000	At the same time
4102000	4104000	The MFA
4104000	4106000	The
4106000	4108000	Elbow decay constant
4108000	4110000	It can be very small
4110000	4112000	So it will have an enhancement
4112000	4114000	It will be higher than the
4114000	4116000	The middle band
4116000	4118000	Enhanced by
4118000	4120000	1000 times or 100 times
4120000	4122000	This is good
4122000	4124000	This mechanism
4124000	4126000	Can be
4126000	4128000	Measured by
4128000	4130000	Solenoid action
4130000	4132000	It can be measured
4132000	4134000	This is our model
4134000	4136000	Advantage
4136000	4138000	This is the conclusion
4138000	4140000	I think
4140000	4142000	This is a more detailed part
4142000	4144000	I think
4144000	4146000	That's about it
4146000	4148000	Any questions
4148000	4150000	Before you ask questions
4150000	4152000	First of all
4152000	4154000	Let's applaud
4154000	4156000	Thank you for your speech
4160000	4162000	Do you have any questions?
4162000	4164000	You can ask questions now
4166000	4168000	This is a theoretical thing
4168000	4170000	Can you hear me
4170000	4172000	Yes
4172000	4174000	Then
4174000	4176000	Your theory is very interesting
4176000	4178000	We have an experiment
4178000	4180000	About two or three years later
4180000	4182000	There may be some preliminary results
4184000	4186000	Which experiment are you doing
4188000	4190000	We have an experiment with LC circuit
4192000	4194000	Can you hear me
4196000	4198000	Can you hear me
4200000	4202000	Can you repeat your question
4204000	4206000	Can you hear me
4208000	4210000	Can you hear me
4210000	4212000	No
4214000	4216000	Just a little bit
4216000	4218000	Try again
4218000	4220000	Sorry
4220000	4222000	Your theory is very interesting
4222000	4224000	We have an experiment
4224000	4226000	At Los Alamos
4226000	4228000	Can measure your 10 to 7
4228000	4230000	To 10 to minus 10
4230000	4232000	EV range
4232000	4234000	Maybe two or three years later
4234000	4236000	Yes
4236000	4238000	Your value range is also
4238000	4240000	Just your range
4240000	4242000	10 to 7
4242000	4244000	10 to minus 10 EV range
4244000	4246000	My question is
4246000	4248000	Is your value range the same as the picture?
4248000	4250000	Almost
4250000	4252000	Almost the same
4252000	4254000	That's not bad
4254000	4256000	You can test your theory
4256000	4258000	But I have a question
4258000	4260000	Do you consider
4260000	4262000	If it is two
4262000	4264000	Then you will have like
4264000	4266000	Neutrino oscillation
4266000	4268000	Yes, there will be such a phenomenon
4268000	4270000	This is also a possibility
4270000	4272000	I mentioned this to the boss
4272000	4274000	But he probably means
4274000	4276000	It should be the same phenomenon
4276000	4278000	If you add one more x
4278000	4280000	Like particle
4280000	4282000	You said it wouldn't change
4282000	4284000	Will there be a stronger enhancement
4284000	4286000	There may be a stronger enhancement
4286000	4288000	Yes
4288000	4290000	Our mechanism is
4290000	4292000	But we didn't say
4292000	4294000	You can consider more complex models
4294000	4296000	I agree
4296000	4298000	OK
4298000	4300000	Thank you
4308000	4310000	Do you have any questions?
4316000	4318000	Hello
4318000	4320000	I have a simple question
4320000	4322000	Just now
4322000	4324000	You were talking about
4324000	4326000	Axiom can handle CP
4326000	4328000	Strong CP problem
4328000	4330000	My network is a bit of a problem
4330000	4332000	So I don't seem to hear it clearly
4332000	4334000	Can you say it again?
4334000	4336000	Sorry
4336000	4338000	You said how to solve strong CP problem
4338000	4340000	Go back
4342000	4344000	This is strong CP problem
4344000	4346000	This is
4346000	4348000	In QCD, we can choose this term
4348000	4350000	Yes, basically
4350000	4352000	Just add a particle
4352000	4354000	In this term
4354000	4356000	And then
4356000	4358000	When it's very low temperature
4358000	4360000	This
4360000	4362000	Axiom will fall to this potential minima
4362000	4364000	This is called
4364000	4366000	It's also vacuum
4366000	4368000	It's the vacuum of the axiom
4368000	4370000	This vacuum can just cancel out this CP term
4372000	4374000	So this will disappear
4374000	4376000	If this disappears
4376000	4378000	It's very small
4378000	4380000	So it can be explained
4380000	4382000	Why the upper bound is so small
4382000	4384000	10-11-2
4384000	4386000	So it's very simple
4386000	4388000	Just a cancellation
4388000	4390000	I see
4390000	4392000	I'm from NingTai
4392000	4394000	Now there are many
4394000	4396000	People
4396000	4398000	They said they want to be in NingTai
4398000	4400000	Find this axiom in the range
4400000	4402000	They mainly do
4402000	4404000	What I want to do is
4404000	4406000	Find a normal insulator
4406000	4408000	And a topological insulator
4408000	4410000	On their boundary
4410000	4412000	Their
4412000	4414000	Maxwell equation
4414000	4416000	There will also be this theta term
4416000	4418000	But
4418000	4420000	On the boundary
4420000	4422000	Theta term
4422000	4424000	Must be integer or semi-integer
4424000	4426000	This is
4426000	4428000	For this integer semi-integer theta
4428000	4430000	Does it make any sense in high energy?
4430000	4432000	Or is it actually
4432000	4434000	It's important
4434000	4436000	How much is this theta
4436000	4438000	It doesn't matter at all
4438000	4440000	Because this theta is a
4440000	4442000	How to say
4444000	4446000	You can't say it's not important
4446000	4448000	But some people know this
4448000	4450000	You said it's 2π or 2π
4450000	4452000	Yes, it's integer semi-integer
4452000	4454000	Think about it
4454000	4456000	Ok
4458000	4460000	I can't think of anything special
4460000	4462000	Ok
4462000	4464000	Let me see
4464000	4466000	But here
4468000	4470000	This is a different theta
4470000	4472000	There is another theta here
4472000	4474000	Confused
4474000	4476000	This is a different theta
4476000	4478000	Not this
4478000	4480000	Different theta
4480000	4482000	This theta is basically
4482000	4484000	Is to cancel something
4486000	4488000	In high energy
4488000	4490000	Axiom can also be seen as
4490000	4492000	Boundary
4492000	4494000	Is it related to boundary effect?
4496000	4498000	Um
4498000	4500000	Wow
4500000	4502000	There is
4502000	4504000	Related to boundary
4504000	4506000	But it should not be your
4506000	4508000	Topological boundary
4508000	4510000	Why is this theta term
4510000	4512000	Because I just talked about
4512000	4514000	Axiom
4514000	4516000	For example, the electrical effect is
4516000	4518000	Vector current
4518000	4520000	Do you know
4520000	4522000	Axiom current
4522000	4524000	Passive integral
4524000	4526000	Boundary term is
4526000	4528000	Non-managed
4528000	4530000	Um
4530000	4532000	So it's actually related to boundary
4532000	4534000	But not your boundary
4534000	4536000	Oh ok
4536000	4538000	I'm sure
4538000	4540000	I'm not familiar with
4540000	4542000	Your boundary
4542000	4544000	Yes
4544000	4546000	Actually
4546000	4548000	Actually
4548000	4550000	There should be a correspondence
4550000	4552000	There should be a correspondence
4552000	4554000	But I'm not familiar with your boundary
4554000	4556000	Anyway, this term is actually
4556000	4558000	From that you
4558000	4560000	That
4560000	4562000	Passive integral
4562000	4564000	That
4564000	4566000	EMM
4566000	4568000	EMM
4568000	4570000	What is EMM
4570000	4572000	This is QCD
4572000	4574000	QCD
4574000	4576000	That
4576000	4578000	Volume
4578000	4580000	You can change it to a surface
4580000	4582000	Yes
4582000	4584000	Ok
4584000	4586000	Thank you
4590000	4592000	Do you have any questions?
4592000	4594000	That
4594000	4596000	That
4596000	4598000	Say something
4598000	4600000	I used to be with
4600000	4602000	Teacher Cui
4602000	4604000	That
4604000	4606000	Sorry
4606000	4608000	I want to interrupt you
4608000	4610000	You might want
4610000	4612000	Do you turn on the sound at the same time
4612000	4614000	Then turn on the microphone again
4614000	4616000	Because your response is quite big
4616000	4618000	You may have to adjust it to see if you know
4618000	4620000	What's the situation
4620000	4622000	If you are using headphones
4622000	4624000	You can turn it into a standard headset or not
4624000	4626000	Try using headphones or something
4626000	4628000	Otherwise you can't hear it
4632000	4634000	Can you try again
4634000	4636000	Sorry
4636000	4638000	I'm trying
4638000	4640000	Ok
4640000	4642000	It's almost the same
4642000	4644000	You can only hear it if you speak a little slower
4644000	4646000	Sorry
4646000	4648000	I mean
4648000	4650000	That is
4650000	4652000	I am also in Taiwan University
4652000	4654000	That
4654000	4656000	So let me add
4656000	4658000	That is about
4658000	4660000	The best quality
4660000	4662000	Can you tell me
4662000	4664000	Hey
4664000	4666000	Actually, I didn't hear it clearly
4666000	4668000	it is good
4668000	4670000	Hey
4670000	4672000	Hey
4672000	4674000	That response is quite big
4674000	4676000	I didn't hear what you said
4678000	4680000	Hey
4680000	4682000	Hey
4682000	4684000	Hey
4684000	4686000	Let's give him time to adjust
4686000	4688000	Or you can also type
4688000	4690000	Does anyone else have a problem
4694000	4696000	Of course
4696000	4698000	Wait for me to talk a little
4698000	4700000	I don't know where it is
4700000	4702000	But this kind of thing
4702000	4704000	This concept has been developed for a long time
4704000	4706000	This is not a new thing
4706000	4708000	But in recent years
4708000	4710000	Maybe Wimper's experiments
4710000	4712000	May be recorded in the future
4712000	4714000	I guess
4714000	4716000	Do you have any comments
4716000	4718000	Don't say that
4718000	4720000	We don't want to lose our jobs
4720000	4722000	Isn't your philosophy to explore
4722000	4724000	No
4724000	4726000	Just kidding
4726000	4728000	I personally have no opinion
4728000	4730000	I personally feel
4730000	4732000	Things that can be tested should be tested as much as possible
4732000	4734000	This has data
4734000	4736000	I think so
4738000	4740000	Just now
4740000	4742000	Please say
4742000	4744000	Hey
4744000	4746000	Did someone talk just now
4746000	4748000	Let me talk
4748000	4750000	Because
4750000	4752000	It seems that Action has started to pop up again in recent years
4752000	4754000	Experiments seem to be
4754000	4756000	Because I remember that there were quite a few experiments at the German conference
4756000	4758000	Improving their sensitivity
4760000	4762000	Japan has also started to do it recently
4762000	4764000	Because the mainstream in Japan
4764000	4766000	Is Sucy
4766000	4768000	But because of LC
4768000	4770000	Can't see
4770000	4772000	So now
4772000	4774000	Sucy
4774000	4776000	Start to be more visual
4776000	4778000	Of course people are still doing it
4778000	4780000	So Action may be
4780000	4782000	In the next few years
4782000	4784000	A public topic
4786000	4788000	Just now
4788000	4790000	The previous
4790000	4792000	Collaborator
4792000	4794000	I may not have heard it clearly
4796000	4798000	Hello, can you hear me now
4798000	4800000	Try again
4802000	4804000	You say
4804000	4806000	You just say
4806000	4808000	Let's see if we can hear you
4810000	4812000	So
4812000	4814000	I want to talk about
4814000	4816000	Action
4816000	4818000	Action
4818000	4820000	OK
4820000	4822000	Thank you
4822000	4824000	Just say
4824000	4826000	Like this
4826000	4828000	You can measure
4828000	4830000	Your
4830000	4832000	Things
4832000	4834000	How many
4834000	4836000	If the mass of Action is too low
4836000	4838000	His
4838000	4840000	His
4840000	4842000	Will smooth out
4842000	4844000	Smaller
4844000	4846000	So
4846000	4848000	It will be measured
4848000	4850000	It's not the same as the actual measurement
4852000	4854000	So
4854000	4856000	The mass
4856000	4858000	Is not
4858000	4860000	Oh
4862000	4864000	24
4864000	4866000	I remember it wrong
4866000	4868000	Do you say 10-24 EV
4868000	4870000	I heard the speech
4870000	4872000	10-22
4872000	4874000	Because
4874000	4876000	Because
4876000	4878000	Other
4878000	4880000	A little bit
4880000	4882000	Alpha
4882000	4884000	You can use
4884000	4886000	Galaxy
4886000	4888000	Measure his mass
4888000	4890000	This is another observation
4890000	4892000	Some other observations
4892000	4894000	The output is like this
4898000	4900000	OK
4902000	4904000	But
4904000	4906000	The
4906000	4908000	Low limit is
4908000	4910000	24 or 23
4910000	4912000	24 or 23 OK
4912000	4914000	Thank you
4914000	4916000	OK
4916000	4918000	Do you have any questions
4918000	4920000	You say
4922000	4924000	I want to ask the question
4924000	4926000	Is with the other
4926000	4928000	Do you have any questions
4928000	4930000	You ask
4930000	4932000	I heard you ask
4932000	4934000	He just said that
4934000	4936000	What is his material
4936000	4938000	There will be
4938000	4940000	U1
4940000	4942000	The battery
4942000	4944000	That's why
4944000	4946000	High-end words
4946000	4948000	Is the battery
4948000	4950000	There is no
4950000	4952000	He is U1
4952000	4954000	U1
4954000	4956000	You can
4956000	4958000	There is no
4960000	4962000	Do you have any simple views
4966000	4968000	Wait a minute
4968000	4970000	U1
4970000	4972000	Is it related to the battery
4972000	4974000	Wait a minute
4974000	4976000	Battery
4978000	4980000	Are you Li Zhaolong
4980000	4982000	Yes
4982000	4984000	I think it should be
4984000	4986000	Because this question seems to have been discussed with you before
4986000	4988000	U1 can give
4992000	4994000	What do you say
4994000	4996000	U1 can
4996000	4998000	U1 does not have this
4998000	5000000	Only
5000000	5002000	I don't know if this is
5002000	5004000	Related to others
5004000	5006000	U1
5006000	5008000	U1
5008000	5010000	U1 can take it off
5014000	5016000	I can ask
5016000	5018000	The neighbor
5018000	5020000	The question
5020000	5022000	Is that student still there
5022000	5024000	Is that student still there
5024000	5026000	I want to ask
5026000	5028000	Hello
5028000	5030000	I am
5030000	5032000	You just said that
5032000	5034000	Is in the material
5034000	5036000	There will be
5036000	5038000	E.B
5038000	5040000	Related to Torb
5040000	5042000	That object
5042000	5044000	Why in that case
5044000	5046000	Abelian
5046000	5048000	Why is this car still there
5050000	5052000	Should be
5052000	5054000	I'm not very clear
5054000	5056000	But in that
5056000	5058000	Topological insulator
5058000	5060000	Boundary
5060000	5062000	It is indeed
5062000	5064000	Non-Abelian
5064000	5066000	The reason
5068000	5070000	I'm not sure
5070000	5072000	You really look at those
5072000	5074000	It's the Hamiltonian
5074000	5076000	Those
5076000	5078000	It is non-Abelian
5082000	5084000	It should be related to this
5084000	5086000	If I remember correctly
5086000	5088000	But
5088000	5090000	I'm doing experiments
5090000	5092000	I'm not very clear
5092000	5094000	Why is this
