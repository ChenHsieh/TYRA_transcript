00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today's Tarot Talk is very happy to invite Dr. Yu Zhejing.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Can I say this? Although half of my feet have already stepped into Ph.D.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Zhejing is a graduate of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He directly enrolled in the PhD class of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This year is the fourth year of the PhD class.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the first three years of the PhD class, he conducted a cooperation experiment in Poland.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Last year, he applied for the Thousand Miles Project.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to say that I am in Caltech.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He conducted research on visiting in Caltech.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have become very good friends this year.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He just returned to Taiwan and is expected to graduate this summer.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He is almost graduating.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He is interested in the study of nanoparticless materials and green energy and environmental governance through the application of light, vinegar, coal, blowing, and chemical engineering.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So far, he has published nearly ten articles.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Half of them are written by Ph.D.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can you go back to the first page?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You should be able to see the first video now.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today's topic is very interesting.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's called The Air We Breathe and The Water We Drink.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Without further ado, let's welcome Yu-Zhe Jin.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I forgot to say one thing.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
When you applaud, you have to put the microphone down so that the speaker can hear your applause.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, I heard it.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please start.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Thank you, Tara, for inviting me to speak today.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am Yu-Zhe Jin.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Today I am going to talk about how we use chemical engineering to manage our air and water.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The speech will be divided into two parts.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The first is to use light blowing to manage the toxic gas in the air.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The second part is to use electromagnetic methods to deal with our waste water.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I hope that if you have any questions, we can discuss them directly.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will limit the time to about an hour.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Including Q&A, I will limit it to about an hour.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Sorry, let me interrupt.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have a question.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can see a small microphone pattern on the right side of the screen.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You have to mute your own microphone to make a sound.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't forget.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please continue.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In general, in the combustion process,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
they will release a lot of toxic gases.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Among them, nitric oxide will release about 250 to 400 BPM.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What kind of harm will this cause?

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The toxic gas of nitric oxide, after a series of light chemical reactions,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
may produce carbon dioxide, NO2, or ozone.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
These two things are actually toxic gases.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In fact, in the early days, there were some problems with light chemicals.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can see that the air is orange.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They are the so-called light chemicals.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
These light chemicals are produced by carbon dioxide and ozone produced by these oil reactions.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In the early 1952s in London and the 1980s in Los Angeles,

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
about tens of thousands of people died because of these light chemicals.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
At the same time, carbon dioxide will also form acid rain with water.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The harm of acid rain is corrosion of buildings.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
At the same time, the most recent problem is probably the air whirlpool we know, PM2.5.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Nitric oxide will form a whirlpool in the air after it is combined with some solvents in the air, such as dust.

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
These whirlpools are lighter in density.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
For example, PM2.5 means that the particle diameter is less than 2.5 microns.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Carbon dioxide is lighter, so it will stay in the air.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When it is absorbed by the human body, it will harm the lungs.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So our research focus is to deal with nitric oxide in the air,

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
to prevent it from generating more harmful substances with other chemical reactions.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This chart is based on the air quality standards set by the US Department of Environment.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Among them, the air quality standards set six legal pollutants.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Three of them are the toxic gases we just mentioned, NO2, ozone, and air whirlpools.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
These three will be generated by our carbon dioxide.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So this is why we have to solve the problem of carbon dioxide.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Q&A

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They will be monitored in different ways.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
For example, they will measure the concentration of carbon dioxide for 1 hour.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If the concentration is more than 35 ppm in 1 hour, it is not standard.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But for a long time, if you put the magnitude to 8 hours of monitoring,

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
8 hours is OK as long as it is below 9 ppm.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The short-term concentration should not be too high, and the long-term concentration should be a standard.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If my understanding is correct, is it possible to say that if I have a temporary or monotonous NO2 emission,

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
it is a shot and then it is over.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How long does it take to decay?

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Or it should be said that some things, such as CO, may cause harm if absorbed in a short time.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So it will be set, for example, that it cannot exceed this concentration within 1 hour.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Otherwise, if the absorption exceeds this concentration, it will actually harm the human body.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But some things may be absorbed for a long time.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Even if the concentration is low, it will cause harm to the human body.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It will set a long-term standard.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Or it is set such a standard for the long-term toxicity of that substance and the short-term toxicity.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Does this answer your question?

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
OK, thank you.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The most commonly used method in the industry is called Selective Catalytic Reduction.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We often call it SCR.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We use the method of recovery to deal with our carbon monoxide.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The reason I put this picture is because you know that there is something in the car called a catalyst.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Because the car will actually burn those diesel or gasoline,

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
which will also produce a lot of carbon monoxide by burning.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This catalyst can turn carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let me give you an idea.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If a car has been used for 10 years, it may have bought 50,000 yuan.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How much money do you think will be left after 10 years?

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Does anyone want to guess?

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If the car is used for 10 years, there are about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan left.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In fact, 2,000 to 3,000 yuan is the price of a catalyst.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because the catalyst actually contains a lot of precious metals.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So the most important thing for a car is its catalyst.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Through this, we can turn our carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There are other methods, such as oxidation.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If carbon monoxide is added to its oxidizer, it will actually turn into a more toxic carbon monoxide.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Carbon monoxide will actually harm our lungs.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Carbon monoxide will even cause uric acid tears.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Uric acid tears will cause the function of the oxidizer to decrease, causing the oxidation of the uric acid.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is why we need to use restoration, not oxidation, to deal with our carbon monoxide.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We are doing experiments.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In fact, we considered NOx.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
NOx is actually the synthesis of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Although our initial reaction was carbon monoxide, we do not want to produce more toxic gas after our reaction.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So if we are evaluating whether our air is handled well, we will use this indicator to confirm that all carbon monoxide has been removed.

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The operating temperature of NOx is usually above 250 degrees Celsius, according to current research.

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is why we want to use light-supported SCR reaction, which is to use light blowing to support the restoration reaction just mentioned.

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sorry, I have a question.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You said that 200-300 degrees Celsius is assumed to be long-pressure, right?

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, long-pressure.

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So basically you are heating NOx in the air.

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes, because the exhaust pipe of the car is very hot.

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So we are heating NOx in the exhaust pipe.

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We need to reach the operating temperature of carbon monoxide to effectively remove NOx.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So if I use a pump to collect all these gases into a chamber to make it super high-pressure, but I don't need to heat it.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Isn't the energy density high enough?

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Theoretically, yes.

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But in the actual handling of the case, the flow rate is very fast.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So if you want to do this, you can't handle such a large amount of waste in time.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, because you have to collect it first.

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Collect it in the cylinder and then process it.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then empty the cylinder and collect it and process it.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, OK.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's more impractical in the process.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
OK.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Of course, it's not a problem.

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
OK.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So why do we use light to blow our reaction?

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
First, let's talk about the background of light emission.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Light emission is actually the use of light.

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Then usually the material we choose is semiconductor material.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It will have its bearing and guide.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
After using the light, it can illuminate the guide.

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then the electron will be magnetized from the next generation to the next generation.

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Then it will form its electron and the remaining electric field.

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The electron can actually participate in our chemical reaction.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
For example, the reaction can turn our carbon dioxide into our gas.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So this study is actually using light to provide an energy.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then use this energy to carry out our chemical reaction.

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What advantages does it have compared to the traditional SCR reaction we just talked about?

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It can be reacted at room temperature.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It doesn't need to be heated to, for example, 200 or 300 degrees.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
At the same time, we think of light as an energy that can't be used or used.

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So it's a green energy.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The third point is that the traditional SCR reaction must be operated at very limited temperatures.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For example, there is only 10 degrees of tolerance space.

164
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Light can actually operate at a wider temperature.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So we don't have to design its reaction temperature so strictly.

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Provide a better operating condition.

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The top three points of the doctoral class are our cooperation with Poland.

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think I've been interrupting you.

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm asking a small question.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm actually quite welcome to do this.

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Otherwise, I might talk about it until the end.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So the bandgap of the semiconductor is about a few eV.

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So the photon you're talking about is visible light.

174
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Good question.

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm using TiO2 here.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So it's actually not a visible light material.

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Its bandgap is 3.2 eV.

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
3.2 eV?

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, and then...

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Oh, is it a near-infrared?

181
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Near-infrared.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Near-infrared.

183
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So in fact, TiO2 can only absorb ultraviolet light.

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
OK.

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So it's just eV level.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So we have a lot of researchers who want to modify the material.

188
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Make its bandgap smaller.

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then we can absorb the wavelength of ultraviolet light to the wavelength of visible light.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That is, it can really be used for solar energy.

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because only 4% of solar energy is ultraviolet light.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
In fact, more than 90% is visible light or infrared light bandgap.

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
OK.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Got it.

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
OK, thank you.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
OK, thank you.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
OK, so we're working with Boron.

198
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm just going to talk a little bit about what we did before.

199
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Then we designed a large-scale light-emitting reaction.

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Because before that, a lot of teams were lab-scale.

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They only do it in the lab.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So we want to be able to test whether this thing can actually be used in practical.

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So we designed a large-scale light-emitting reactor.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Its scale is about 1 meter.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We can see from this picture.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The picture on the right is about 1 meter.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So we filled our catalyst, which is our antifreeze, in the outer layer of the tube and the tube.

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then we see that we've actually installed a light tube.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And we're going to blow these reactions with these light tubes.

210
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And then we're going to put the results we made before.

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The y-axis is the concentration.

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We reflect the concentration of the toxic gas NO.

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The horizontal axis is the time.

214
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
At initial concentration, we can see that NO is about 250 to 200 ppm.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
After the reflection of light, it does reduce our toxic gas.

216
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's about 50 ppm.

217
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So we're going to calculate their NOx removal efficiency, which is about 75%.

218
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's what I'm talking about.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Because you can see that his NOx removal efficiency is only 75%.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So we want to be able to further improve its removal efficiency.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So what about this part?

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How do you say?

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If you meet someone who does the light brittle field today,

224
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you don't understand anything, it doesn't matter.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You just ask him, how much is your NOx?

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That will make you feel that he thinks, oh, you might be an expert in this field.

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's why I'm going to put this thing on.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The definition of NOx is actually that it can absorb as much light as it can.

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And then convert it into how many moles of electrons to participate in the reaction.

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So, in theory, if a light can produce an electron to react,

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This value will be at most one.

232
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then we're going to compare the light reflectors that we've tested in the lab before.

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Compare it with the light reflectors in our factory.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Their quantum yaw is actually on a similar scale.

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And then even the light reflectors in the factory,

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
His quantum yaw is better than him.

237
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So we guess why he's better.

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's because in our design,

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
His light tube is actually in the reaction.

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He's this box, he's going to be covered.

241
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So he can effectively use all the functions to prevent the dissolution of light.

242
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay, so the next study,

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We're trying to make our materials better,

244
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
To make it more light efficient.

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So, someone came up with a thing called titanium dioxide nano sheets.

246
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This is the most traditional integrated Tl2.

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you actually magnify it to a large size,

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It looks like this under the microscope.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
An octahedron.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What about this octahedron?

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's our traditional titanium dioxide.

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But there are scientists who have found that.

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's call this side this direction.

254
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You can see the definition of this XYZ.

255
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
X is called 110.

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Y is our 010.

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's the same as our previous mathematical definition.

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So we're going to call the yellow side the gold side of 001.

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And then the red side is the gold side of 101.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So we see that the traditional titanium dioxide,

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's not actually exposed to the gold side of 001.

262
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's mostly the gold side of 101.

263
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Scientists have found that the gold side of 001 is more responsive than the gold side of 101.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But it's because it's more responsive.

265
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So it's actually not stable in thermodynamics.

266
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So it's not easy to synthesize.

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's why the gold side of the tradition is mainly 101.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And then it looks like this.

269
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So in our research, we want to go.

270
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So in our research, we want to go.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Let him expose more of this 001 side.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let him be more reflective.

273
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And then by computer calculations.

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
They found that when we put the gold of TiO2,

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The gold of TiO2,

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's a different element that can reduce its stomach.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's the stomach of each of their gold surfaces.

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.

279
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And then they found that if they mixed the Fu element,

281
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It can make this gold of 001 the most stable.

282
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You can see that the black dot represents the gold of 001.

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The black dot represents the gold of 001.

284
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can see that the black dot is actually lower than the white.

285
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It means that its stomach is actually more stable.

286
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And then for other elements,

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It doesn't have the same effect.

288
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So we try to...

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So we try to...

290
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So we try to...

291
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The one above you is the image of the electronic microscope, right?

292
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So you are actually...

293
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.

294
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.

295
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But you use this, what is it called?

296
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's a single crystal, not a big one.

297
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's a single crystal, not a big one.

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You mean the Taisha and Danjing?

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because you look like a small piece now.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But if you grow a crystal today,

301
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's the Tetra Hyperion you just made.

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Grow it to a super perfect and super big one.

303
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's a single crystal as big as a fist.

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's a single crystal as big as a fist.

305
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,

307
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's going to have a very small surface area.

308
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because it means it's a very large particle.

309
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
For our good reaction,

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Surface area is a very important thing.

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
under each grain of material.

314
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.

316
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.

317
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.

318
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So we care about the surface area.

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's better to be very fine.

320
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So your question is,

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If the particles are too large, it means the surface area is very low.

322
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So we want the particles to be smaller and better.

323
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So you want to know why people make nanoparticles.

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Because nanoparticles means the particles are small.

325
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And nanoparticles means the surface area is high.

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,

327
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,

328
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
the quantum efficiency can be up to 30% or 40% or something like that.

329
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.

330
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.

331
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They are combined into a perfect crystal.

332
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is what they are doing.

333
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But for practical use,

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
they hope that the smaller the particle, the better.

335
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I see. I understand. Thank you.

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I have another question.

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Someone asked,

338
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Fu and Xi are not all black below?

339
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Fu and Xi are not all black below?

340
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes. So it means that Xi is also good.

341
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you use Xi to synthesize,

342
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it will be more than 101.

343
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But Fu's overall energy is lower.

344
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Its scale is less than 0.

345
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.

346
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.

347
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Both are good,

348
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
but Fu is better.

349
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But a follow-up question.

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If the industry is so big,

351
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
the cost should be much lower, right?

352
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's right.

353
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This is more of a fundamental research.

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If it is applied,

355
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
there will be a difference in cost.

356
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Various facilities,

357
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
factories,

358
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the cost of handling Xi should be very low.

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You can imagine that Fu's amount of friction

360
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
accounts for about 0.1% of the overall cost.

361
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So Fu is very little.

362
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's mainly the process of friction.

363
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So the cost is not bad.

364
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes. TI2 is very cheap.

365
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So it's still OK.

366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OK. I'll go on.

367
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So we actually

368
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
added some Fu atoms during the synthesis

369
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to form the Titanium Nanosheets we just talked about.

370
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This is obvious from the appearance.

371
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SG is actually a

372
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
carbon dioxide that is synthesized in a traditional way.

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So it's actually a granule.

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Here we just

375
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
control the ratio of their precursors.

376
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So they are all nanosheets.

377
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can see that they are obviously a granule structure.

378
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then

379
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
how do we

380
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
explain that

381
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
this surface is 001?

382
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We will use TEM to explain that this surface is 001.

383
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Because you can't say that you set this 001,

384
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it's 001. You have to explain something.

385
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Our method is to continue to magnify TEM.

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Then if you

387
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
magnify it for the area, you can actually see their

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
diameter, their despacing.

389
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
According to the measurement, we know that their diameter

390
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is about 0.239 nanometers.

391
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So the despacing corresponded to

392
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
is actually the same as their

393
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
calculation value of 0.235.

394
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Then we can say for sure

395
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that this direction is

396
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
our 001 side.

397
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This picture is actually the side picture.

398
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
In fact, we will look like this

399
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
from the side of it.

400
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
B and C are actually its covers.

401
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So we can see that the top is actually

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
the 001 side.

403
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Then we will use

404
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
XRD to confirm that our

405
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
service source is really involved in it.

406
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
XRD is for their

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
diameter.

408
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
XRD is made up of the analysis material by the diameter.

409
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You can see

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
about 25-26 degrees.

411
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You can find that

412
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
SG and P25 are actually

413
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
a traditional TIL2,

414
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
a traditional granulated TIL2.

415
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Then their wind is probably in this position.

416
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Then I use the line to mark this part.

417
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
In fact, you can find that these three are our

418
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
nanometers of our synthesis.

419
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Their wind is actually deviated.

420
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This deviation can actually point out that

421
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
because its flux is involved in its diameter,

422
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
in fact, if its diameter is getting bigger,

423
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
we are based on our Bragg law.

424
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You can know that if the diameter is getting bigger,

425
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
the D spacing is getting bigger,

426
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
it will change its theta value,

427
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
so that the wind is deviated.

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So we use XRD to confirm that

429
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
its flux is involved in its diameter.

430
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Then this is

431
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
XRD's light-electromagnetic chart.

432
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We can use this to analyze its

433
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
TIL.

434
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Because TIL is an excess metal,

435
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
so in fact, TIL may exist in 2, 3, 4.

436
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We want to know how many of them

437
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
exist in our carbon dioxide.

438
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
From this chart, we can find that

439
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
TIL is mainly a 4-car.

440
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
In fact, in our carbon dioxide plate,

441
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
we will find that it has more TIL.

442
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
This wind actually represents

443
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
TIL's wind.

444
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Then after our calculation,

445
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
we can know that TIL's wind,

446
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
TIL's content is probably

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
about 20% for the plate.

448
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Then we can find that

449
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TIL is mainly a 4-car.

450
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then we can find that

451
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
TIL's wind,

452
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
TIL's content is probably

453
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
about 20% for the plate.

454
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Then we can find that

455
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
TIL's wind,

456
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
TIL's content is probably

457
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
about 20% for the plate.

458
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Then we can find that

459
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
TIL's wind,

460
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
TIL's content is probably

461
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
about 20% for the plate.

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Then we can find that

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
TIL's wind,

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
TIL's content is probably

465
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
about 20% for the plate.

466
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Then we can find that

467
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
TIL's wind,

468
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
about 20% for the plate.

470
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Then we can find that

about 20% for the plate.

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Then we can find that

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
about 20% for the plate.

478
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then we can find that

about 20% for the plate.

486
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Then we can find that
