00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello everyone, welcome to this week's Terra Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. I am currently studying high-energy physics experiments at the University of California.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Before we officially start, let's first introduce what kind of organization Project Terra is.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
In fact, as we wrote on the website, our goal is to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world, exchange results and trends in Taiwan's academic circles overseas,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
and provide each other with a platform for effective communication.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
To put it simply, we hope to establish a platform that helps Taiwanese from all over the world engage in research and work to communicate with each other quickly and timely.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
We will hold a webcast like today every week.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
The speakers are basically our members, and the audience can sign up online.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
The topic of the speech is based on the results of the speaker's research, review his current development in his special field,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
and share new ideas, plans, or opportunities for cooperation.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Project Terra is currently a fully self-funded, fully volunteer organization.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Our staff are basically all doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
You can see the About page on our website.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
I want to add that we recently added a lot of staff who may not have been updated to the website.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
The most important purpose of a project like this is to fully open up, share and cooperate.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
The more friends who are willing to join us, share and help each other,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
we can move towards the goals we all want.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
I also hope that it will be helpful to Taiwan's academic circle and everyone's research career, or to transfer jobs in the future.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
If you feel that you support our ideas, or are passionate about sharing your very passionate research,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
you can consider joining our members, and you will continue to receive our speech and activity information.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Of course, you can also go to our Facebook fan page and continue to follow our news.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
We also want to emphasize that we have no profit at all.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
If you are willing to share with other Taiwanese, it will be the biggest reward for us.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
It is also the biggest help to other friends who work in the academic circle.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
This is the introduction of TARA.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Next, I want to introduce our speaker.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
We are honored to invite Zheng Yunting today.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Zheng Yunting is currently studying physics at the California Institute of Technology.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
He is currently a doctoral candidate.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Yunting graduated from the Department of Physics in 2014 and joined the Caltech Research Institute.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
He is currently studying his doctorate.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
His special field is observational cosmology.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
He will introduce to us today that he is doing a data analysis project.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It is a rocket project.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
There is one more thing to remind everyone.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
In order to let the speaker feel our enthusiasm,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
the microphone must be turned on when applauding, so that he can hear the voice.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Let's applaud and welcome Yunting to give us this speech.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Thank you everyone.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I am Zheng Yunting. I am studying my PhD at Caltech.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Thank you to my office mate, Zhang Yanyong, for the introduction.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
The topic I am going to talk about today is

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Measuring Extragalactic Background Light at Optical and Near-Infrared.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
This is a project I am doing.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I am doing its data analysis.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
What I am going to talk about today is more focused on

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
the background in this field.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
What do we want to measure?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
What do we want to understand?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What is a signal?

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Let me start by introducing the history of our universe.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
This is the universe we know so far.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
We can start from the left.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
The left is the earliest period.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
We have inflation and Big Bang.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Inflation is the theory of explosion in Chinese.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Big Bang is the beginning of the universe.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
In the very early period,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
the universe is very small and hot.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Everything inside is very hot and oily.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
As the universe expands,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
the gas will expand.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
At a certain point in time,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
the temperature in the universe is low enough.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
The electrons and protons in the gas

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
will combine to form hydrogen.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
This process is called recombination.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
After recombination,

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
there are a lot of photons in the universe.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Photons are easily scattered with free electrons.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
After recombination,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
there are almost no free electrons in the universe.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
These photons will not become long.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
We can see the photons emitted at that time.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
This is called a cosmic microwave background or CMB.

06:12.000 --> 06:22.000
This is the earliest signal we can measure in cosmology.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
After recombination and CMB,

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
a lot of protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
During this period,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
the universe is full of neutral hydrogen and hydrogen.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
This period is called the Dark Age.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Because it is very dark,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
there are no photons like the CMB at that time.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
However, there are no stars and galaxies yet.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
The universe during this period is completely black.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
During this period,

07:06.000 --> 07:16.000
there will be some density fluctuations in the universe.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
These density fluctuations are because of gravity.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
As time goes by,

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
there will be more matter coming in.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
The main component is dark matter.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
These dark matter may form heavier and condensed structures.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We call this dark matter halo.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Because there is a strong gravitational potential in the halo,

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
the background gases such as hydrogen will also gather here.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
When the gathering becomes compact,

08:01.000 --> 08:12.000
it will cause a fusion reaction and form the first star or galaxy.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
After a period of time,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
the universe begins to form stars and galaxies.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
After these stars and galaxies form,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
they will release a lot of photons.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
If the energy of the photons is strong enough,

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
the energy gap between the hydrogen and the gas will be strong enough.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
The gas will separate the hydrogen nearby.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
You can see that there are some separated areas on this map.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
We call this ionizing bubble.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
This process is called reionization.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
As time goes by,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
there will be more and more stars and galaxies in the universe.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
It will ionize the hydrogen nearby.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
At the end,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
if you have enough galaxies,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
you will separate all the hydrogen in the universe.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
The gases outside the galaxy are all ionized.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
This is our current universe.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
This is the history of the development of the universe.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
What I'm going to study now is called an extra-galactic background light.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I have a question.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
What if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, okay.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I see.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I see.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I see.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Can you see it clearly like this?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Actually, I think it's pretty clear.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Okay, then I'll do it like this.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I also think traffic lights are more convenient.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
So, what I'm going to measure is the extra-galactic background light,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
or EVL.

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
In the literature, the word galactic refers to our own galaxy.

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
So, extra-galactic is outside our own galaxy.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Background light refers to everything outside the galaxy.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
So, the EVL we measure is the time in the history of the universe.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
So, it's like this.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
You can see CMB from the beginning,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
and then there's Dark Age,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
and then there's a lot of stars and galaxies.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And then they emit light.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
The spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
So, the spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
So, the spectrum is the light emitted by the different wavelengths.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
So, next I'm going to introduce the spectrum of EDL.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And these data on the diagram show the subjects all of the EMB measurements.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
And these data on the diagram show the subjects all of the EMB measurements.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
And you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
and you can see that they're all doing at different wavelengths,

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
and I'm going to share a little bit about what each wavelength does for you.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
and I'm going to share a little bit about what each wavelength does for you.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So, let's look at the high-energy and low-energy one first.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
The high-energy one is GAMMA RAY and X-ray.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The high-energy one is GAMMA RAY and X-ray.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
The main source of these high-energy photons is called

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
the Active Galactic Nuclei from the AGM.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
The main source of these high-energy photons is called the Active Galactic Nuclei from the AGM.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
These are billions of black holes in the center of each galaxy

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
These are billions of black holes in the center of each galaxy

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
These black holes accelerate the heat emanated from galaxies

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
These black holes accelerate the heat emitted from galaxies

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
These black holes accelerate the heat emanated from galaxies

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
These black holes acceleration leads to både  coated with aurorae

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
These black holes acceleration leads to béocte

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
These black holes acceleration leads to béocte

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
These high-energy photons secure the Przybyszane

12:40.000 --> 12:42.540
These high-energy photons secure the Psi

12:42.540 --> 12:45.620
These high-energy photons secure the Psi

12:45.620 --> 12:47.020
These high-energy photons secure the Psi

12:47.020 --> 12:50.020
These high-energy photons secure the Psi

12:50.020 --> 12:53.020
These high-energy photons secure the Phi

12:53.020 --> 12:56.020
These high-energy photons secure the Phi

13:04.020 --> 13:07.020
We also have low-bout of agaric compounds

13:07.040 --> 13:10.040
which are synchrotron radiation

13:10.040 --> 13:13.040
which is when gas is heated,

13:13.040 --> 13:16.040
which is when gas is heated,

13:16.040 --> 13:19.040
or accelerated to a very high speed.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.040
We don't have much data on UV

13:28.040 --> 13:31.040
We don't have much data on UV

13:31.040 --> 13:34.040
We don't have much data on UV

13:34.080 --> 13:37.080
and the experiment result was mere readings

13:37.080 --> 13:40.080
And the experiment result was mean readings

13:40.080 --> 13:43.080
And the experiment result was mere readings

13:53.080 --> 13:56.080
So we very rarely meet UV in astro galactic.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.080
So we very rarely meet UV in assegalactic.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.080
So we very rarely meet UV in astro galactic.

14:02.120 --> 14:14.120
This peak was the oscillation of Cosmic microwave background in 30s

14:14.120 --> 14:14.120


14:14.120 --> 14:22.120
These are the two small bumps, one in the optical and one in the infrared.

14:22.120 --> 14:28.120
These two mainly come from the star emission in each galaxy.

14:28.120 --> 14:33.120
Star emission is on the optical side.

14:33.120 --> 14:40.120
In the infrared, it is the emission of dust in the galaxy.

14:40.120 --> 14:52.120
These dusts absorb the starlight and emit thermal radiation.

14:52.120 --> 14:57.120
This thermal radiation is in the infrared.

14:57.120 --> 15:09.120
In the infrared, half of the starlight is emitted by the optical, and the other half is absorbed by the dust.

15:09.120 --> 15:19.120
The wavelengths I'm going to talk about today are in the optical.

15:19.120 --> 15:27.120
If we zoom in, we can see that there is a lot of different data here.

15:27.120 --> 15:35.120
This is the fine infrared bump, and this is the optical down near infrared.

15:35.120 --> 15:42.120
You can see that there is a lot of different data here.

15:42.120 --> 15:50.120
Each data is measured at a different value in the same wavelength.

15:50.120 --> 15:58.120
The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.

15:58.120 --> 16:06.120
The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.

16:06.120 --> 16:16.120
The reason why these data are so inconsistent is because they are used in many different ways.

16:16.120 --> 16:26.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

16:26.120 --> 16:34.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

16:34.120 --> 16:42.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

16:42.120 --> 16:50.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

16:50.120 --> 16:58.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

16:58.120 --> 17:06.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:06.120 --> 17:14.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:14.120 --> 17:22.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:22.120 --> 17:30.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:30.120 --> 17:38.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:38.120 --> 17:46.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:46.120 --> 17:54.120
The first method is called Galaxy Counts.

17:54.120 --> 18:02.120
The second method is called Absolute Photometry.

18:02.120 --> 18:10.120
The second method is called Absolute Photometry.

18:10.120 --> 18:18.120
The third method is called Absolute Photometry.

18:18.120 --> 18:26.120
The fourth method is called Absolute Photometry.
