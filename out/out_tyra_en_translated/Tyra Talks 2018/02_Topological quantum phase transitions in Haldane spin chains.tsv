0	4000	Q&A
4000	23000	Hello, I am today's representative host, Zhang Yanyong, because our host, Zhang Jianyuan, he is actually more suitable, because he is doing Qubits, doing condensed matter, but he is now stuck on the road, he has no time for transportation, so I will represent the host.
23000	43000	Let me introduce our speaker today. Our speaker today is Dr. Zeng Yuqing. The topic he is going to talk to us today is ... I want to read it right, wait a minute, I suddenly can't find it, wait a minute, wait a minute.
43000	68000	Topological quantum phase transitions in Haldane spin chains. This is a very popular topic, because in 2016 or 2017, Topological Matter won the Nobel Prize, so we have always hoped that we could invite an expert to introduce to us what topological phases are.
68000	95000	Then, Zeng Yuqing, in 2005, got a college degree from Donghai University, a physics major, right? Then he went to serve in the military, and then served in the military for 1.5 years, but he served in the military at Donghai University. Why?
95000	99000	After I served in the military, I returned to Donghai University as a research assistant.
125000	143000	Then there is a published paper in PRB, if you are interested, because I don't have that number, so you can directly ask our speaker for this thing. Then he transferred to Central University and completed his Ph.D. degree. The main function is also condensed matter theory.
143000	166000	At present, Zeng Yuqing is at the University of Kent in the UK, and he is now focusing on numerical study on the time-reversal invariant fractional topological insulator. This is a very hot topic, so we don't have much to say, we applaud and welcome today's speaker. Oh, if you want to applaud or ask a question, remember to turn on the microphone.
173000	181000	Let's get started. Today I prepared some props.
203000	214000	I have some props. You can play with some props later.
233000	250000	I will talk about some of the things I have done before, which will be more professional. First of all, what is physics?
250000	265000	What we mainly learn in physics is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is like classical mechanics, which is mechanics, or kinetic mechanics of electricity, quantum mechanics, thermal mechanics, and statistical mechanics.
265000	284000	This whole thing is actually studying the interaction between time, space, and matter. The interaction between matter has, for example, strong, weak, electromagnetic, or gravity.
284000	305000	You can take the whole world, these substances, as if they were actors on stage. The stage is the background between time and space, and there will be some interaction between the actor and the actor.
306000	314000	The whole thing will form a movie or a stage play.
315000	334000	What about matter? This is from when I was very young, for example, in high school or elementary school, I learned that we can classify matter in this way.
334000	345000	First, divide it into solid matter or mixtures. Mixtures, such as beer, milk tea, or air, are mixtures.
346000	357000	For example, alcohol, water, and many other substances, such as beer, flowers, and so on.
357000	365000	For example, most of the air is 4 out of 5 gas, and 1 out of 5 oxygen, for example.
366000	384000	Pure matter can be divided into elements and mixtures. For example, the elements in the cycle table, such as gold, iron, oxygen, and O2.
385000	393000	For example, the previously well-known graphene, which is basically carbon.
394000	405000	For example, alcohol is a mixture of alcohol and water.
406000	415000	Alcohol has a chemical form, such as CH3CH2OH, which is alcohol.
415000	424000	Chlorine is also a mixture of pure matter.
424000	429000	Oxygen is also a mixture of pure matter.
429000	436000	For example, ice is water, which is the solid of water.
436000	441000	Ice is also pure matter, which is H2O.
442000	450000	This classification is probably a little bit of preliminary understanding of matter.
450000	458000	To understand this understanding further, we can see that matter has many states.
458000	462000	This state is called phase.
462000	469000	There is a change between the phase and the phase, which is called phase change.
469000	481000	For example, the ice or water we just talked about is under pressure in the horizontal axis and temperature in the vertical axis.
481000	490000	For example, at the bottom of atmospheric pressure, below 0 ° C, it is solid.
490000	496000	This side will be liquid and this side will be gas.
496000	505000	The red line is from here, it will pass through a waste point and then become water vapor.
505000	513000	From here, it will pass through this ice point and solidify into ice.
513000	515000	For example, this picture.
515000	519000	Of course, you can't see the water vapor with your naked eye.
519000	523000	Because the water vapor is transparent and colorless.
524000	530000	If it is connected to this water drop on the glass, it will become a liquid.
530000	532000	You can see that this is water.
532000	535000	This is the water we usually see.
535000	539000	Ice is solid.
539000	543000	This picture is in our present.
545000	551000	It's snowing in the UK recently, and it's cold.
552000	560000	After the snow, many people want to do an experiment.
560000	571000	Put the liquid nitrogen on the snowman and then destroy it.
571000	574000	See what the result is.
574000	583000	In short, this picture of water should have been seen in elementary school.
583000	588000	I don't know if there is any problem.
588000	593000	If not, I want to emphasize that there is a critical point here.
593000	618000	The meaning of this critical point is that if the temperature and pressure are very high from here to the critical point, you will not be able to distinguish whether the water is a liquid or a gas.
619000	625000	After this critical point, there is no red line.
625000	631000	The red line on the left has been extended.
631000	637000	This point stops at this critical point.
637000	644000	So if this side is gas, this side is liquid, this side is solid.
644000	652000	This line completely separates solid and liquid.
652000	661000	But here you can adjust the temperature and pressure appropriately.
661000	665000	Then let it slowly go around this critical point from here.
665000	670000	Then enter another item.
671000	685000	In other words, the phase of the liquid and the phase of the gas are the same phase.
685000	693000	The three-dimensional picture of water here is actually only two phases.
693000	696000	There are only two images like this.
696000	700000	There should be no problem.
700000	705000	This is a relaxing video.
705000	719000	A few days ago, we put the liquid and gas on the snowman.
719000	723000	Many people came to see.
723000	726000	There are about 100 people here.
726000	729000	Other dramas have come to see.
729000	732000	I think this is interesting.
733000	744000	You can see that gas is also a pure material.
744000	749000	Pure materials have three-dimensional pictures of water like just now.
749000	752000	Now pour out the liquid and gas.
752000	760000	The liquid and gas are about 70K.
760000	766000	It's about 100 degrees below zero.
790000	808000	The temperature of the ice is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.
808000	814000	The temperature of the liquid and gas is very high compared to the temperature of the liquid and gas.
814000	820000	It turned the ice into a lower temperature.
820000	831000	If you look at the image of the water just now, it is still solid.
832000	835000	That's about it.
835000	838000	What is a phase?
838000	848000	What does this material mean?
848000	851000	You have an external parameter.
851000	856000	For example, you just saw that there is temperature and pressure.
857000	866000	Under the external parameter, the material is in a huge state, a macro state.
866000	868000	What are the external parameters?
868000	878000	For example, temperature pressure, magnetic field, or external control, external control.
878000	880000	For example, you add a power plant.
880000	889000	Or you use other elements to replace these compounds.
889000	891000	You do some mixing.
891000	895000	This mixing can also be regarded as an external parameter.
895000	899000	Mainly these parameters, you do these modifications.
899000	906000	It will affect these, because the material is composed of those atoms.
906000	908000	It is composed of those particles.
908000	916000	If you modify these external parameters, it will affect the interaction between the particles.
916000	925000	If it affects the interaction between the particles, it will have different phases.
925000	937000	The higher the temperature, the more chaotic the material is.
938000	952000	But if you have an interaction, the material may have a different order.
952000	956000	What is a macro state?
956000	960000	For example, the three-phase change just now.
960000	962000	That is, the liquid, solid, and gas.
962000	972000	But it is not that only the liquid, solid, and gas are a macro state.
972000	974000	For example, conductivity.
974000	977000	Conductivity is also a macro state.
977000	981000	Magnetic field is also a macro state.
981000	983000	For example, mercury.
984000	998000	In 1911, it was discovered by Ernst that when the temperature dropped very low, it suddenly became a superconductor.
999000	1003000	This conductivity is its conductor.
1003000	1005000	For example, the horizontal axis is the temperature.
1005000	1013000	When the temperature is very high, the temperature is absolute.
1013000	1020000	From this place, you can see that there is a conductor here to meet the Ohm's law.
1020000	1026000	The lower the temperature, the smaller the conductor, but there is still a conductor.
1026000	1038000	But when the temperature is about 4K or 4.2K, the conductor suddenly disappears to almost none.
1038000	1041000	It is completely none.
1041000	1046000	This can be regarded as a phase change.
1046000	1051000	Because this is a macro state, the whole change.
1051000	1055000	Because there is a conductor here, there is no conductor here at all.
1055000	1060000	Here is the general conductor.
1060000	1066000	On the left side, it suddenly becomes a superconductor.
1066000	1070000	The superconductor has great application value.
1070000	1087000	For example, later we found that mercury is a pure element, but other compounds may also become superconductors.
1087000	1090000	Like these high-temperature superconductors.
1090000	1099000	High-temperature superconductors can become superconductors as long as they are at the temperature of the liquid atom.
1099000	1102000	For example, these same compounds.
1102000	1107000	You will see that there is an X in these different compounds.
1107000	1109000	There is an X here, right?
1109000	1112000	This X is when you synthesize this compound.
1112000	1115000	How much ratio do you want to put in?
1115000	1117000	How much ratio do you put in?
1117000	1121000	Then you go to burn this compound.
1121000	1126000	Then you mean that this X is your external parameter.
1126000	1129000	Your center axis is your temperature.
1129000	1133000	Different temperatures and different cross-sections.
1133000	1136000	The horizontal axis is the cross-section.
1136000	1141000	Write a P on the right is that you are in the electric field.
1141000	1143000	That's what this X means.
1143000	1147000	Write a N on the left is that you are in the electron field.
1147000	1151000	Here is electron dot and hole dot.
1151000	1156000	This place is when you are not involved.
1156000	1162000	Here is a superconductor.
1162000	1169000	When you are involved to a certain extent, when you drop to a low temperature, it becomes a superconductor.
1169000	1174000	So this place, this range is a superconductor phase.
1174000	1178000	This range is a superconductor phase.
1178000	1181000	What is a superconductor?
1181000	1184000	Then go on.
1184000	1186000	Magnetic.
1186000	1189000	In fact, there are many kinds of magnetic.
1189000	1192000	What we usually see is a magnet.
1192000	1194000	Like this magnet.
1194000	1200000	When we were in elementary school, we would take the magnet and sprinkle some magnetic powder to look at the magnetic field.
1200000	1206000	The magnetic nature of this magnet is called magnetism.
1207000	1212000	That is to say, there are many magnetic fields inside the magnet.
1212000	1214000	Many small magnetic fields.
1214000	1220000	If these magnetic fields are originally messy,
1220000	1227000	If the temperature is very high, then these magnetic fields will be randomly arranged.
1227000	1232000	After randomly arranged, the whole is not magnetic.
1232000	1236000	But if the temperature drops,
1236000	1242000	Then there will be some interaction between this magnetic field and the magnetic field.
1242000	1251000	These interactions will make these magnetic fields align in the same direction.
1251000	1257000	When everyone is lined up in roughly the same direction,
1257000	1262000	The overall magnetic nature will be displayed.
1262000	1264000	You will see that it is a magnet.
1264000	1267000	It is the overall direction.
1267000	1272000	For example, this arrow is N-level, this is S-level.
1272000	1275000	If everyone is messy, then the whole is offset.
1275000	1281000	I found a YouTube video.
1281000	1283000	Probably like this.
1284000	1286000	Can you see it now?
1286000	1288000	There should be no problem, right?
1288000	1291000	Yes, I can see it.
1291000	1295000	There is a piece of iron on the top.
1295000	1299000	After the magnet is burned red,
1299000	1309000	The red magnet will be messy.
1310000	1312000	Then there is no magnetic nature.
1312000	1314000	But after it slowly cools down,
1314000	1318000	When the temperature is low enough,
1318000	1323000	Because it has an interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic field,
1323000	1327000	When the temperature is low enough,
1327000	1330000	It will align everyone in the same direction.
1330000	1332000	In the same direction, there is a magnetic field.
1332000	1337000	If there is a magnetic field, it becomes iron magnetic nature.
1337000	1341000	Iron magnetic nature is the meaning of this magnet.
1341000	1344000	There should be no problem.
1344000	1350000	Another one is that it is well arranged,
1350000	1356000	But it does not have the magnetic force of the seed.
1356000	1359000	The magnet of the seed.
1359000	1372000	Although the magnet is iron magnetic nature,
1372000	1374000	What does iron magnetic nature mean?
1374000	1379000	That is to say,
1379000	1381000	How does this magnetic force come from?
1381000	1387000	Part of it is the orbital momentum of the electron.
1387000	1390000	And the other part is the magnetic field.
1390000	1397000	If these magnetic fields are interspersed,
1397000	1401000	For example, here is up, down, up, down, up, down, up,
1401000	1403000	Intersected and arranged,
1403000	1406000	It is also well arranged,
1406000	1413000	But it does not have the iron magnetic nature of the magnet just now.
1413000	1416000	But it still has a magnetic field.
1416000	1426000	Although this iron magnetic nature does not have the magnetic force of the seed,
1426000	1436000	But it is completely different from the iron that was completely messed up just now.
1436000	1442000	Because the magnetic field of the burning iron is messy.
1443000	1451000	This iron magnetic nature is very well arranged.
1451000	1461000	After that, I will mainly talk about the magnetic fields of one-dimensional.
1461000	1464000	What if it is arranged into a chain?
1464000	1468000	Of course, this is the intention below.
1469000	1471000	Because you are not taking a magnet,
1471000	1479000	Because there are countless magnetic fields in a magnet itself.
1479000	1482000	Or there are many magnetic fields inside.
1482000	1485000	Then we will discuss later.
1485000	1490000	The magnetic field is arranged into one-dimensional.
1490000	1496000	Then this magnetic field has some interaction with the magnetic field next door.
1496000	1502000	Will this cause a whole?
1502000	1506000	Will there be a state of order?
1506000	1513000	Or is it a whole?
1513000	1515000	What is the order?
1515000	1520000	Simply put, everything has an order.
1520000	1525000	For example, electronics also has an order.
1525000	1528000	Light also has an order.
1528000	1530000	Paper also has an order.
1530000	1532000	Quark also has an order.
1532000	1536000	Everything has an order.
1536000	1545000	The order is a basic physical nature.
1545000	1549000	Light also has an order.
1549000	1551000	The order of light is 1.
1552000	1562000	The z-direction of light can only be positive or negative 1.
1562000	1570000	So we see that light has a polarizing direction.
1570000	1572000	There is a left-handed light and a right-handed light.
1572000	1574000	Light has an order.
1574000	1576000	The order of light is 1.
1577000	1581000	The order of light should be divided into two categories.
1581000	1592000	One is 1 in 2, 3 in 2, 5 in 2, 7 in 2.
1592000	1598000	This kind of half-order should be half-order.
1598000	1602000	This kind is called Phenol.
1602000	1605000	Another kind is the order of the whole.
1605000	1609000	For example, the order is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
1609000	1611000	This kind is called Phosphorus.
1611000	1616000	Light has an order of 1, so it is Phosphorus.
1616000	1623000	Electronics has an order of 1 in 2, so it is Phenol.
1624000	1628000	Sorry, go on.
1628000	1630000	That's right.
1630000	1631000	Can I?
1631000	1633000	Yes, you can.
1633000	1652000	So the spin-chain discussed later is related to the order of the whole or half-order.
1652000	1658000	These are two very different types.
1662000	1666000	Before talking about these orders,
1666000	1670000	let's talk about symmetry.
1670000	1674000	What is asymmetry?
1674000	1677000	What is asymmetry?
1677000	1689000	Asymmetry means that after you have done a certain operation, the result does not change.
1689000	1692000	For example, as I just said,
1692000	1700000	parallel symmetry, rotation symmetry, mirror symmetry, time parallel, time inverse, any operation.
1700000	1708000	Can you see me now?
1708000	1710000	Yes, I can see you.
1710000	1713000	For example, I take this.
1713000	1722000	If you don't look at the pattern on this ball,
1722000	1725000	if they are all the same color,
1725000	1728000	if I turn 360 degrees like this,
1728000	1731000	I'll cover it up first,
1731000	1735000	then I'll turn a little bit,
1735000	1736000	and then I'll show you.
1736000	1738000	Then you don't know,
1738000	1743000	you will never be able to tell whether I have turned or not.
1743000	1744000	Right?
1744000	1750000	So it means that this ball has the symmetry of this rotation.
1750000	1752000	But there is already a pattern on it.
1752000	1756000	Of course, this pattern will destroy its rotation.
1756000	1757000	Because I turn like this,
1757000	1759000	you recognize this pattern,
1759000	1762000	you know I have turned.
1762000	1767000	But if this is all blue,
1767000	1771000	then I can turn this three-dimensional corner,
1771000	1773000	this three-dimensional corner.
1774000	1778000	This is a rotation symmetry.
1782000	1784000	This apple,
1784000	1788000	this apple, you have an imagination first,
1788000	1790000	there is a meme here,
1790000	1793000	and then go down here.
1793000	1798000	So if I turn like this,
1798000	1800000	then you will find that it is different.
1800000	1805000	But if I turn like this along this axis,
1805000	1808000	suppose its shape is perfect,
1808000	1815000	then you will see that it also has the symmetry of this rotation.
1815000	1818000	But the symmetry of this rotation,
1818000	1825000	only with this Z axis as the rotation axis,
1825000	1827000	you have this symmetry.
1827000	1829000	I can turn like this.
1829000	1834000	I can also turn like this, right?
1834000	1838000	I can also turn like this.
1838000	1844000	I can also turn like this.
1844000	1853000	The symmetry of this apple is less than the symmetry of this ball.
1853000	1856000	Because it only rotates like this.
1856000	1859000	This ball can rotate in any way.
1862000	1863000	If this is the case,
1863000	1866000	you will see that this and this ring,
1866000	1868000	I made a finger ring,
1868000	1870000	this finger ring is the same,
1870000	1876000	that is, I turn like this,
1876000	1879000	the result does not change.
1879000	1883000	With this bagel,
1883000	1885000	this is also.
1885000	1888000	But if I turn like this,
1891000	1894000	you will not know that I have turned.
1900000	1902000	In this case,
1902000	1906000	if I put a sticker on it,
1906000	1909000	do you know that I have turned?
1909000	1912000	For example, I am very hungry now,
1912000	1914000	let me take a bite.
1918000	1922000	Now after being bitten by me,
1922000	1927000	it has lost the symmetry of this rotation.
1930000	1931000	This is also.
1931000	1933000	This bagel is also.
1933000	1937000	If I don't bite too big,
1937000	1939000	I'll take a bite first.
1939000	1942000	I bought a lot today.
1944000	1945000	I bite a little bit.
1947000	1949000	I don't bite this hole.
1951000	1954000	Then it has no symmetry of this rotation.
1956000	1957000	In other words,
1957000	1961000	what does this bite cause?
1961000	1963000	Caused a defect.
1964000	1965000	Caused a defect.
1965000	1974000	This defect will affect a lot of things.
1977000	1979000	What I'm going to talk about later is TORP.
1981000	1982000	TORP,
1986000	1987000	play a little game first.
1990000	1992000	I have a finger ring here.
1992000	1993000	This finger ring.
2000000	2002000	If I use a pen,
2004000	2006000	many people should know this.
2008000	2009000	If I go from here,
2009000	2011000	then follow this ring,
2012000	2015000	go around like this.
2015000	2016000	Go, go, go,
2021000	2022000	go around,
2022000	2024000	go around and pick it up.
2026000	2030000	Wait for the paper to turn 360 degrees,
2030000	2032000	I'll go back to the original point.
2034000	2037000	These two are not the same.
2038000	2039000	One,
2042000	2044000	I also do this.
2046000	2047000	Like this.
2058000	2060000	I also go back to the original point.
2061000	2062000	But this is not.
2062000	2063000	When doing this,
2064000	2067000	this ring is very different from these two rings.
2070000	2074000	This ring is just like this finger ring.
2074000	2076000	This finger ring is actually the same.
2078000	2080000	I twisted it a little bit.
2080000	2082000	In fact, this ring is just like this.
2083000	2084000	This ring is like this.
2085000	2086000	So you see,
2086000	2087000	I'm drawing black here.
2088000	2089000	If there is,
2090000	2092000	usually there is an ant walking on it.
2093000	2094000	After going around,
2094000	2097000	you will go back to the original place.
2098000	2099000	This ring is like this.
2100000	2101000	This ring is not.
2102000	2105000	This ring is the so-called Mobius ring.
2108000	2112000	If I have an ant here,
2112000	2113000	go like this,
2115000	2116000	go like this,
2117000	2118000	go, go, go,
2120000	2121000	go, go, go,
2122000	2123000	go around,
2124000	2125000	go,
2128000	2129000	go around,
2129000	2130000	it will,
2130000	2131000	it actually,
2131000	2133000	I'm going around now.
2134000	2135000	Go around,
2135000	2138000	the result is that this path runs to the back of this ring.
2138000	2140000	It's not the same as this.
2141000	2143000	After two laps,
2144000	2145000	I will go back to the original point.
2147000	2148000	This is a
2151000	2155000	completely different thing from a few boxes.
2156000	2157000	Oh,
2157000	2159000	go back to the video.
2168000	2169000	That
2170000	2171000	I just said,
2171000	2173000	this is symmetrical.
2175000	2176000	This is symmetrical.
2176000	2177000	That
2178000	2179000	This is
2179000	2181000	The symmetry has been destroyed.
2182000	2183000	That
2183000	2184000	with
2184000	2186000	What does symmetry have to do with it?
2187000	2188000	Because we know
2188000	2189000	that
2190000	2191000	if you
2191000	2192000	if
2193000	2194000	you have a
2195000	2196000	energy or
2196000	2197000	free energy,
2197000	2199000	if it is a certain parameter
2200000	2201000	of the function,
2201000	2202000	then you basically
2202000	2204000	free energy should be like
2205000	2207000	energy is like the lower the better
2207000	2208000	stability
2208000	2209000	that if your
2209000	2210000	first
2210000	2212000	your function is like this
2212000	2213000	that
2213000	2215000	you have a ball here,
2215000	2216000	then it is of course symmetrical.
2216000	2218000	Because this is the point of symmetry.
2219000	2220000	The point of symmetry is of course
2222000	2224000	the lowest point of energy.
2225000	2227000	But if your external parameters
2227000	2228000	change,
2228000	2229000	for example, your temperature
2230000	2231000	temperature changes
2231000	2232000	temperature decreases,
2232000	2234000	your temperature is getting lower and lower,
2234000	2236000	which causes this function to change.
2236000	2237000	At this time,
2237000	2239000	the lowest energy state
2239000	2240000	will not be in
2240000	2241000	this
2241000	2242000	symmetrical state.
2243000	2244000	And it may
2244000	2245000	choose
2245000	2246000	in
2246000	2247000	a certain
2247000	2248000	more
2249000	2250000	free energy
2250000	2251000	lower place
2251000	2252000	that this place
2253000	2254000	that of course
2254000	2255000	every place
2256000	2257000	this place
2257000	2258000	or this place
2259000	2260000	free energy
2260000	2261000	energy is as low
2262000	2263000	as it should be
2264000	2265000	on the left or
2265000	2266000	on the right
2266000	2267000	do not know
2267000	2268000	it may
2268000	2269000	it is
2269000	2270000	it may
2270000	2271000	it
2271000	2272000	has a little bit of
2272000	2273000	orientation
2273000	2274000	to the left
2274000	2275000	or a little bit
2275000	2276000	to the right
2276000	2277000	when it is very natural
2277000	2278000	it will soon
2278000	2279000	run to
2279000	2280000	this stable place
2280000	2281000	that like
2281000	2282000	this place
2282000	2283000	that
2283000	2284000	if it is like this
2284000	2285000	you will find
2285000	2286000	it is not symmetrical
2287000	2288000	you were
2288000	2289000	originally
2289000	2290000	left and right
2290000	2291000	this has a
2291000	2292000	mirror symmetry
2293000	2294000	that is now
2294000	2295000	not symmetrical
2295000	2296000	that is not symmetrical
2297000	2298000	represents
2299000	2300000	a
2300000	2301000	order
2301000	2302000	occurred
2302000	2303000	that is
2303000	2304000	occurred
2305000	2306000	that is
2306000	2307000	a certain
2307000	2308000	like
2308000	2309000	for example,
2309000	2310000	we just
2310000	2311000	looked at
2311000	2312000	that
2312000	2313000	that
2313000	2314000	distance temperature
2314000	2315000	experiment
2315000	2316000	that
2316000	2317000	burning red
2317000	2318000	iron
2318000	2319000	there is no
2319000	2320000	magnetic
2320000	2321000	burning red
2321000	2322000	iron
2322000	2323000	it
2323000	2324000	its magnetic
2324000	2325000	is messy
2325000	2326000	that
2326000	2327000	very messy
2327000	2328000	when
2328000	2329000	magnetic
2329000	2330000	although
2330000	2331000	it has magnetic
2331000	2332000	in every place
2332000	2333000	it has a lot of
2333000	2334000	this
2334000	2335000	that
2335000	2336000	order or
2336000	2337000	magnetic
2337000	2338000	for example,
2338000	2339000	this magnetic
2339000	2340000	that
2340000	2341000	but the temperature
2341000	2342000	is very high
2342000	2343000	it
2343000	2344000	every
2344000	2345000	magnetic
2345000	2346000	are
2346000	2347000	constantly
2347000	2348000	doing
2348000	2349000	this
2349000	2350000	is
2350000	2351000	constantly
2351000	2352000	in

2359000	2360000	the magnetic
2360000	2361000	current
2361000	2362000	it looks messy
2362000	2363000	while the correct values
2363000	2364000	and the negative
2364000	2365000	the正負
2365000	2366000	the positive

2367000	2368000	are
2368000	2369000	going
2369000	2370000	to
2370000	2371000	change
2371000	2372000	the
2372000	2373000	magnetic
2373000	2374000	is messy
2374000	2375000	messy
2375000	2376000	that
2376000	2377000	how to say
2377000	2378000	it is
2378000	2379000	symmetric
2379000	2380000	it
2380000	2381000	magnetic
2381000	2382000	that

2383000	2384000	it
2384000	2385000	hands
2385000	2386000	is very messy
2386000	2387000	or
2387000	2389000	you have a camera
2389000	2391000	you you you this camera
2391000	2392000	to observe
2392000	2393000	and then you
2393000	2395000	shift this camera
2395000	2396000	that you find
2396000	2397000	it still messy
2397000	2398000	as just
2398000	2399000	the same mess
2399000	2400000	is that
2400000	2401000	you can not see what it is
2401000	2403000	you can not tell
2403000	2405000	you have no rotation
2405000	2406000	I did not
2406000	2407000	I did a shift
2407000	2408000	or did a
2408000	2409000	rotation
2409000	2411000	you can not tell
2411000	2412000	so
2412000	2413000	it
2413000	2414000	in the previous
2414000	2415000	film
2415000	2417000	that burning red iron
2417000	2419000	has what symmetry
2419000	2420000	it has
2420000	2422000	symmetry
2422000	2423000	also has
2423000	2424000	symmetry
2424000	2425000	rotation
2425000	2426000	but
2426000	2427000	after the temperature
2427000	2428000	is reduced
2428000	2429000	it
2429000	2430000	because
2430000	2431000	magnetic
2431000	2432000	magnetic
2432000	2433000	between
2433000	2434000	its interaction
2434000	2435000	between
2435000	2436000	the
2436000	2437000	more
2437000	2438000	more
2438000	2439000	strong
2439000	2440000	more obvious

2441000	2442000	hot
2442000	2443000	hot
2443000	2444000	hot
2444000	2445000	not enough
2445000	2446000	to make it
2446000	2447000	to make it messy
2447000	2448000	so it will
2448000	2449000	cause the
2449000	2450000	overall
2450000	2451000	overall
2451000	2452000	magnetic
2452000	2453000	direction

2455000	2456000	that
2456000	2457000	this time
2457000	2458000	if everyone
2458000	2459000	in the same direction
2459000	2460000	when it
2460000	2461000	that you
2461000	2462000	this time
2462000	2463000	you will find
2463000	2464000	that I have
2464000	2465000	no
2465000	2466000	this
2466000	2467000	rotation
2467000	2468000	symmetry
2468000	2469000	is that I
2469000	2470000	rotate
2470000	2471000	symmetry
2471000	2472000	that
2472000	2473000	I
2473000	2474000	that
2474000	2475000	just that direction
2475000	2476000	originally pointed up
2476000	2477000	everyone pointed up
2477000	2478000	that I rotate
2478000	2479000	everyone
2479000	2480000	in one direction
2480000	2481000	you will find that it
2481000	2482000	has changed
2482000	2483000	that
2483000	2484000	is not symmetrical
2484000	2485000	that
2485000	2486000	this is called
2486000	2487000	a

2489000	2490000	symmetry
2490000	2491000	symmetry
2491000	2492000	that
2492000	2493000	symmetry
2493000	2494000	is that it
2494000	2495000	has a sequence
2495000	2496000	that you say
2496000	2497000	it is
2497000	2498000	a change
2498000	2499000	that
2499000	2500000	this is
2500000	2501000	our most
2501000	2502000	traditional
2502000	2503000	ah
2503000	2504000	material
2504000	2505000	to
2505000	2506000	occur
2506000	2507000	that
2507000	2508000	the
2508000	2509000	most
2509000	2510000	most
2510000	2511000	ah
2511000	2512000	a
2512000	2513000	a
2513000	2514000	a
2514000	2515000	recognition
2515000	2516000	is that
2516000	2517000	this is the
2517000	2518000	theory of
2518000	2519000	the

2521000	2522000	that
2522000	2523000	it
2523000	2524000	should
2524000	2525000	be that
2525000	2526000	we have
2526000	2527000	a
2527000	2528000	is that
2528000	2529000	there is a

2537000	2538000	a change
2538000	2539000	that
2539000	2540000	but like just
2540000	2541000	ah
2541000	2542000	sorry
2542000	2543000	interrupt
2543000	2544000	that
2544000	2545000	sequence of
2545000	2546000	English
2546000	2547000	what
2547000	2548000	sorry
2548000	2549000	I just
2549000	2550000	want to
2550000	2551000	continue
2551000	2552000	that
2552000	2553000	that
2553000	2554000	ah
2554000	2555000	that
2555000	2556000	some things
2556000	2557000	are not
2557000	2558000	like this
2558000	2559000	ah
2559000	2560000	that
2561000	2562000	that
2562000	2563000	later
2563000	2564000	later
2564000	2565000	will continue to talk about
2565000	2566000	that
2566000	2567000	that
2567000	2568000	later found
2568000	2569000	ah
2569000	2570000	there is a
2570000	2571000	change
2571000	2572000	ah
2572000	2573000	it
2573000	2574000	is the earliest
2574000	2575000	a
2575000	2576000	Russian
2576000	2577000	ah
2577000	2578000	he called
2578000	2579000	Brzezinski
2579000	2580000	he found
2580000	2581000	he was
2581000	2582000	he was
2582000	2583000	a model
2583000	2584000	that
2584000	2585000	later
2585000	2586000	because he
2586000	2587000	seems to be
2587000	2588000	published in
2588000	2589000	this story
2589000	2590000	is written
2590000	2591000	in Russian
2591000	2592000	and then
2592000	2593000	earlier than
2593000	2594000	Kostelits and
2594000	2595000	Soles
2595000	2596000	that later
2596000	2597000	no one knows
2597000	2598000	that later
2598000	2599000	Kostelits and
2599000	2600000	Soles
2600000	2601000	they also
2601000	2602000	counted a
2602000	2603000	thing
2603000	2604000	and then
2604000	2605000	found that
2605000	2606000	it actually
2606000	2607000	has a
2607000	2608000	change
2608000	2609000	but
2609000	2610000	this model
2610000	2611000	it did not
2611000	2612000	occur symmetrical
2612000	2613000	they do
2613000	2614000	this model
2614000	2615000	is like this
2615000	2616000	just
2616000	2617000	talk about
2617000	2618000	that one
2618000	2619000	that
2619000	2620000	seems to be
2620000	2621000	here
2621000	2622000	this amount
2622000	2623000	as
2623000	2624000	this amount
2624000	2625000	is not
2625000	2626000	a
2626000	2627000	quantity
2627000	2628000	is a
2628000	2629000	quantity
2629000	2630000	is
2630000	2631000	a quantity
2631000	2632000	of words
2632000	2633000	is that
2633000	2634000	he
2634000	2635000	will talk about
2635000	2636000	the amount
2636000	2637000	here
2637000	2638000	is this amount
2638000	2639000	is
2639000	2640000	a
2640000	2641000	quantity
2641000	2642000	you have
2642000	2643000	XY
2643000	2644000	on the
2644000	2645000	plane
2645000	2646000	and then
2646000	2647000	you have
2647000	2648000	on the
2648000	2649000	square
2649000	2650000	every one
2650000	2651000	in this
2651000	2652000	square
2652000	2653000	square
2653000	2654000	every one
2654000	2655000	on the
2655000	2656000	square
2656000	2657000	put a
2657000	2658000	quantity
2658000	2659000	of the
2659000	2660000	corresponding
2660000	2661000	quantity
2661000	2662000	do
2662000	2663000	do
2663000	2664000	just write
2664000	2665000	a
2665000	2666000	internal
2666000	2667000	interaction
2667000	2668000	that
2668000	2669000	this model
2669000	2670000	to see
2670000	2671000	it did not
2671000	2672000	destroy the
2672000	2673000	rotation
2673000	2674000	because
2674000	2675000	I
2675000	2676000	put
2676000	2677000	me
2677000	2678000	in this
2678000	2679000	Z axis
2679000	2680000	as
2680000	2681000	the
2681000	2682000	axis, then
2682000	2683000	I
2683000	2684000	just rotate
2684000	2685000	a few degrees
2685000	2686000	is 0 to
2686000	2687000	2拍
2687000	2688000	0 to 360
2688000	2689000	degrees
2689000	2690000	I just
2690000	2691000	turn a little
2691000	2692000	or turn a
2692000	2693000	lot
2693000	2694000	just turn a
2694000	2695000	few degrees
2695000	2696000	any angle
2696000	2697000	you
2697000	2698000	will
2698000	2699000	say this
2699000	2700000	model
2700000	2701000	this energy is
2701000	2702000	unchanged
2702000	2703000	this
2703000	2704000	unchanged
2704000	2705000	so
2705000	2706000	there
2706000	2707000	is such a
2707000	2708000	continuous
2708000	2709000	rotation
2709000	2710000	symmetry
2710000	2711000	that
2711000	2712000	there was a
2712000	2713000	theorem before
2713000	2714000	called
2714000	2715000	Mermin
2715000	2716000	Wagon
2716000	2717000	theorem
2717000	2718000	is that
2718000	2719000	if you
2719000	2720000	only have
2720000	2721000	the corresponding
2721000	2722000	interaction
2722000	2723000	then
2723000	2724000	you
2724000	2725000	have
2725000	2726000	a
2726000	2727000	continuous
2727000	2728000	symmetry
2728000	2729000	that
2729000	2730000	continuous
2730000	2731000	symmetry
2731000	2732000	that
2732000	2733000	is
2733000	2734000	below
2734000	2735000	the
2735000	2736000	equation
2736000	2737000	but
2737000	2738000	they found
2738000	2739000	that
2739000	2740000	in fact
2740000	2741000	even if there is no
2741000	2742000	continuous
2742000	2743000	symmetry
2743000	2744000	it
2744000	2745000	will not
2745000	2746000	occur
2746000	2747000	symmetry
2747000	2748000	does not
2748000	2749000	mean that
2749000	2750000	it will not
2750000	2751000	happen
2751000	2752000	and this
2752000	2753000	image
2753000	2754000	was proposed
2754000	2755000	by
2755000	2756000	Kosterlitz
2756000	2757000	and Thorez
2757000	2758000	later
2758000	2759000	we called
2759000	2760000	KT
2760000	2761000	transition
2761000	2762000	or BKT
2762000	2763000	transition
2763000	2764000	in high
2764000	2765000	temperature
2765000	2766000	first of all
2766000	2767000	because it
2767000	2768000	will not occur
2768000	2769000	symmetry
2769000	2770000	will not occur
2770000	2771000	symmetry
2771000	2772000	so
2772000	2773000	as long as
2773000	2774000	you have a
2774000	2775000	limit temperature
2775000	2776000	it will not
2776000	2777000	be that
2777000	2778000	orderly
2778000	2779000	so
2779000	2780000	orderly
2780000	2781000	for example
2781000	2782000	you
2782000	2783000	write this
2783000	2784000	energy
2784000	2785000	like this
2785000	2786000	in front
2786000	2787000	of a
2787000	2788000	symbol
2788000	2789000	that
2789000	2790000	if
2790000	2791000	J is
2791000	2792000	J is
2792000	2793000	the
2793000	2794000	internal
2794000	2795000	will be
2795000	2796000	lower
2796000	2797000	internal
2797000	2798000	base
2798000	2799000	is
2799000	2800000	the
2800000	2801000	internal
2801000	2802000	base
2802000	2803000	is
2803000	2804000	high school
2804000	2805000	is
2805000	2806000	the
2806000	2807000	length
2807000	2808000	of this
2808000	2809000	symbol
2809000	2810000	multiplied by
2810000	2811000	another
2811000	2812000	symbol
2812000	2813000	multiplied
2813000	2814000	by
2814000	2815000	cos
2815000	2816000	theta
2816000	2817000	if theta
2817000	2818000	is 0
2818000	2819000	if the
2819000	2820000	theta
2820000	2821000	is
2821000	2822000	0
2822000	2823000	then
2823000	2824000	this is
2824000	2825000	vertical
2825000	2826000	is 0
2826000	2827000	so
2827000	2828000	there is a
2828000	2829000	symbol in front
2829000	2830000	of it
2830000	2831000	so if the
2831000	2832000	energy is
2832000	2833000	lower,
2833000	2834000	of course,
2834000	2835000	it is best
2835000	2836000	to have
2836000	2837000	the same
2837000	2838000	amount
2838000	2839000	for each
2839000	2840000	symbol.
2840000	2841000	If it is
2841000	2842000	the opposite,
2842000	2843000	the
2843000	2844000	energy is
2844000	2845000	the highest
2845000	2846000	, so
2846000	2847000	the
2847000	2848000	same
2848000	2849000	energy is
2849000	2850000	the lowest
2850000	2851000	, so
2851000	2852000	it is
2852000	2853000	the lowest
2853000	2854000	energy
2854000	2855000	in the
2855000	2856000	ground state
2856000	2857000	.
2857000	2858000	Of course,
2858000	2859000	of course,
2859000	2860000	there is order,
2860000	2861000	but as long as
2861000	2862000	you have a little
2862000	2863000	temperature, as long as
2863000	2864000	there is a little
2864000	2865000	temperature,
2865000	2866000	it will not be
2866000	2867000	the direction,
2867000	2868000	it will not
2868000	2869000	be all
2869000	2870000	the same
2870000	2871000	direction,
2871000	2872000	it is
2872000	2873000	absolutely
2873000	2874000	that is
2874000	2875000	that is
2875000	2876000	that is
2876000	2877000	not
2877000	2878000	not
2878000	2879000	destroy this
2879000	2880000	if everyone
2880000	2881000	is the same direction,
2881000	2882000	then of course
2882000	2883000	the symmetry
2883000	2884000	is destroyed,
2884000	2885000	then there is no
2885000	2886000	symmetry,
2886000	2887000	but there is a
2887000	2888000	change in
2888000	2889000	that
2889000	2890000	is what
2890000	2891000	the situation
2891000	2892000	is high
2892000	2893000	temperature
2893000	2894000	when it
2894000	2895000	is
2895000	2896000	a little

2897000	2898000	there is a little

2997000	2998000	is
2998000	2999000	that
2999000	3000000	I remember
3000000	3001000	when I was
3001000	3002000	learning xy
3002000	3003000	mother, he
3003000	3004000	said that
3004000	3005000	it was not
3005000	3006000	a waste
3006000	3007000	to
3007000	3008000	calculate
3008000	3009000	its
3009000	3010000	coherence
3010000	3011000	length
3011000	3012000	,
3012000	3013000	one is
3013000	3014000	power
3014000	3015000	decay,
3015000	3016000	one is
3016000	3017000	exponential
3017000	3018000	decay,
3018000	3019000	then how
3019000	3020000	to connect
3020000	3021000	that thing
3021000	3022000	to
3022000	3023000	your
3023000	3024000	side
3024000	3025000	?
3025000	3026000	Well
3026000	3027000	,
3027000	3028000	well
3028000	3029000	,
3029000	3030000	if the
3030000	3031000	coherence
3031000	3032000	length
3032000	3033000	,
3033000	3034000	because
3034000	3035000	the first
3035000	3036000	is the
3036000	3037000	definition of
3037000	3038000	Mermin
3038000	3039000	Wegener
3039000	3040000	,
3040000	3041000	first of all,
3041000	3042000	if it
3042000	3043000	doesn't
3043000	3044000	have
3044000	3045000	order,
3045000	3046000	its
3046000	3047000	coherence
3047000	3048000	length
3048000	3049000	must be
3049000	3050000	decayed
3050000	3051000	to
3051000	3052000	zero,
3052000	3053000	but
3053000	3054000	it
3054000	3055000	is
3055000	3056000	very
3056000	3057000	slow
3057000	3058000	power
3058000	3059000	decay
3059000	3060000	,
3060000	3061000	well
3061000	3062000	,
3062000	3063000	well
3063000	3064000	,
3064000	3065000	I think
3065000	3066000	I think
3066000	3067000	this may
3067000	3068000	be carefully
3068000	3069000	inferred
3069000	3070000	to see
3070000	3071000	its
3071000	3072000	connection here
3072000	3073000	,
3073000	3074000	I think
3074000	3075000	it seems
3075000	3076000	that there is
3076000	3077000	no way to
3077000	3078000	directly use
3078000	3079000	a very
3079000	3080000	intuitive
3080000	3081000	way to
3081000	3082000	see that
3082000	3083000	this place
3083000	3084000	is a
3084000	3085000	power-low
3085000	3086000	decay
3086000	3087000	that you
3087000	3088000	have this
3088000	3089000	picture,
3089000	3090000	for example,
3090000	3091000	you have to use
3091000	3092000	math to
3092000	3093000	represent,
3093000	3094000	for example,
3094000	3095000	the physical amount
3095000	3096000	is different
3096000	3097000	on the
3097000	3098000	left and
3098000	3099000	right
3099000	3100000	,
3100000	3101000	which
3101000	3102000	is to
3102000	3103000	use
3103000	3104000	what
3104000	3105000	things
3105000	3106000	to
3106000	3107000	say
3107000	3108000	there is
3108000	3109000	no
3109000	3110000	similar
3110000	3111000	things
3111000	3112000	all the
3112000	3113000	parameters
3113000	3114000	well
3114000	3115000	well
3115000	3116000	well
3116000	3117000	,
3117000	3118000	the
3118000	3119000	problem
3119000	3120000	is that
3120000	3121000	you can not
3121000	3122000	define a
3122000	3123000	thing,
3123000	3124000	for example,
3124000	3125000	the left
3125000	3126000	side of the
3126000	3127000	back
3127000	3128000	is still
3128000	3129000	zero,
3129000	3130000	the
3130000	3131000	right side
3131000	3132000	is
3132000	3133000	zero,
3133000	3134000	the
3134000	3135000	left
3135000	3136000	side
3136000	3137000	is
3137000	3138000	zero.
3138000	3139000	In
3139000	3140000	fact,
3140000	3141000	the
3141000	3142000	left
3142000	3143000	side
3143000	3144000	is
3144000	3145000	zero,
3145000	3146000	the
3146000	3147000	right
3147000	3148000	side
3148000	3149000	is
3149000	3150000	one,
3150000	3151000	so
3151000	3152000	they are
3152000	3153000	different,
3153000	3154000	so
3154000	3155000	we can
3155000	3156000	not
3156000	3157000	say
3157000	3158000	that
3158000	3159000	is the
3159000	3160000	old
3160000	3161000	parameter,
3161000	3162000	but
3162000	3163000	here
3163000	3164000	well
3164000	3165000	here
3165000	3166000	you can
3166000	3167000	only
3167000	3168000	calculate
3168000	3169000	its
3169000	3170000	value
3170000	3171000	,
3171000	3172000	so
3172000	3173000	you
