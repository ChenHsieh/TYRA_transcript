1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, Project Terra is an international platform for sharing information.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We hope that scholars from all over the world can share with us

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the results of our current research and development,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and more importantly, what is the trend of development.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is not something you can easily find in Taiwan.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Project Terra can also provide people who are doing research

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
with opportunities to exchange and collaborate.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we hold a seminar like this every week.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The speakers are basically all members,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and they will share their new ideas and research trends.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Project Terra is a self-releasing organization

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that is dedicated to public service.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have no intention of making any profit.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All of our members are very enthusiastic doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can see our website.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you can take a look at our website.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and would like to keep in touch with us,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you can join our membership.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you can find other people to work with,

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
we will be happy to help you.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you have any questions,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you can ask us directly.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We are usually very free to talk.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sure, no problem.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I would like to remind you that

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when we have more and more listeners,

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
we will set the volume to silent.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So if you remember to click on the microphone icon

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
before speaking,

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you can ask questions or

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
if you have any questions,

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you can directly talk to the speaker, Beta.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, Beta, let's get started.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For some reason, I can't share the screen.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me re-join.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, thank you, Ted.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My name is Chengxinda.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My Chinese name is Ergongcheng.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My surname is Daoda.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Today, I would like to thank Ted and Terra

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
for giving me the opportunity to introduce

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a method we are developing.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is a new method.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The main purpose of this method is to deal with

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the interaction between light and matter.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We hope to provide a new way

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
to do this.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The method we propose is called

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mixed Quantum Classical Electrodynamics.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In English, it should be called

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Quantum-Fixed Mixed Electrodynamics.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will introduce to you in detail

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
what kind of method it is.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, let me introduce myself.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My name is Chengxinda.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My background is that when I was in Taiwan,

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was studying math and physics in college.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I majored in math and physics.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Later, for some reason,

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
when I applied to go to college,

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I saw that there was a program called

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Chemical Physics in Columbia.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I thought it was very similar to what I was doing.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It was also something I was interested in.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I applied to this program.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was very lucky to apply to this program.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I found out that when I came to the United States,

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I became a chemical physicist.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have been used as a chemical physicist from beginning to end.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because of this reason,

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I am now working as a chemical physicist

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
at Penn University.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
To sum up,

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I use the theory of physics

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and the computational method developed in physics

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to study the problem of chemistry.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My professional field is

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
studying dynamics,

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
which is the theory of dynamics

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the computational method of dynamics.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Specifically,

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
my Ph.D. is in Columbia.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I am doing chemical dynamics,

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
that is,

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
electromagnetic dynamics in a chemical environment.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My postdoc,

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what I am doing now

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
is a little different from my Ph.D.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I am doing the interaction of light and matter.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Today,

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
my talk will focus on

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
my postdoc work.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OK.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
First of all, what is light?

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We often say that light is an object.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Basically,

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
light is a very important thing in everyday life.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Light is basically an electromagnetic wave.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Electromagnetic waves

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
are basically the source of all our information.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We see things in this world.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
From the greatest extent,

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
how do we know

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
what happens on other planets

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or on Mars, for example?

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We can

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
reflect the light of the sun from Mars

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and see from the spectrum of sunlight

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
what kind of matter there is on Mars.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How much of this matter is there?

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then,

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
there are more possibilities

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
in the development of modern science.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
These are no longer visible light.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We have different kinds of light

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
from low energy to high energy.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then, from the low energy range,

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
we have NMR

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to Raman

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or IR spectrum.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
These things are

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
lower than visible light.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Within the range of higher than visible light,

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there is UV,

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
which is ultraviolet,

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
X-ray spectroscopy, which is more powerful.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Basically, our feature is that

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
basically,

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
this

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
spectroscopy

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
shows that

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the stronger the energy,

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the deeper we can see.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just like in the form of X-ray,

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we can see that it can

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
reflect the electrons in the inner layer.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you can know what the behavior of the electrons in the inner layer is.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is one of the functions

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
of light and matter interaction.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In recent years,

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
because of the development of nanotechnology,

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
we can make our devices

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in a smaller scale.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So we can even use light,

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the quality of light,

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to manipulate matter,

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to change the nature of matter.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
For example,

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
we can put

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
a chemical reaction

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in a cavity,

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and the nature of the chemical reaction

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
may be changed.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or we can put this chemical reaction

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
on a crystal.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This chemical reaction may have

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
different behavior.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There are other

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
different nanostructures,

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
nanostructures,

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which can have different

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
effects on light-matter interaction

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and change the nature of matter.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Another very important example

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is that in recent years,

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
there is a very popular

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
study

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
on how we use

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
light-matter interaction

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to change,

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
for example,

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
this paper

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is a paper

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
about

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the conductivity

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
of organic semiconductors.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They put a very thin

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
membrane structure,

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and there is a circle

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
above it,

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and attach it

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to the organic semiconductor.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It can change

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the conductivity of the semiconductor.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It can change it

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
from a bad conductor

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
to a better conductor.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But these

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
modern developments

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
all use the nature of light-matter.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When we need

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to understand the nature of light-matter,

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
we need to discuss

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
what is light

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and what is the difference

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
between classical light and light-matter.

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The classical light

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
is in the left panel.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We regard classical light as an electromagnetic wave,

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and the development

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
of the electromagnetic wave

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
is based on

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the Maxwell's equation,

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
which is

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the Maxwell's equation.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is a Maxwell's equation

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
without a source.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is a

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
propagate,

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
a electromagnetic wave moving forward

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
without any source.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the classical view

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
of light.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
In quantum mechanics,

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we regard light as a group

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
of energy.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Its energy

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is discretized.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You may have heard of

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the Uncertainty Principle,

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
which is

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the Uncertainty Principle.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The Uncertainty Principle

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
in light

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
corresponds to

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the distribution of energy.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The energy may not be

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
only one energy,

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but a distribution of probability.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How does quantum mechanics

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
evolve light?

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It is based on the Heisenberg equation.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It is based on the Heisenberg equation.

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The H is an operator

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in quantum mechanics.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The H is an operator

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
in quantum mechanics.

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The H is an operator.

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
H represents the energy.

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This basically

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
describes how light

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
evolves

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
in a space.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is the difference

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
between classical

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and quantum mechanics?

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's look at

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
the matter.

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We can see

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the difference between

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
classical and quantum.

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Classical matter

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is a particle

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or many particles.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Many particles

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
follow

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Newton's law

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in quantum mechanics.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We all know

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
classical mechanics.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A particle has a certain speed

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and this speed changes over time.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In quantum mechanics,

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the energy

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
is considered

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
continuous.

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
the energy

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is considered continuous.

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In quantum mechanics,

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the energy

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
doesn't

275
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
use proofs

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to describe matter,

277
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
instead we use function

278
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
named wave function.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
In uncertainty principle

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
it is a

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
distribution

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
frame of reference

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
for environment

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and momentum.

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Uncertainty principle

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is not a satisfied

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you can

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you can

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
you can write down its

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
spatial distribution and

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
momentum distribution

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
of a wave function.

293
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This wave function

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
follows the following thing called

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Schrodinger equation

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Schrodinger equation

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is written like this.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Since we

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
now know these

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
physical

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
classical and quantum

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and quantum of light.

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
When we want to describe

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the reaction of modern light

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and the interaction of light and matter

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
our ideal state

307
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
is to use quantum light

308
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and quantum matter.

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
When I have quantum light and quantum matter

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
together

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
we can

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
this is a set of

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
quantum electric mechanics

314
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
called QED.

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In this QED

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
we can

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
put the whole

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
matter and light

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
in the same wave function

320
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
they will have a combined

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hamiltonian

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and they can

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
evolve together.

324
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This can include

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
all interactions

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in quantum mechanics.

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But this is a very large

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
calculation.

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It is very difficult

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to do a real calculation

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
except for some basic

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
model problems.

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
One of the reasons is

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
this total wave function

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
contains a lot of

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
degrees of freedom

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
a lot of variables.

338
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This thing

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
may be in a real situation

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
for example

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I take a real nanoparticle

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
or a real

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
particle structure

344
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
this thing

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
can't be done.

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So we have

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
a compromise

348
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
approach.

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We develop a set

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
called Mixed Quantum Classical

351
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
which is a combination of

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
classical quantum mechanics.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
In this we

354
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
put light as classical

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
as classical

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and matter as matter.

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Therefore

358
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we don't need to

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
evolve the light

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
we just need to know

361
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
what is the

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
behavior of matter.

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We put light's behavior

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
as a time-dependent perturbation

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
as a

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
driving force

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
as if

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
something is pushing

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
matter

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
into evolution.

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a more

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
practical approach.

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But it has some problems.

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
As I said

375
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
it is OK for some problems.

376
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This is not

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
our first approach.

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Many people have done this.

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But it has some problems.

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The first problem is

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
it doesn't have feedback.

382
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Feedback means

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
we treat the light

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
as bending

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The system

386
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
doesn't throw

387
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
any energy

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
or feedback

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
into the light.

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
if you

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
take the whole system

393
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and put light and matter

394
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
together

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you will find that

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
this theory doesn't

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
conform to energy conservation.

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The second problem is

399
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
it has uncertainty principle.

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
In other words

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I should have

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
a standard difference

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
between light and matter.

404
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
In other words

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't have

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
only one point

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
so I should have

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
a wide distribution.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But we have

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
classical light

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
so there is no

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
fluctuation.

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Another problem

414
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
is time dependent perturbation.

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It is a linear response.

416
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It is a linear response.

417
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It is a linear response.

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It is a linear response.

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Basically

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
it is a linear response.

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The light pushes

422
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
the light

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and it responds.

424
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But this

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is a strong coupling.

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If the light is very strong

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and it can change

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
the quality of light

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
this theory

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
cannot be explained.

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
cannot be explained.

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The most serious problem

433
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
is that it cannot

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
capture a

435
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
important physical quality

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
called spontaneous emission.

437
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
called spontaneous emission.

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I will explain it later.

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
These problems

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
make

441
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
classical method

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
cannot explain

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
quantum mechanics.

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
quantum mechanics.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
quantum mechanics.

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
quantum mechanics.

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
My work

448
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
is to develop

449
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
a new

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
mixed quantum classical

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
a new

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
mixed quantum classical

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
a new

454
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
a new

455
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
we can

456
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
recover

457
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
we can reconstruct

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
spontaneous emission

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
we can

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
enforce

461
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
influence energy conservation

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
we can

463
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
we can build habitual light

464
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
we can build habitual light

465
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
we can build habitual light

466
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
how can we do it?

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
sorry, I have a question

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
ok, go ahead

469
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I want to ask

470
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
because

471
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
using quantum mechanics is a bit difficult

472
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
can't do

473
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
analytical solution

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to what extent

475
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
for example, molecular

476
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
or elemental

477
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
single element

478
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
or many body

479
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
yes, usually

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
many body

481
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
because many body

482
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
its scale is exponential n

483
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
so

484
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
if you add

485
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
exponential n

486
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
your computer can't run

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
so

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
what we can do

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is

490
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
take some degree of freedom

491
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
as classical

492
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
there are many good classical methods

493
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to propagate Maxwell's equation

494
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
but

495
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
for example, single molecule

496
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
can be calculated?

497
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
yes, single molecule can be calculated

498
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
as a

499
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
as a

500
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
chemist

501
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to do something practical

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I see

503
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
because I do high energy

504
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't know

505
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I only do one by one

506
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
two or three more

507
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
seems difficult

508
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
what we want to do

509
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
for example,

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
put a molecule

511
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
into a cavity

512
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I see

513
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
ok, thank you

514
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I want to ask

515
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
is this LR

516
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
same as

517
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Lindblad equation operator?

518
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
thank you

519
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
open system

520
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
which one?

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it's very similar

522
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I won't write it down

523
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
but

524
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
it's very similar to

525
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Lindblad

526
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but it can't be written as

527
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Lindblad form

528
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
because it's a non-linear term

529
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
it's not like Lindblad

530
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
it's a linear term

531
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
it's a time-dependent

532
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and skewed Lindblad

533
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
ok

534
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
keep talking

535
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm looking forward to it

536
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll talk about it later

537
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
ok

538
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
basically

539
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
what we want to do

540
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
because we have a friend who does high energy

541
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
we have

542
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
low energy

543
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
chemical system

544
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
so we don't consider

545
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
relative effect

546
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
ok

547
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
next

548
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
let's talk about

549
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
what is spontaneous emission

550
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
what is spontaneous emission

551
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the quantum theory of spontaneous emission

552
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
was written by Dirac in 1927

553
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Dirac

554
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
of course

555
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Einstein explained it

556
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
before Dirac

557
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but the paper in 1927

558
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
he used

559
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
the first principle

560
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to introduce

561
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
spontaneous emission

562
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
so

563
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I see it as

564
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
a major contribution

565
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
what is spontaneous emission

566
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
it's basically

567
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
a transition

568
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
from a stimulated state

569
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
to an excited state

570
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
simply put

571
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I have an electron

572
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
it's in a stimulated state

573
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
it's in an excited state

574
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
it emits the same light

575
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
it's called spontaneous emission

576
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
the most important thing about it

577
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
it's in vacuum

578
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
a quantum system

579
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
a two-level system

580
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
a stimulated state and an excited state

581
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in vacuum

582
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
it still emits

583
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
this thing

584
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
because

585
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
in quantum theory

586
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
we use

587
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
zero-point energy

588
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
it's the

589
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
light in vacuum

590
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
the lowest energy

591
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
some theories

592
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
it's called vacuum fluctuation

593
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
although it's vacuum

594
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
it still

595
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
interacts with

596
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the quantum system

597
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to emit spontaneous emission

598
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
why is spontaneous emission

599
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
so important

600
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
because fundamentally

601
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it's a quantum process

602
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
in classical theory

603
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it's impossible

604
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
to get spontaneous emission

605
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
second

606
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
it's basically

607
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
spontaneous emission

608
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
responsible for

609
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
almost all light

610
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
we can see

611
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
it's because of spontaneous emission

612
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
zero light, flat light

613
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
visible light

614
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
it's because of

615
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
spontaneous emission

616
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
next

617
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it's a

618
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
quantum electrodynamics

619
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
after Dirac

620
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in 1927

621
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
after paper

622
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
a lot of people

623
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
like Pauli, Wigner

624
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Eisenberg, Fermi

625
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Freeman Dyson

626
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and Feynman

627
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
started to do

628
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
QED research

629
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
what we want to say

630
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
if we take

631
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
mixed quantum classical equation

632
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
to deal with

633
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
spontaneous emission

634
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
what will happen

635
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
here

636
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I want to explain

637
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
what is

638
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
mixed quantum classical

639
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
first

640
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
we see

641
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
you can see my mouse

642
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
oh yes

643
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
can you see my mouse

644
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
yes

645
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
ok

646
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
it's a little bit lag

647
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
if you want to stop

648
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
slow down

649
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
ok, no problem

650
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I will stop here

651
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
ok, first question

652
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
we assume a system

653
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
a two-level system

654
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
in vacuum

655
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
this system

656
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
is completely in

657
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
spontaneous emission

658
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
no distribution

659
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
in

660
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
mixed quantum classical

661
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
there is no spontaneous emission

662
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
which is

663
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
this line

664
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
this picture

665
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
horizontal is time

666
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
vertical is

667
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
stimulated

668
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
stimulated

669
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
population

670
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
that

671
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
red line

672
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
means no matter

673
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
how long

674
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
this system

675
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
will not emit any light

676
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
first of all

677
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
this is wrong

678
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
qualitatively

679
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
but we found

680
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
if

681
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I am

682
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
not in

683
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
spontaneous emission

684
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I have half

685
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
0.5, 0.5

686
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I have half

687
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
half in

688
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I found

689
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
there is a little bit

690
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
spontaneous emission

691
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
real spontaneous emission

692
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
this black line

693
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
compared

694
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
there is a gap

695
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
another

696
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
this is

697
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
we tried

698
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
a method

699
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
we tried other methods

700
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
three methods

701
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
mixed quantum classical

702
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
called

703
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
SQC

704
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or

705
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
CPA

706
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
mixed quantum classical

707
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
there is a problem

708
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the right picture

709
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the middle curve

710
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
the middle curve

711
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
real spontaneous emission rate

712
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
red

713
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
this is

714
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
the left picture

715
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
from there

716
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
emission rate

717
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
compare with

718
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
real spontaneous emission

719
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
rate

720
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
sometimes

721
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
almost all

722
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
ground state

723
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
very close

724
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
very close

725
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
real spontaneous emission rate

726
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
but

727
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
getting worse

728
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
more and more population

729
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
in

730
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
spontaneous emission

731
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
more and more

732
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
other methods

733
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
opposite

734
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
opposite

735
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
behavior

736
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
this is the second problem

737
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
the last problem

738
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
basically

739
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
old problem

740
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
our factory

741
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
classical factory

742
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
no fluctuation

743
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
anything about

744
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
fluctuation

745
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
must be wrong

746
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
next

747
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the method

748
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
plus R

749
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
we call

750
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the average length

751
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
we use

752
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
because it is the simplest

753
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
average length

754
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
in the average length

755
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
plus

756
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
LR

757
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
LIMBRA

758
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
what is the plus R

759
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
it has 3 functions

760
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
first

761
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I put

762
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
extra relaxation

763
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I put some population

764
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
from the top

765
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
to the ground state

766
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
this additional population

767
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
we use

768
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
according to

769
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to deduce

770
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
in every time state

771
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
how much

772
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
how much relaxation

773
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
let it

774
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
with

775
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
spontaneous emission rate

776
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
same

777
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
this is the first thing

778
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
second

779
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
because we

780
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
took some

781
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
population

782
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
from the ground state

783
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
to the ground state

784
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
where is the energy

785
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
should be put

786
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
to the power plant

787
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
it should be

788
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
it should be

789
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
classical

790
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
it should be

791
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
part of the power plant

792
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
or plant

793
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to

794
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
to ensure

795
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
the whole system

796
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
energy conservation

797
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
so we designed a way

798
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
the energy

799
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
can be put to the power plant

800
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and

801
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
we designed

802
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
stochastic

803
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
defacing

804
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I put

805
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I put this system

806
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
there is a random process

807
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
it will

808
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
decide

809
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
the system phase

810
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
in every time

811
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
there is a random process

812
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
it will decide

813
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
the system phase

814
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
this small

815
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
stochastic defacing

816
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
introduce

817
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
classical

818
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
power plant

819
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
fluctuation

820
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I am not running a single trajectory

821
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I am running many trajectories

822
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
to balance the trajectory

823
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
so

824
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
we will have

825
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
the power plant

826
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
there will be fluctuation

827
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
there will be

828
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
so

829
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
we can tell

830
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000

What is

1176
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
What is

1177
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,840
What is

1178
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
What is

1179
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
What is

1180
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,840
Okay, so let me recap it again

1181
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,840
What did we learn from Raman Scannering?

1182
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
What we learned is that

1183
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,840
Raman Fast++R can actually

1184
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
allow us to get

1185
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
multi-state transitions

1186
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
We can do multi-state transitions

1187
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
We just need to put the correct

1188
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,840
spontaneous emission in

1189
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
We can get multi-state transitions

1190
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
And it's still pretty accurate

1191
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,840
And

1192
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
Even if we don't have

1193
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
a classical frequency

1194
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,840
We don't need to put another frequency

1195
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,840
to make it vibrate

1196
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,840
We can still

1197
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,840
We can still get inelastic scattering

1198
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
with Mixed Chromium Classical

1199
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
And lastly, let's talk about

1200
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Excuse me

1201
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
Did I interrupt you?

1202
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Did I interrupt you?

1203
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,840
No, no, no

1204
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Oh, okay

1205
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
I have a question

1206
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Because it looks like

1207
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Raman Fast++R and Quantum

1208
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
are basically the same

1209
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,840
But my question is

1210
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,840
For example, if you want to manually

1211
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,840
add a relaxation

1212
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
and a defacing

1213
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,840
and a defacing

1214
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,840
and a defacing

1215
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,840
You basically have three parameters

1216
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
to add in, right?

1217
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,840
How do they get it?

1218
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Oh, they all

1219
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
Oh, they all

1220
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,840
are based on

1221
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Fermi's Golden Rule

1222
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
All my transitions

1223
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,840
are based on Fermi's Golden Rule

1224
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Just like in Raman

1225
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
What I'm doing is

1226
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
I'm using Fermi's Golden Rule

1227
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,840
for these two transitions

1228
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
I'm using Fermi's Golden Rule

1229
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,840
to figure out how much I need

1230
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
to add

1231
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,840
These three things

1232
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
are related to each other

1233
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,840
Everything is based on

1234
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Fermi's Golden Rule

1235
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,840
So if I'm not wrong

1236
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
If I'm not wrong

1237
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
You add a resonance

1238
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
intermediate state in the middle

1239
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,840
You add a resonance

1240
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
intermediate state in the middle

1241
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
If it's Fermi's Golden Rule

1242
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
You choose an energy

1243
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
and all your in and out

1244
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,840
will be resonant with that energy

1245
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,840
No

1246
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,840
But

1247
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,840
What I'm doing is

1248
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,840
What I'm doing is

1249
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,840
I know

1250
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,840
For example, I know

1251
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,840
every transition 2-1

1252
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,840
2-1 and 2-0

1253
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,840
are based on different Fermi's Golden Rule

1254
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,840
Fermi's Golden Rule is a rate

1255
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,840
There's a transition rate

1256
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,840
There's a transition rate

1257
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,840
In my theory

1258
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
I can deduce

1259
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,840
How much is the difference

1260
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,840
between Errandfest and Fermi's Golden Rule

1261
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,840
Then I'll use those three things

1262
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
to add up

1263
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Let me ask

1264
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Sorry

1265
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,840
You can move to the next slide

1266
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,840
Yes

1267
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,840
To the next one

1268
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
The first one on the right

1269
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,840
So

1270
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
Sorry

1271
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,840
To the one before

1272
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,840
On the right

1273
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,840
So the input frequency

1274
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,840
and

1275
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,840
in these ranges

1276
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,840
Do you need to calculate

1277
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,840
how to add up

1278
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
the other parameters?

1279
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Or these are already

1280
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,840
The omega i

1281
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,840
There are ten

1282
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
Do you need to add up

1283
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,840
the other parameters

1284
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,840
ten times?

1285
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
That might be easy

1286
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,840
I don't know

1287
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,840
I'm just asking

1288
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,840
It's okay

1289
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,840
We don't need to

1290
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,840
Every trajectory

1291
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
is the same

1292
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
Just change one parameter

1293
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
Just omega i

1294
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Yes, I just need to change omega i

1295
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,840
I didn't change anything

1296
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
I didn't change anything

1297
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,840
in the calculation

1298
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,840
So I don't need to calculate again

1299
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,840
Can I ask a question?

1300
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,840
You are calculating

1301
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Whether it's Rayleigh or Raman

1302
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,840
You said you want to use Fermi's Golden Rule

1303
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,840
But in general

1304
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,840
Your state 2 is a virtual state

1305
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,840
So

1306
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,840
In reality

1307
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,840
You can't get the real coupling constant

1308
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,840
So how do you solve this problem?

1309
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,840
Can't get the real coupling constant

1310
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
In practice

1311
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,840
You can measure Rayleigh scattering cross-section

1312
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
Or Raman scattering cross-section

1313
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,840
But you can't get

1314
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
Real state and virtual state

1315
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,840
How much is the coupling

1316
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,840
Yes

1317
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
It's like this

1318
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,840
I don't have virtual state

1319
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,840
and real state coupling

1320
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,840
The coupling I use is

1321
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Resonant

1322
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,840
I should not say resonant

1323
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,840
The coupling I use is

1324
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,840
Actually 1 and 2 coupling

1325
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,840
So

1326
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,840
If you look back from the lab

1327
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Because my idea is

1328
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
more from

1329
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Initial

1330
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,840
The first principle

1331
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,840
If I want to calculate

1332
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,840
If I want to calculate

1333
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
The actual molecule

1334
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,840
To calculate this

1335
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,840
I will use

1336
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,840
Electronic Structure

1337
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,840
To calculate

1338
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,840
The real coupling

1339
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,840
This coupling

1340
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Not the real coupling

1341
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,840
In electronic structure

1342
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,840
How big is the coupling

1343
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,840
This coupling

1344
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,840
This coupling

1345
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,840
Can be calculated

1346
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,840
Transition dipole moment

1347
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,840
1 and 2 state transition dipole moment

1348
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,840
The light I hit

1349
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Whether there is resonance

1350
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
I use the transition dipole moment

1351
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,840
So you mean

1352
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,840
You are in the molecule

1353
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
You all have real state

1354
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,840
You use real state transition dipole moment

1355
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
You sum up all these real states

1356
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,840
Yes

1357
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,840
Because

1358
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,840
In this

1359
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,840
I don't have any

1360
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,840
virtual state

1361
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
It's not like

1362
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Sum of state

1363
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,840
I have a lot of virtual state

1364
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,840
Here is real state

1365
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,840
Different frequency

1366
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Thank you

1367
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,840
It is

1368
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,840
A bit like a driving system

1369
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
It is a dynamical system

1370
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Hope to answer your question

1371
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,840
Any other questions

1372
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,840
No, I will continue

1373
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,840
Where did I just talk about

1374
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,840
In the end, we want to say

1375
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,840
In the end, we want to say

1376
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,840
The problem we want to deal with

1377
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
Is a strong problem

1378
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,840
What about this strong problem

1379
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,840
Model triplet

1380
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,840
It is a two-level system

1381
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,840
Back to a very simple two-level system

1382
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,840
There is a very strong

1383
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Classical field

1384
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,840
The biggest feature of this model triplet

1385
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
I think the coolest thing is that it is classical

1386
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Classical in quantum now

1387
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,840
It's a bit like laser

1388
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
It is a coherent state

1389
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Very close

1390
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,840
Classical

1391
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,840
Classical electric field

1392
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,840
But it emits

1393
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,840
The light wave

1394
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,840
It is a very

1395
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,840
Not classical

1396
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,840
Quantum light wave

1397
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
Why is this

1398
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,840
Because of this field

1399
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,840
This electric field

1400
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,840
Because it is very strong

1401
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,840
Basically, it has exceeded

1402
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,840
So we can't use it anymore

1403
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,840
In quantum theory

1404
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,840
It is a bit like

1405
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Mixing state

1406
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,840
A bit like hybridization

1407
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,840
The picture in the lower right corner

1408
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,840
In fact, on the left

1409
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,840
On the left side of this diagonal

1410
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,840
Is the Bayer state

1411
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,840
I made

1412
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,840
Two-level system

1413
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,840
Generate

1414
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,840
Sorry

1415
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
Two-level system and light

1416
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,840
The state generated by the frequency

1417
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Draw it out

1418
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,840
After drawing the hybridization

1419
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,840
You will find that the right side

1420
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,840
Is the state after hybridization

1421
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,840
It's a bit like a mix

1422
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,840
It's a bit like a dress state

1423
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,840
Hybridization is light

1424
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,840
With

1425
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,840
Hybridization of two-level system

1426
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,840
So its energy level

1427
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,840
Will be changed

1428
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Then

1429
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,840
In the model on the right

1430
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,840
It has three different

1431
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Launch

1432
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,840
Frequency

1433
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,840
The first one we call T

1434
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,840
Why is it called T?

1435
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,840
It's very simple

1436
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
It's called 3 photons

1437
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,840
You can see it from

1438
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,840
The highest

1439
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,840
After 1, 2, 3

1440
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
Three times to the lowest

1441
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
So it's called triple

1442
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,840
3 photons

1443
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Then F is called fluorescence

1444
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,840
Fluorescence is basically the lowest connection

1445
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
The two closest connections

1446
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Between

1447
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,840
Launch

1448
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Then the other two

1449
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,840
It's called Rayleigh

1450
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,840
Two Rayleigh

1451
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,840
It goes through two photons

1452
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,840
It's called Rayleigh

1453
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,840
That

1454
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,840
This

1455
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,840
The quantum theory

1456
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Gave us three

1457
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Different frequency

1458
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,840
It's three different peaks

1459
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Then these peaks

1460
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,840
It will be produced

1461
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
It contains the Rabi frequency

1462
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,840
This

1463
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,840
The gentleman on the left is Rabi

1464
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,840
He used to be in Columbia

1465
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Very cool

1466
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
Then

1467
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
We can also use this

1468
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Mixed quantum classical method

1469
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Let's try

1470
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
We found that if we don't put any

1471
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,840
If we don't change any plus r

1472
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,840
We found that this system

1473
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,840
It's basically classical in classical out

1474
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,840
It's classical in, it's classical out

1475
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,840
There won't be much change

1476
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,840
If you're a kid

1477
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,840
Or high school

1478
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,840
There's a physical phenomenon

1479
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,840
You put

1480
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,840
A pile of protein

1481
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,840
Put in a

1482
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Tie a pile of protein

1483
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,840
On the same pole

1484
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
The pole has a fixed frequency

1485
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,840
After a long time, they will be synchronized

1486
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,840
This phenomenon is basically

1487
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,840
It's very similar to what we see here

1488
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Say

1489
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,840
I

1490
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
But there are a lot of different frequencies

1491
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Running inside

1492
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,840
In fact, we're looking at this

1493
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,840
Mixed quantum classical

1494
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,840
In a short time, you'll see three peaks

1495
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,840
We can see three peaks

1496
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,840
But for a long time, you'll find the two peaks next to it

1497
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,840
It's slowly disappearing

1498
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Only the middle peak is left

1499
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,840
It's basically a

1500
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,840
Classical driving system

1501
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,840
Classical in, classical out

1502
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,840
Nothing else

1503
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,840
The rest is

1504
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,840
The same old problem

1505
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
There's no fluctuation here

1506
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,840
With this

1507
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,840
We'll find that

1508
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,840
The blue line is the line after the plus

1509
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,840
We can see

1510
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,840
There's a stable

1511
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,840
Side peak

1512
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,840
It won't be because of time

1513
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,840
It won't be because of time

1514
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,840
It's gone

1515
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,840
Why is there a stable side peak

1516
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,840
It's actually a

1517
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,840
It's attributed to

1518
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,840
Random perturbation

1519
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,840
Stochastic defacing

1520
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,840
It's kind of like

1521
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,840
In this classical system

1522
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
Push it from time to time

1523
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,840
Don't let it fall back

1524
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,840
The huge frequency

1525
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,840
Don't let it be forever

1526
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Classical in, classical out

1527
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,840
There's this little stochastic

1528
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,840
Defacing is actually very important here

1529
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,840
It can make

1530
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,840
The two side peaks

1531
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,840
All stable

1532
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,840
We want to know

1533
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Here we can see

1534
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
These three ratios

1535
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
R, F, T

1536
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
With

1537
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
All classical theory

1538
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,840
The prediction is consistent

1539
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,840
We want to know

1540
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,840
Is there anything else

1541
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,840
More interesting

1542
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
We can compare with classical theory

1543
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
Here

1544
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
We show

1545
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,840
This graph

1546
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,840
It's an experiment

1547
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
2012

1548
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
Nature Phantomics

1549
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,840
What did it change

1550
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,840
It's a model triplet

1551
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,840
Different lines

1552
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
From bottom to top

1553
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,840
Different

1554
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,840
Infrared frequency

1555
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,840
You'll find

1556
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,840
There are a few

1557
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,840
Features

1558
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,840
The middle peak

1559
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
There are some

1560
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
Different

1561
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Different infrared behavior

1562
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,840
The first one

1563
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Peak position

1564
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,840
You can see the picture on the right

1565
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,840
The middle line

1566
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,840
Is

1567
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Central peak

1568
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,840
It doesn't change much

1569
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
This

1570
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Side peak

1571
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,840
It's with

1572
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,840
This width

1573
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,840
Many people call

1574
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
Generalized

1575
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Rabi frequency

1576
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,840
It's off resonance

1577
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
It's off resonance

1578
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,840
Rabi frequency

1579
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,840
That

1580
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
The experiment and theory

1581
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
Very well

1582
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,840
This peak

1583
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,840
Basically

1584
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,840
Basically

1585
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,840
This

1586
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,840
It's not hard to get

1587
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,840
The experiment and theory

1588
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,840
It's not too bad

1589
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,840
We

1590
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
In

1591
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
In urnfest plus r

1592
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,840
You can see

1593
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
The same behavior

1594
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,840
Central peak

1595
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Fixed

1596
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Side peak

1597
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,840
Similar

1598
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Generalized

1599
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,840
Rabi frequency

1600
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,840
The picture is a bit

1601
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
I want to be like the left

1602
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,840
X and y

1603
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,840
Opposite

1604
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,840
If you flip it over

1605
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
The color is correct

1606
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
Blue to blue

1607
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,840
This is

1608
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Can be

1609
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,840
A very good point

1610
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Basically

1611
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,840
It's not hard

1612
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,840
Next

1613
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Here

1614
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,840
There's another peak

1615
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,840
Outside

1616
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Right

1617
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Left and right

1618
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,840
Resonance

1619
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
Resonance

1620
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,840
It may be

1621
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Higher

1622
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,840
Higher

1623
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
I'm sure

1624
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
I have an impression

1625
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
Please tell me

1626
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
I remember

1627
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,840
Model triplet

1628
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,840
Very strong

1629
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,840
Equivalent to

1630
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,840
This connection

1631
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,840
AC

1632
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
Create another connection

1633
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
My previous understanding

1634
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
Right

1635
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
So the calculation

1636
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,840
Is

1637
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,840
2012

1638
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
Method

1639
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,840
Simulation

1640
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,840
No use

1641
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,840
The method

1642
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,840
The method

1643
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,840
The method

1644
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,840
Is

1645
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,840
Dark shift

1646
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Electrophonon

1647
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Hybridization

1648
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,840
The wind

1649
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,840
Relationship

1650
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,840
Calculate

1651
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,840
OK

1652
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,840
The earliest

1653
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,840
Model paper

1654
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,840
1967

1655
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,840
The earliest prediction

1656
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,840
Model triplet

1657
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,840
Later

1658
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,840
Many people

1659
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,840
Explained

1660
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,840
There is a good resource

1661
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,840
Corinth

1662
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,840
Work

1663
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Right

1664
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,840
Next

1665
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,840
More interesting

1666
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,840
I'm comparing

1667
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,840
This picture

1668
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,840
I want to compare

1669
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,840
Peak position

1670
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,840
Can i get

1671
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Correct

1672
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,840
Coherence emission

1673
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,840
This one on the left

1674
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,840
Quotient

1675
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,840
Quantum mechanics

1676
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,840
The whole quantum theory

1677
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Calculated

1678
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,840
Coherence emission

1679
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,840
The ratio

1680
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,840
That

1681
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,840
This green dot

1682
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,840
Is a dot

1683
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,840
We use

1684
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,840
The first

1685
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,840
We found

1686
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Near resonance

1687
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Delta omega is 0

1688
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,840
Near resonance

1689
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,840
Very good

1690
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,840
Is there a way

1691
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,840
We have a caveat

1692
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,840
That is

1693
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,840
Quantum mechanics

1694
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,840
Based on

1695
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,840
Rotating wave approximation

1696
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,840
Near resonance

1697
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,840
Near resonance

1698
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,840
So we don't know

1699
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Far away

1700
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,840
Resonance

1701
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,840
Quantum mechanics

1702
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,840
This calculation

1703
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,840
Quantum mechanics

1704
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,840
Is it accurate?

1705
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,840
So this place

1706
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,840
We are not very clear

1707
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,840
Is this place accurate?

1708
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,840
We get

1709
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,840
Quite different

1710
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Near resonance

1711
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,840
The result is close

1712
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
That right

1713
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,840
Is a

1714
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,840
Can

1715
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,840
Almost beyond

1716
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,840
Rotating wave approximation

1717
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,840
That is

1718
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,840
If we look at the left

1719
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Peak

1720
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
For

1721
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,840
For

1722
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,840
Different frequency

1723
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,840
Change

1724
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,840
The red line

1725
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,840
Right side

1726
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,840
The blue line is the left side peak

1727
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,840
That

1728
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,840
Is

1729
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
In this

1730
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,840
This

1731
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,840
It is a

1732
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,840
It will not

1733
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,840
Unpredictable

1734
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,840
Because

1735
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,840
It only focuses on

1736
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,840
One level

1737
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,840
One level

1738
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
This

1739
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,840
Approximation

1740
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,840
So it can get

1741
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,840
The middle finger is right

1742
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,840
But it can't get this

1743
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,840
At this point

1744
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,840
But our

1745
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Mixed quantum classical method

1746
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,840
Because I didn't do anything

1747
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,840
This

1748
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,840
Rotating wave

1749
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,840
So the result I got

1750
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,840
I can get this

1751
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Linear crossing

1752
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,840
This result

1753
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,840
The result of the experiment is the same

1754
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,840
On the experiment

1755
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,840
We can see this

1756
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,840
It is not a fixed point

1757
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,840
It is a linear crossing

1758
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,840
This result

1759
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
Very exciting

1760
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,840
So

1761
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,840
We

1762
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,840
So the last

1763
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,840
This is the last recap

1764
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,840
We found this

1765
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,840
RFS class R dynamics

1766
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
It can

1767
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,840
Can simulate quantum mixing

1768
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,840
There is no mixing

1769
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,840
But only

1770
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,840
Driving field

1771
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,840
With a small stochastic

1772
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,840
I can simulate

1773
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,840
Quantum mixing

1774
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,840
That we can

1775
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,840
Very clear

1776
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,840
Coherence emission and incoherence emission

1777
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,840
That

1778
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,840
I hope

1779
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
These advantages

1780
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Tell everyone that we are developing

1781
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,840
This set of theory

1782
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,840
Very reliable

1783
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,840
Method to deal with

1784
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,840
Quantum interaction

1785
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,840
But this method

1786
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,840
There are many problems

1787
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,840
This method

1788
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,840
We haven't thought about it yet

1789
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,840
This

1790
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,840
Quantum motion

1791
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,840
Our current material

1792
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
Very simple material

1793
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,840
Very simple

1794
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,840
From the perspective of a chemist

1795
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,840
We are

1796
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,840
We hope

1797
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,840
At least

1798
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,840
Chemistry

1799
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,840
Potential energy

1800
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,840
Put in

1801
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,840
Put in

1802
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,840
Non-adiabatic dynamics

1803
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,840
Different behaviors

1804
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,840
This is a

1805
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,840
Suitable direction

1806
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,840
Another question mark

1807
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Can we get

1808
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,840
Photon content detection

1809
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,840
Because there are

1810
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,840
The second point and the third point

1811
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Very similar

1812
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,840
Anti-function

1813
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,840
Because

1814
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,840
There is another big feature

1815
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,840
I haven't covered yet

1816
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
Three-wind

1817
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,840
Photon content detection is different

1818
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,840
Because

1819
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,840
It releases light

1820
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,840
Order of relationship

1821
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,840
Every light

1822
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,840
For example, it

1823
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,840
It releases the first

1824
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,840
The next one may be very close to it

1825
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,840
That

1826
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,840
The first one

1827
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
It must be very far away

1828
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,840
It can't release a light right away

1829
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,840
So when you measure

1830
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,840
The statistical value of light

1831
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,840
You will find

1832
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,840
F light may be

1833
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:50,840
In line with

1834
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,840
Poisson distribution

1835
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,840
Then T light

1836
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,840
It is in line with sub-Poisson distribution

1837
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,840
So they

1838
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,840
The statistical value of light will be different

1839
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,840
Here

1840
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,840
We haven't tried it yet

1841
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,840
Of course

1842
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,840
There is no light inside

1843
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Can we get similar

1844
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,840
Finally

1845
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,840
There is a

1846
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,840
If our light is not

1847
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,840
Not

1848
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,840
Not at zero

1849
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,840
There is a thermal distribution

1850
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,840
Then we

1851
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Can we

1852
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,840
In Mixed quantum classical

1853
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,840
Get detail balance

1854
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,840
Or we may

1855
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,840
Violate detail balance

1856
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,840
The last question

1857
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,840
It's actually a very important question

1858
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,840
In many systems

1859
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,840
For example, you put a two-level system in the cavity

1860
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,840
Its spontaneous emission rate

1861
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,840
May be changed

1862
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,840
It may no longer be in line with

1863
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,840
Freemius golden rule rate

1864
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,840
Its spontaneous emission rate

1865
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,840
Because of the cavity

1866
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,840
Strong interaction

1867
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,840
Caused

1868
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,840
It

1869
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,840
The emission frequency will change

1870
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,840
What about our method now

1871
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,840
Based on Freemius golden rule rate

1872
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,840
So it may not be in line with

1873
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,840
So this is also a

1874
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
It may be necessary to consider

1875
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,840
Then

1876
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,840
Then we do

1877
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,840
Method

1878
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,840
Method development

1879
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,840
Method development

1880
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,840
For people

1881
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,840
The most common thing we do

1882
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,840
We have created a new toy

1883
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,840
It's

1884
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,840
We want to use it in many places

1885
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,840
Many people hope to use it

1886
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,840
In many places

1887
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,840
For us

1888
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,840
A very important question

1889
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,840
When will it break down

1890
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,840
This is the most important thing we want to know

1891
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,840
The most important thing we want to know

1892
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,840
When does it not work

1893
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,840
That

1894
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,840
Of course there are many

1895
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,840
Application

1896
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,840
These things are all

1897
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,840
We hope to push it to

1898
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,840
Other

1899
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,840
Light or

1900
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,840
Spectroscopy group

1901
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,840
Let them try

1902
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,840
Can we

1903
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,840
Use the same method

1904
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,840
Look at

1905
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,840
We put

1906
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,840
Chemical reaction into a cavity

1907
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,840
It may be because of the interaction with light

1908
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,840
To change

1909
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,840
Its vibrational

1910
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,840
Energy level

1911
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,840
Because of the change in the vibrational energy level

1912
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,840
It may have different

1913
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,840
Reaction pathway

1914
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,840
So it will have different chemical reactions

1915
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,840
This is also

1916
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,840
This is a thing we can do

1917
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,840
A direction

1918
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,840
Another application in the middle

1919
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,840
Is a new theory

1920
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,840
It's called

1921
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,840
Model spectroscopy

1922
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,840
Then

1923
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,840
In this model spectroscopy

1924
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,840
I use

1925
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,840
Classical source

1926
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,840
Generate quantum light

1927
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,840
Then use this quantum light

1928
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
Different light statistical properties

1929
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,840
To

1930
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,840
Hit the target

1931
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,840
Then

1932
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,840
I can see

1933
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,840
This

1934
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,840
Target for different

1935
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,840
Photon statistics

1936
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,840
Behavior

1937
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,840
This is a

1938
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,840
New thing

1939
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,840
But this thing

1940
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,840
There is no implementation

1941
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,840
But in theory

1942
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,840
Many people

1943
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,840
Pursue this direction

1944
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,840
Finally

1945
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
A very

1946
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,840
In device and material science

1947
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,840
A very useful application

1948
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Conductance enhancement

1949
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,840
Application

1950
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,840
This

1951
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,840
Conductance enhancement

1952
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,840
Can use

1953
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,840
Cavity

1954
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,840
Can use

1955
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,840
This method

1956
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
We hope to use this method

1957
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,840
To

1958
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,840
Understand why

1959
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,840
Conductance enhancement

1960
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Will happen

1961
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,840
Finally, I would like to thank

1962
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,840
My

1963
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,840
Professor

1964
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,840
This

1965
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
Old man

1966
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,840
Not old

1967
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,840
My

1968
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,840
Advisor

1969
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,840
And

1970
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,840
I've been

Visiting scholar

1973

Half year

1974

Visiting scholar

A professor

1977
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,840
Now

1978
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,840
This method

1979
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,840
Generate

1980
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,840
Three dimension

1981
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,840
This method

1982
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,840
I have a

1983
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,840
Electronic system

1984
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,840
There is a

1985
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,840
Classic electronic system

1986
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,840
Maxine is a classic electronic system

1987
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,840
Expert

1988
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,840
This theory

1989
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,840
With

1990
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,840
Very

1991
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,840
Mature

1992
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,840
Combination

1993
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,840
Tao Li

1994
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,840
A researcher

1995
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,840
He is

1996
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,840
We did a lot of work together

1997
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,840
Finally, I want to thank

1998
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,840
Ted

1999
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,840
Organize

2000
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,840
Let me have a chance

2001
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,840
Share with you

2002
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,840
Thank you

2003
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,840
Thank you

2004
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,840
Thank you

2005
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,840
Any other questions

2006
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,840
No

2007
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,840
Hey everyone

2008
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,840
No one has a special question

2009
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,840
Hey

2010
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,840
Let me ask

2011
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,840
One is what we are looking at

2012
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,840
The problem is good

2013
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,840
When we look at it recently

2014
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,840
I

2015
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,840
What are you doing

2016
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,840
Light

2017
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,840
This kind of

2018
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,840
Interaction

2019
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,840
In the semiconductor

2020
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,840
In the semiconductor

2021
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,840
This kind of

2022
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,840
We are looking at

2023
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,840
In addition to

2024
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,840
Like you now

2025
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,840
Are concerned

2026
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,840
Light in classical way

2027
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,840
Electromagnetic wave

2028
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,840
If

2029
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,840
So we do

2030
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,840
We do more

2031
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,840
That

2032
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,840
So

2033
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,840
It depends on

2034
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,840
Light itself

2035
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,840
Characteristics

2036
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,840
One we are looking at recently

2037
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,840
I

2038
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,840
Just

2039
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Is

2040
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,840
This kind of thing

2041
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,840
I'm thinking

2042
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,840
If there is

2043
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,840
Although at the beginning

2044
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,840
But

2045
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,840
Light

2046
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
Is recently

2047
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,840
I think it's a hot topic

2048
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,840
One

2049
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,840
Have you ever thought about it

2050
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,840
His whole disease

2051
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,840
He is also a

2052
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,840
That one

2053
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,840
Border

2054
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,840
One of the conditions

2055
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,840
Square

2056
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,840
Light

2057
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,840
This slope

2058
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,840
It's different from the circle

2059
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,840
Not the same

2060
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,840
In addition to the disease

2061
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,840
There is a good moment

2062
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,840
That you

2063
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,840
This may be

2064
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,840
Maybe you are now

2065
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,840
It may not be the same

2066
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,840
But I want to say

2067
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,840
You can analyze it

2068
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,840
Light

2069
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,840
For

2070
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,840
Maybe

2071
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,840
Interaction between molecules

2072
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,840
Interaction with any

2073
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,840
Interaction

2074
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,840
How does it react

2075
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:04,840
I think

2076
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,840
This

2077
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,840
I am not a scholar

2078
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,840
These things are a bit difficult

2079
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,840
I

2080
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,840
I am now

2081
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,840
I am now

2082
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,840
What they are doing

2083
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,840
Very confident

2084
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,840
I have

2085
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,840
FDTD

2086
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,840
These good

2087
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,840
Classical electromagnetic

2088
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,840
That

2089
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,840
Basically

2090
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,840
What he does now

2091
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,840
For

2092
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,840
Different polarization

2093
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,840
Can be done

2094
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,840
I think

2095
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,840
If he does this

2096
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,840
I think it should be

2097
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,840
The problem you are thinking about is helpful

2098
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Great

2099
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,840
Let's pay attention to this

2100
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,840
Professor

2101
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,840
I have a question

2102
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,840
Ok

2103
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,840
This is

2104
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,840
This is my long-standing question

2105
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,840
I want to know when it will happen

2106
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,840
Melo

2107
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,840
When will it happen

2108
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,840
Outer tongue splitting

2109
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,840
Then

2110
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,840
What is your second

2111
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,840
Outer tongue splitting

2112
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,840
Oh

2113
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,840
Then

2114
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,840
I know it's probably

2115
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,840
Only in molecules or

2116
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,840
Molecular system

2117
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,840
But in

2118
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,840
Acetone system

2119
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,840
Outer tongue splitting

2120
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,840
Then

2121
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,840
Do you know the specific reason

2122
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,840
I don't know the specific reason

2123
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,840
What is it

2124
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,840
Because my understanding of it is the same as yours

2125
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,840
It's in

2126
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,840
Molecule

2127
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,840
In the molecular system

2128
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,840
It will be

2129
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,840
The other one is in

2130
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,840
Yeah

2131
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,840
I still have to learn these things

2132
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,840
I haven't

2133
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,840
I probably do this

2134
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,840
About a year and a half

2135
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,840
Ok

2136
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,840
I still have a lot to learn

2137
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,840
Ok

2138
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,840
The other thing is

2139
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,840
Outer tongues and

2140
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,840
What is it

2141
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,840
It's called

2142
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,840
EIT

2143
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,840
Electronic

2144
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,840
Transparency

2145
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:34,840
What's the difference between these two

2146
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,840
Transparency

2147
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,840
I really don't know

2148
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,840
Ok

2149
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,840
Out of my

2150
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,840
You may ask

2151
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,840
Ted may not know

2152
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,840
I remember EIT

2153
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,840
I remember EIT and

2154
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,840
It seems to be different

2155
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
EIT seems to be more in atoms

2156
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,840
But I actually don't remember

2157
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,840
Ah

2158
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,840
EIT

2159
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,840
EIT and

2160
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,840
The effect of outer tongues looks the same

2161
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,840
But it's completely different from molecular splitting

2162
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,840
Molecular splitting you will see

2163
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,840
There are three states

2164
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,840
You see two states in outer tongues

2165
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,840
I forgot

2166
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,840
Sorry

2167
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,840
It's okay

2168
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:24,840
But I think this is a pretty interesting question

2169
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,840
I think I should

2170
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:28,840
I should use

2171
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,840
Because EIT is basically

2172
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,840
The first thing we try

2173
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,840
Let's try to break down

2174
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,840
This method

2175
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,840
See if our method will break down here

2176
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,840
It's actually pretty good

2177
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,840
So I was thinking

2178
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,840
Maybe our next project will use EIT

2179
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,840
Ok

2180
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,840
Another thing

2181
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,840
You said you add

2182
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,840
You add fluctuation in the electric field

2183
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,840
Then

2184
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,840
Add fluctuation in the classical field

2185
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,840
Then let it be

2186
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,840
Looks like there is

2187
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,840
Spontaneous emission

2188
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,840
Which electric field are you in

2189
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,840
Is it driving force

2190
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,840
Do you add fluctuation in the emission field

2191
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,840
No, I'm in the radiation field

2192
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Add fluctuation

2193
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,840
What about driving field

2194
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,840
We still treat it as

2195
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,840
It's a

2196
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,840
Electric field running past

2197
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,840
Just say

2198
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,840
You can break it down

2199
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,840
But this

2200
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,840
If you are in

2201
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,840
Emission

2202
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,840
Add fluctuation in radiation

2203
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,840
Then

2204
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,840
You said your addition

2205
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,840
You just assume

2206
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,840
It's on time

2207
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,840
Don't run on time

2208
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,840
Then at a certain random time

2209
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,840
You just let it change

2210
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,840
Phase

2211
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,840
Then

2212
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,840
This thing seems to be with

2213
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,840
Is two dimensional

2214
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,840
Spectroscopy

2215
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,840
The method they use

2216
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,840
Very similar

2217
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,840
Do you say pump probe

2218
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,840
In two dimensional

2219
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,840
Spectroscopy

2220
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,840
They have

2221
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,840
Another one called

2222
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,840
Another one called

2223
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,840
There are two components in

2224
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,840
One is called

2225
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,840
Free induction decay

2226
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,840
The second one is

2227
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,840
Phonon scattering

2228
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,840
Or scattering of other things

2229
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,840
Then

2230
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,840
The second one

2231
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,840
Their assumption

2232
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,840
They brought in

2233
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,840
Model method

2234
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,840
In the radiation field

2235
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,840
Add a random

2236
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,840
Phase jump

2237
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,840
So these two things

2238
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,840
Is it the same

2239
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,840
Actually different

2240
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,840
A little different

2241
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,840
Just say

2242
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,840
OK

2243
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,840
I want

2244
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,840
Just

2245
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,840
I want to say one thing

2246
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,840
Because i'm not really

2247
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,840
I'm not really

2248
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,840
I'm not really

2249
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,840
Add a random phase

2250
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,840
I'm adding a random phase

2251
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,840
In

2252
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,840
In

2253
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,840
Two level system

2254
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,840
Then this two level system

2255
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,840
Random phase will react to electric field

2256
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,840
So i'm not really

2257
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,840
Add to electric field

2258
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,840
That way

2259
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,840
There are two benefits

2260
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,840
Because

2261
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,840
My

2262
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,840
It is natural

2263
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:36,840
There are two benefits of this method

2264
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,840
The first benefit is

2265
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,840
Because my two level system

2266
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,840
Also need this defacing

2267
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,840
It also needs

2268
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,840
This little defacing

2269
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,840
Correct

2270
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,840
Its fluctuation

2271
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,840
It also needs this thing

2272
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,840
That

2273
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,840
From

2274
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,840
Then the other benefit is

2275
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,840
Because i'm

2276
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,840
Put

2277
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,840
There is actually a

2278
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,840
Difficulty point is because I put

2279
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,840
I want to put this

2280
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,840
Add a little fluctuation

2281
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,840
I can't just add it

2282
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,840
Add to a certain place

2283
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,840
It just caused it

2284
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,840
Self-interaction will destroy the whole system

2285
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,840
That

2286
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,840
So it will have a

2287
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,840
Specific method

2288
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,840
Add it to a correct place

2289
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,840
That

2290
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,840
This thing

2291
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,840
Because

2292
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,840
Because

2293
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,840
Because this field

2294
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,840
It's not like it's not just a point

2295
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,840
It's a whole space

2296
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,840
And it has to meet some basic

2297
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,840
For example, it can't go beyond the speed of light

2298
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,840
I can't put a field

2299
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,840
Suddenly add to a place beyond the speed of light

2300
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,840
Right

2301
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,840
So

2302
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,840
We try not to add directly

2303
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,840
On the field

2304
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,840
So when we design this method

2305
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,840
We put

2306
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,840
This fluctuation is added to the two-level system

2307
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,840
Let the two-level system

2308
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,840
Naturally generate this fluctuation

2309
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,840
OK

2310
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,840
There is a more detailed question

2311
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,840
I want to know

2312
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,840
Why

2313
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,840
Classical

2314
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,840
Just

2315
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,840
Quantum matter and classical

2316
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,840
Field

2317
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,840
That

2318
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,840
Inside the model

2319
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,840
Only when

2320
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,840
Just when

2321
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,840
That is

2322
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,840
Low

2323
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,840
Low 0

2324
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
Low 1 is

2325
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,840
There will be no emission

2326
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,840
I always thought

2327
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,840
There will be no emission

2328
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,840
OK

2329
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,840
Thank you for asking this question

2330
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,840
Because

2331
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,840
Because of my time

2332
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,840
I missed a part

2333
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,840
That's it

2334
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,840
Here

2335
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,840
Here

2336
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,840
Mixed quantum classical

2337
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,840
Here

2338
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,840
It's not pure

2339
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,840
Pure

2340
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,840
The most basic

2341
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,840
Mixed quantum classical

2342
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,840
There is a

2343
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,840
Mixed quantum classical

2344
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,840
I am in this

2345
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,840
This

2346
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,840
In this

2347
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,840
Two-level system

2348
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,840
Classical

2349
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,840
Field

2350
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,840
Will also

2351
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,840
Self-interact to two-level system

2352
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,840
Let it decay

2353
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,840
So

2354
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,840
This is already a non-linear system

2355
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,840
So you see these

2356
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,840
These red lines are not a simple

2357
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,840
A simple

2358
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,840
Exponential decay

2359
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,840
OK

2360
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,840
It is a

2361
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,840
I will keep myself

2362
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,840
Self-interact

2363
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,840
So

2364
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,840
There will be some decay

2365
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,840
Basically

2366
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,840
Here

2367
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,840
This is one of our recent papers

2368
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,840
Its point is

2369
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,840
This is the most basic

2370
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,840
Mixed quantum classical

2371
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,840
Can get some

2372
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,840
Partially correct

2373
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,840
Some spontaneous emission

2374
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,840
But it won't get all

2375
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,840
Spontaneous emission

2376
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,840
Sorry, you can go to the front page

2377
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,840
Let me see what is called

2378
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,840
Oh

2379
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,840
You said

2380
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,840
Its equation

2381
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,840
I didn't write it out

2382
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,840
OK

2383
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,840
I can

2384
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,840
I can give you

2385
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,840
Our paper

2386
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,840
On the paper

2387
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,840
I can check it myself

2388
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,840
Because I didn't

2389
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,840
Write it all out

2390
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,840
It's a bit complicated

2391
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,840
Thank you

2392
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,840
You're welcome

2393
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,840
OK

2394
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,840
Other listeners have no questions

2395
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,840
Want to discuss

2396
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,840
OK

2397
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
If you don't have any questions

2398
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,840
That's all for today

2399
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,840
Thank you

2400
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,840
Thank you

2401
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:50,840
OK

2402
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
Then you

2403
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,840
When you feel ready

2404
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,840
Tell us

2405
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,840
We will put the recording on

2406
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,840
OK

2407
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,840
That's all for today

2408
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,840
That's all for today

2409
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,840
OK

2410
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,840
Good night

2411
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,840
Good night

2412
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,840
10.30

2413
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,840
OK

2414
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,840
Thank you

2415
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,840
Bye
