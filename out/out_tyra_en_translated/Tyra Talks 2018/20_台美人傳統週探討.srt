00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome everyone to today's Taira speech, and I am the host today, Bo Xuan, and I am very happy that this is the first Taira history speech today, and the speaker today is Hong Qi Ting, who is currently a doctoral candidate for the history of Santa Barbara.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And now the main focus is American history, Asian American research, as well as the Cold War and Taiwan-US relations. I think these studies are quite important.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And today Qiqi is going to talk about the traditional Taira people, so let's not talk too much and let Qiqi start the speech.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello everyone, it's an honor to be here for the first time, and I feel a little sorry for everyone, because I didn't do much.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And my position today is that I personally hope that everyone can give me some feedback.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In fact, the topic I am going to talk about today is a part of my paper, because my paper mainly wants to study the role and importance of Taiwanese Americans in Taiwan's democratization and current Taiwan-US relations.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This topic is about the traditional Taira people, and I think it is a very important part of my paper.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The reason is that the traditional Taira people are in May, the whole month is a day to commemorate the multi-ethnicity of the United States.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And every May, it seems that the Jews and the Asians are all in May, and there will be a lot of commemorative activities related to the culture of the Taira people throughout the month.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This event can be said to be the most important event in the year of the Taira community, so I think this topic is very important to my paper.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It can be seen as a small fragment of how the Taira community mobilizes, organizes, and designs such activities to promote themselves internally and externally.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
From this process, we can understand how the community of Taira people is formed, so it is a very important part of my paper.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Before I get to that point, I would like to mention that there is a national newspaper in the United States called the Pacific Times, which has a history of about 30 years.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It is the most influential Chinese newspaper in the United States or the entire North American region.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Their editor-in-chief asked me to write a topic like this, so I think this opportunity is very rare.

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
After I finish sorting out the information, I will publish it in the Pacific Times.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If I have time, I might turn it into English and see if I can post it in other newspapers.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For example, in May, when many Taira people started to promote traditional Chinese activities, they could take this information and introduce it to members of Congress in the United States or local communities, such as high school students.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If the audience of the article is different, the angle of discussion will be different.

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So my current position is that how can I get the Taira people who are organizing this event and the Taiwan Committee to review the history and think about how we can improve in the future.

21
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have participated in two presentations as an audience, and the speaker has been talking about a very complete topic, which is his own research.

22
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not sure what my argument is, so I hope that if you have any questions, you can always ask me.

23
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Because I think that way I can make my own thoughts clearer and I will know what is important and what is interesting.

24
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This way, my article will be better written, so I hope to interact more and I hope to have a lot of questions, which can be a variety of questions.

25
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello, I have a question.

26
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Zhang Yan has a question.

27
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, go ahead.

28
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So about this, I will ask a very basic question. What is the definition of Taipei people?

29
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's a very good question.

30
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The definition of Taipei people is that you are a descendant of Taiwan, your parents are Taiwanese, or you are a Taiwanese immigrant.

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then you have an American nationality, and your wife is American, and she marries you, and she becomes half Taiwanese American.

32
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Or you are the fourth generation, and your grandfather is Taiwanese.

33
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They are all considered Taiwanese American.

34
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Anyway, you are the same as the black man, as long as you have a drop of blood, you are Taiwanese.

35
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They all count.

36
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then you have the right to be an American citizen, and you can be praised as a Taiwanese American.

37
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But there is one thing that I think must be included in it, which is your own identity.

38
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because this thing is also related to Taiwan's history.

39
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Although Taiwan is not mainstream, but some people think it is Chinese, it is not Taiwanese.

40
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I'm talking about the Chinese, it's not that I'm Chinese, I'm Taiwanese.

41
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Some people think he is a member of the People's Republic of China.

42
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will not draw that kind of person in the range of Taiwanese American.

43
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And the other thing I want to talk about is this holiday.

44
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In fact, he has, I think, behind my own research, more and more, I found that he was behind the politics with the Taiwan government.

45
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The political component of the US government-Taiwan-US relationship is actually there.

46
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
For example, in the eight years of Ma Ying-jeou's administration, the Taiwanese American society in the United States.

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Basically, they hold a traditional week every year.

48
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But they didn't take money from the Taiwanese government, and they didn't ask the Standing Committee for help.

49
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Many of the elders I'm visiting now, they just say that we don't need to take the money from the Kuomintang.

50
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, and now that Tsai Ing-wen is in power, some people think, ah, forget it, we can still work with the government.

51
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So I think behind this, he's actually not just a very pure cultural thing.

52
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He also has some political identity of Taiwanese people.

53
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And the Taiwanese American as a very special group of people.

54
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
When I talk about Taiwanese American, I think of Taiwanese American.

55
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because from my research, from 1950 to 19, there are a lot of people coming from Taiwan to the United States.

56
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But not everyone thinks they are Taiwanese American.

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
About half of the people think they are Chinese American.

58
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So this thing is a very important difference.

59
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So to answer your question, I would say that the first thing is related to blood.

60
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Your family, your gene, there is such a link between Taiwanese people.

61
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then you are now an American citizen.

62
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then another thing is identity.

63
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think it must also be considered.

64
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So in other words, if you are actually in the Taiwanese American, identity can also be allowed in many ways, right?

65
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because it is possible that Lin Shuhao, although he is related to Taiwan,

66
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
but he does not necessarily feel that Taiwan is his home or something like that.

67
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If this is also considered Taiwanese American?

68
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This question depends on which context you are discussing.

69
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
For example, Lin Shuhao, his parents, his great-grandparents seem to still be in Taiwan, right?

70
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So he will travel to Taiwan.

71
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Then he will go fishing in Taiwan.

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He will go to Taiwan to eat dumplings.

73
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Fishing is a very open event.

74
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He was not asked if he was Chinese or Taiwanese.

75
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He just came to that place because of his great-grandparents.

76
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So when he has a vacation, he will want to go to that place.

77
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think in that context, he is Taiwanese, there is no problem.

78
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But if today is a very special occasion.

79
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
For example, he was asked if he was going to play in China.

80
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then you have to admit that you are Chinese American and he is Taiwanese American.

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
At that time, I think it is a totally different story.

82
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And this kind of contradiction, this kind of entanglement is actually not just Taiwanese Americans.

83
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Taiwanese people will also face this kind of problem.

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Now there are 31 meetings in Taiwan.

85
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't want to make any judgment.

86
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Everyone has their own way to survive, right?

87
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's just that when he's on that occasion, he's bound to change his identity.

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Then it won't be a topic for me to discuss.

89
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Because when I say that Taipei people are a highly political issue.

90
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's because in my paper, I want to make an argument.

91
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That is to say, my question, my paper has a very big problem.

92
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Taiwanese Americans as a person who immigrated to the United States under a very special Taiwan-US relationship during the Cold War.

93
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Their experience is very different from Chinese Americans.

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you have read the book Asian American History.

95
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If you read Chinese American, his story, his argument is all the way from this 19th century.

96
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Chinese workers came to the United States to help the plantation workers.

97
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Then help to build the railway.

98
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then in the 20th century, it was a slum movement.

99
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then everyone is hiding in Chinatown.

100
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then they all have long braids and then they eat rat meat.

101
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Very, very different image.

102
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then after the 1950s, the Chinese American image is that they are a group of refugees from the Communist Party of China to the free world.

103
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then I got to Taiwan.

104
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Then I got to Hong Kong.

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In that sense, Taiwanese immigrants were placed in this whole line from the 19th century.

106
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Chinese workers, then the slum movement, then the refugees.

107
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
To understand Taiwan in this context.

108
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think it's very problematic.

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Because the first thing is that in the 19th century, we didn't have anyone.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
At that time, we were still in the Qing Dynasty.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We moved from China to Taiwan for the second time.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We are not discussing the context of Chinese Americans.

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Then in the second to 20th century, the group of people who lived in Chinatown because of the Paihua Act.

114
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Also with our impression, our memory is different.

115
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because in the 20th century, Taiwan was ruled by Japan at that time.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Most people want to immigrate.

117
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
For example, my grandfather went to Japan to study, not to the United States.

118
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The United States is not the main immigration place in Taiwan.

119
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The United States has become the most important place for Taiwanese immigrants.

120
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And even in the 1960s, the most important immigration country.

121
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It started after the Cold War.

122
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So Taiwan's immigration to the United States is actually a very modern, very cold war story.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you don't emphasize this, you will become a Taiwanese-American, Chinese-American.

124
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think a lot of people think that if you read the textbooks, or you read the textbooks.

125
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
A paradigm that has been established seems to be unbreakable.

126
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You will take it for granted.

127
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes, we are Chinese-Americans.

128
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We are like that.

129
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I think this is the first thing.

130
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The first thing is that he simplifies the story.

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The story is not that simple.

132
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Second, identity in American society is a self-claim.

133
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can say what you are not.

134
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can say what you are.

135
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No one can force you to say who you are.

136
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the case in American society.

137
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So I think because we have this space, we should go even better.

138
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Even if Taiwan and China are in a very complicated situation in Asia,

139
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
it doesn't mean that you are already in the United States.

140
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You have become a Taiwanese-American citizen in the United States.

141
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You have no right to say that you are a Taiwanese-American, not a Chinese-American.

142
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I think behind this, this Taiwanese-American,

143
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
he is what I want to use, my argument.

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There is a very important argument in my paper.

145
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I want to bring up the Taiwanese-American, independent of the Chinese-American.

146
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And why can this Taiwanese-American be independent of the Chinese-American story or argument?

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
In fact, it is a very special experience of Taiwanese-Americans immigrating to the United States during the Cold War.

148
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And what is that very special experience?

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That is, under the martial law of Taiwan, many people came to the United States in order to oppose the Kuomintang.

150
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Then, oh, no, it should be said that they came to the United States under the martial law of the Kuomintang.

151
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
After they accepted a lot of liberal ideas, progressive ideas,

152
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
they began to oppose that authoritarian rule and then to promote Taiwan's democracy.

153
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The most obvious example is the Paris era.

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
After the Melita incident in 1979,

155
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
where can those refugees like Xu Xinliang be accommodated?

156
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Most of them came to the United States.

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Then you can also know that every time something happens,

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
money and international aid are mainly provided in the United States and Canada.

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
One argument is that because of the experience of Taiwanese-Americans immigrating to the United States,

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
there is a connection with the opposition to authoritarian rule.

161
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
After you connect them together, you will find that this is very different from the Chinese-American context.

162
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You should not mix them together and say that they are all Chinese-American.

163
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then the second one is that when studying the democratization movement in Taiwan,

164
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
in fact, the role of overseas Taiwanese is not given enough attention.

165
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It seems to be just a side story.

166
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But I don't think so. I think it is actually very important.

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And this importance, especially after the Democratic Progressive Party came to power,

168
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think it should be emphasized more.

169
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, I'm a little far away now.

170
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
OK. Hello, is everyone still there?

171
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
We are all still there.

172
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
OK, OK, OK.

173
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Are there any more questions?

174
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I would like to ask if you are sharing the screen now or have not started yet?

175
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I haven't started yet.

176
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
OK.

177
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you want to share the screen, you can confirm it.

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because I'm afraid you won't be able to share it.

179
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
OK, I'll press share first and then press my screen.

180
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Can you see it like this?

181
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Not yet.

182
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But I'm already on my screen.

183
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Now you...

184
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let me think.

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
My computer is now on my screen.

186
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Then you jump back to BlueJeans.

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then BlueJeans, you slide down from the middle.

188
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You should see a share screen at the bottom.

189
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
A rectangular blue button.

190
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

191
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OK.

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then...

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You should be able to choose after you press it.

194
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes.

195
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
1 or 2?

196
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Now we can see it.

197
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Then you can press play.

198
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
OK.

199
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
OK.

200
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm recording.

201
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Is it recording now?

202
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
OK.

204
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So the topic I'm going to talk about today is Taiwanese traditional porridge.

205
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
My PowerPoint is actually very simple.

206
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just four pages.

207
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So you're welcome to ask any questions you have.

208
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
My structure is also very simple.

209
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What I'm going to talk about is...

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What is Taiwanese traditional porridge?

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And why is it important?

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Before we start, I'd like to ask if anyone has participated in a traditional porridge event in the U.S.?

213
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We have three people here.

214
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hello?

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm going to help with the traditional porridge next week.

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Where are you going to help?

217
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There's a circus troupe coming from Ann Arbor.

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you going to Chicago or Michigan?

219
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They're probably going to perform in Chicago.

220
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But the elders have brought them to Ann Arbor for a one-night show.

221
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So there's a show in your city, too?

222
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes, there's a vacancy here.

223
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So you're going to see it and help with the venue?

224
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm going to help with the venue.

225
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh, OK.

226
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I interviewed Professor Li Xianglan from your city.

227
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think he's in charge of the committee in Chicago.

228
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He told me about the event in your city.

229
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I haven't participated in it myself.

230
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm going to participate this year.

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'll post a link to the event in LA.

232
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's take a look at the event.

233
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is the LA schedule.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can see from April 21st to June 16th.

235
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's been over a month.

236
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
LA is special because it has the most Taiwanese in the U.S.

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So there are a lot of circus troupes here.

238
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If there are a lot of circus troupes, there will be a lot of shows.

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So you can compare it to Chicago.

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There are a lot of Taiwanese, but not as many as there are here.

241
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So what I know now is that there's an event in Chicago.

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's a local singer from Taiwan.

243
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There's a show from the committee.

244
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's a teacher from the Taiwan Food Association.

245
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He's in charge of a food event.

246
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
There are a lot of circus troupes in LA.

247
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So there are a lot of activities.

248
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you look at the schedule, you can see there are a few types of activities.

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The most popular one is the food tour.

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's on May 20th in LA.

251
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's in a park in Montreal Park.

252
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a whole day's event.

253
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
In addition to the food tour, there are also live performances.

254
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:56,000
In the major cities I know, including LA, San Diego, Chicago, and DC,

255
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
there are also food tours.

256
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
In addition to food, you can also see in LA.

257
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I think it's a special event.

258
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's not just about performing, eating, and playing.

259
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There are also community service events.

260
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
For example, today in LA, there's an event to clean up the LA River.

261
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's to contribute to the local community.

262
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I also know that there's a dentist in Taiwan.

263
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Some doctors provide free dental services.

264
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I also know that there's another thing to do with the local community.

265
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In many places, other than LA, there's also one in San Diego.

266
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
When there's a bridge, they'll donate money.

267
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
At the opening of the traditional week, there's a high school scholarship.

268
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's not limited to Taiwanese children.

269
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It also includes people of other ethnicities.

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
For example, in San Diego, they give six places every year.

271
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's stipulated that four of them must be foreigners.

272
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Last year, they gave an Arab.

273
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It seems to be a refugee.

274
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
He came to the United States and applied for a scholarship to support his financial needs.

275
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I also know that there's another one in San Diego.

276
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It seems to be from Syria.

277
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
When you look at the traditional week in Taipei,

278
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
you'll see that it's not just about promoting Taiwanese culture.

279
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is a very important goal.

280
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
At the same time, there's also outreach.

281
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's connected to the local community.

282
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It allows the local community to know more about Taiwan.

283
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There are three different activities in the traditional week.

284
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll talk about this later.

285
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's take a look at what the activities are about.

286
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Why is there a traditional week?

287
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:27,000
In 1992, President Bush announced that May was the traditional month of the Asian-Taiwanese in the United States.

288
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
In fact, the traditional week in Taipei is put in the context of the Asian-Taiwanese traditional month.

289
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The main purpose is for the U.S. government to praise the Taiwanese and Asians for their contributions to American society.

290
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Why is it chosen in May?

291
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
May has a very important relationship with the history of the Asian-Taiwanese in the United States.

292
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There are two reasons for choosing May.

293
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The first reason is that the first wave of Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States in May 1843.

294
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The second reason for choosing May is that the cross-strait railway was completed in 1869.

295
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:28,000
More and more people believe that the cross-strait railway in the United States was built by Chinese laborers.

296
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
For example, the 101 in Taiwan was built by Taiwanese laborers.

297
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The 101 is our icon, but it was built by foreign laborers.

298
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Sorry, I have a question from the audience.

299
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I want to ask how you define culture and what is Taiwan culture?

300
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
My paper also discusses relevant issues, so I want to discuss it.

301
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is a question from Annie.

302
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
This is a very good question.

303
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is a very good question.

304
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because I actually have a question mark where I look at the end.

305
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So, when we get to the end, when I talk about the wrap-up,

306
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I will discuss my own observations of the activities of traditional music.

307
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Actually, it will be there soon.

308
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because I only have four PowerPoint slides.

309
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So, I will write down my question.

310
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I will answer it together at the end.

311
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So, this event was chosen in May because of its contribution to American history with two Asian ethnic groups.

312
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Because of the history of Japanese and Chinese, it was decided to be held in May.

313
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
In 1992, Asian traditional music began to be played.

314
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:13,000
In 1999, during the Clinton administration, the US Congress, in order to praise Taiwanese for their contributions to the United States,

315
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
decided to separate Taiwanese from the United States.

316
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So, in May, you can choose a specific state.

317
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now I know that a lot of people will choose the state of Mother's Day as Taiwanese American Heritage Week.

318
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
This has become a trademark.

319
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It is Taiwanese American Heritage Week, not Chinese American, not Asian American.

320
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It has its own independence.

321
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:53,000
This is very important because it is related to the organizer's outreach to the local community.

322
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:02,000
When there is a Taiwanese American trademark, it can promote Taiwan and China in private.

323
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So, there is a diplomatic connection behind it.

324
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I will talk about this later.

325
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So, this is Taiwanese American Heritage Week.

326
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But there is an exception.

327
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I know that there are a lot of Taiwanese in D.C.

328
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But they did not come out of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States independently.

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Instead, they celebrated the Asian American Heritage Month together.

330
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I think this is an exception.

331
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't know why they don't particularly emphasize Taiwanese American Heritage Week.

332
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Maybe because it's in D.C.

333
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's more political sensitive.

334
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So, they don't want to cause trouble.

335
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, they put it in the context of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States.

336
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It can avoid some tensions.

337
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But other places, other than D.C.,

338
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Taiwanese communities in other places, when they celebrate May,

339
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:09,000
they put the Taiwanese American Heritage Month in the context of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States.

340
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, why is this important?

341
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
There are three levels.

342
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
For the American society,

343
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
the reason why they set up this month to commemorate

344
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
is to praise the contribution of American minorities to American society.

345
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
In addition, they want to promote multiculturalism.

346
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So, for the American society,

347
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
this is their main position on this event.

348
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
For the Taipei community,

349
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
it is an important event to establish,

350
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
gather, and strengthen ethnic identity.

351
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I want to share this.

352
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
When I was writing this article,

353
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I wanted to understand the different dynamics in different places.

354
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So, I visited different areas, different generations, and different positions.

355
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Some people are just participants.

356
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Some people have participated in many events,

357
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and they are the main organizers.

358
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
From the perspective of different people,

359
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I wanted to understand the different meanings of this event for different people.

360
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I found it very interesting.

361
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Older people,

362
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
people who came to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s,

363
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
the first generation,

364
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
when the traditional state began,

365
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
they were the founding fathers.

366
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
For them, this month,

367
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
this kind of commemorative event,

368
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
of course, it is important to let the mainstream society know them.

369
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
However, because their English is not good enough,

370
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
it seems that the younger generation of Compare

371
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
is not able to fit into the mainstream society.

372
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
How can we use the language that is familiar to the mainstream society

373
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
to talk about this culture,

374
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
to talk about this tradition?

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Their ability is relatively lacking.

376
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So, when they organize this event,

377
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
they tend to serve the people in their own community.

378
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
For example,

379
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
when I visited the organizer in the Bay Area,

380
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
he said,

381
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
his name is Cai Hejie.

382
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
He is a second-generation American.

383
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
He grew up in Illinois in the Midwest.

384
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
He is very special.

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
He does not speak Chinese at all.

386
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He often goes to Taiwan.

387
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He is an American,

388
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and he is not studying Humanities.

389
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
He studied Engineering in college,

390
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and now he is a physician.

391
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
He is a second-generation American.

392
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Anyway, he is such a person.

393
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I asked him,

394
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
why do you want to participate in this event?

395
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What is the significance of this event to you?

396
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He said,

397
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
he used to be a white person in the Central Department.

398
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So, he had an identity crisis when he was young.

399
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He felt that

400
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
in American society,

401
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
either you are a white person,

402
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
or you are not a white person.

403
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What kind of person is not a white person?

404
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He was born in the 1970s.

405
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He said that

406
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
when he was a teenager,

407
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
the mainstream American society

408
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
did not have enough nutrients

409
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to tell him what kind of person is not a white person.

410
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He was confused.

411
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I asked him this question

412
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
because I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

413
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

414
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Although their parents are Taiwanese,

415
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
their grandparents are in Taiwan,

416
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
but their interest in Taiwan

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
is very superficial.

418
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
They say,

419
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I will go back to Taiwan to see my grandpa.

420
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Taiwan has pearl milk tea.

421
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Pearl milk tea and stinky tofu are delicious in Taiwan.

422
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Other than pearl milk tea and stinky tofu,

423
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
he has zero understanding of Taiwan.

424
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Many people do not speak Chinese.

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I know a lot of people

426
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
who are more concerned about Taiwan.

427
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I know a lot of people

428
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
who are more concerned about Taiwan.

429
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The United States is the place

430
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
where they choose to settle down.

431
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The United States is the place

432
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
where they choose to settle down.

433
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Although Taiwan has a Taiwanese

434
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
ethnic concept,

435
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Taiwan is a foreign country

436
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and is not important.

437
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Taiwan is a foreign country

438
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and is not important.

439
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

440
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

441
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Many people are white-washed.

442
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Many people are white-washed.

443
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Many people are white-washed.

444
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
When they look at the identity,

445
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
they are more concerned about

446
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
their professional career.

447
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
For example,

448
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I am a doctor.

449
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I have a lot to do with my community.

450
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I have a lot to do with my community.

451
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I don't care if I am Asian

452
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't care if I am Asian

453
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
or if I am white.

454
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
or if I am white.

455
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Ethnicity is not something they care about.

456
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Ethnicity is not something they care about.

457
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
There are a lot of people

458
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
who choose this option

459
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
who choose this option

460
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
in the Taiwanese community.

461
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
in the Taiwanese community.

462
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Cai Hejie is very special.

463
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Cai Hejie is very special.

464
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He made me feel that

465
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
he made me feel that

466
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
he understands Taiwanese people.

467
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
He doesn't blame them.

468
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He doesn't blame them.

469
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
He doesn't blame them.

470
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
He doesn't blame them.

471
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
He thinks that

472
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Taiwanese American identity

473
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Taiwanese American identity

474
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
is important

475
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and he is willing to spend a lot of time

476
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and he is willing to spend a lot of time

477
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
on this issue.

478
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
on this issue.

479
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
a completes your choices

480
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000

481
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
doesn't matter

482
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
doesn't matter

483
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
because it is your choice.

484
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
because it is your choice.

485
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
because it is your choice.

486
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
He started in Ilino

487
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
He started in Ilino

488
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
then moved to San Francisco

489
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
then moved to San Francisco

490
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
He has been participating in various activities

491
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
He has been participating in various activities

492
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
but he is more concerned about the activities of Taiwanese

493
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
but he is more concerned about the activities of Taiwanese

494
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
He even has an online website

495
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
He even has an online website

496
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
called Taiwanese American.org

497
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I read a lot of things

498
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I read a lot of things

499
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think it is great

500
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
If you are interested

Sapporo

530
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Now these young people

531
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
generation after

532
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
there is a big change like me

533
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
For example, I went to visit the organizer

534
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
in Portland. He said

535
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that his previous activities were

536
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
usually held in a high school

537
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and then in the auditorium of the high school

538
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
he felt like that

539
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
he was not so satisfied he felt

540
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
he could do better

541
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
so he last year and the year before

542
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
when the general recruitment

543
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
he rented a venue in the city of Portland

544
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yes, but he is very advanced

545
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and that venue because he is a

546
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
mainstream society everyone wants to go

547
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
to see the show to listen to the concert will go to that place

548
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
so you are holding an event in that place

549
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
you can use his platform to promote

550
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
to do a lot of promotion

551
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and outreach work

552
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
so his visibility

553
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
suddenly increased

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
from this example you can reflect

555
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
for the older generation

556
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
of course, on the one hand, they have their own

557
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
limitation and then on the other hand

558
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
because

559
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
they are not fit in

560
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
so it seems that one of the purposes of this event

561
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
is to serve their own community

562
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
so in the end

563
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
it becomes a community

564
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
but the new generation

565
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
of the younger generation

566
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
because of their ability to adapt to culture

567
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
or the ability to interact

568
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
with different cultures

569
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
so in addition to being able to

570
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
internalize

571
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and also to build

572
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
this Taiwanese American identity

573
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
to do such a

574
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
cultural construction

575
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
it can actually outreach to the

576
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
mainstream society of the United States

577
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
so that the mainstream society of the United States can understand

578
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
what is the Taiwanese American Heritage Week

579
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
so I think

580
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
this is a different generation

581
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
they are organizing

582
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
such an event

583
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
they have a lot of different ideas

584
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
this is different

585
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
at the same time the reason is

586
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
different generations

587
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
have the ability to interpret

588
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
culture and have the ability to

589
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
interact with different cultures

590
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and then it also reflects

591
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
different generations

592
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
what is the positioning of this event

593
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
my own observation is

594
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
now the young generation

595
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
in fact, their main ideas are

596
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
hoping to make the mainstream society

597
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
of course, because I am more leftist

598
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
so what is this mainstream

599
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I will criticize a little later

600
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
this is also a question mark

601
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
but their idea is

602
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
we are going to the White House

603
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
we are going to Union Square

604
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we can let the mainstream society

605
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
know what we are doing

606
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
what is Taiwan

607
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
what is Taiwanese American culture

608
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
so there are different generations

609
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
will reflect a different

610
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
way of thinking

611
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and this reflects

612
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
when they are organizing

613
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
there will be a lot of differences

614
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
for example, in San Diego

615
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
it is mainly the older generation

616
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
who are organizing

617
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the most important thing is

618
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
there will be delicious Taiwanese food

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and I heard that

620
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
there is a mom in San Diego

621
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
who is very good at making zongzi

622
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
the zongzi will disappear

623
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
so she started making zongzi

624
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
about 3 weeks ago

625
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
she can make more than 1000 zongzi

626
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and it seems like

627
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
it will be sold out in half a day

628
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
so the traditional week

629
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
they want to participate

630
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
because they want to visit

631
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
their hometown

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
to see

633
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
where they grew up

634
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
so for us

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
it is a group of Taiwanese

636
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
they will feel

637
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
so nostalgic

638
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I will go there

639
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and share with other Taiwanese

640
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
how to cook

641
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
so for us

642
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
how to strengthen

643
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
their feelings

644
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
for Taiwan

645
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
but for the younger generation

646
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
of course there is

647
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I will go there

648
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
because I want to eat Taiwanese food

649
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I think there is a reason

650
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
but for the young Taiwanese

651
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
organizers

652
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
this event will be

653
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
how we use this occasion

654
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
to talk to the mainstream society

655
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
to discuss

656
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
or to promote

657
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
what Taiwan is

658
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and the importance of Taiwan

659
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
so I think

660
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I see a

661
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
very different place

662
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and the third

663
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I think is very important

664
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
this event is very important

665
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I interviewed

666
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the director of

667
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
L.A.'s church

668
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and I talked to him

669
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
about the role of the church

670
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and I found

671
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
for example

672
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
in Chicago

673
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
every year

674
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
the church

675
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
will have two groups

676
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to the U.S.

677
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
East Coast and West Coast

678
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
East Coast will go to

679
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
10 different cities

680
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
to perform

681
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
West Coast

682
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
will perform

683
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
in different cities

684
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
this is the work of the church

685
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
and they will pay

686
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to invite these groups

687
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and the food and accommodation

688
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
of these groups

689
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
will be paid by the church

690
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
but the church

691
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
has a very limited budget

692
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
so it is impossible

693
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
to invite

694
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
for example

695
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yunmeng Wuji

696
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and secondly

697
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
they can't

698
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
go to too many cities

699
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
for example

700
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
more than 15 or 20 cities

701
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
because they can't afford

702
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and when it comes to local

703
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
they don't really

704
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
have the human resources

705
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
to support

706
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
local performances

707
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
so the director

708
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
told me

709
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
a very important concept

710
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
which is the diplomatic issue

711
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
he told me

712
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
in the U.S.

713
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
the church

714
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
is just an auxiliary

715
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
they are very grateful

716
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
to the U.S.

717
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Taiwan Bridge

718
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
because the Taiwan Bridge

719
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
these groups

720
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
when they go to the local

721
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
although the church

722
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
will pay for the food

723
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
but the local

724
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
for example

725
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
celebration

726
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
these groups

727
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
are not hosted

728
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
because the U.S.

729
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
network

730
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is not enough

731
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
so you can see

732
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
this is not

733
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
like we are

734
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
helping the Taiwan Bridge

735
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
like we are

736
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
assisting

737
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
the Taiwan Bridge

738
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I think it is the opposite

739
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the Taiwan Bridge

740
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
the Taiwan Bridge

741
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is very important

742
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
for Taiwan

743
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
but the church

744
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
is not enough

745
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
and they can't

746
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
do it well

747
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so we need to rely on

748
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the Taiwan Bridge

749
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
like I interviewed

750
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
a person

751
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
he said

752
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
the church

753
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
pays for the local

754
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the local

755
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
they pay for the local

756
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
he said

757
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
they don't ask for money

758
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
from the government

759
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
they pay for the local

760
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
for example

761
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
this year

762
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
there is a cooperation

763
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
with the Taiwan Bridge Committee

764
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
but I know

765
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the main

766
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
teacher

767
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
he is not

768
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
from the Taiwan Bridge Committee

769
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
he is a Taiwanese

770
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
living in the U.S.

771
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
he likes Taiwan

772
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
he wants to help

773
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the U.S.

774
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
so he used

775
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
his own money

776
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
to pay for the local

777
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
everything is his own

778
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
so I think

779
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
this is what I want to

780
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
develop

781
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
in Taiwan

782
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
like my friend

783
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
in Portland

784
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
every year

785
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
there is a committee

786
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
to discuss

787
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
to raise funds

788
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
in May

789
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
they bought the tickets

790
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
for 5 months

791
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
but usually

792
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
they need to pay

793
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
for the tickets

794
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
they usually

795
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
buy the most expensive

796
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
tickets

797
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
they didn't go in

798
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
so a group of Taiwanese

799
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
because it's

800
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
12.52pm

801
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
there is still

802
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
10-15 minutes

803
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
so let me remind you

804
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
sorry

805
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I can't finish

806
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
so I think

807
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I want to develop

808
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
but I don't know

809
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
where to go

810
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
so I want to emphasize

811
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Taiwan's government

812
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
is in a difficult situation

813
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and needs Taiwan's help

814
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I want to emphasize

815
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Taiwan's organization

816
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
is very strong

817
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
so I want to

818
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
answer the question

819
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
what is the problem of culture

820
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I observed

821
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
so many different places

822
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
doing this

823
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I found a few problems

824
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
these three questions

825
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think they all answer

826
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
what is culture

827
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
how do you define it

828
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and what is Taiwan culture

829
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
the second question

830
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I found it very interesting

831
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I read the Taiwan public opinion

832
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
in the Taiwan-US traditional week

833
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
just started

834
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
not long

835
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
there was a discussion

836
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the Taiwan-US traditional week

837
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the American people want to promote Taiwan culture

838
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and write books

839
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and cut paper

840
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
what is the difference

841
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
this is a very interesting question

842
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
this problem still exists in Taiwan

843
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
so we say Taiwan culture

844
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Taiwan is different from China

845
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
but where is the boundary

846
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
where is the boundary

847
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
if we are in the US

848
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
we want to promote Taiwan culture

849
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
if our agenda

850
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
is to distinguish Taiwan from China

851
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
how should we navigate

852
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
how should we navigate

853
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
to make the boundary

854
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
very obvious

855
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
so people know

856
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
this is different

857
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
my observation

858
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I don't think this is a good way

859
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
but I found

860
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
we don't do it

861
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
we don't do it

862
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
we don't do it

863
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
we don't do it

864
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
we don't do it

865
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
we don't do it

866
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
what is left of Taiwan culture

867
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
isn't Chinese culture

868
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
a part of Taiwan culture

869
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I think this is a problem

870
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
even in Taiwan

871
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
you can't make it clear

872
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
this continues to the US

873
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I saw some people

874
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
for example

875
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
they invited Taiwanese aboriginals

876
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
this is different from Chinese culture

877
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
these kinds of attempts

878
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
are to make the boundary

879
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but my question is

880
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
what is the higher priority

881
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
what is the main agenda

882
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
to make the boundary

883
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
first

884
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
to make the boundary

885
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
is the solution the best

886
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
second

887
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
is the boundary

888
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
that important

889
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
isn't Chinese culture a part of Taiwan culture

890
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
second

891
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
this is related to culture

892
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I myself

893
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I saw a lot of

894
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
photos of the traditional week

895
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and their annual activities

896
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
a lot of people would record

897
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
a lot of times

898
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I would find it funny

899
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I had a discussion with a friend last year

900
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
he was in San Francisco

901
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
he was in Union Square

902
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
he was passing by

903
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
he wanted to see

904
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
because I'm Taiwanese

905
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
he saw a big

906
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
dragon

907
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
with three dragons on top

908
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
his face was shaking

909
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and he left

910
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
he was like what is this

911
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Taiwanese culture

912
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
my second question mark

913
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to promote

914
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Taiwanese culture

915
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
this kind of festival

916
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
you will find a lot of times

917
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
if the organizer is not self-aware

918
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
he will end up

919
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
repeating

920
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
the American

921
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
mainstream society

922
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and the superficial

923
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
image of Taiwan

924
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
the patriotic

925
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
image

926
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Taiwan is bubble tea

927
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Taiwan is stinky tofu

928
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Taiwan is inviting aboriginals to perform

929
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
and inviting

930
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Taiwanese to sing

931
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Taiwanese songs

932
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
this is Taiwan

933
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
but if an organizer

934
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
is organizing a cultural event

935
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
his imagination

936
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I would

937
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I would feel

938
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
scary

939
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
because

940
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you are

941
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
inside

942
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
what is this

943
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
what is his influence

944
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
what is he

945
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
when you are doing this

946
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
when you are organizing

947
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
does he make you know yourself better

948
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
or does he

949
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
just

950
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
restrict

951
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
your imagination

952
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I think this question

953
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
is important

954
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I am not

955
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
from

956
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
many events

957
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I can see

958
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
some hope

959
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
some people

960
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I talked to

961
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
they told me

962
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
for example

963
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Dr. Tsai

964
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
he does a lot of

965
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
events

966
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
and he feels

967
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
in his events

968
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
he wants to

969
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
emphasize this

970
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
he wants to

971
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
show what is

972
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Taiwanese culture

973
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
he cares about

974
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
events

975
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
he invites people to

976
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
spend a lot of time

977
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
researching

978
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
what stories

979
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
are unknown

980
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
to Taiwanese

981
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Taiwan's latest research

982
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
on history and culture

983
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and new discoveries

984
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
new debates

985
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
he is willing to

986
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
include these

987
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
he does not want to

988
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
to a superficial event

989
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Taiwan is stinky tofu

990
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Taiwan is Xiao Long Bao

991
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Taiwan is traditional dance

992
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we drink bubble tea

993
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
we are Taiwanese

994
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
he thinks

995
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
this kind of

996
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
cultural imagination

997
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
is a pity

998
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and superficial

999
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I have seen this kind of attempt

1000
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
another attempt

1001
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
this is Taiwanese American

1002
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
heritage week

1003
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
not Taiwan culture

1004
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
heritage week

1005
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I tried to ask them

1006
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
this is Taiwanese American

1007
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
heritage week

1008
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
not Taiwan heritage week

1009
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
how do you draw the boundary

1010
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and distinguish it

1011
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
of course

1012
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
on the one hand

1013
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Taiwan culture is part of

1014
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Taiwanese American

1015
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
you do not need to

1016
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
clearly say

1017
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
which part is Taiwanese American

1018
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
which part is Taiwan

1019
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
this problem may not exist

1020
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
for the older generation

1021
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
this problem may not be an issue

1022
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
on the other hand

1023
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I heard some young people

1024
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
willing to think about this

1025
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
they will say yes

1026
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I think Taiwanese American

1027
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
is a little different from

1028
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Taiwan's culture

1029
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
how should I

1030
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
in such a cultural festival

1031
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
to show the difference

1032
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
they will start

1033
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
some people

1034
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
they were born in the United States

1035
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and then use English

1036
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
to write their memories

1037
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
of Taiwan

1038
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
what is their imagination of Taiwan

1039
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
draw or write

1040
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
some short articles

1041
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
use that way

1042
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to present

1043
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Taiwanese American

1044
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
as a very special

1045
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
he is not Chinese American

1046
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
he is not Taiwanese

1047
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
a very special existence

1048
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
to see such a common sense

1049
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
it exists

1050
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
to respond to

1051
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
what is the culture

1052
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I think I still think

1053
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
that point

1054
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Taiwan culture

1055
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
how do you distinguish

1056
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Taiwan culture from Chinese culture

1057
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I think this will be an issue

1058
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
the second issue

1059
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
you can apply

1060
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
to a bigger issue

1061
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
when doing the creative industry

1062
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
you have to think

1063
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
how can I push further

1064
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
to let

1065
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
deeper understanding

1066
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
or imagination about culture

1067
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
not just to copy

1068
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
the imaginations of the mainstream society

1069
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I don't know

1070
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
if I have answered

1071
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
your question

1072
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
for me

1073
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
my question is

1074
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I believe most people

1075
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
can agree that

1076
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Taiwan culture

1077
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
even Taiwanese

1078
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
are trying to define

1079
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
in such a situation

1080
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
we are in the US

1081
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
actually abroad

1082
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
to hold a Taiwan culture

1083
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
promotion

1084
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
in 1998

1085
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
we have been promoting

1086
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
calligraphy, pen and paper

1087
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
xiaolongbao

1088
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in the next 8 years

1089
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
we have been promoting

1090
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
calligraphy, pen and paper

1091
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in the next 8 years

1092
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
it is not stable

1093
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
we are still

1094
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
searching for

1095
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
identity

1096
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
to hold such an event

1097
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
is it positive

1098
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
or negative

1099
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I would say

1100
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
identity

1101
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
this concept

1102
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
is always flowing

1103
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
so I don't think

1104
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
it has to be

1105
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
stable

1106
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
but we have been

1107
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
talking

1108
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
there may be

1109
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
conflicts

1110
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
finally we found

1111
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
a consensus

1112
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
we all agree

1113
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I think

1114
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
it is

1115
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
so you can find

1116
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
for example

1117
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
indigenous people

1118
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
you can say

1119
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
it is politically correct

1120
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
but it is

1121
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
kind of

1122
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
after 30 years

1123
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
we have been

1124
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
discussing

1125
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
it has become

1126
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
an important

1127
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
cultural icon

1128
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
or heritage

1129
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
so I would say

1130
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
identity building

1131
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
identity

1132
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
identity building

1133
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
it is not

1134
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
a consensus

1135
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
it is

1136
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
a process

1137
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
a process of discussion

1138
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
it is not

1139
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
a clean

1140
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
it has many

1141
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
grey areas

1142
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
but finally we found

1143
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
a consensus

1144
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
we all agree

1145
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
there are many

1146
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
these things will

1147
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
continue to move forward

1148
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I don't know if I answered

1149
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
your question

1150
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
thank you

1151
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
because of the time

1152
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
you can

1153
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
wrap up for 3 minutes

1154
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
thank you

1155
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
so

1156
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
my point is

1157
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
when I look at

1158
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
a cultural

1159
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
traditional week

1160
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
for me

1161
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
there are two important things

1162
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
one is

1163
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
three

1164
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
why it is important

1165
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I think

1166
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
we should not

1167
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
give up this opportunity

1168
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
to introduce Taiwan to the US

1169
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
because it is

1170
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
not only

1171
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
important for

1172
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
diversity

1173
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
it is also

1174
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
a tool

1175
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
to promote

1176
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Taiwan

1177
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
so

1178
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
if

1179
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I become an organizer

1180
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
it will be

1181
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
an important

1182
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
part of my agenda

1183
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
so

1184
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
the second

1185
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
is

1186
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
how to

1187
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
encourage

1188
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and organize

1189
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
how to

1190
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
gather our

1191
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
fellow citizens

1192
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
to have

1193
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
more

1194
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
interaction

1195
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
to know

1196
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
who we are

1197
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I think

1198
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
these are

1199
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
two important things

1200
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
the third is

1201
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
how to help

1202
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Taiwan to

1203
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
promote diplomacy

1204
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
because

1205
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the US is still

1206
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
the place with the most

1207
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Taiwanese

1208
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
if we can do well

1209
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I think this model

1210
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
can be applied

1211
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Taiwan has a lot of

1212
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
important work

1213
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
and meaningful

1214
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
things to do

1215
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
anyway

1216
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
thank you

1217
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
thank you

1218
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
for the wonderful speech

1219
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
before we end

1220
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I want to ask

1221
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
if there are any questions

1222
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
we can chat

1223
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
if there are

1224
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
any questions

1225
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
we can chat

1226
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Emma left

1227
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
but she said

1228
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
LA and Mazu temple

1229
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
yes

1230
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
she also

1231
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
invited

1232
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
the master

1233
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
what was his name

1234
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
anyway

1235
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
is it Oscar

1236
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
yes

1237
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I don't know if this is a question

1238
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
or an idea

1239
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
when everyone

1240
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
is promoting the traditional state

1241
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
and the theme of Taiwan

1242
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think

1243
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
the biggest difficulty is

1244
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
young people in Taiwan

1245
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
don't want to

1246
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
come out to help

1247
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
rely on the old people

1248
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
old people are pushing

1249
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
is that enough

1250
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I don't know

1251
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I think my question

1252
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
is more like

1253
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
how to make more people

1254
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
willing to promote this

1255
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
instead of these Taiwanese

1256
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I will say

1257
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
remind everyone

1258
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
you are sharing your Gmail

1259
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
you can turn off

1260
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
the sharing screen

1261
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
luckily I didn't

1262
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
post it on Facebook

1263
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
remind everyone

1264
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
you can answer

1265
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
yes

1266
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I think this is

1267
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
a good question

1268
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I talked to some elders

1269
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
because the Taiwanese community

1270
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
has a very important crisis

1271
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
the elderly have retired

1272
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
they are old

1273
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
it's like

1274
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
there are generations

1275
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
of problems

1276
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
different ideas

1277
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
so I will say

1278
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
young people

1279
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
don't come

1280
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
it's not just young people

1281
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it's also

1282
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
old people

1283
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
for example

1284
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I can't accept

1285
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
the elderly

1286
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
who talk to me

1287
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
we grew up

1288
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
in the era of

1289
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
martial law

1290
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
we are the generation of

1291
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
sunflowers

1292
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
even if you are a

1293
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
pro-democracy

1294
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
you talk to me

1295
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
like an old green man

1296
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I can't accept

1297
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
the anti-KMT

1298
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
the KMT is very

1299
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
sexist and racist

1300
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I can't talk to them

1301
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
will it be recorded?

1302
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
will they hear?

1303
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
hello?

1304
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
yes

1305
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
yes

1306
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
but

1307
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
if you have

1308
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
something you can't talk about

1309
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
wave your hand

1310
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and tell me to cut it

1311
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I don't know if we have a name

1312
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
the answer is

1313
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
young people don't come

1314
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
because

1315
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
young people and old people

1316
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
have different ways

1317
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
of doing things

1318
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I know many young people

1319
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
they are willing to

1320
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
do things for free

1321
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but they

1322
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
will leave

1323
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
they are not happy

1324
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
because they don't think

1325
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
they should be treated like this

1326
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
so I think this problem

1327
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
is the internal organization

1328
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
of different generations

1329
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
young people

1330
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I am very busy

1331
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
you want me to do a lot of volunteer work

1332
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
it depends on my ability

1333
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I have to work

1334
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I have to write papers

1335
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I have to do unpaid work

1336
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
if I have good physical strength

1337
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I don't have to worry

1338
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
one of my worries

1339
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I will be willing to commit more

1340
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
but at this stage

1341
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
there is no way

1342
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
let alone those who have children

1343
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
young people don't come

1344
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I think our job is

1345
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
to create a space

1346
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
this space is very friendly

1347
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
a very warm space

1348
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
it's ok if you cannot join now

1349
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
it's ok

1350
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
we understand

1351
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
but I will tell you

1352
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
this space is always welcome

1353
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
if you have time today

1354
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
you can come

1355
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
as an organizer

1356
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I will position myself

1357
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I am not saying

1358
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
why don't you come

1359
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
why don't you love Taiwan

1360
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I think this is too harsh

1361
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
because everyone's life agenda

1362
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
different time points

1363
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
their tasks are different

1364
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
yes

1365
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
understand

1366
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
thank you

1367
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
thank you Oscar and Qiqi

1368
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
for your answers

1369
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I want to ask

1370
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
one last question

1371
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
if not

1372
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
we are ready

1373
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
to end today's speech

1374
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
do you have any feedback

1375
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
let's ask if there are any questions

1376
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
yes

1377
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I will count to three

1378
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
1

1379
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
2

1380
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
3

1381
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
feedback

1382
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
do you have any

1383
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
points to add

1384
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I have a suggestion

1385
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I think you asked

1386
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
a lot of questions

1387
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
these questions

1388
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
are actually

1389
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
related

1390
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
but

1391
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I think

1392
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
these questions can exist independently

1393
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
so if you

1394
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
say them all

1395
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
like a group

1396
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
without a specific

1397
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
order

1398
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
connect them all

1399
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
actually

1400
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
the most important question

1401
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
you have to ask

1402
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
is not that clear

1403
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
so I think

1404
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
you may have to

1405
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
make a choice

1406
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
these materials

1407
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
the question you want to ask

1408
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
at least

1409
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
in this article

1410
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
you may want to ask another question

1411
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
but you can answer

1412
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
from these materials

1413
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and you want to use this question

1414
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
to ask the question of the paper

1415
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
that's another question

1416
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
but I think for a presentation

1417
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
like you want to write to the newspaper

1418
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
you may have to think about

1419
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
a very clear question

1420
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and you have to give up some

1421
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
secondary but these materials

1422
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
can also answer the question

1423
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
otherwise the structure

1424
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
will not be so clear

1425
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
there are a lot of materials

1426
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
you have to tie up

1427
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
the most important thing

1428
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
very good advice

1429
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I think

1430
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
this research is very interesting

1431
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
because actually

1432
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I had a few Taiwanese friends

1433
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
who came to the US

1434
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
they had a meeting in the US

1435
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and they did business in Taiwan

1436
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
they wanted to promote

1437
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Taiwan's exquisite agricultural products

1438
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
to the world

1439
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
such as milk and coffee

1440
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
and fruit jam

1441
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
the exquisite processing of fruit

1442
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
of course they are very

1443
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
recognized by Taiwan

1444
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
but we talked about

1445
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
what is the Taiwanese culture

1446
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
for example

1447
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
a group of Chinese

1448
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
went to New York

1449
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and made a Chinatown

1450
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
are these cultures

1451
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
American culture

1452
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
if so

1453
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
how do we define

1454
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Taiwan culture

1455
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I think this is

1456
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
a very important issue

1457
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
of course I have no answer

1458
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and I'm not an expert

1459
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
but I think this kind of research

1460
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
is very important

1461
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
to all Taiwanese

1462
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
so I think it's great

1463
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I can understand

1464
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
that kind of

1465
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
in a hurry to cut

1466
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
the workers

1467
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
in a hurry to cut

1468
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
the traditional Chinese

1469
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Chinese characters

1470
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I can understand

1471
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
their anxiety

1472
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
because you are

1473
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
doing a political battle

1474
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
you want to establish a

1475
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
discourse as a weapon

1476
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
for your political agenda

1477
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
you have to be very careful

1478
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
anything that can weaken your argument

1479
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
you have to figure out a way to get rid of it

1480
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
so I can understand their anxiety

1481
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and their persistence

1482
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
but

1483
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
but I think

1484
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I can accept

1485
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
and I can understand

1486
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and I think it's a process

1487
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
when Taiwan is really established

1488
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
these things can all come back

1489
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
now

1490
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
you can only let it be

1491
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
vague

1492
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
you don't have to mention it

1493
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
you don't have to talk about it

1494
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
you can talk about it

1495
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
you can talk about it

1496
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
assimilate

1497
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
assimilate

1498
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
with the English

1499
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
family

1500
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
family

1501
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
family

1502
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
family

1503
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
family

1504
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
family

1505
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
family

1506
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
family

1507
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
process

1508
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
as an organizer

1509
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
as a political organizer

1510
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
it will be

1511
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
considered as a

1512
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
can throw away

1513
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
can

1514
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
can use, can not use

1515
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
depends on different context

1516
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
when it's useful, you use it

1517
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
when it's not useful, you keep it

1518
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
no need to build a

1519
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
unbreakable

1520
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Taiwan culture is what

1521
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I think you don't have to

1522
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
set yourself to death

1523
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
you don't have that flexibility

1524
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
to swim in different

1525
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
different context

1526
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Oscar

1527
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
seems to have a question or not

1528
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
seems

1529
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
no, I just think

1530
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
this question, I also think for a long time

1531
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
then I think

1532
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
uh

1533
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
should say that in my experience

1534
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
is

1535
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I think

1536
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
it is more likely to

1537
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
make Taiwan into a

1538
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
speaking

1539
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
uh

1540
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
is a little bit of an

1541
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
assimilated society

1542
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
to let people know that Taiwanese people are

1543
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
what people have, for example

1544
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
for example

1545
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
last week we just

1546
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
held a speech

1547
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and then our theme

1548
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
is to put all kinds of people

1549
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
in the picture

1550
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
he is a Japanese

1551
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
so he has his own

1552
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Japanese elementary school students

1553
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and his grandmother is Chinese

1554
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and then his

1555
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
anyway, there are all kinds of people

1556
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
different races over there

1557
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
and then our theme at that time

1558
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
is to define it as Taiwan is

1559
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
everything

1560
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
because we are

1561
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
an island, it is impossible to have only one thing

1562
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
everywhere

1563
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
this is the influence of many cultures

1564
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
so you see a certain

1565
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
aspect of Taiwan, like you said

1566
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Mazu, in fact, it is also the people of the south

1567
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Mazu is also from Meizhou

1568
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
that is not Taiwan, of course you can

1569
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
seriously say that the real Taiwan is also the indigenous people

1570
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
that you are in the indigenous people is actually from the south

1571
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
to the Yuxin side, it is also the real Taiwan

1572
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
that is not

1573
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
so I mean

1574
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
instead of going to find a

1575
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
fact, like you just said

1576
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
is to find a majority

1577
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
then I think instead of

1578
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
finding a very clear

1579
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
subject, it is better to be very honest

1580
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
so that everyone knows

1581
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Taiwan is everything

1582
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
you see is not a whole

1583
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and then we have

1584
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
elements of Chinese, we have elements of Japanese

1585
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
even the Dutch

1586
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and Spanish

1587
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
really

1588
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
just an

1589
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
impression

1590
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I agree with this

1591
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
this is the controversy of the textbook

1592
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
although the KMT has been saying

1593
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
that the KMT is going to China

1594
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
but in fact, the KMT is hoping to

1595
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
you can't say

1596
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
that the KMT brought in something wrong

1597
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
right?

1598
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
How do you navigate that direction today?

1599
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You look at the world

1600
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
from a different angle, if you look at Taiwan

1601
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
from a diversified perspective

1602
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
you will find that it

1603
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
is not just a Han society

1604
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
it is not

1605
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
just the history of the past

1606
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
great China

1607
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
made it into a

1608
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
history written from the perspective of the Han people

1609
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
that

1610
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
are there any other questions?

1611
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
because I think the time

1612
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
is actually almost

1613
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
that

1614
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
looks like everyone

1615
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
should have learned a lot today

1616
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
like me

1617
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I heard a lot of things

1618
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
at the end of the speech

1619
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I want to talk a little bit

1620
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
because I was listening to your speech

1621
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I suddenly thought of a little story

1622
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I started from high school

1623
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I participated in the

1624
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
indigenous tribe service

1625
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I basically go there every year

1626
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
we are in the camp

1627
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
every time it is about a week

1628
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
every time we go to the camp

1629
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
there will be a show

1630
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
and then I was

1631
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
the first year I went up the mountain

1632
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I was very shocked

1633
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
because the first year we let the children

1634
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
decide what to play

1635
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
and then they played the theme

1636
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I think it's amazing

1637
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
although they are all

1638
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
very playful

1639
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
but you can see the context of their life

1640
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
for example, there is a play called

1641
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Grandpa is drunk

1642
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
or the sister who sells incense

1643
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
or father beats sister

1644
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
you will go

1645
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
although they are very

1646
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
if they are free to play

1647
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
they will talk about these things

1648
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
so I thought

1649
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
every year to hold a traditional week in Taiwan

1650
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
is like an identity

1651
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
a time point

1652
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
so if you see

1653
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
activities or slogans used

1654
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
in this traditional week

1655
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
more or less

1656
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
reflects the identity of

1657
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
our subgroup

1658
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I think it's very interesting

1659
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
after listening to your speech

1660
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
when they write their own things

1661
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
they will say

1662
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
as long as the topic they write is

1663
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
we let them decide

1664
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
what to play

1665
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
we don't care

1666
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
let them play

1667
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
so it can be imagined

1668
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
that those children

1669
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
from Taiwan National High School

1670
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
what they can think of

1671
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
must be the most direct theme in life

1672
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
they can immediately think of

1673
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
who the grandpa beats

1674
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
or who the father is drunk

1675
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
you can imagine

1676
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
although you can't see

1677
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
but these are their life

1678
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and they are exposed to these things every day

1679
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
this sharing is great

1680
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
just like I just mentioned

1681
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
a question

1682
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
if you don't reflect

1683
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
will you just repeat

1684
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
what the mainstream society

1685
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
imagines of you

1686
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I think

1687
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
the culture they can imagine

1688
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
is very different

1689
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
from the story

1690
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
you have heard

1691
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and I think

1692
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
this diversity

1693
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
should be brought out

1694
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
but I think

1695
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I have organized

1696
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
things

1697
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
and when you are

1698
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
very busy

1699
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
sometimes you can't think

1700
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
just like the past

1701
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
just let it be

1702
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
it's simple

1703
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
there is a network

1704
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
you can't be sure

1705
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
whether it will be popular

1706
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
there are all kinds of considerations

1707
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
so I think

1708
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
you will continue

1709
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
the imagination of the past

1710
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
but this is very dangerous

1711
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
because it simplifies a lot of things

1712
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
and what's worse

1713
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
if it just reinforces

1714
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
it doesn't help

1715
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
the mainstream society to understand Taiwan

1716
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
it's harmful

1717
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
so

1718
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
that's it for today

1719
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
thank you

1720
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
thank you

1721
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I'm looking forward to it

1722
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I feel like

1723
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I'm the type of person who keeps talking

1724
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
now I have more inspiration

1725
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
keep writing

1726
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
that's it

1727
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
thank you for your participation

1728
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
that's the end of the speech

1729
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
you can leave the chat room

1730
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
good night

1731
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
next time I will talk about

1732
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
the South China Sea issue

1733
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and the Chinese

1734
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
good luck

1735
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
you too, bye

1736
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
good night
