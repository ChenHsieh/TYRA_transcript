00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Hello, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Lin Yuwei from UC Irvine.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
Our guest for today's TerraTalk is Lu Kefan, a Ph.D. student at Fairbanks University of Alaska.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
His field of research is very interesting. It's about Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
He was a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University. He was also an intern at ZTE.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
He was a Ph.D. student for three and a half years.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
He is expected to graduate next spring.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
You can visit his defense course and see the aurora.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Let's welcome Lu Kefan.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Thank you, everyone.

01:07.000 --> 01:25.000
I don't want to bore you, so I'll introduce the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

01:25.000 --> 01:44.000
I'll talk about my field of research.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
At the end, I'll talk about my work in the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

01:52.000 --> 02:06.000
At the beginning, we saw a video.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
It's a popular video on social media.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
It tells us how to reduce sea ice in recent years.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
It's about saving polar bears, protecting the earth, reducing carbon, and protecting the environment.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It's a similar title.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
For me, this kind of video doesn't have a wrong direction.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
But from a scientific point of view, we have to be very careful when we see a similar video.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
What does the color in the video mean?

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
I think you may intuitively think that the white part is the size, volume, or thickness of the ice.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
But in fact, this video is from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
It calculates the age of the sea ice, which is the length of time the sea ice stays in the ocean.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
Why do we look at the age of the sea ice?

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
In general, we will divide the sea ice into one-year ice or multi-year ice.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
One-year ice is the gray part.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
You can see that there is a big shock every year.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Because it melts in summer.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
In winter, when the sea water reaches the freezing point, it freezes again.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
In fact, the thickness of the sea ice has nothing to do with its age.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
The average thickness of one-year ice is about 2 to 3 meters.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
The thickness of multi-year ice, which is the ice that has not completely melted in summer for more than a year, is actually about 3 meters.

03:58.000 --> 04:11.000
The thickness of one-year ice or multi-year ice may be more than 5 meters.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
So when you see a video like this, especially a large-scale video,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Because the thickness of the sea ice is very difficult to measure from the air,

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
So if you see such a large-scale video, it is usually not discussing the thickness of the sea ice, its size, or volume.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Next, let's take a look at the winter of 2016.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Take a closer look at the gray part.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
For example, as I just said, one-year ice is also 3 meters.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Multi-year ice is also 3 meters.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Then you will see that the whole piece is white.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Even the east coast of the United States still has sea ice.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Then visually, you will not feel so deeply that our sea ice is declining.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
But NASA made this video not to intimidate everyone.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
This video has several points.

05:07.000 --> 05:18.000
The first point is that we can see that most of the sea ice flows out of the Atlantic coast.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
This is the first point.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
The second point is that if we look closely at the gray area,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Or look at the statistics next to it,

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
In the summer, the gray area is the part of one-year ice.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Indeed, there is a gradual decrease in the trend.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
Then I would say that it is a decrease in the trend, not that it is really decreasing every year.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
But overall, it is gradually decreasing in the past 40 years.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
The countries that are concerned about the study of North America are the neighboring eight countries,

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
Including the United States, Greenland, Iceland, the Nordic countries, and Russia.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
In addition to the neighboring eight countries,

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
There are also countries such as Europe, Germany, France, East Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
The reason why they are so concerned about the study of North America is because

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
Everyone wants to take advantage of the lack of ice in the summer to use the fishing rights and navigation rights in the Arctic Ocean.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
So these far Eastern Asian countries can use this red line,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
This red line is the Arctic Ocean's North East Line,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
It is now being used.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
If the East Asian countries use the North East Line to travel by sea to send goods to Europe,

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
Its navigation will be only one-third of the way to the south.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
So for them, the melting of the sea ice in the summer or the gradual reduction of the sea ice area,

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
For some countries, it is not entirely a disaster or a bad thing or something they want to avoid.

07:09.000 --> 07:21.000
Then there is no need to say that the United States, Norway, and Russia have very large drilling projects along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
It's not like what everyone sees.

07:26.000 --> 07:36.000
Greenpeace has previously stated that they have used a method to prohibit Shell from drilling oil, and they have won.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
It's not like that.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
The reason why Shell stopped drilling oil in the Arctic Ocean is because they hired a large number of scientists to do research,

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
They found that if they wanted to deal with the subsequent oil problems and consolidate the ecological balance,

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
The investment and their income were not worth it, so they decided to withdraw.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
But in addition to Shell, there are quite a few oil companies in the United States, such as ConocoFlips or BP,

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
They continue to drill oil along the coast of the Arctic Ocean, and there is no need to say that the entire north coast of Norway is a drilling platform.

08:14.000 --> 08:31.000
These countries' attitude towards the reduction of sea ice is to treat it as a natural phenomenon that is already happening and is almost impossible to reverse.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
Their research focuses on how to deal with what has already happened.

08:38.000 --> 08:51.000
For example, researchers at the National Institute for Oil and Gas Engineering in Austria and Norway are now working on improving the shape of the drilling platform.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
Because we see that if there is less sea ice, the flow of sea will be strengthened, but there will still be some floating ice stuck on the coast.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
After these floating ice are affected by strong sea currents, they will hit the drilling platform, which may cause public safety accidents.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
So they want to improve the drilling platform to reduce the slowdown of floating ice hitting the sea.

09:12.000 --> 09:28.000
Or like the East Asian countries I just mentioned, they are constantly studying when to enter the Arctic Ocean and which route to take to avoid aftershocks and shipwrecks.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
For example, we know that the Arctic Ocean is very famous.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
As the sea ice retreats, the water temperature will also change.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
So we find that the Arctic Ocean is gradually moving northward.

09:43.000 --> 09:52.000
At this time, they have to consider whether to change the target species or change the area and timing of the Arctic Ocean.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
These are all countries that are now working on Arctic research.

09:57.000 --> 10:18.000
They are not completely treating the Arctic Ocean as a disaster to avoid or try to restore to the original state of sea ice.

10:19.000 --> 10:42.000
From this animation, we can see that a lot of sea ice flows out of the Atlantic Ocean.

10:42.000 --> 11:09.000
For this reason, we can see that a lot of Atlantic Ocean water flows from the Atlantic coast of the Arctic Ocean to the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean.

11:09.000 --> 11:29.000
This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

11:29.000 --> 11:57.000
The opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

11:57.000 --> 12:12.000
Therefore, Atlantic ocean water continues to flow from the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean to the north coast of Canada.

12:12.000 --> 12:37.000
This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

12:37.000 --> 12:57.000
This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

12:57.000 --> 13:22.000
This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

13:22.000 --> 13:50.000
This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

13:52.000 --> 14:17.000
This is because the opening of the Atlantic coast of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow, only about 100 to 200 kilometers wide.

14:17.000 --> 14:43.000
