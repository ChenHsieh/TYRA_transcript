1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, Project Terra is an international platform for sharing information.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We hope that scholars from all over the world can share with us

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the results of our current research and development,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and more importantly, what is the trend of development.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is not something you can easily find in Taiwan.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Project Terra can also provide people who are doing research

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
with opportunities to exchange and collaborate.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we hold a seminar like this every week.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The speakers are basically all members,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and they will share their new ideas and research trends.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Project Terra is a self-releasing organization

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
that is dedicated to public service.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We have no intention of making any profit.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All of our members are very enthusiastic doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can see our website.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you can take a look at our website.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and would like to keep in touch with us,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you can join our membership.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you can find other people to work with,

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
we will be happy to help you.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you have any questions,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
you can ask us directly.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We are usually very free to talk.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Sure, no problem.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I would like to remind you that

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when we have more and more listeners,

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
we will set the volume to silent.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So if you remember to click on the microphone icon

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
before speaking,

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you can ask questions or

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
if you have any questions,

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you can directly talk to the speaker, Beta.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, Beta, let's get started.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For some reason, I can't share the screen.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let me re-join.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, thank you, Ted.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My name is Chengxinda.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My Chinese name is Ergongcheng.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My surname is Daoda.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Today, I would like to thank Ted and Terra

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
for giving me the opportunity to introduce

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
a method we are developing.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is a new method.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The main purpose of this method is to deal with

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the interaction between light and matter.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We hope to provide a new way

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
to do this.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The method we propose is called

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mixed Quantum Classical Electrodynamics.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In English, it should be called

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Quantum-Fixed Mixed Electrodynamics.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will introduce to you in detail

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
what kind of method it is.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, let me introduce myself.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My name is Chengxinda.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
My background is that when I was in Taiwan,

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was studying math and physics in college.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I majored in math and physics.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Later, for some reason,

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
when I applied to go to college,

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I saw that there was a program called

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Chemical Physics in Columbia.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I thought it was very similar to what I was doing.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It was also something I was interested in.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I applied to this program.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was very lucky to apply to this program.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I found out that when I came to the United States,

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I became a chemical physicist.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have been used as a chemical physicist from beginning to end.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because of this reason,

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I am now working as a chemical physicist

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
at Penn University.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
To sum up,

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I use the theory of physics

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and the computational method developed in physics

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to study the problem of chemistry.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My professional field is

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
studying dynamics,

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
which is the theory of dynamics

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and the computational method of dynamics.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Specifically,

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
my Ph.D. is in Columbia.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I am doing chemical dynamics,

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
that is,

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
electromagnetic dynamics in a chemical environment.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
My postdoc,

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
what I am doing now

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
is a little different from my Ph.D.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I am doing the interaction of light and matter.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Today,

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
my talk will focus on

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
my postdoc work.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OK.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
First of all, what is light?

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We often say that light is an object.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Basically,

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
light is a very important thing in everyday life.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Light is basically an electromagnetic wave.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Electromagnetic waves

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
are basically the source of all our information.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We see things in this world.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
From the greatest extent,

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
how do we know

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
what happens on other planets

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
or on Mars, for example?

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We can

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
reflect the light of the sun from Mars

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and see from the spectrum of sunlight

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
what kind of matter there is on Mars.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How much of this matter is there?

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then,

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
there are more possibilities

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
in the development of modern science.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
These are no longer visible light.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We have different kinds of light

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
from low energy to high energy.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then, from the low energy range,

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
we have NMR

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to Raman

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or IR spectrum.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
These things are

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
lower than visible light.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Within the range of higher than visible light,

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there is UV,

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
which is ultraviolet,

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
X-ray spectroscopy, which is more powerful.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Basically, our feature is that

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
basically,

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
this

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
spectroscopy

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
shows that

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the stronger the energy,

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the deeper we can see.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just like in the form of X-ray,

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we can see that it can

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
reflect the electrons in the inner layer.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you can know what the behavior of the electrons in the inner layer is.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is one of the functions

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
of light and matter interaction.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In recent years,

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
because of the development of nanotechnology,

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
we can make our devices

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in a smaller scale.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So we can even use light,

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the quality of light,

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to manipulate matter,

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to change the nature of matter.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
For example,

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
we can put

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
a chemical reaction

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in a cavity,

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and the nature of the chemical reaction

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
may be changed.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or we can put this chemical reaction

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
on a crystal.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This chemical reaction may have

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
different behavior.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There are other

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
different nanostructures,

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
nanostructures,

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
which can have different

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
effects on light-matter interaction

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and change the nature of matter.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Another very important example

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is that in recent years,

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
there is a very popular

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
study

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
on how we use

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
light-matter interaction

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to change,

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
for example,

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
this paper

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
is a paper

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
about

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the conductivity

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
of organic semiconductors.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They put a very thin

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
membrane structure,

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and there is a circle

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
above it,

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and attach it

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to the organic semiconductor.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It can change

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the conductivity of the semiconductor.

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It can change it

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
from a bad conductor

190
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
to a better conductor.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But these

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
modern developments

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
all use the nature of light-matter.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When we need

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to understand the nature of light-matter,

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
we need to discuss

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
what is light

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and what is the difference

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
between classical light and light-matter.

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The classical light

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
is in the left panel.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We regard classical light as an electromagnetic wave,

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and the development

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
of the electromagnetic wave

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
is based on

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the Maxwell's equation,

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
which is

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the Maxwell's equation.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is a Maxwell's equation

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
without a source.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is a

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
propagate,

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
a electromagnetic wave moving forward

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
without any source.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the classical view

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
of light.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
In quantum mechanics,

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
we regard light as a group

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
of energy.

220
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Its energy

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is discretized.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You may have heard of

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the Uncertainty Principle,

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
which is

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the Uncertainty Principle.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The Uncertainty Principle

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
in light

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
corresponds to

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the distribution of energy.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The energy may not be

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
only one energy,

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but a distribution of probability.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How does quantum mechanics

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
evolve light?

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It is based on

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the Heisenberg equation.

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The H is an operator

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in quantum mechanics.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The H is an operator

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
in quantum mechanics.

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The H is an operator

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
in quantum mechanics.

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is a description

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
of how light

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
evolves

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
in a space.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is the difference

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
between classical

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and quantum mechanics?

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's take a look

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
at the matter part.

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We can also see

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
what classical matter

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and quantum matter are.

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Classical matter

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
is a particle

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
or many particles.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Many particles

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
follow

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Newton's law

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in quantum mechanics.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We all know

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
classical mechanics.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A particle has a certain speed

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and this speed changes over time.

266
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In classical

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
quantum mechanics,

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
we take

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the energy

270
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
as a series.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In quantum mechanics,

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
we describe

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the energy

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
as a wave function.

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In quantum mechanics,

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
we describe

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the energy

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
as a wave function.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The wave function

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
is a

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
distribution

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
in the direction

283
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
of space and momentum.

284
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It is not a solid

285
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
particle.

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It is a

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
distribution

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
in the direction

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
of space

290
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and momentum.

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It is a

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
distribution in the direction

293
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
of space and momentum.

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It is a distribution

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
in the direction

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
of space

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and momentum.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It follows

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Schrödinger's equation.

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It follows

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
classical and quantum mechanics.

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It follows quantum mechanics

303
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
and quantum light mechanics.

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
When we describe

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
the interaction

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
of modern light

307
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and quantum mechanics,

308
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
we can use

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
quantum light

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and quantum mechanics.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When we have quantum light

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and quantum mechanics together,

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
we can get

314
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
quantum electromagnetic energy

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In QED,

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
we can

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
integrate the matter

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and light

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
into the same wave function.

320
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Then they will have a combined Hamiltonian.

321
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then they use this huge thing

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to evolve together.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This can include

324
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
all the interaction

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
in high-level quantum mechanics.

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But this is

327
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
a very, very large

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
calculation.

329
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It is very difficult

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to do a real calculation

331
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
except for some basic models.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
One of the reasons

333
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is that the total wave function

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
contains a lot of

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
degrees of freedom.

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There are a lot of variables

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
in it.

338
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
In a real situation,

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
for example,

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I take a real nanoparticle

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
or a real

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
nanostructure

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
to calculate this thing.

344
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Basically,

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the current theory can't do it.

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So we have

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
a more

348
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
compromise approach.

349
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We develop a set

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
called Mixed Quantum Classical,

351
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
which is a combination of classical quantum

352
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
electromagnetic theory.

353
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
In this, we treat

354
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
light as classical,

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
as classical,

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and material as matter.

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Therefore,

358
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we don't need to evolve

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the light.

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We only need to care about

361
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the behavior of matter.

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then we treat

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the behavior of light

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
as a time-dependent perturbation.

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We treat it as

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
a driving force.

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's like

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
something is pushing

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
matter

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
into evolution.

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a more

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
practical approach,

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but it has some problems.

374
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Of course,

375
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
it's OK for some problems.

376
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This is not

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the method we first proposed.

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This method has been done by many people.

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But it still has some problems.

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The first problem

381
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
is that it has no feedback.

382
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The so-called feedback is that

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
we treat the light here

384
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
as bending,

385
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and we don't

386
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
transfer any energy

387
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
to the light.

388
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We don't

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
transfer any feedback

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to the light.

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Basically,

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
if you take the whole system,

393
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
the light and matter

394
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
together,

395
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you will find that

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
this theory does not meet the energy conservation.

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The second problem is that

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
we don't have fluctuation.

399
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
There is an uncertainty principle.

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
In other words,

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I should have a

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
standard difference

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
between light and matter.

404
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because

405
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
my thing is a

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
distribution,

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I should have a

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
distribution width.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But here,

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
because we use classical light,

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
there is no

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
fluctuation.

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Another problem

414
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
is that

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
because we treat it as

416
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
time-dependent perturbation,

417
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
it is a linear response.

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Basically,

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the material

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
responds to

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
what the light pushes.

422
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The light pushes

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
very hard, and it responds very hard.

424
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
However,

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
in strong coupling,

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
if the light pushes very hard,

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
it can change

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
the quality of light.

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This theory

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
cannot be explained.

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The most serious problem

432
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
is that

433
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
it cannot capture

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
a very important

435
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
physical quality called spontaneous emission.

436
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
In Chinese, it is called spontaneous emission.

437
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I will explain what it is later.

438
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
These problems

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
cause

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
classical methods

441
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
to be stuck there.

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It can't explain

443
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
the quantum mechanics

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
we want to explain.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So,

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
my job

447
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
is to

448
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
develop a new

449
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
method

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
based on

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
mixed quantum classical dynamics.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We hope

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to develop

454
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
a new method

455
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that

456
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
can

457
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
reconstruct

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
spontaneous emission.

459
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We can

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
enforce

461
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
energy conservation.

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We can also

463
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
add

464
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
the fluctuation

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
of classical light.

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
How do we

467
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
do this?

468
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Sorry, I have a question.

469
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Please go ahead.

470
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I want to ask

471
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
because

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
using all quantum mechanics

473
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
is a bit difficult.

474
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We cannot calculate it

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
by analytical solution.

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
For example, can't we calculate

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
molecular?

478
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Can't we calculate single element?

479
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Can't we calculate many-body?

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yes,

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
usually many-body

482
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
is

483
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
exponential n.

484
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Think about

485
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
how many particles

486
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
exponential n

487
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
can't run fast.

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What we can do

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is

490
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
to treat some degree of freedom

491
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
as classical.

492
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
There are many good classical methods

493
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to propagate Maxwell's equation.

494
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
For example,

495
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
single molecule

496
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
can be calculated?

497
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

498
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
As a

499
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
chemist,

500
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I want to do

501
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
something practical.

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I see.

503
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I am doing high-performance.

504
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't know.

505
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I only calculate one by one.

506
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Two or three more

507
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
are difficult.

508
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What we want to do

509
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
is to put

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
a molecule

511
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
into a cavity.

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I see.

513
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Is LR

514
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
the same

515
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
as Lindblad

516
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
equation operator?

517
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you.

518
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Is it?

519
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I just want to make sure.

520
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It is very similar.

521
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I will not

522
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
write it down.

523
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It is very similar to

524
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Lindblad,

525
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
but it can't be written as

526
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Lindblad form.

527
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It is a non-linear term.

528
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It is not like Lindblad.

529
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It is a linear term.

530
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It is a time-dependent

531
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and skewed Lindblad.

532
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I see.

533
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Keep going.

534
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I am looking forward to it.

535
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I will talk about it

536
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
later.

537
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Basically,

538
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
what we want to do

539
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
is to

540
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
make a low-energy

541
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
chemical system.

542
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We don't

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
consider

544
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
relative efficiency.

545
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We don't consider it.

546
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Next,

547
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
we will talk about

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
spontaneous emission.

549
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What is

550
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
spontaneous emission?

551
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The quantum theory of spontaneous emission

552
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
was proposed by Dirac

553
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
in 1927.

554
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Before Dirac,

555
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Einstein introduced

556
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
spontaneous emission.

557
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
In 1927,

558
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
he introduced

559
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
spontaneous emission

560
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
from the first principle.

561
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So,

562
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I consider it

563
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
as a major contribution.

564
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What is spontaneous emission?

565
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It is basically

566
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
a transition.

567
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It is a transition from

568
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
a stimulated state to an excited state.

569
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
In short,

570
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I have an electron.

571
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It is in a stimulated state.

572
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It is in an excited state.

573
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It emits the same light

574
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
as the transition energy.

575
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is called spontaneous emission.

576
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The most important thing is

577
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
a quantum system,

578
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
a two-level system,

579
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
a stimulated state and an excited state.

580
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It still emits

581
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
in vacuum.

582
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
This is because

583
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
in quantum theory,

584
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
we use

585
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
a thing called

586
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
zero-point energy.

587
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It represents the

588
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
minimum energy of light in vacuum.

589
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Some theories

590
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
correspond to

591
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
vacuum fluctuation.

592
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Although it is in vacuum,

593
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
it still

594
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
interacts with

595
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the quantum system

596
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to emit spontaneous emission.

597
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why is

598
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
spontaneous emission

599
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
so important?

600
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Fundamentally,

601
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it is a quantum process.

602
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In classical theory,

603
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
it is impossible

604
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
to get spontaneous emission.

605
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Second,

606
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
spontaneous emission

607
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
is responsible

608
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
for almost

609
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
all light.

610
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The light we can see

611
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
is because of spontaneous emission.

612
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Zero light,

613
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
visible light,

614
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
the mechanism at the bottom

615
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
is because of spontaneous emission.

616
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It is a

617
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
leading theory

618
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
of quantum electrodynamics.

619
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
After Dirac

620
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
in 1927,

621
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
a group of people

622
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
started to invest in this field.

623
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Pauli, Wigner,

624
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Eisenberg, Fermi,

625
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Freeman Dyson,

626
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and Feynman.

627
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
They started to do

628
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
QED research.

629
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
If we

630
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
use

631
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
mixed quantum classical equations

632
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
to deal with

633
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
spontaneous emission,

634
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
what will happen?

635
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I am going to

636
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
explain

637
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
what is

638
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
mixed quantum classical.

639
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
First,

640
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
we can see

641
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
my mouse.

642
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Great!

643
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Can you see my mouse?

644
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yes.

645
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
There is a little

646
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
lag.

647
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
If you want to stop,

648
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
please slow down.

649
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
No problem.

650
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
First,

651
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
let's assume

652
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
a two-level system

653
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
is placed in the vacuum.

654
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The system is

655
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
completely in spontaneous emission state.

656
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There is no

657
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
distribution

658
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
in the state.

659
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
In

660
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
mixed quantum classical,

661
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
there is no spontaneous emission.

662
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This is the line

663
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I am drawing.

664
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The line I am drawing

665
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
is the time axis.

666
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The axis is the

667
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
population of

668
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
the stimulated state.

669
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The red line

670
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
represents the

671
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
time axis.

672
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
The system

673
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
does not emit any light.

674
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
First of all,

675
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
this is wrong

676
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
in terms of quality.

677
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
However,

678
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
we found

679
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
that

680
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
if I am not

681
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
completely in the

682
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
stimulated state,

683
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
for example,

684
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I have half

685
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
of the stimulated state and half of the

686
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
stimulated state,

687
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I will find that

688
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
there seems to be a little

689
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
spontaneous emission.

690
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
However,

691
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
there is still a gap

692
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
compared to the

693
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
real spontaneous emission,

694
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
the black curve.

695
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This is

696
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
a method we have tried.

697
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We have tried other methods.

698
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
We have tried other three methods.

699
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
For example,

700
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
we have tried MCCC.

701
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It is called SQC,

702
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or CPA.

703
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
These other methods

704
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
have problems.

705
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The right side of the graph

706
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
represents the curve in the middle

707
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
of the graph.

708
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The curve in the middle

709
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
represents the spontaneous emission rate.

710
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The red line

711
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
is the red line

712
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
in the left side of the graph.

713
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
From there,

714
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I get the emission rate

715
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and compare it

716
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
with the real

717
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
spontaneous emission rate.

718
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sometimes,

719
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
for example,

720
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
when it is almost at ground state,

721
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
it will be very close

722
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to the real

723
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
spontaneous emission rate.

724
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
However,

725
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
it will get worse and worse.

726
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
When more and more population

727
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
are at ground state,

728
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the distance

729
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
will get bigger and bigger.

730
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The other methods

731
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
have the opposite

732
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
effect.

733
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
This is the second problem.

734
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The last problem

735
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
is

736
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
a very old problem.

737
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Our factory

738
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
is a classical factory,

739
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
so there is no

740
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
any fluctuation.

741
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
If I want to calculate

742
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
anything about fluctuation,

743
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I must be wrong.

744
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The method we propose

745
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
is called

746
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
PLOS R.

747
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We call it

748
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the average length method.

749
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We use PLOS R

750
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
because it is the simplest

751
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
average length method.

752
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
In the average length method,

753
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
we add

754
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
LR,

755
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
which is a little bit like

756
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the Limplot form.

757
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
What is PLOS R?

758
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It has three functions.

759
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The first one is

760
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
an additional relaxation.

761
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We take some population

762
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
from the ground state

763
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
to the ground state.

764
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The additional population

765
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
is based on

766
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
the Ehrenfest equation

767
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to deduce

768
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
how much is missing

769
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and how much

770
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
relaxation we need to add

771
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
to make it

772
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
exactly the same

773
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
as spontaneous emission rate.

774
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
This is the first thing.

775
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The second thing is

776
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
that we took some population

777
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
from the ground state

778
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
to the ground state

779
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
in the previous step.

780
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Where does

781
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
this energy go?

782
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This energy should be

783
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
put into

784
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
the power plant.

785
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It should

786
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
become

787
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
a part of

788
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
the power plant

789
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
or the magnetic field

790
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
to ensure

791
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that

792
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
the whole system

793
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
is energy-stable.

794
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So we designed a method

795
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
to make

796
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
this energy

797
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
to be put

798
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
into the power plant.

799
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We also designed

800
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
a thing called

801
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
stochastic,

802
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
which is a random

803
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
defacing.

804
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
In a random process,

805
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
the system

806
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
will decide

807
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
whether to

808
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
turn the system's phase

809
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
a little bit.

810
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It can decide

811
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
whether to

812
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
turn the system's phase

813
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
a little bit.

814
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
This small

815
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
stochastic defacing

816
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
introduces

817
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the fluctuation

818
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
of the classical

819
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
power plant.

820
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm not running

821
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
one trajectory,

822
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
but many trajectories

823
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
to balance

824
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
its trajectory behavior.

825
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We can

826
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
tell

827
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
what is

828
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
the coherent

829
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
of the power plant

830
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
we are

831
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
generating.

832
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Is there

833
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
a part of

834
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
coherent,

835
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
which means

836
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
it has

837
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
a certain frequency,

838
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and the other part

839
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is incoherent.

840
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The incoherent part

841
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
means the frequency

842
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
shifts a little bit,

843
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and the value

844
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
is zero.

845
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
With these three

846
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
additional

847
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
plus-or strategies,

848
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
we can

849
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
recover

850
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the green line.

851
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We can

852
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
recover

853
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
the spontaneous

854
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
emission rate.

855
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It's a little bit

856
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
of a pain in the ass.

857
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We know

858
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
the difference,

859
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and we can

860
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
recover the spontaneous

861
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
emission rate.

862
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
However,

863
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
this is not

864
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
the selling point.

865
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The selling point is

866
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
that we can

867
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
recover

868
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
the correct emission rate.

869
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Although our emission

870
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
will be a pile of

871
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
thousands of

872
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
classical

873
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
power plants,

874
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
on average,

875
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it will be

876
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
consistent with the

877
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
quantum intensity.

878
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Let me

879
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
explain this to you.

880
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The blue line

881
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
is the intensity.

882
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's like the

883
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
square of the power plant.

884
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The blue line

885
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is the

886
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
square of the

887
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
power plant.

888
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
We all know

889
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
that the

890
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
difference between

891
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the average square

892
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and the average square

893
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
is the standard difference.

894
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
From 50-50,

895
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
when the

896
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
system is

897
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
50-50,

898
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
the standard difference

899
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
is smaller.

900
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If we

901
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
start from

902
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
100%,

903
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
from

904
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
78,

905
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
the two-level

906
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
system

907
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
will have a

908
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
very big standard difference.

909
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What does this mean?

910
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It means that

911
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
from this 100%

912
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
two-level system,

913
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
there is no coherence emission.

914
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The blue line below

915
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
is the coherence emission.

916
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Anyway,

917
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
we are

918
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
very satisfied

919
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
with this result.

920
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
We can see that

921
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
although we use

922
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
classical power plants,

923
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
we are still satisfied

924
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
with this result.

925
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Now, let's recap

926
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
what we have done.

927
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
We have proposed

928
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
ERMFES PLUS R

929
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Mixed Chromium Classical Dynamics.

930
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It can recover

931
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
spontaneous emission.

932
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It also satisfies

933
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
energy conservation.

934
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
We even

935
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
modified

936
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ERMFES PLUS R

937
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Mixed Chromium Classical Dynamics

938
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
to simulate

939
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
quantum fluctuation.

940
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I have a question.

941
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Sorry.

942
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Can you go back

943
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
to the previous slide?

944
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Why is the

945
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
electric field

946
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
average

947
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
not zero?

948
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Generally speaking,

949
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
for spontaneous emission,

950
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
the average square of

951
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
the electric field

952
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
should be zero.

953
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The average square of

954
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
the electric field

955
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
is only

956
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
zero in one situation.

957
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
If the system

958
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
is fully

959
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
activated, it is zero.

960
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
However, when the system

961
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
is fully activated,

962
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
the average square of

963
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
the electric field

964
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
is not zero.

965
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sorry.

966
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
My question is

967
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
for any electromagnetic wave,

968
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
the average square of

969
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
the electric field

970
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
should be zero.

971
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The average square of

972
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
the electric field

973
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
is zero in one situation.

974
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
The average square of

975
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
the electric field

976
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
is 0.

977
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is it right?

978
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Sorry.

979
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The average square of

980
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
the electric field

981
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
is 0.

982
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Sorry.

983
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I have absolute value here.

984
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I want to compare

985
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the difference between

986
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
coherence emission and

987
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
all emission.

988
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You can think of it as

989
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
the amplitude of the electric field.

990
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's like a sine.

991
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's the value in front of the sine.

992
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Sorry.

993
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's the amplitude of the electric field.

994
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's the square of

995
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the amplitude of the electric field

996
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and the intensity.

997
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I see.

998
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you.

999
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Let's continue.

1000
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Now we have this.

1001
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Very good.

1002
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I want to do more

1003
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
with this good tool.

1004
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I don't want to just do two-level system.

1005
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I want to do a more complicated system.

1006
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Of course, it can't be too complicated right away.

1007
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So we looked at two different cases.

1008
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
One is Raman.

1009
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The first case is Raman scattering.

1010
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It's to test

1011
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
our

1012
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Ernefest plus R method.

1013
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Is there a way to

1014
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
deal with multiple quantum states?

1015
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The second question

1016
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
is called Moller triplet.

1017
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Basically, it's a very strong

1018
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
phenomenon.

1019
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We want to test

1020
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
if Ernefest can handle

1021
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the electric field in the wall.

1022
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
First,

1023
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Raman scattering.

1024
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Raman

1025
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
is basically

1026
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
a

1027
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Indian scientist.

1028
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Very cool.

1029
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The most basic model

1030
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
of Raman scattering

1031
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
is three-level system.

1032
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You can see on the right

1033
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
0, 1, 2.

1034
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Energy from 0 to

1035
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
1 to 2.

1036
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
In the beginning,

1037
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
the system

1038
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
is on 0.

1039
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
There is a

1040
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
beam of light coming in.

1041
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This beam of light will

1042
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
pump the electricity from 0 to 2.

1043
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
0 and 1

1044
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
are not coupled

1045
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
in the system.

1046
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So,

1047
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
they pump the electricity

1048
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
from 0 to 2.

1049
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
There are two possible

1050
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
pathways from 0 to 2.

1051
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
One is from 2 to 0

1052
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
or from 2 to 1.

1053
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So,

1054
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
the beam of light

1055
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
comes from every transition.

1056
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
The beam of light

1057
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
is elastic.

1058
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It is the same frequency

1059
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
from 0 to 2

1060
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and back to 0.

1061
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So, it is called elastic process.

1062
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The other frequency

1063
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
from 2 to 1

1064
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
is called

1065
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
inelastic process.

1066
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
In quantum mechanics,

1067
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
the whole process

1068
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
can be explained

1069
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
by a formula.

1070
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
This is a

1071
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
KHD,

1072
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Kramer, Heisenberg and Dirac.

1073
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This is a

1074
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
quantum formula

1075
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
to explain

1076
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
the spectrum.

1077
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Why

1078
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Raman Scattering

1079
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
is so important?

1080
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It contains a lot of important information.

1081
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
For example, it can tell us

1082
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
the excited state,

1083
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
which is the state above.

1084
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What is the movement

1085
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
of Raman?

1086
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It also contains a lot of

1087
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
molecular structure information.

1088
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
For example,

1089
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Raman's

1090
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
spectroscopy is used on the surface.

1091
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So, it can know

1092
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the structure of

1093
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
the molecule attached on the surface.

1094
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Is it straight or curved?

1095
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
There are different

1096
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Raman's movements.

1097
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I forgot to mention that

1098
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Raman has

1099
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
three different transitions

1100
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
with different labels.

1101
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
R stands for Reidy.

1102
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Reidy means

1103
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
from 2 to 1, which is the elastic part.

1104
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Stock Raman

1105
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
is from 0 to 2

1106
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and back to 1.

1107
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is from 0 to 2 to 1.

1108
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This is called

1109
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Stock's Reidy.

1110
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Anti-Stock's Reidy is a

1111
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
weaker signal.

1112
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
It still has a chance

1113
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
to go from 1 to 2 and back to 0.

1114
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
This is a weaker

1115
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
signal.

1116
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
OK.

1117
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Next,

1118
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
basically,

1119
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
we want to know

1120
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
whether Mixed Kronenklassik

1121
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
can

1122
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
capture Raman's scattering.

1123
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
There are some

1124
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
problems here.

1125
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Basically, Mixed Kronenklassik

1126
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
does not have a plus R.

1127
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
There is only one

1128
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
elastic scattering.

1129
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
There is only one R.

1130
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You can see it in the

1131
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
picture.

1132
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I have different

1133
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
scattering frequencies

1134
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
from

1135
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
3 quarters

1136
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
to

1137
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
3 quarters of 0 to 2

1138
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to more than 0 to 2.

1139
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
There are different frequencies.

1140
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It is not necessarily resonance.

1141
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This is Resonance Raman.

1142
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
OK.

1143
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Although I can get

1144
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
this one,

1145
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
but

1146
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
in Mixed Kronenklassik,

1147
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't have

1148
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
any other mechanism

1149
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
to make it go from 2 to 1.

1150
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Basically, it is impossible

1151
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to have any

1152
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Raman's scattering.

1153
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
In addition, the old problem of MQC

1154
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
is that there is no fluctuation.

1155
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
After adding

1156
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
RMFS plus R solution,

1157
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
we will find that

1158
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
the picture on the right

1159
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
can completely recover

1160
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Dock's Raman.

1161
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
In fact,

1162
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
we can also get Anti-Stock Raman,

1163
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
but the signal

1164
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
of Anti-Stock Raman is very small.

1165
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If we draw a

1166
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
log plot,

1167
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
there is a signal,

1168
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
but it is relatively weak,

1169
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
so the signal is very small.

1170
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We can see

1171
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the Anti-Stock Raman.

1172
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But how accurate

1173
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
is this Anti-Stock Raman?

1174
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So we can

1175
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
compare it

1176
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
with KHD.

1177
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The picture on the top

1178
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
shows

1179
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
RMFS plus R

1180
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
blue line.

1181
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It is almost

1182
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
qualitatively agree with

1183
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
quantum mechanics.

1184
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
The red line

1185
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
does not add RMFS plus R.

1186
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We find that there are

1187
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
several order of magnitude

1188
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
difference.

1189
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
This picture

1190
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
proves that

1191
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
RMFS plus R

1192
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
is not only a quantitative improvement,

1193
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
but also

1194
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
different physics.

1195
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
There is a

1196
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
qualitative difference.

1197
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Next,

1198
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
we see that

1199
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Riley and

1200
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Raman,

1201
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
RMFS plus R

1202
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
is very similar to

1203
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
KHD.

1204
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Let me

1205
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
recap again.

1206
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What did we learn

1207
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
from Raman Scattering?

1208
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
RMFS plus R

1209
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
is very similar to

1210
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
KHD.

1211
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
RMFS plus R

1212
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
is very similar to

1213
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
KHD.

1214
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
RMFS plus R

1215
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
allows us to

1216
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
do the multistate transition.

1217
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
allows us to do the multistate transition.

1218
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We can get a multistate transition

1219
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
with a good

1220
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
quantization.

1221
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We don't need

1222
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
to use our hands

1223
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
to create a frequency

1224
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
to make it vibrate.

1225
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
We can get a

1226
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
inelastic scattering

1227
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
with RMFS.

1228
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Lastly,

1229
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I'm sorry,

1230
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I interrupted you.

1231
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You can continue.

1232
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I have a question.

1233
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I have a question.

1234
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
RMFS plus R

1235
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
RMFS plus R

1236
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
RMFS plus R

1237
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
RMFS plus R

1238
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
RMFS plus R

1239
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
RMFS plus R

1240
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
RMFS plus R

1241
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
RMFS plus R

1242
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
RMFS plus R

1243
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
RMFS plus R

1244
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
RMFS plus R

1245
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
RMFS plus R

1246
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
RMFS plus R

1247
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
RMFS plus R

1248
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
RMFS plus R

1249
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
RMFS plus R

1250
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:57,000
RMFS plus R

1251
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
RMFS plus R

1252
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
RMFS plus R

1253
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
RMFS plus R

1254
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So if I understand correctly, you add a Resonance Intermediate State in the middle

1255
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Add a Resonance Intermediate State in the middle

1256
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Because if it's Fermi's Golden Rule, you choose an energy and all your In and Out will be Resonant with that energy

1257
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
No, what I mean is

1258
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
What I mean is

1259
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I know

1260
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
For example, I know every transition 2-1

1261
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
2-1 and 2-0

1262
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
They all meet different Fermi's Golden Rule

1263
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Fermi's Golden Rule is a rate

1264
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
There is a transition rate

1265
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
In my theory

1266
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I can deduce

1267
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
How much is the difference between RMFS and Fermi's Golden Rule

1268
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Then I will use those three methods to add the difference

1269
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's OK

1270
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Let me ask

1271
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Sorry, can you go to the next page?

1272
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yes

1273
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Next, I want to see the picture on the right

1274
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Sorry, I want to see the picture on the right

1275
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So the input frequency

1276
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
In these ranges, do you have to re-calculate how to add other parameters?

1277
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Or these are already

1278
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Omega i

1279
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
There are ten

1280
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Do you have to add other parameters ten times?

1281
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That may be easy

1282
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't understand

1283
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I just ask

1284
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It doesn't matter

1285
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Actually, it doesn't matter

1286
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Every trajectory is exactly the same

1287
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Just change a parameter

1288
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Omega i

1289
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yes, I just need to change Omega i

1290
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I didn't change anything

1291
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I didn't change anything else in the calculation

1292
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So I don't need to re-calculate

1293
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Can I ask a question?

1294
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Whether it's Rayleigh or Raman

1295
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You said you want to use Fermi's Golden Rule

1296
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But in general

1297
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
State 2 is a virtual state

1298
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So in reality

1299
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You can't get the real coupling constant

1300
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
How do you solve this problem?

1301
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Can't get the real coupling constant

1302
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
In practice, you can measure Rayleigh scattering cross-section

1303
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Or Raman scattering cross-section

1304
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
But you can't get a

1305
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Real state and virtual state coupling

1306
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
How much is it?

1307
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yes

1308
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's like this

1309
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I don't have virtual state and real state coupling here

1310
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The coupling I use is

1311
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Resonant coupling

1312
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I shouldn't say resonant, sorry

1313
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
The coupling I use is actually 1 and 2 coupling

1314
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Then

1315
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If you look back from the lab

1316
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Because my idea is more from

1317
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
First principle

1318
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
If I want to calculate this

1319
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
In fact, the actual molecule to calculate this

1320
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I will use electronic structure

1321
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Use electronic structure to calculate the real coupling

1322
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
This coupling

1323
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Not the real coupling

1324
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
In the electronic structure

1325
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
How big is the coupling

1326
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
This coupling is good

1327
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
This coupling can be calculated in the electronic structure

1328
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's a transition dipole moment

1329
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
1 and 2 state transition dipole moment

1330
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The light I hit

1331
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Whether there is resonance

1332
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I use the transition state dipole moment

1333
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So what you mean is

1334
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You have real state in the molecule

1335
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Then you use real state transition dipole moment

1336
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Then you sum up all these real states

1337
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yes

1338
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Because in this mixed quantum classical

1339
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I don't have any virtual state

1340
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It's not like the sum over state theory

1341
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I have a lot of virtual state

1342
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
No, this is real state

1343
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Then different frequency

1344
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Thank you

1345
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because it is a bit like a driving system

1346
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It is a dynamical system

1347
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I hope this will answer your question

1348
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Any other questions?

1349
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
No, I will continue

1350
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Where did I just talk about

1351
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
In the end, we want to say

1352
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
In the end, the problem we want to deal with

1353
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Is a strong problem

1354
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
What about this strong problem

1355
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It's called model triplet

1356
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It is a two-level system

1357
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Back to a very simple two-level system

1358
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But there is a very strong classical field

1359
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
What is the biggest feature of model triplet

1360
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I think the coolest point is that it is classical

1361
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Classical in quantum now

1362
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It's a bit like laser

1363
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's a coherent state

1364
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It's very close to classical mechanics

1365
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Classical mechanics

1366
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But the spectrum it emits

1367
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It's a very, very non-classical

1368
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's a very quantum spectrum

1369
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Why is that?

1370
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Because this field

1371
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This field is because it is very strong

1372
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So it's basically

1373
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It has exceeded all the encirclement theory

1374
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So we can't use the encirclement theory anymore

1375
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So in quantum theory

1376
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's a bit like a mixing state

1377
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's a bit like a hybridization

1378
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
What about the picture in the lower right corner

1379
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Actually on the left

1380
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
On the left side of this diagonal

1381
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
It's bare state

1382
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I made

1383
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Two-level system

1384
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Generate

1385
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Sorry

1386
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Two-level system and light frequency

1387
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The state generated

1388
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Draw it out

1389
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
After the hybridization is drawn

1390
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You will find that the one on the right is the state after the hybridization

1391
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's a bit like a mix

1392
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's a bit like a dress state

1393
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But it's light

1394
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Hybridization is the hybridization of light and two-level system

1395
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So its energy level

1396
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Will be changed

1397
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Then

1398
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Inside the dress state model on the right

1399
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It has three different

1400
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Launch frequency

1401
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
The first one

1402
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
We call it T

1403
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Why is it called T? It's actually very simple

1404
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's called three

1405
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Three photons

1406
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You can see it from the highest

1407
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
After one, two, three

1408
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Three times to the lowest

1409
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So it's called triple

1410
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Three photons

1411
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Then what about F? F is called fluorescence

1412
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Fluorescence is basically

1413
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
It's the lowest level

1414
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It's the two closest

1415
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Between

1416
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Launch

1417
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Then the other two

1418
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's called Rayleigh

1419
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Two Rayleigh

1420
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
It goes through two photons

1421
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It's called Rayleigh

1422
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
That

1423
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
This

1424
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
The whole quantum theory

1425
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Gave us three different

1426
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Frequency, which means it's three different

1427
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Peak

1428
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Then inside these peaks

1429
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Will be produced

1430
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It contains the Rabi frequency

1431
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Rabi is

1432
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The gentleman on the left is Rabi

1433
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
He was actually in Columbia before

1434
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Very cool

1435
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Then

1436
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
The same we can use this

1437
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Mixed quantum classical method

1438
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Let's try

1439
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
We found that if we don't put any

1440
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Change we don't put any

1441
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
We found that this system is basically

1442
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Classical in, classical out

1443
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's classical in, it's classical out

1444
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
There won't be much change

1445
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
If you were a kid

1446
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Or high school

1447
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
There is a physical phenomenon

1448
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That is, you put

1449
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
A pile of protein

1450
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Put in a

1451
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Tie a pile of protein

1452
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Tie a pile of protein on the same pole

1453
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
The pole has a fixed frequency vibration

1454
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
After a long time, they will be synchronized

1455
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Together

1456
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
This phenomenon is basically the same as what we see here

1457
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
It's like

1458
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I

1459
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Although there are many different frequencies in it

1460
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Run in there

1461
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
In fact, we are looking at

1462
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
This mixed quantum classical

1463
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
In a short time, you will see three peaks

1464
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We can see three peaks

1465
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But for a long time, you will find that the two peaks next to it

1466
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Gradually disappeared

1467
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Only the middle peak is left

1468
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Basically it is a

1469
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Classical driving system

1470
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Classical in, classical out

1471
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Nothing else

1472
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The other is

1473
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
There are other old problems

1474
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
We don't have any fluctuations here

1475
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That

1476
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
With this plus r

1477
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
We will find that this blue line

1478
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Is the line after the plus r

1479
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
We can see that they can

1480
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Have a stable

1481
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Side peak

1482
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It won't be because of time

1483
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It won't disappear because of a long time

1484
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Why is there a stable side peak?

1485
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
In fact, it is

1486
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
In fact, it is a

1487
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Return to

1488
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Random perturbation

1489
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Stochastic defacing

1490
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's a bit like

1491
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
In this classical system

1492
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Push it from time to time

1493
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Don't let it fall back

1494
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
The huge frequency

1495
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Don't let it be forever

1496
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Classical in, classical out

1497
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
There is a small stochastic

1498
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Defacing is actually very important here

1499
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It can make

1500
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
The two side peaks are stable for a long time

1501
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
We want to know

1502
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Here we can see that

1503
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
These three ratios are r

1504
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
With f and t

1505
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
With

1506
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
All classical theory

1507
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The prediction is consistent

1508
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
We want to know

1509
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Is there any other

1510
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
More interesting properties

1511
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We can compare with classical theory

1512
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
What about here

1513
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
We show

1514
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
This picture above

1515
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Is the result of an experiment

1516
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
2012

1517
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The result of the experiment

1518
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
What did it change?

1519
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It is also a model triplet

1520
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Then the different lines

1521
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
From the bottom to the top

1522
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Also different

1523
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Infrared light frequency

1524
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Then you will find that

1525
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
There are several features

1526
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
The wind in the middle

1527
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Almost unchanged

1528
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But the wind next to it

1529
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Different

1530
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Different evolution

1531
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The first one is

1532
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Peak position

1533
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You can see the picture on the right

1534
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
The middle line

1535
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
The middle line

1536
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
The middle line is

1537
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Central peak

1538
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It doesn't change much

1539
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But this

1540
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Side peak

1541
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It is with

1542
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
This width is called

1543
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Many people call

1544
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Generalized

1545
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Rabi frequency

1546
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It is off resonance

1547
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Not necessarily resonance

1548
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Rabi frequency

1549
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
This experiment

1550
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Very well with theory

1551
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
This

1552
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
This peak

1553
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Basically

1554
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Basically

1555
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
This

1556
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
The position of the peak is not a rare thing

1557
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So in practice and theory

1558
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Not too much

1559
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Then we

1560
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
In

1561
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
In urbanfest plus r

1562
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You can also see the same behavior

1563
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
That is to say

1564
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Central peak

1565
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Fixed

1566
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Side peak

1567
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
There is a

1568
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Generalized Rabi frequency

1569
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
These two pictures

1570
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
A little flip

1571
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Because I want to be the same as the left

1572
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
X and y are above

1573
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
The experiment is the opposite

1574
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But if you turn it over

1575
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
The color is correct

1576
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Blue against blue

1577
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This is what we observe

1578
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Very good point

1579
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
This is basically

1580
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Is not a difficult thing

1581
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But

1582
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Excuse me

1583
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
In addition to these three peaks

1584
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
There is another peak outside

1585
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Correct

1586
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
There are more on the left and right

1587
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So that is also

1588
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Resonance

1589
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Resonance

1590
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It may be higher

1591
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Higher

1592
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Correct

1593
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Let me make sure

1594
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I have an impression

1595
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Please tell me

1596
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I remember the so-called

1597
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Because the light is very strong

1598
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So

1599
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Equal to this original

1600
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
There is an ac

1601
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
This way

1602
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Create two more

1603
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
My previous understanding is like this

1604
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Correct

1605
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So this calculation method

1606
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Above

1607
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
The method they came up with in 2012

1608
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Is it a simulation method?

1609
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
In fact

1610
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Use you today

1611
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
The method of analysis

1612
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The method they use is

1613
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
The method they use is

1614
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Is

1615
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Dark shift

1616
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
There is

1617
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Electrophonic hybridization

1618
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You can put those

1619
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The relationship between

1620
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Calculate

1621
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
OK

1622
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Then continue

1623
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The earliest MOLO paper is

1624
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
1967

1625
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The earliest prediction

1626
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
MOLO triplet was in 1967

1627
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Then later

1628
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Of course a lot of people

1629
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Just go in and explain this thing

1630
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
There is a very good resource

1631
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Do a lot

1632
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Work in this area

1633
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Then

1634
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Okay, let's take a look at one

1635
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
More interesting thing

1636
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
That is, I am comparing

1637
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This picture is what I compared

1638
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Except that I want to compare

1639
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
The position of the peak, I also want to compare

1640
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Can I get

1641
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Can I get the correct

1642
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Coherence emission

1643
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
What about this one on the left?

1644
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
What about this curve?

1645
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Quantum mechanics

1646
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Is the whole quantum theory

1647
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That

1648
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Coherence emission

1649
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
The ratio

1650
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That

1651
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
This green dot

1652
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
There is a dot

1653
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
We use

1654
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Ernest plus r to calculate

1655
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Then we found here

1656
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Especially near the place

1657
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Delta omega is zero

1658
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Near the place

1659
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Very good

1660
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Is there a way

1661
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
We also have a small caveat

1662
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
In fact, this quantum mechanics

1663
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
The theory is based on

1664
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Rotating wave approximation

1665
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It is based on

1666
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Very close to this

1667
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Very close to the resonance

1668
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So we don't know

1669
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Far away

1670
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Where is the resonance

1671
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The theory of quantum mechanics

1672
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Is our calculation method

1673
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The theory of quantum mechanics

1674
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Is it accurate?

1675
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So this place

1676
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
We are not very clear

1677
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Is this place accurate?

1678
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Anyway, what we get is

1679
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Quite different

1680
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
At least near the resonance

1681
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Their results are very close

1682
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
What about this thing on the right?

1683
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Is a

1684
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Can play

1685
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It can almost surpass

1686
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Rotating wave approximation

1687
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That is to say

1688
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
If we look at the peak on the left

1689
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
For

1690
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
For

1691
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
For

1692
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Different frequency changes

1693
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
That

1694
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
The red line

1695
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Is the right side peak

1696
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
The blue line is the left side peak

1697
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
That

1698
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Is the quantum theory

1699
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Under this

1700
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Under this

1701
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
It is a line

1702
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
It will not predict at all

1703
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Irregular situation

1704
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Because it is only

1705
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Focused on

1706
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
One level

1707
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
One level quantum behavior

1708
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Because of this

1709
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Rotating wave approximation

1710
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It only focuses on one level quantum behavior

1711
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So it can get the middle one

1712
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It's right, but it can't get it

1713
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
At this point

1714
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
But our

1715
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Mixed quantum classical method

1716
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Because I didn't do anything

1717
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Rotating

1718
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Rotating wave

1719
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
So the result I got

1720
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I can get this

1721
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Linear crossing result

1722
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
This result is actually

1723
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
The result of the experiment is the same

1724
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That is, in practice, we can also see

1725
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
This is not a fixed point

1726
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
It is a

1727
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Linear crossing

1728
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
This result is very

1729
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Exciting result

1730
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So

1731
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So

1732
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Finally

1733
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
This is a final recap

1734
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
We found this

1735
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
RFS class R dynamics

1736
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It can almost simulate

1737
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Quantum mixing

1738
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
There is no mixing mechanism

1739
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But just use

1740
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Driving field

1741
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
With a small stochastic

1742
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Diffusing, I can simulate

1743
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Quantum mixing

1744
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
We can also

1745
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Very clearly distinguish

1746
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Coherence emission and incoherence emission

1747
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I hope

1748
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
These

1749
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Advantages can tell

1750
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Everyone that we are developing now

1751
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The theory is a very reliable

1752
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Method

1753
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
To deal with

1754
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Light-material interaction

1755
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But this method still has a lot of problems

1756
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
This method

1757
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
We are still

1758
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I haven't thought about any

1759
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Quantum mixing

1760
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
That is, our current

1761
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Matter is a very simple matter

1762
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Two-level system, three-level system

1763
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Is a very simple matter

1764
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
From the perspective of a chemist

1765
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
We are

1766
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
We hope that we can

1767
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
At least put some

1768
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Chemistry

1769
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Put potential energy

1770
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Put nuclear

1771
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Put in

1772
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Non-adiabatic dynamics

1773
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Put these different behaviors

1774
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
This is a

1775
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
A good direction

1776
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Another question mark

1777
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Can we get

1778
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Photon counting statistics

1779
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Because there are

1780
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The second point and the third point

1781
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Very similar

1782
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Anti-function

1783
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Because

1784
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
There is another big feature of monostripe

1785
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I haven't covered here

1786
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Three-wind

1787
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Quantum counting statistics

1788
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Because

1789
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The sequence of light

1790
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So every light

1791
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
For example

1792
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
F light

1793
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
The first one

1794
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
The next one may be very close to it

1795
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
T light

1796
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
The first one

1797
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Must be far away from it

1798
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Can't release a light right away

1799
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
When you measure the light

1800
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
When the statistics are

1801
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You will find

1802
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
F light may be

1803
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
In line with

1804
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Poisson distribution

1805
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
T light

1806
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Subpoisson distribution

1807
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
The quality of light

1808
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Will be different

1809
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Here

1810
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
We haven't tried it yet

1811
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Of course

1812
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
There is no light here

1813
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
We can get similar

1814
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Last

1815
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Thermal light

1816
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
If the light is not

1817
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Not

1818
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Not at 0 degree

1819
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
There is a thermal distribution

1820
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Then

1821
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Can we

1822
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
In mixed quantum classical

1823
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Get detail balance

1824
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Or we may

1825
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Violate detail balance

1826
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
The last question

1827
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Is a very important question

1828
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
In many systems

1829
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Two-level system

1830
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Spontaneous emission rate

1831
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
May be changed

1832
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Not in line with Fermi's golden rule

1833
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Spontaneous emission rate

1834
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Because of cavity

1835
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Cavity causes strong interaction

1836
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Strong interaction

1837
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Causes

1838
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
This

1839
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
The frequency of emission will change

1840
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
This method

1841
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Based on Fermi's golden rule

1842
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
May be

1843
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So this is also a possibility

1844
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Need to consider

1845
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Then

1846
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
We do this

1847
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Method

1848
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Method development

1849
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Method development

1850
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
For people

1851
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
The most common thing we do

1852
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Is that we have created a new toy

1853
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Is

1854
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
We want to use it in many places

1855
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Hope many people

1856
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Use it in many places

1857
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
For us

1858
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
A very important question

1859
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
When will it break down

1860
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
This is the most important

1861
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
The most important thing we want to know

1862
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
When does it not work

1863
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
That

1864
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Of course there are many

1865
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Application

1866
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
These things are

1867
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
We hope to push it to

1868
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Other

1869
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Spectroscopy

1870
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Spectroscopy group

1871
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Let's try

1872
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Can we use this

1873
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Same method

1874
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
To see

1875
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Chemistry

1876
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Put it in a cavity

1877
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It may be because of the interaction with light

1878
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
To change

1879
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Its

1880
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Vibrational energy level

1881
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Because of the change of the vibrational energy level

1882
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It may have different

1883
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Reaction pathway

1884
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
So it will have different

1885
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
This is

1886
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
This is a thing we can do

1887
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
A direction

1888
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Another application

1889
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Is a new theory

1890
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Called

1891
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Model

1892
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Then

1893
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
In this model

1894
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I use

1895
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Classical source

1896
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Generate quantum light

1897
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Then use this quantum light

1898
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Different light

1899
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Go to

1900
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
The target

1901
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Then

1902
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I can see

1903
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
This target

1904
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Different

1905
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Photon statistics

1906
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
The

1907
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Behavior

1908
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
This is a new thing

1909
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But this thing

1910
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
There is no experimental implementation yet

1911
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But in theory

1912
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Many people are

1913
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Pursue this direction

1914
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Finally

1915
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
A very

1916
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
In device and material science

1917
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
A very useful application

1918
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Conductance enhancement

1919
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Application

1920
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Conductance enhancement

1921
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Conductance enhancement

1922
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Can be used

1923
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Cavity

1924
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Can be used

1925
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
To simulate

1926
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We hope

1927
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Can use this method

1928
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
To understand

1929
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Why

1930
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Conductance enhancement

1931
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Finally

1932
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Thank you

Visiting scholar

1943

Half a year

This method

1950

Generate

Three-dimensional

1952
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
This method

1953
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I have a

1954
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Electron system

1955
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
The evolution

1956
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
The evolution of the classical electron system

1957
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Maxine is a classical electron system expert

1958
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So he can use

1959
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I don't know the theory

1960
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Put it

1961
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
With some

1962
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Very mature classical electron system

1963
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Combine

1964
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Then Taoli is us

1965
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
A researcher in my group

1966
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Then he is

1967
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
We did a lot of work together

1968
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Finally, I want to thank

1969
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Ted

1970
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Organize the whole

1971
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Let me have a chance to share with you

1972
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Thank you

1973
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Hello

1974
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Thank you

1975
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Everyone

1976
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Does anyone have any special questions?

1977
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
The

1978
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
The

1979
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
The

1980
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Okay, let me ask

1981
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I am

1982
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Good

1983
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
When we look at it recently

1984
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I

1985
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
What I've been doing lately is

1986
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Light polarization

1987
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Interaction

1988
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Use

1989
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
In the semiconductor

1990
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
What's in there

1991
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
We are looking at it recently

1992
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
In addition to

1993
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Because we are more concerned

1994
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Like what you are talking about now

1995
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Light in classical way

1996
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
The electromagnetic wave

1997
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
To present

1998
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
If like us

1999
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So we do it

2000
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
We do more polarizations

2001
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Or

2002
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So it's

2003
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It depends on the light itself

2004
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
His own characteristics

2005
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Then we recently

2006
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Looking at one is

2007
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You should probably listen to it

2008
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Just

2009
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
There is

2010
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This kind of thing

2011
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm thinking

2012
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
If there is

2013
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Although it was quite new at first

2014
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
but

2015
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
There is

2016
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
The light is recently

2017
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I think it's a hot topic

2018
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
One

2019
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Have you ever thought about it?

2020
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
His whole disease

2021
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
He is also a

2022
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
That one

2023
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
This boundary

2024
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
One of the conditions

2025
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Square

2026
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Its light is a bit like it

2027
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
A wave of rotation

2028
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's different from the circle

2029
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Still not the same

2030
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So it is

2031
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
There is also a moment

2032
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Then you

2033
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
This may be

2034
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Maybe you are now

2035
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It may not be the same

2036
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But I want to say

2037
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You have a way to analyze this

2038
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
The light will be

2039
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
With

2040
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Maybe not yet

2041
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
The interaction of molecules

2042
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Or with any two-level system

2043
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Interaction

2044
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
How does it react

2045
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I think

2046
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
This

2047
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I was not born with light

2048
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
These things are a bit difficult

2049
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I

2050
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I am now

2051
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I am now

2052
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
What they are doing

2053
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Very confident

2054
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I have

2055
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
FDTD

2056
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
These good

2057
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Classic electric mechanics

2058
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
That basically

2059
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
He

2060
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
What he does now

2061
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Different

2062
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Different

2063
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Can do

2064
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I think

2065
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
If he does this

2066
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I think it should be

2067
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
The problem you are thinking about is helpful

2068
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Great

2069
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Let's pay attention to this

2070
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Professor

2071
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I have a question

2072
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Ok

2073
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
This is

2074
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
This is a long-standing question

2075
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I want to know

2076
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
When will it happen

2077
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
When will it happen

2078
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Outer tongue splitting

2079
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Then

2080
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
What is your second

2081
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Outer tongue splitting

2082
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Oh

2083
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Then

2084
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I know it's probably

2085
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Only in molecules

2086
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Or the atomic system

2087
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
This mole triplet will occur

2088
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But in the acetone system

2089
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It will only happen

2090
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
But what is the specific reason

2091
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Do you know

2092
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I don't know the specific reason

2093
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Because my understanding of him

2094
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Same as you

2095
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
He is in

2096
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
In the molecule

2097
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
In the molecular system

2098
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
He will be

2099
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
In the acetone system

2100
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I still have to learn

2101
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I haven't

2102
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I have been doing this

2103
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This set of theory

2104
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
About a year and a half

2105
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Ok

2106
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
There are still a lot to learn

2107
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Ok

2108
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
There is another thing

2109
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Outer tongue

2110
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
What is the other one

2111
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Called

2112
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
EIT

2113
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Electronic

2114
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Transparency

2115
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
What's the difference between the two

2116
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Transparency

2117
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I really don't know

2118
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Ok

2119
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Out of my

2120
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
You may ask

2121
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Ted may not understand

2122
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I remember EIT

2123
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
With male triplet

2124
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
There seems to be a difference

2125
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
EIT seems to be more in the atom

2126
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
But I actually don't remember

2127
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
EIT

2128
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
EIT

2129
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
EIT and

2130
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
The effect of outer tongues looks the same

2131
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
But it's completely different from male triplet

2132
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Male triplet you will see three states

2133
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
EIT and

2134
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Outer tongues you see two states

2135
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I forgot

2136
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Sorry

2137
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
It doesn't matter

2138
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
But I think this is a pretty interesting question

2139
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I think I should

2140
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I should use

2141
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Because male triplet is basically

2142
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
The first thing we try

2143
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Let's try to break down

2144
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This method

2145
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
See if this method will break down here

2146
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Actually quite good

2147
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So I was thinking

2148
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Maybe our next project will use EIT

2149
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Ok

2150
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Then another thing

2151
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
You said you add

2152
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You add fluctuation in the electric field

2153
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Then in the classical field

2154
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Add fluctuation

2155
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Then let it

2156
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Looks like there is spontaneous emission

2157
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Then

2158
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Which electric field are you

2159
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Is it driving force electric field

2160
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Add fluctuation

2161
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
No, I'm in the radiation field

2162
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Add fluctuation

2163
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Driving field here

2164
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
We still treat it as

2165
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
It's a

2166
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Electric field running past

2167
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Maxwell equation is linear

2168
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
You can break it down

2169
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But this

2170
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
If you are in emission

2171
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
That

2172
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Add fluctuation in radiation

2173
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Then

2174
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You said your addition is

2175
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
You just assume

2176
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It's running above the time

2177
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Then

2178
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
At a certain random time

2179
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Let it change the phase

2180
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Like this

2181
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Then

2182
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
This thing seems to be with that

2183
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Is two-dimensional

2184
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Spectroscopy inside

2185
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
The method they use

2186
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Very similar

2187
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Do you say pump probe method

2188
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Is in two-dimensional

2189
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Spectroscopy inside

2190
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
They have

2191
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
One is called homogeneous line width

2192
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Another one is called

2193
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
No, this is homogeneous line width

2194
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
There are two components

2195
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
The first one is

2196
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Free induction decay

2197
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
The second one is

2198
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Scattering of phonon

2199
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Scattering of other things

2200
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Then the second

2201
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Their assumption

2202
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
They bring in

2203
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Model method

2204
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
In the radiation field

2205
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Add a random

2206
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Phase drop

2207
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So these two things

2208
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Is it the same

2209
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Actually different

2210
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
A little different

2211
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
That is to say

2212
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
OK

2213
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I want

2214
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
That is

2215
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I want to say one thing

2216
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Because i'm not

2217
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm not really

2218
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm not really

2219
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Add a random phase

2220
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I am adding a random phase

2221
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
In

2222
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
In

2223
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Two-level system

2224
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Then this two-level system

2225
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Random phase will reflect on the electric field

2226
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
So i'm really adding

2227
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Electric field

2228
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
There are two benefits to this method

2229
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Because

2230
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
My

2231
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
My

2232
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It is natural

2233
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
There are two benefits to this method

2234
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Because my

2235
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Two-level system

2236
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Also need this defacing

2237
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
He also needs

2238
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
This little defacing

2239
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Correct his

2240
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
His fluctuation

2241
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
He also needs this thing

2242
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
From

2243
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
From

2244
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Then another benefit is

2245
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Because i'm

2246
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Put

2247
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
There is actually a

2248
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Difficulty point is because i put

2249
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I want to put this

2250
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Add a little fluctuation

2251
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I can't just add it

2252
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Add to a certain place

2253
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It just caused his self-interaction

2254
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Will destroy the whole system

2255
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That

2256
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
So he will have one

2257
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Specific method

2258
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Add it to a correct place

2259
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
That

2260
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
This thing

2261
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Because he

2262
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Because of this field

2263
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
He is not like he is not only a point

2264
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
He is a whole space

2265
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And he has to meet some basic

2266
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
For example, he can't go beyond the speed

2267
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I can't put a field suddenly

2268
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Add to a place beyond the speed

2269
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Right

2270
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So

2271
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Try not to add directly

2272
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
On field

2273
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So when we design this method

2274
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
This fluctuation

2275
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Add to two-level system

2276
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Add to two-level system

2277
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Naturally generate this fluctuation

2278
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
OK

2279
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Then there is a more detailed question

2280
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I want to know this

2281
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Why this classical

2282
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It's just

2283
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Quantum matter and classical

2284
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Field

2285
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
That

2286
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Only when

2287
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
When that

2288
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
That

2289
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Low

2290
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Low 0

2291
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Low 1 is

2292
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
There will be no emission

2293
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Then there will be other emissions

2294
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I always thought it was all

2295
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
No emission

2296
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Thank you for asking this question

2297
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Because

2298
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Because of my time

2299
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I missed a part

2300
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
That's it

2301
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Here

2302
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Here

2303
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Mixed quantum classical

2304
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Here

2305
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
It's not pure

2306
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Is the most

2307
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
The most basic

2308
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Mixed quantum classical

2309
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It is a mixed quantum classical

2310
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
That is to say

2311
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I am in this

2312
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
This

2313
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
In uranfest

2314
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Two-level system

2315
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Classical

2316
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Field

2317
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Will also

2318
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Interact to two-level system

2319
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Let it decay

2320
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So this is already a non-linear system

2321
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So you see these

2322
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
These red lines are not

2323
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
A simple

2324
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Simple exponential decay

2325
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So it's a

2326
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
It will continue to

2327
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Self-interact

2328
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So

2329
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
There will be some decay

2330
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Basically

2331
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
This is

2332
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
One of our recent papers

2333
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
His point is uranfest

2334
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
This is the most basic

2335
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Mixed quantum classical

2336
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Can get some

2337
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Partially correct

2338
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
But

2339
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
He won't get all

2340
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Sorry

2341
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
You can go to the front page

2342
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Let me see what is called uranfest

2343
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
You said

2344
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
His equation

2345
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I didn't write it out

2346
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
OK

2347
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I can give you

2348
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Our paper

2349
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
There is

2350
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I can check it myself

2351
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Because I didn't

2352
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Write it all out

2353
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
A bit complicated

2354
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Thank you

2355
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Other listeners have no questions

2356
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Discuss

2357
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
If there is no problem

2358
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That's the end of our speech today

2359
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Thank you all

2360
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Thank you

2361
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Thank you

2362
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
OK

2363
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
You think

2364
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Tell us when you are ready

2365
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
We will put the video up

2366
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
OK

2367
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
OK

2368
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
That's all for today

2369
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
OK

2370
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Good night

2371
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
It's okay

2372
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
4.30

2373
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
OK

2374
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Thank you all

2375
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Bye
