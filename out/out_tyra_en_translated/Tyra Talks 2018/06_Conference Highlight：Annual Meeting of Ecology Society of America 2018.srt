00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone, I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are very honored to invite Zhang Fengxun today. He is currently a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Michigan University.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
His current major is Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, and has recently been renamed Sustainable Development Studies.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Before coming to the United States as a doctoral candidate, Fengxun studied in the Department of Insectology at the University of Taiwan.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He wrote a small paragraph about his own self-introduction. He is a community ecologist.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What he wants to understand is the interaction between species and the environment in which we humans exist.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In addition to ecology, he likes comedy, baseball, his home, and Taiwan.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Today's speech is different from the past, because we think that in addition to sharing his own research points and results, we hope that he can share more information.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Of course, we are very fortunate that Fengxun attended this year's annual meeting of the American Ecological Association a few weeks ago.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The annual meeting of the American Ecological Association is one of the largest in the world and attended by many people.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:15,000
From his point of view, what important information is there at this year's annual meeting, and what breakthroughs are there in this area that are worth highlighting?

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's welcome Fengxun with a round of applause.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Fengxun is not a formal Chinese name, but deals with issues such as sustainable development.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What is special about our association is that it is not the same as the ecological association we are familiar with.

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Generally, the ecological association is based on basic science. We want to know the cause of a phenomenon, the evolution of species, and so on.

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
However, our association now thinks that we only understand these things, which is like being in an academic ivory tower.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In fact, this is not helpful for the development of ecology, so they think we should solve the problem more actively.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That is to say, how do we solve the problem of applying the ecological theory we already know to the major changes in the environment that we humans are facing now?

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Or how do we make these relatively terrible extreme climates and other phenomena less common or milder?

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is my background, and what I want to share with you today is that I went to the US Ecological Annual Conference two weeks ago to participate in the conference.

21
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I would like to share with you what I have seen, what I have played, and what I have thought.

22
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I would like to introduce ESA, which stands for Ecology Society of America.

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In fact, each country has its own ecological association, and Taiwan also has one.

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
However, ESA's annual meeting should be the largest in the world.

25
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This year, more than 4,000 people participated in the conference.

26
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I also went to talk to people after the conference.

27
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I asked them about the situation in Europe.

28
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
They said it was much smaller, maybe less than 2,000 people.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the biggest conference in the world, and I think it is also the most complete conference in terms of discussion issues.

30
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The disadvantage is that there are too many people, and you can't get to know everyone, and you can't have a very in-depth conversation with everyone.

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So if your social skills are not good, you will be like me for a long time and don't know what to do.

32
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can only find someone to talk to.

33
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's a good opportunity to practice talking to people.

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is a side effect.

35
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Anyway, this is ESA's brief introduction.

36
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I went to the conference two weeks ago.

37
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because I don't really know what everyone's background is, I will first introduce what ecology is.

38
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you google ecology or go directly to wiki, they will tell you that this is a choice between biological interaction and biological organism interaction with the environment.

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In short, I want to learn how two organisms interact, including how we grab food, how we eat each other, how we help each other, and how the environment affects our relationship with each other.

40
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All the discussions about this are ecological issues.

41
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't think anyone will know what I'm talking about, because it's too abstract.

42
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So when we talk about ecology, we immediately think of the existence of hierarchy.

43
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Just like when we were in high school, we learned that the human body is made up of cells, and the cells make up the tissues, and the tissues make up the organs, the circulatory system, and the individual.

44
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So in fact, ecology has a similar hierarchy.

45
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
From the smallest organism, which is a biological individual, to the vast majority of these biological organisms, which you can see in the picture below.

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This should be a geoduck, I don't know what to draw.

47
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then with a group of geoducks, they are all the same, a group of geoducks.

48
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then it becomes a population ecology.

49
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then if you go up, in addition to this geoduck, there may be geoducks, snakes, eagles, other animals, trees, grass.

50
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There are different kinds of animals living in the same time and space.

51
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This forms a community, a group.

52
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
In short, many kinds of animals live in the same place.

53
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is called a community ecology.

54
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If we enlarge the scope a little more, for example, we want to know that in addition to so many kinds of animals, where do they get the energy they need?

55
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Where do their excrements go?

56
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What kind of changes did their excrements make to the non-biological environment?

57
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then it becomes an ecosystem.

58
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
An ecosystem is a system.

59
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The whole thing, biological and non-biological, all come together and become an ecosystem.

60
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then there are people studying ecosystem ecology.

61
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then to a bigger point is the biosphere.

62
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think this is a whole planet.

63
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not a very meaningful classification.

64
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But if you insist on expanding, it becomes a whole planet.

65
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Then these levels, each level has its own questions to explore.

66
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
For example, people who study individual creatures will want to know how a creature grows.

67
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How do I react to the environment and so on?

68
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then the population ecology of the ecosystem is that I want to know why this species is sometimes more and sometimes less.

69
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
For example, the evaluation of fish resources is one of the important parts of the population ecology.

70
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
For example, in Taiwan, I want to know how many fish I can catch this year.

71
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
When should I catch it? When should I not catch it?

72
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is the question that the population ecology has to answer.

73
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The community ecology is like I just said.

74
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Different interactions between different species.

75
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So the most critical question is why there are so many species in the world.

76
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How do so many species live together in this world?

77
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Then it becomes so many species on the Internet.

78
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What impact does the environment of non-living things in this world have?

79
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is the ecosystem ecology.

80
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is roughly the hierarchy in ecology.

81
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I identify myself as a community slash a little ecosystem ecologist.

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What I'm interested in is that I want to know how each species interacts with each other.

83
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What impact do they have on the environment?

84
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Or to be more direct with people.

85
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There are many species in this system or in this natural environment.

86
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What impact does it have on me?

87
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What does it matter to me?

88
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Then talk about community ecology or ecosystem ecology.

89
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
A question that everyone will ask is why there are so many species in this world.

90
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This is a very, very old question.

91
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's also very old and very important.

92
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's also a question that we haven't answered in 100 years.

93
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Because from the very beginning of 19

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to explain why there are so many species of people.

95
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I have written here that it is Brunel.

96
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Then I put a table on the right for everyone to see.

97
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
When we want to answer this question,

98
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to know why there are so many species.

99
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is the evolution of ecologists' ideas from the past to the present?

100
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
In short, I think it can be divided into two periods.

101
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The first period.

102
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The reason I'm talking about this now is because this question is very difficult to answer.

103
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it's also very important.

104
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So now a lot of ecological research is actually inseparable from

105
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The most fundamental question I'm asking now.

106
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why are there so many species?

107
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Then when we answer this question,

108
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
For ancient ecologists,

109
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The way we try to answer is

110
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think it's a turnip, a pit, this method.

111
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In other words, how many resources can be used in the world?

112
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Or how many niches can be occupied by species?

113
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Then we should have seen so many species.

114
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So including Grinnell, including Elton,

115
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
These are all very famous ecologists.

116
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They all proposed various ideas about niches or ecological hypocrisy.

117
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I will not explain their ideas one by one.

118
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In short, the concept of this niche is a turnip, a pit.

119
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Until about 2000,

120
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The previous idea was that a turnip, a pit.

121
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
At most, the environment changes.

122
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Then create different turnip pits.

123
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So there are different species.

124
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sometimes the turnip pit is big, sometimes the turnip pit is small.

125
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The density of species will be high.

126
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The density of species will be low, etc.

127
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So different species can coexist together.

128
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Until about 2000,

129
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There was a man named Steve Hoppe.

130
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know what his idea was.

131
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But he proposed a theory.

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There is no turnip, a pit.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Everything is random.

134
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He proposed a neutral theory.

135
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We see so many species.

136
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is it because of a random phenomenon?

137
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The most classic example is that he took a long-term experimental observation station.

138
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Then he went to study the changes in the composition of the species in the experimental observation station, etc.

139
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Then he found that he could use a random model.

140
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Make a random mathematical model.

141
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You can predict the changes in the composition of long-term species.

142
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The prediction is not bad.

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then he proposed a theory.

144
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There are so many species in the world.

145
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not a turnip, a pit.

146
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There is a big species pool over there.

147
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
In this species pool,

148
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
ABCD may appear this year.

149
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
EFGH appeared this year.

150
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
ABEH appeared the following year.

151
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He went on like this.

152
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
After this neutral theory was proposed,

153
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
everyone thought that we had been faking for almost 100 years.

154
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So there was another man named Peter Chesson.

155
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The fourth bullet point.

156
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He proposed another theory.

157
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We call it Modern Coexistence Theory.

158
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He proposed this theory.

159
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Under this framework,

160
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
neutral theory is just a special case under this framework.

161
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
In other words, Peter Chesson's framework

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:24,000
includes the theories we know so far.

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He wanted to make a big framework

164
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to tell us that different communities, different natural environments,

165
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
we will see different species.

166
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because there are different mechanisms behind it.

167
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So he proposed a fluctuation-independent mechanism.

168
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The first part of his modern theory is that

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
when the environment has reached a balance,

170
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
how many species will exist here

171
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
determines how much the resources used by these species are different

172
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
compared to the ability of their resources to interact.

173
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
How much difference does their ability make?

174
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is called stabilizing.

175
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
For example,

176
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
if I love to eat apples and he loves to eat oranges,

177
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
then I will eat my apples well,

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and he will eat his oranges well.

179
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If not, we can coexist in this world without any problems.

180
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Then the concept of using different resources

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is called stabilizing.

182
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Another one is that we both love to eat apples,

183
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
but my speed of eating apples is about the same speed as yours.

184
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So we fight fiercely.

185
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I take a bite, you take another bite.

186
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I take another bite, you take another bite.

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So we keep fighting each other.

188
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So no one can kill each other.

189
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So we can coexist in this world very tightly.

190
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This is a mechanism of equalizing.

191
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Under this framework,

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the neutral theory I just mentioned

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
is an extreme state of equalizing.

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Everyone is the same.

195
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No one can kill another person.

196
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So there are a bunch of species in this world

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
fighting each other here.

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So far,

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
everyone seems to be a little satisfied.

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think it's not bad.

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We can use this big framework

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
to explain why we can see so many different species.

203
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But in fact,

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
current ecologists

205
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
can't understand these theories of Jason.

206
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
On the one hand,

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
it seems that we are enough here.

208
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
We just need to know

209
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that everyone fights each other fiercely,

210
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
or that everyone uses different resources.

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You can explain

212
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
why there are different species here

213
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and then continue to extend.

214
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But when some current theoretical ecologists

215
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
continue to dig Jason's framework,

216
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
they will find that there is actually another mechanism,

217
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
which is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism.

218
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The reason why this mechanism allows species to coexist

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
is because it feels that the environment is constantly changing.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So the system can't reach a balance

221
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
or is on the way to a balance.

222
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So since we are still in a state

223
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
where the environment is constantly changing,

224
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
what we know now

225
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
is that when we see these species,

226
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
we can't use these theories

227
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that we have obtained

228
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in a balanced state

229
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to explain why we see these now.

230
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Of course, this is difficult

231
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
because we don't know

232
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
whether the natural environment we live in

233
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
has reached a balance

234
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or has not reached a balance.

235
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So I think this is a big question.

236
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is also the first thing I saw

237
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and I think it may be a topic

238
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
that many ecologists will start to study in the future.

239
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How to quantify a system

240
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
has it reached a balance

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
or has it not reached a balance?

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If it has not reached a balance,

243
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
it is the fluctuation-dependent mechanism.

244
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How do we quantify these mechanisms?

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How do we use these mechanisms

246
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to explain how many different creatures

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I see in this system now?

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
In the fluctuation-dependent mechanism,

249
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
the main core is that

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the environment is constantly changing.

251
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So when the environment is constantly changing,

252
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
if I like low resources,

253
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I can live a good life.

254
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
When in low resources,

255
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can find a way to get rid of people.

256
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Another person may be

257
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
when in high resources,

258
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
he will find a way to get rid of me.

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But because the environment is constantly changing,

260
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
we have to

261
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
adapt to the environment.

262
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is the concept.

263
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's not like what I eat,

264
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
what you eat,

265
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and stay in a very stable state.

266
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Now the environment is changing,

267
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and we have our own density.

268
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
There may also be feedback back to the environment.

269
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is the storage effect

270
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you are interested,

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know if you are interested.

272
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you are interested, you can go and see

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
this paper I wrote.

274
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think he wrote it very well.

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Then there is a sentence

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
in a relatively flat language

277
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that tells us what the whole

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Coexistence Theory is talking about.

279
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll give you an example here.

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What is a fluctuation-dependent mechanism?

281
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This paper is also a good one.

282
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Sorry, the resolution is not very good.

283
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This is a new paper that came out recently.

284
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In this paper,

285
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
he wants to prove one thing.

286
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Storage effect and relative non-linearity

287
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
These two fluctuation-dependent mechanisms

288
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
is the reason for the coexistence of two species.

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You can see panel A and B.

290
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Different colors represent the density of different species.

291
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yellow is one, blue is another.

292
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Then the background is either white or light,

293
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
or gray represents the richness of resources.

294
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The background is dark or light,

295
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
which represents the richness of resources.

296
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So we can see from panel A and panel B,

297
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
when there is less resource,

298
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
it is not so dark.

299
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yellow wins.

300
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
On the other hand, when it's darker,

301
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in panel C,

302
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
blue wins.

303
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But when we get to panel D,

304
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
he deliberately adds resources in that system.

305
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Sometimes this system has a lot of resources,

306
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and then sometimes he takes the resources away,

307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and then he adds resources and takes them away.

308
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It creates a human-made fluctuation.

309
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
When we see a human-made fluctuation,

310
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
yellow and blue can coexist.

311
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
No one can eliminate anyone.

312
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
For example, this is the first real experiment proof.

313
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Of course, everyone does this kind of experiment.

314
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But this paper has a special point.

315
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
In addition to telling you that you can really coexist,

316
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
it really uses a mathematical model to really quantify

317
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
how much storage effect I can have,

318
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
how much relative non-inheritance.

319
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So let everyone know that there are really two kinds of

320
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
environmental changes

321
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that allow species to coexist.

322
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's not just that we want to say,

323
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
because of environmental change,

324
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
everyone has different levels of resources,

325
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
so of course we can coexist.

326
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This kind of verbal argument is right.

327
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So this is the first one.

328
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think it's a pretty eye-opening study.

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Then at the seminar,

330
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I also saw a few talks,

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
so I tried to quantify

332
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
why species can coexist in changing environments,

333
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and what is the mechanism behind their coexistence.

334
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Is everyone suitable for different environments?

335
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Or is the environment I affect affecting me?

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is the first highlight I saw at this conference.

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I have a question.

338
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So you're showing this now,

339
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
for example, there are two species of yellow and blue.

340
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yellow and blue species.

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Both of them have a feature,

342
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
which is that you can see the peak at each point.

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That is, the slope is very large.

344
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So it means that these two species themselves

345
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
have a very small response time scale to change.

346
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Maybe less than a day.

347
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But if you look at the D-panel in the lower right corner,

348
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
it's like external excitation.

349
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That is, their environment changes,

350
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
their scale is ten days, five days,

351
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
a few days, a few days, a few days.

352
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That's the width of black and white.

353
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So the time scale of the species system

354
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and the time scale of excitation are very different.

355
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So you can see this phenomenon very clearly.

356
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But if today the species must use

357
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
about the same time,

358
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
or even longer, to respond to external excitation,

359
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
then the whole model will fail.

360
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Because it may not have time to reach the next state.

361
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The environment has changed again,

362
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and then it will collapse in the end.

363
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's a mess.

364
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes, it's possible.

365
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So what I'm talking about now,

366
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
this fluctuation-dependent thing,

367
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
is actually what you're talking about.

368
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It's a relative concept.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If the environment is changing,

370
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
it must be fluctuation-dependent.

371
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It can be said that my own life cycle is very short.

372
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So even if the environment changes once a year,

373
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I have already given birth dozens of times a year.

374
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yes, I have reproduced dozens of times.

375
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So the change in the environment is meaningless to me.

376
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So I just said that in a system,

377
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
now we want to answer this question.

378
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Ecologists,

379
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the first difficult point is

380
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that we have to identify the change in the environment

381
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
for the life cycle of my species.

382
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In terms of life cycle,

383
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
is it dependent or independent?

384
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If it is dependent,

385
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
if it is fluctuation-dependent,

386
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
we can then ask

387
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
which mechanism is it?

388
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Does this answer your question?

389
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh, thank you.

390
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yes.

391
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay,

392
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
next, like I just said,

393
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
this is a very old question.

394
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's so old that

395
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
some people don't want to answer this question anymore.

396
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So everyone started to ask this question

397
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
in another way.

398
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Now there are so many species in this environment.

399
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So then,

400
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
the question just answered is

401
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
why does this environment

402
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
allow me to see so many species?

403
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But now,

404
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
everyone may find it boring,

405
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
so ask it the other way around.

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So many species,

407
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
what impact will it have on this environment?

408
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This question

409
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
or this question

410
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
is actually not something that happened recently,

411
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
but it suddenly became obvious.

412
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
It probably started in the late 1990s.

413
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
There was a person in Europe

414
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
who did a project called Ecotron.

415
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
In other words,

416
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
it's probably like...

417
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't know if everyone knows

418
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
that there is a kind of...

419
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Give you a glass ball,

420
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and then there is grass inside.

421
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There are different kinds of grass,

422
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and then there are some moss,

423
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
something wet,

424
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
like a planet.

425
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Ecotron is very similar to that concept.

426
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's a microcosm.

427
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Their idea is that

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the more species there are in this microcosm,

429
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
the more biomass I will see.

430
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I can see the more creatures in it.

431
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It started this

432
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning Branch.

433
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Biodiversity

434
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
How does it affect the function of this system?

435
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Function means

436
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
what is the production volume of this system?

437
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How efficient is this system

438
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
with the nutrient salt?

439
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The most famous one

440
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
will be brought to everyone.

441
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
It's in Minnesota.

442
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
There is a person

443
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
who is the first person

444
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
to really do this large-scale experiment.

445
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You can see it in the picture on the left.

446
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's called Seagull Creek.

447
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It really digs a piece of land

448
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and plants this grass.

449
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
You can see a plot.

450
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
There may be five kinds of grass in this plot.

451
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There is one kind of grass in another plot.

452
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
There are several kinds of grass in a plot.

453
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It goes down like this.

454
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Or in Germany,

455
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Jena Experiment

456
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
also does similar things.

457
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
There are different kinds of grass

458
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
in each block.

459
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
When I have a lot of grass,

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
does this grass

461
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
use different resources

462
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in order to survive?

463
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
In total,

464
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I can take more resources

465
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
from the environment.

466
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
As I just said,

467
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
there is a concept of a radish pit.

468
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The whole pit is full.

469
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We take a lot of resources

470
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
from the system.

471
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
A lot of biodiversity grows out of it.

472
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
This kind of research

473
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
has been done for more than 10 years.

474
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We have now discovered

475
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
a general pattern.

476
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
When we see a lot of species

477
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
in an environment,

478
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
when biodiversity increases,

479
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
when X goes to the right,

480
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
we see that those functions

481
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
will increase.

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
How much resources can we take away?

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
How much biodiversity can we produce?

484
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We all see a function

485
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that increases but saturates.

486
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
This is the knowledge we know now.

487
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
However,

488
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
the knowledge we have now

489
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
is all based on grass experiment.

490
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is the grass experiment

491
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I just showed here.

492
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We all plant grass

493
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
or raise a certain

494
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
nutrient-based organism.

495
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Then we find that

496
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the nutrient-based organism functions well.

497
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
However,

498
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
this is not enough.

499
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In our world,

500
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
it is impossible to have only grass.

501
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
At least there are humans.

502
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
At least insects eat grass.

503
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Rabbits eat grass.

504
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Lions eat rabbits.

505
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There are many different kinds of life.

506
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Now,

507
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
there are a few questions

508
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that ecologists want to continue to explore.

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The first is

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
the function of these ecosystem.

511
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
For example,

512
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the production of biomass, etc.

513
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Is it related to

514
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
what we need in this world?

515
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This is the first one above.

516
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
How do we put these functions

517
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and services

518
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I will talk about what service is later.

519
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Service is the function we need.

520
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
How do we put these two things together?

521
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Otherwise, people will think that

522
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
our ecological system is

523
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
locked in a academic ivory tower.

524
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Purely understand the phenomenon of the natural environment

525
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and then it's over.

526
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No more.

527
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Everyone hopes that

528
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
we ecologists can contribute to

529
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
some changes in the environment, etc.

530
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
This is the first

531
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
ecologicalists

532
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
want to continue to study.

533
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Next is what I just said.

534
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
All the knowledge we learn now

535
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
is very flat.

536
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Or the same nutrient class.

537
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But the natural environment

538
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
is a very three-dimensional state.

539
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So should we

540
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
put the natural environment

541
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
into a very three-dimensional state?

542
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
The third one is

543
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
how can we predict accurately

544
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
or accurately

545
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
when the environment changes

546
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
to reflect

547
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
how many species will be left now.

548
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
How many species will be left

549
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and how many functions

550
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
will be left, etc.

551
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So these three are from

552
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Functioning.

553
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The three branches

554
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I think are ecological systems.

555
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I can't say it's obvious,

556
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
but a lot of people are doing it.

557
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Now I'm going to talk about the first one.

558
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
What is ecosystem services?

559
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
These services mean

560
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
all people

561
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
live in this world

562
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and learn about these

563
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
functions,

564
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
patterns,

565
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
all the things you need.

566
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then,

567
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I remember it was the UN

568
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
or something.

569
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The report of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.

570
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
At that time, it was clearly defined

571
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that our current ecosystem

572
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
is actually the whole earth.

573
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
These services

574
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
are provided to people.

575
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
There are these four categories,

576
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
supporting provisioning,

577
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
regulation, and culture.

578
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The first few are easier to understand.

579
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Supporting services

580
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
that support the operation of the earth.

581
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
For example, the cycle of nutrients.

582
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You may have learned

583
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
that in biology,

584
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
we learn about the water cycle,

585
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the egg cycle, the carbon cycle,

586
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
the carbon cycle, and so on.

587
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Or how much

588
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
production

589
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
can be used by us, etc.

590
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Then these will support

591
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
how much food can we eat,

592
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
the water cycle,

593
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
because of the water cycle,

594
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
how much clean water

595
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
can be used by us.

596
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
This is provisioning.

597
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Or when we want to manage

598
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
a system,

599
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
we don't want to have too many pests.

600
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We want to maximize,

601
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
for example, maximize the number of corn.

602
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We don't want too many corn pests.

603
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The number of pest control

604
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
is the regulation services.

605
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
These three are relatively easy to understand.

606
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think,

607
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and it is also now

608
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
a big problem for ecologists.

609
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
We call it cultural services.

610
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What I wrote here is

611
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you can think of everything

612
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
related to culture.

613
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
These are from the natural environment.

614
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You get these ideas.

615
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You get these inspirations.

616
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You get these education.

617
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You get to learn.

618
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But as long as it's related to the environment,

619
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it's not that kind of

620
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ugly.

621
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You don't have it.

622
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
If you don't have it,

623
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
you won't die.

624
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But you will live unhappily.

625
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
These things are called culture.

626
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So some people say

627
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
because nature is beautiful,

628
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
it's too beautiful.

629
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So we can't maximize it.

630
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We can only rely on the beauty of our inner self

631
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
to appreciate nature.

632
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Then there are other people who say

633
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that this is meaningless.

634
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I say what you say is beautiful.

635
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I can also say

636
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that there is nothing in the world that is the most beautiful.

637
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So how do we quantify

638
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
the services of these ecosystems,

639
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
especially the services of culture?

640
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
This is something that some people

641
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
are trying to figure out now.

642
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And that part of people

643
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
includes a lot of economists.

644
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Because economists are very...

645
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I think

646
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
they are very good at estimating

647
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
the value of this thing in the market,

648
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and then how to trade it.

649
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So some people will think

650
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
that we will quantify these services.

651
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
For example,

652
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
a piece of clean water

653
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
is worth 2.5 million.

654
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Then a big clean swimming pool

655
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
is worth 2.5 million.

656
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
A big clean swimming pool

657
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
is worth 10 million.

658
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't know.

659
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Just try to quantify it

660
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
or find a way to...

661
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I can't say that this can be traded,

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
but use money to quantify it

663
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
so that we can do better management, etc.

664
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Or we can use money

665
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
to quantify

666
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
almost everything in the world

667
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in a system of communication.

668
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
This is the second thing I think

669
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
that eco-scientists are facing now.

670
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
This is also a problem

671
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that some scholars

672
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
who are not trained in ecology

673
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
want to help us solve.

674
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
How to quantify ecosystem services,

675
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
especially these services

676
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
related to culture.

677
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Even when I was at this conference,

678
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
there was a special workshop.

679
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
There were quite a few participants.

680
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Almost 100 people.

681
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Almost 100 people were discussing

682
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
ecosystem services.

683
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
This is the second thing

684
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that I think is pretty cool.

685
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay.

686
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Next,

687
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I just said

688
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that when we understand

689
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
biodiversity,

690
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
what we understand now

691
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
is relative to others.

692
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
When we understand

693
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
the impact of biodiversity

694
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
on the environment,

695
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
our understanding

696
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
of biodiversity

697
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
is relative to others.

698
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So probably after 2005 and 2007,

699
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
some people started to think

700
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that biodiversity

701
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
should be said

702
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
that the natural environment

703
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
is a very three-dimensional state.

704
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
We should not only consider

705
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
the same nutrient class.

706
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We should consider

707
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
all nutrient classes.

708
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So there are some studies

709
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
that are also going to do

710
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
pest control.

711
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Biological control.

712
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
These studies on biodiversity

713
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
will think that

714
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
they first thought that

715
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
if I want to control a pest,

716
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
for example, this soil.

717
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We want to control this.

718
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
This should be considered

719
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
a insect.

720
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I don't know what kind of insect this is.

721
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Anyway, it's a pest.

722
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We want to control

723
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
the number of pests.

724
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Then we should put

725
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
a kind that will eat it

726
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
at the bottom.

727
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Or is it better to put

728
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
everything in?

729
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
How should it be put

730
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
to let the number of pests

731
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
be suppressed to the minimum?

732
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
At the beginning,

733
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
when we consider

734
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
a lot of different nutrients

735
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and a lot of different

736
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
nutrient classes,

737
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
the biodiversity we knew

738
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
would really affect

739
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
the ecosystem function.

740
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Does this still exist?

741
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This is the initial idea.

742
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Until recently,

743
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
there have been more researchers

744
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
who have invested in this research.

745
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Then we will think that

746
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
in addition to different

747
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
biological classes,

748
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
should we think of the

749
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
whole environment as a

750
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
network?

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's a concept of a food network.

752
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
There are a lot of food networks.

753
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
There are a lot of species

754
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
that exist in this system at the same time.

755
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Then everyone eats each other.

756
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Everyone grabs food from each other.

757
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
This research can actually

758
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
involve a debate

759
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
from a long time ago.

760
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Everyone will ask

761
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
what kind of network

762
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and what kind of food network

763
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
is the most stable state.

764
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Before the emergence of

765
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Function

766
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
,

767
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
everyone started to ask

768
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
what kind of food network

769
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
is the most stable.

770
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
At that time,

771
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
the pure research was

772
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
purely thinking about

773
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
how to prevent

774
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
this food network from crashing.

775
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Maybe everyone is very good at connecting.

776
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Connectedness is very high.

777
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Everyone is in a small group.

778
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's very close to each other.

779
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Then the small group and the small group

780
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
are not so close to each other.

781
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
How do these attributes of

782
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
each network

783
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
affect the stability of

784
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
the entire network?

785
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Then put this idea

786
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
into the idea of

787
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Biodiversity Ecosystem Function.

788
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Everyone will start to think that

789
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
since each network

790
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
has different attributes,

791
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
different characteristics,

792
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
then in the state of different characteristics,

793
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
will there be different

794
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
food networks with different characteristics?

795
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
There will be different functions.

796
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
For example,

797
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
this opinion paper

798
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
is not a real data paper.

799
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It provides an idea

800
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
that when different food networks

801
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
have different attributes,

802
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
different characteristics,

803
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the energy flux

804
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
is not discussing

805
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
whether the entire network

806
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
will crash easily.

807
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What we are discussing now is

808
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
how much energy flows in

809
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and how much efficiency

810
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
flows out in the end.

811
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Everyone started to ask this question.

812
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Theoretically,

813
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
these are some of the network attributes.

814
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
How does it affect

815
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
the function of this part?

816
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
This question is

817
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the question I am most interested in

818
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
asking in the future.

819
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
At the end,

820
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I will talk about

821
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
my own research.

822
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
It's very simple.

823
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
My own research

824
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
is very related to

825
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
the question

826
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
that some ecologists

827
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
are starting to ask.

828
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
How do different network attributes

829
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
affect the function of this network?

830
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
This research,

831
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I haven't seen it yet.

832
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think it's fun and cool,

833
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
but I haven't seen

834
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
too much

835
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
real data

836
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
doing this.

837
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Now it's mainly

838
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
a very theoretical research.

839
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
In other words,

840
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
we have to use a more three-dimensional

841
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
way to understand

842
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
how diversity affects

843
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
the function

844
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
of the entire ecosystem.

845
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We are still in a

846
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
theoretical stage.

847
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Theoretically,

848
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
this full web,

849
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
everyone is very tight-knit,

850
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
or everyone's interaction is very strong.

851
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I might see this kind of function.

852
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Theoretically,

853
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
because

854
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
this can't be blamed on ecologists,

855
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
because I really want to quantify

856
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
a full web.

857
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It's actually not easy.

858
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Of course, many people are already doing full web.

859
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But what everyone does is

860
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
for example,

861
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
fish in a lake,

862
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I want to open his stomach

863
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and see what kind of small fish and shrimp he ate.

864
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
In my own words,

865
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
A fish ate

866
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
C, D, E shrimp,

867
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and so on.

868
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Use various methods to see

869
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
what kind of things a species eats,

870
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
or if there are any

871
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
different species

872
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
eating and eating each other.

873
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Use different microscopes,

874
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
or like I just said,

875
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
God content research.

876
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We can't blame

877
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
that we don't have enough

878
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
empirical data,

879
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
but this empirical data is not easy to get.

880
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So everyone will start to

881
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
dilute, for example,

882
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
we use

883
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
the size of the organism

884
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
to decide,

885
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
to estimate what he will eat.

886
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Because for example,

887
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
a fish,

888
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
a goldfish,

889
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I mean the goldfish in the aquarium,

890
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
he may eat a shark.

891
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So we can use its size

892
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
to estimate what kind of food

893
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
a goldfish can eat.

894
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Then use the size of the organism

895
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and

896
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the size of the organism

897
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
such a trait

898
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
to help each species

899
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
what kind of food

900
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
it may have.

901
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Then build a

902
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
more realistic,

903
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
not so theoretical food network.

904
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Then we use some attributes of this food network

905
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
to see what the function of this food network is.

906
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But it's the same,

907
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
it's still built on a theory

908
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
that small fish can't eat big fish.

909
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So it's not necessarily

910
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
that this is the most perfect food network.

911
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's just that

912
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
the biologists are starting to think

913
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
how to answer this question.

914
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Including myself, I also think

915
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
this is the next topic

916
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I want to continue

917
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
to study.

918
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
After finishing

919
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
these chapters of my Ph.D.

920
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I want to do some research.

921
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I've been

922
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
talking to

923
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
the people at the conference,

924
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
including some biologists

925
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
from France or Germany.

926
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
They all say they have

927
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
a huge greenhouse effect.

928
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Like what I just said,

929
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I want to make it three-dimensional,

930
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
like what you can see

931
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
on this picture.

932
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
There are a lot of things like a greenhouse.

933
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Different food networks

934
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
are made up of different greenhouses.

935
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Like the German

936
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
IDIV,

937
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I think that organization is really cool.

938
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
First, they have a lot of money.

939
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Second, the topics they study

940
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
are all my friends.

941
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I like them a lot.

942
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
They seem to have a lot of future ideas.

943
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
This is my second

944
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
conference.

945
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I think it's worth sharing

946
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
what biologists are thinking

947
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
about.

948
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Third,

949
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
this research

950
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
was done by

951
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
my former teacher,

952
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Sutiara.

953
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
She's my teacher.

954
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But she doesn't know

955
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
much about math.

956
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Anyway,

957
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
biologists want to

958
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
do this kind of research.

959
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We're all looking for a cause-and-effect relationship.

960
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
For example,

961
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
why are there so many

962
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
species in the world?

963
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
What's the reason?

964
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We saw this result.

965
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Why are there

966
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
so many species?

967
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Why do we get

968
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
these functions?

969
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
The reason is that there are so many species.

970
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
The result is that there are these functions.

971
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But in addition to

972
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
actually doing experiments,

973
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
for example, like I just said,

974
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
it's hard to really

975
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
quantify

976
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the cause-and-effect relationship

977
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
of a phenomenon

978
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
other than

979
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
the cause-and-effect relationship.

980
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Sutiara

981
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
doesn't know much about math,

982
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
so

983
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I just made it up.

984
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's based on

985
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
this theorem,

986
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
the Taken's theorem,

987
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
to develop a set of

988
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
mathematical models

989
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
or a set of

990
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
statistical methods.

991
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
We should talk about statistical methods.

992
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It can measure

993
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
the impact of

994
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
a population

995
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
on another population.

996
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It can use the relationship of time series

997
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
to know if a population

998
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
has a direct impact on another population.

999
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
For example,

1000
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
this is the most common example.

1001
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Red and blue

1002
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
are two species.

1003
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So at the time of A,

1004
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
red and blue have a strong

1005
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
relationship.

1006
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
According to our

1007
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
theory,

1008
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
red is the cause of blue,

1009
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
blue is the effect of red,

1010
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
or vice versa.

1011
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
But when we get to B,

1012
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
we find that

1013
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
their relationship is opposite.

1014
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's negative.

1015
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So we say,

1016
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
if red increases,

1017
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
let blue decrease,

1018
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
or vice versa.

1019
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
We use this correlation

1020
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
to infer the causality.

1021
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Red and blue have nothing to do with each other.

1022
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So we find that

1023
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
red and blue have no causality.

1024
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
However, these two time series

1025
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
are written from the

1026
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
mathematical formula above.

1027
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
In other words,

1028
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
red and blue, x and y,

1029
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
have a causality.

1030
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But in our traditional

1031
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
ecological research,

1032
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
if we just do a bunch of correlations

1033
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
or don't do experiments,

1034
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
we can't know

1035
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
the causality of

1036
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
red and blue, x and y.

1037
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
However,

1038
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
using this method,

1039
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
cross-mapping,

1040
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
we can know

1041
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
the causality of

1042
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
red and blue.

1043
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I mentioned this method

1044
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
because I saw

1045
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
the experiment room

1046
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
this year.

1047
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
The experiment room is not that big.

1048
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's just four or five people.

1049
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They came to give a talk.

1050
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Almost everyone came to give a talk.

1051
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It seems to me

1052
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that this method

1053
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
has been developed successfully.

1054
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Let's use it.

1055
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's a kind of

1056
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
declaration

1057
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
of significance.

1058
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
A few years ago,

1059
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
when I went to

1060
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
ESA,

1061
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
there were some

1062
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
collaborators.

1063
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
However,

1064
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
it's not like this year.

1065
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Almost the whole experiment room

1066
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
came to give a talk.

1067
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Ecologists, let's use CCM.

1068
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Let's use this method.

1069
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Let's not do correlations.

1070
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Let's not do x and y.

1071
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Let's use CCM.

1072
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Let's try to collect

1073
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
time series data

1074
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
to know who is the cause and who is the cause.

1075
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's a kind of

1076
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
declaration.

1077
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I think it's great.

1078
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Actually, ecologists are not that smart.

1079
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
To be honest,

1080
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I decided to study ecology

1081
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
because my math is not good enough.

1082
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I can't study physics.

1083
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I can't study chemistry.

1084
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I don't like to study humanities.

1085
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So, I decided to study biology.

1086
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I was happy to see the biology

1087
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
running around.

1088
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm not good at math.

1089
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So,

1090
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I'm not sure

1091
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
if this method

1092
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
will work.

1093
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm not sure.

1094
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
This method

1095
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
requires a good time series.

1096
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
As you know,

1097
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
in the current

1098
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
scientific research environment,

1099
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
every project,

1100
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
every grant

1101
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
may take 3 to 5 years.

1102
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Maybe 10 years.

1103
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
It's a good time series.

1104
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
3 to 5 years.

1105
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
3 to 5 years time series may not be long enough

1106
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
to do CCM.

1107
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
To do convergence cross mapping.

1108
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Next,

1109
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
what I just said,

1110
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I just wrote

1111
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
A detects an impact

1112
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
on another population.

1113
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
In other words,

1114
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
if A's impact on B is

1115
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
C's impact,

1116
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
which is indirect,

1117
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
then we get

1118
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
A, B, C, these three time series.

1119
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's possible for me to catch

1120
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
A's impact on B.

1121
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But this impact is actually through C.

1122
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's not A's direct impact on B.

1123
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
In other words,

1124
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
this method is not omnipotent.

1125
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I can only tell you

1126
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
who might affect who.

1127
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But whether this impact is

1128
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
a direct impact, I can't be sure.

1129
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
In other words,

1130
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
CCM, although it's powerful and cool,

1131
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
it can let us know the causality.

1132
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But it still can't let us know

1133
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
the real causal relationship.

1134
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Is the causality

1135
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
direct?

1136
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So this method

1137
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
still has some shortcomings.

1138
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
But I think

1139
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
it's already

1140
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
a great way

1141
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
to let everyone

1142
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
who has a time series

1143
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
to try to answer the questions

1144
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
they want to answer.

1145
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Some more traditional

1146
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
correlation analysis.

1147
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
This is probably the last one.

1148
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Is the last one a summary?

1149
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't know.

1150
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I just summarized everything

1151
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I just said.

1152
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
In short, we still have to ask

1153
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the most classic question.

1154
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
How do species coexist?

1155
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Why are there so many species?

1156
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And now

1157
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
a way to

1158
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
answer this question.

1159
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
We have to consider environmental changes.

1160
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Use fluctuation-dependent

1161
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
mechanisms to explain species coexistence.

1162
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
After species coexistence,

1163
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
we are

1164
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
trying to

1165
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
solidify our understanding of biodiversity.

1166
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And

1167
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
find a way to know

1168
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
what impact

1169
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
biodiversity

1170
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
has on

1171
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
the environment

1172
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
we live in.

1173
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
For example, how much food can we eat?

1174
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
This kind of question.

1175
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Next is

1176
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
causality inference.

1177
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We really want to know

1178
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
some causal relationships.

1179
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Through time series analysis,

1180
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
we want to know causal relationships.

1181
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Finally, ecosystem services.

1182
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I think it's a very

1183
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
mysterious term.

1184
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I really think that Schneider University

1185
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
seems to love this term.

1186
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
We want to use ecosystem services

1187
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
to manage our...

1188
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I forgot where it is.

1189
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Anyway, it's a country in South America.

1190
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I heard in the workshop

1191
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
that our government is trying to

1192
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
push the concept of ecosystem services.

1193
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
We want to use the concept of ecosystem services

1194
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
to manage the natural resources

1195
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
of our country.

1196
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I think

1197
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
these are some interesting topics.

1198
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
After participating in this meeting,

1199
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I saw some interesting topics.

1200
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I want to

1201
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
learn more about

1202
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the impact of

1203
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
network

1204
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and

1205
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
diverse ecosystem functioning.

1206
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Lastly,

1207
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I think

1208
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I don't know if this is a question

1209
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
or a concern.

1210
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
If you know a little bit about

1211
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
ecosystem services,

1212
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
you will know that

1213
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
there are so-called

1214
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
theoretical ecologists and

1215
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
empiricists.

1216
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Some people's research is

1217
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
a computer or a pile of paper

1218
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
with a pile of equations

1219
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
or a framework.

1220
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
For example, I just talked about Peter Chesson

1221
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
who proposed the Modern Consistent Theory.

1222
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Some people think

1223
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
it's meaningless to just think about it.

1224
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I need to do experiments.

1225
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
These two

1226
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I can't say two sides.

1227
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The communication between

1228
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
these two ecologists

1229
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
is not so smooth.

1230
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I think

1231
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
maybe some people think it's not bad.

1232
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I don't think it's that smooth.

1233
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Because theoretical ecologists

1234
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
are too smart

1235
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and empiricists

1236
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
may not be able to keep up with their ideas.

1237
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
On the other hand, empiricists

1238
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
think we are materialistic enough.

1239
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Theoretical ecologists

1240
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
think we are materialistic.

1241
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
The other people are empty-handed.

1242
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So I think the communication between

1243
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
these two sides needs

1244
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
a strong theory.

1245
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Then I will do experiments

1246
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
with these ecologists

1247
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
to build a bridge of friendship.

1248
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Otherwise,

1249
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I've been thinking about

1250
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
the mechanism of fluctuation-dependent

1251
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
and how to influence co-existence.

1252
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's meaningless if you can't do experiments.

1253
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Or

1254
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
the most obvious example is

1255
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I did a theoretical model

1256
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and one of my

1257
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
committee members said

1258
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
is it useful to do so many theories?

1259
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Can you really do experiments

1260
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
to verify your model prediction?

1261
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So my second chapter

1262
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
is to do experiments

1263
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to see if the predicted results

1264
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
can be seen

1265
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
in real life.

1266
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It's like a debate.

1267
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
It's like a civilized blind date.

1268
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
This is what I want to say today.

1269
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
This is what I want to say today.

1270
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
What I saw at this conference

1271
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and what I think

1272
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
ecologists are thinking about.

1273
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Is there any time left?

1274
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Actually,

1275
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
it's about time.

1276
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But we can ask questions.

1277
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Before asking questions,

1278
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
let's turn on the microphone

1279
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
for two seconds.

1280
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Thank you, Feng Xun,

1281
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
for the speech.

1282
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I don't know if you have any questions

1283
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
or comments.

1284
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I have a similar question

1285
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
or a comment.

1286
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You mentioned

1287
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
network analysis

1288
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and causality interference.

1289
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You mentioned

1290
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
time series analysis.

1291
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
These two technologies

1292
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
are very useful

1293
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
in physics.

1294
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They are very useful

1295
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
in physics.

1296
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
They are very useful

1297
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
in physics.

1298
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
In fact,

1299
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
they are widely used.

1300
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But I think

1301
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
the biggest problem is

1302
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
that

1303
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
physicists' habits.

1304
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
For example,

1305
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
there are water molecules in the water.

1306
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
There are one or two water molecules in the water.

1307
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I don't know how to use

1308
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
ten water molecules.

1309
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The computer can't predict.

1310
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So I use one water molecule

1311
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and one water molecule.

1312
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So I use water molecules

1313
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and one water molecule

1314
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
to check the phenomenon.

1315
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Then I said

1316
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
that my model

1317
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
would have such a phenomenon.

1318
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Then I went for experiments.

1319
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Then I said I understood

1320
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
the flow of water.

1321
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I think this

1322
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
can be delineated.

1323
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Assuming things can be delineated

1324
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
in a condition

1325
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
like a time series,

1326
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
it would be more interesting.

1327
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Otherwise,

1328
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
physicists say

1329
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
they can calculate one by one,

1330
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
but they can't do fluid mechanics.

1331
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Then I said I would leave it to the computer.

1332
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Then I asked the computer

1333
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
to do a large-scale

1334
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
numerical simulation

1335
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
to simulate some strange phenomena.

1336
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
If the experiment can't be done,

1337
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I said the experiment wouldn't be done.

1338
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But it doesn't mean it's wrong.

1339
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Because in the real world,

1340
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
water is still flowing.

1341
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
This kind of research

1342
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
and operation

1343
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
is actually very difficult

1344
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
for a system

1345
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
with complex variables.

1346
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So let's go back

1347
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
to the biological ecosystem.

1348
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Of course,

1349
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
you can say

1350
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
it's easy to issue a paper.

1351
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I just need to build up the model

1352
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and let the computer calculate it.

1353
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
In the end,

1354
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
you still have to go back

1355
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
to whether you can explain

1356
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
what happened in this world

1357
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
and whether you can do experiments to verify it.

1358
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But there will be a lot of difficulty in the middle.

1359
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Then it becomes

1360
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
a very interesting thought study.

1361
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
But it's hard to say

1362
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
if it has an impact on the learning itself.

1363
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I totally agree.

1364
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
If I remember correctly,

1365
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
the talk of the person next week

1366
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
is similar to what you just said.

1367
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It's about building a climate model

1368
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
or a water texture model

1369
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
to understand

1370
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
some of the changes

1371
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
in the environment, etc.

1372
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
That's a very popular question

1373
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
for some ecologists

1374
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
right now.

1375
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Because, as I just said,

1376
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
we want to know how to face this world.

1377
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So if I can

1378
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
use a digital simulation

1379
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and I know

1380
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
that the temperature here is one degree higher

1381
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
than the temperature in a black box,

1382
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't know what's going on.

1383
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Anyway, the sea level will rise by 50 meters.

1384
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I feel very happy.

1385
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
If the prediction is accurate,

1386
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I feel happy.

1387
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But some ecologists

1388
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
think that

1389
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
it's like doing

1390
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
big data analysis.

1391
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You don't know what's going on at all.

1392
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
You only know one cause and effect.

1393
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So I think

1394
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
this is a

1395
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
question that depends on

1396
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
what you want to answer.

1397
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
If you really just want to solve an environmental problem

1398
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
or a human survival problem,

1399
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
you can do a data analysis

1400
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
and I can come up with

1401
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
an effective solution,

1402
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
that's great.

1403
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But if I just want to increase my knowledge,

1404
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I think knowledge is the most important thing.

1405
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
This is very meaningful to me.

1406
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
This is why I don't

1407
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
like

1408
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
big data analysis

1409
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
or environmental studies.

1410
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
That's the reason.

1411
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
In fact,

1412
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
there are some people

1413
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
in the conference

1414
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
who are trying to

1415
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
use CtS

1416
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
to collect

1417
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
more data

1418
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
to understand environmental changes.

1419
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't think

1420
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
they have a good enough

1421
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
theoretical foundation.

1422
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I don't pay

1423
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
too much attention to what they are doing.

1424
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Thank you.

1425
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Do you have any questions?

1426
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
If you have any questions

1427
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
or comments,

1428
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'll tell you.

1429
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
The links of

1430
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Taira's website and

1431
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Taira's conference

1432
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
are in the chat.

1433
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
If you are interested,

1434
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
you can check it out.

1435
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You can see what Taira

1436
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
wants to do,

1437
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
how to join,

1438
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and what other

1439
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
academic lectures

1440
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
we will have next year.

1441
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You can see next year's lecture

1442
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
at the end of the year.

1443
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
If you are interested,

1444
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I hope we can

1445
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
connect more people

1446
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
from all over the world

1447
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
to share resources.

1448
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
The more people join,

1449
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
the more powerful it will be.

1450
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
The link is in the chat.

1451
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
You can check it out.

1452
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Do you have any questions?

1453
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
If you are interested,

1454
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
you can contact

1455
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
or discuss with

1456
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Taira's website.

1457
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
The link is in the chat.

1458
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
On the right,

1459
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
there is a list

1460
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
of members.

1461
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
If you click

1462
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
on Taira's name,

1463
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
there should be an email.

1464
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
No?

1465
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Okay.

1466
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
We didn't write it down.

1467
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Sorry.

1468
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
If you are interested,

1469
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
you can contact

1470
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Taira.

1471
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
We can help you.

1472
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Taira's email is

write her email

1478
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000

Okay.

1485
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
That's all for today.

1486
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Let's give it up

1487
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
for Taira.

1488
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Thank you.

1489
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm going to

1490
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
stop recording.
