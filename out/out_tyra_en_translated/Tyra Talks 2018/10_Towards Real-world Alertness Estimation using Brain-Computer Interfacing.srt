00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am today's host, I am Hong Shaoming, I am now working in California as a postdoctoral researcher.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Without further ado, let's introduce today's speaker, Dr. Wei Qunshu.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Dr. Qunshu graduated from the College of Electrical Engineering, and stayed in California to study electrical engineering.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
After graduating, he went to UCSD to study biotechnology, and his professor is Professor Zong Ziping.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He is mainly interested in using the perspective of engineering to use brain-to-brain meetings to study human behavior.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Over the past few years, he has published nearly 10 conference papers and two journal papers.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Without further ado, let's listen to his presentation.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The title is Towards Real-World Awareness Estimation Using Brain-Computer Interface.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's welcome him.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you Shaoming for the introduction.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Today, I will introduce how we measure brain activity and monitor our alertness using a brain-computer interface.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We can easily have a discussion.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
First, I will briefly introduce the brain.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Our brain is a tube of about 3 pounds, about 1,000 grams.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The outermost part of the brain has many folds.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
These folds are composed of many neurons in the brain.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There are about 8.6 billion neurons.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We know that the brain has very strong computing power.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
However, compared to our most powerful computers, its performance is very good.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In terms of energy consumption, it is 100,000 times more efficient than a normal CPU.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Therefore, the brain can only operate at 12 to 25 watts.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This wattage is equivalent to the wattage of a light bulb.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So you can imagine that in some comics, when the character thinks of a point, he will draw a light bulb.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's actually pretty close.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because the brain's power consumption is the power of a light bulb.

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The structure of the neural network is composed of cells.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are many vectors.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The vector part collects information from other neural networks around it.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After the information is compiled into the neural network, it will decide whether to power up.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you want to power up, you can use the axis.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Then you can power up to other neural networks.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In this way, complex networks can be used to control the whole person.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Here is a brain signal that I use more often.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's called a brain wave.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's EEG.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Many people have been exposed to EEG.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Especially when a newborn is born, we often do a brain test to see if his vision or hearing is normal.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How does EEG occur?

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There are many neural networks in our brain.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Especially the skin.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Many neural networks are arranged.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There are some rules in the structure.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The arrangement of the rules allows the neural network to have an additional effect when it is powering up.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The change in the electrical field can be so great that you can feel the change in the electrical field outside the scalp.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The change in the electrical field becomes our brain wave signal after some processing.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to interrupt me.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Our brain wave signal is...

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have a question.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There is a line below.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
BlueJeans meeting is sharing your screen with bluejeans.com.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You have to press the hide button.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, okay.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Or you can block it a little bit.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can continue.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's continue.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is the brain wave signal.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It is a real-time signal.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can see that it is like a time series.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It is a time series.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In order to measure the whole brain, we will try to arrange electrical fields outside the scalp.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So we will have a lot of brain waves on both sides at the same time.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We will analyze the energy of brain waves in terms of frequency.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The frequency depends on whether the signal is fast or slow.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The high frequency is the fast part.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The low frequency is the slow part.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So we will divide delta.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It is a low frequency activity of less than 3.5 Hz.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is a very slow vibration.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you go higher, it will be divided into theta wave, alpha wave, or beta wave.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The higher the frequency, the faster the vibration.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Our brain can be divided into different bands.

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
By observing the energy of the band, we can get a lot of information.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let me introduce the location of the channel of the brain.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It has a standard way of dividing.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The name of the channel is divided into points.

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Frontal is the channel at the beginning of F.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Central is the channel at the beginning of C.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Central parietal is the channel at the beginning of O.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Occipital is the channel at the beginning of O.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We can do this frequency analysis for each channel.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We can combine the change of time with the change of frequency.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We can see the energy of different bands over time.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This can tell us a lot of information about the state of this person.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We can design experiments to see if the brain changes.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We can find some characteristics in different states.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Reflect the brain in different states.

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The brain interface is where we read the signals of the brain.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then we go through some signal processing, including frequency analysis.

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Or you can use a lot of other different signal processing methods to get different characteristics.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then we use the processed signals to make it recognizable.

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then we can convert it into some commands to control.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For example, a mechanical arm or a wheel or a mouse cursor.

97
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or to input text or some messages.

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We call this the brain computer interface.

99
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In short, it's BCI.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What can BCI do?

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
As I just said, it can convert into commands.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So when we play video games, we can use it to control the movement of your character.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Of course, including the wheel and the mechanical arm.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Of course, it can also be used to monitor a person's cognitive state.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Including whether you want to sleep.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This extends to my main area of expertise.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Monitoring the level of awareness.

108
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The level of awareness is related to drowsy driving.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A lot of people fall asleep while driving.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This news happened on July 18th.

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was only recently that a drowsy driving incident occurred.

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it's not a big deal.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's not a big deal.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's not a big deal.

115
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not a big deal.

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not a big deal.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not a big deal.

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's not a big deal.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's not a big deal.

So he can't hear the headphones, can he?

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I didn't hear it.

132
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, no.

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's see.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't.

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Can you play it on your computer?

136
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Can you hear me?

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can you hear me?

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Can you hear me?

142
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I can hear you.

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Can you hear me?

145
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes.

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Max.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then after 11 hours a day, we have to shut down

148
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and have 10 hours of sleep.

149
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Truck drivers are also required to take a 30-minute break

150
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
during their first 8 hours of driving.

151
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
All of this needs to be recorded

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
in logs like these,

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
which are now mostly computerized.

154
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We now have to carry electronic recording devices

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
on our vehicles.

156
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Rio says his students learn to make driving plans

157
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to avoid getting fatigued,

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and they're encouraged to stop to power nap

159
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
or just stretch their legs.

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It gives you more stamina.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You're more alert, because when you're not alert,

162
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
you know, you can't make good decisions.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And that's what truckers like Rudy live by.

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I start closing, you've got to pull over

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and take a nap.

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
GoMana, eight news now.

167
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
says drowsy driving

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
causes up to 1.2 million crashes

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
every year in this country,

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and it kills between 5,000 and 8,000 people.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's nearly twice as many

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
as distracted driving.

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So,

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
this is a recent

177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
drowsy driving incident.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
As you saw in the video,

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
a truck hit

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
a construction vehicle

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
caused

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
two deaths and three injuries.

184
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Drowsy driving can cause

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
up to 1.2 million

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
crashes every year,

187
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and it kills

188
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
between 5,000 and 8,000 people.

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So if we can avoid

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
drowsy driving,

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
if we can effectively monitor

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
drowsy driving

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and manage it,

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
maybe we can avoid

195
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the death and injury

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
caused by this.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then,

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
in the news,

199
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
it was mentioned that

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
if you find your eyes

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
blind,

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
you should stop driving.

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But I also discussed with

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Shaoming last time

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
whether to use

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
eye or blink

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to do

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
this alertness monitoring.

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But there is a question

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that is,

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is there a way to

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
catch it

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
before it closes

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
its eyes

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and put it in the car?

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This part may want to

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
use brainwaves to

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
break through this problem.

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If we use

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the brain interface to do

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
this alertness monitoring,

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
we will first

223
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
measure its brainwaves

224
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
from the driver.

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
After we get this EEG signal,

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
after some processing,

227
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
we use machine learning

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to build a model

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that can turn the EEG

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
data into

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
alertness.

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
After we know its alertness,

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
we can try to

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
give it some feedback.

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
For example, we can wake it up,

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
or we can

237
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
let the car

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
stop driving

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and stop by the road,

240
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
or force it to rest.

241
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There are some ways to intervene.

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
My research is

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
mainly about

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
how we deal with this signal,

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
how we build a

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
machine learning model,

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and how we can

248
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
monitor the alertness

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
very well.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Then we can

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
accurately determine

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
whether to make some interference.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have a question.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want to

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
clarify a little bit.

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you mean

257
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that your research is

258
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
a state of

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
mental relaxation

260
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
or a state of real sleep?

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's a state of

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
waking up

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to almost falling asleep

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
before you really

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
fall asleep.

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't study

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the state of the brain

268
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
after falling asleep,

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
because I want to catch

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
it before I fall asleep.

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In fact,

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
driving experience,

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and I know

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that my eyes were open at that time,

276
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but the image

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
was already

278
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
blurred and black,

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and I was not looking at the road.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I was a little out of my mind,

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and then I suddenly woke up,

282
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and I felt a little

283
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
shaky.

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So you have to catch

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the time point

286
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
before you fall asleep.

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It depends on

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
when you can't support

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the alertness.

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I have another question.

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You are now

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
identifying a signal,

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and you think

294
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
this signal is

295
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the state you are talking about.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you have a contrast group?

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
For example, you track his eyes,

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and then I define

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
the behavior of the eyes,

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
which is to fall asleep.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then I look for

302
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
a corresponding brain wave,

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
or I ask the subject to write

304
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that I feel like I'm about to fall asleep.

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What is your calibration?

306
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This question is very good.

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
How do we define

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the so-called alertness?

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to talk about it next.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Because we think

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
alertness is related to your reaction time.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So we use

313
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
reaction time to

314
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
give us an objective

315
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
measurement method.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Just like you said,

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
using the eyes or

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
the way the subject responds.

319
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The part of the eyes

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
is that the activity of the eyes

321
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
is also a physiological signal.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So whether he can react directly

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to this behavior

324
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
is another experiment.

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
His role and brain wave

326
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
are the same.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It just depends on which physiological signal

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
makes it easier for us

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to be more accurate

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
to determine

331
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
whether it is

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
alert or not.

333
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Subject report

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
is an objective determination.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The subjective determination

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
will have some

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
deviation.

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That is, the word

339
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
reported by the subject

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
cannot express

341
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the state he just experienced

342
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
very objectively.

343
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Many researchers

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
think that the more objective

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
determination method is to look at

346
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
his reaction time.

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Next,

348
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I will talk about how we

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
measure brain waves and

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
his reaction time.

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Finally, I will talk about

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
how to define

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
alertness.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Does this answer your question?

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, thank you.

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Thank you.

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I will talk about

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the experiment we did

359
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and how to get the data we want.

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We put the subject

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
in a simulated

362
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
driving car.

363
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The car has a

364
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
circular projection screen.

365
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The car is

366
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
on a dynamic platform,

367
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
so driving in it

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
is to simulate

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
the real driving situation as much as possible.

370
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is a device

371
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
in the brain center

372
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
of the University of Transportation

373
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
In this experiment,

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
we are doing

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
road maintenance

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
tasks.

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Road maintenance

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
means that the subject

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
must maintain the car

381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
on the road.

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We will

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
automatically make the car

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
lean, forcing

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
the subject to

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
adjust the direction of

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
his car from time to time.

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The scene is

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
on a straight

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
highway,

391
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
but the car

392
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
will tilt to the left

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
or to the right.

394
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The car will tilt once every 6-10 seconds.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The subject

396
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
will feel that the car is

397
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
tilted,

398
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
move the steering wheel

399
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to guide the car.

400
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We will see

401
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
when the car

402
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
moves the steering wheel

403
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
after it is tilted.

404
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is the reaction time.

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Every 6-10 seconds,

406
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
we can measure the reaction time.

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
In the end, we hope

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
to predict the

409
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
reaction time

410
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
after the

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
brain wave

412
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
before the tilt.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is the

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
role of prediction.

415
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Next, I will talk about

416
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
how to deal with

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the prediction of

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the alertness.

419
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Every 6-10 seconds,

420
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
we will have a response time

421
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
sample.

422
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
On the y-axis,

423
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I draw the reaction time.

424
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I go to log.

425
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
On the horizontal axis,

426
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I draw the time.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The unit is divided.

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This is the length

429
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
of the whole experiment.

430
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The length of the experiment

431
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
is not certain.

432
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is shorter,

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
it is only 45 minutes.

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Most experiments

435
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
take more than an hour.

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
About an hour and a half.

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Sometimes we will

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
ask the same subject to

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
come back and do it.

440
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let me see.

441
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We finally collected more than 30 subjects.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There are

443
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
5, 6, 10

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
driving

445
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
experiment data.

446
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's talk about

447
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
each point.

448
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's the RT we just measured.

449
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
10 to the power of 0 is about 1 second.

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
When he wakes up,

451
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
he can get the car back

452
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to normal.

453
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
After a while,

454
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
his condition is not good.

455
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
After his alertness began to decline,

456
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we will see some longer

457
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
response time.

458
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
In fact, the reaction is that

459
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
his alertness becomes worse.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We have to deal with

461
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
this RT data.

462
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because RT is

463
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
not a range.

464
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Only one side has a range.

465
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The other side has no range.

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's do a regularization first.

467
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Change it to a value of 0 to 1.

468
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The way to regularize it

469
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
is to use its

470
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
cumulative distribution function.

471
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Map it

472
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to a

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
range value.

474
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Then

475
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
let's do a

476
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
smoothing here.

477
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
For smoothing, I use a 90-second

478
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
moving window

479
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
to make the

480
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
data look more dynamic.

481
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
We turn it

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
into a smoother value.

483
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This part is because

484
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
RT only samples

485
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
once every 6 to 10 seconds.

486
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If you

487
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
use too high quality

488
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
to look at this data,

489
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
it is more meaningless.

490
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
If we use a smoothing,

491
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
we can get rid of

492
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
some of the

493
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
inaccuracies of this data itself.

494
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So we use

495
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
this

496
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
alertness deficit index

497
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
which is an index

498
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
that lacks attention.

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We use it as

500
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
a ground truth

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
in our behavior.

502
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Does anyone have any questions?

503
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's assume that

504
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
RT directly reflects

505
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the level of alertness.

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yes.

507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
RT becomes alertness

508
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
should be one of the factors.

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes.

510
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So it depends on the

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
design of the experiment.

512
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
In addition, let's assume that

513
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
in our experiment design,

514
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
the part that affects RT

515
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
is only drowsiness.

516
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We try to

517
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
eliminate other factors

518
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that may affect RT.

519
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Because

520
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
similar paradigms

521
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
in the experiment

522
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
are also used

523
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
to study

524
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
mind-wandering.

525
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Mind-wandering and

526
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
alertness are related

527
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
but not exactly the same.

528
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
For example, your subject

529
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
starts to think about other things

530
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and his RT becomes worse.

531
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
In your definition,

532
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
it is a lack of alertness.

533
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yes.

534
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It is acceptable.

535
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So our alertness

536
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
is based on

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the alertness defined by RT.

538
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes.

539
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Because the subject does not react

540
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
like you said,

541
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
he may be thinking about other things.

542
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Of course,

543
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the instruction of our experiment

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
is to teach them to focus.

545
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes.

546
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What we can do is

547
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
only up to here.

548
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It may affect your

549
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
EEG data later.

550
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Imagine that there are three reasons

551
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
why his RT becomes worse.

552
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You will catch three patterns.

553
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The three patterns

554
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
may be different.

555
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
For example, when you train the data,

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the accuracy will be lower.

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because your data is not high enough.

558
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Sometimes it is because of A,

559
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
sometimes because of B,

560
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
sometimes because of C.

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It is impossible to be completely correct.

562
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Just like what you said,

563
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
mind-wandering,

564
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
we can't control it.

565
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
However,

566
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
when RT becomes longer,

567
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
it becomes quite long.

568
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
For example, 5 seconds.

569
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
If he is thinking about other things

570
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
for 5 seconds

571
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
without following our instructions

572
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to guide him,

573
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know what to do.

574
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
OK.

575
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What you see

576
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
is the real

577
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
death.

578
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Some trials,

579
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
like what you said,

580
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
may be due to other factors

581
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
or some miscommunication.

582
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This part

583
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
cannot be ruled out.

584
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
OK.

585
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
If your task

586
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
can separate

587
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
different things that affect RT,

588
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
your model

589
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
will be cleaner.

590
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This is an ideal situation.

591
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Of course,

592
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
we can't cover

593
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
so many different factors at the same time.

594
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes.

595
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So,

596
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
in terms of brain science,

597
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
we often have this problem.

598
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We can't control what the subject is thinking.

599
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
That's right.

600
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's a bit awkward.

601
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have a different idea

602
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
about brain science.

603
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
OK.

604
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If you want to

605
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
throw data to machine learning,

606
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
if there are three reasons,

607
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
whether he wants to sleep

608
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
or something else,

609
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
your algorithm

610
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
may be persuaded

611
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to identify

612
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
three different reasons.

613
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But for whatever reason,

614
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
it will

615
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
indicate that

616
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
you are lying.

617
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Isn't that right?

618
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's possible.

619
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So, in the end,

620
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
his algorithm

621
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
can avoid

622
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the longer RT time

623
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
for whatever reason.

624
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think we should

625
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
go back to the original question.

626
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What do you want to detect?

627
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
For example,

628
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
if you want to promote a policy,

629
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
you want to avoid

630
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
drowsy driving.

631
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
This whole thing is set up

632
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
for drowsy driving.

633
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But later I found that

634
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the other important factor

635
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
that affects their driving

636
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
is mind-wandering.

637
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Even if you can detect

638
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
mind-wandering at the same time,

639
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
when you make a policy,

640
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
these two are completely different.

641
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
How do you avoid A and avoid B?

642
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
In the end,

643
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
from the point of view of brain science,

644
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
what happened during that time?

645
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's the reason

646
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I asked this question.

647
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I think it's possible.

648
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
When you make a machine learning,

649
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
it can identify all patterns

650
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
as a lack of awareness.

651
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is also possible.

652
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Like what

653
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yen-Yung mentioned,

654
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
if I use machine learning,

655
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
it will learn

656
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
the relationship between data.

657
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Then you get

658
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
an overall

659
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
influence

660
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
of R&D.

661
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I don't know what it is.

662
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
In addition,

663
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
we just

664
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
discussed that

665
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
different

666
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
cognitive

667
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
phenomena can be

668
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
disassembled.

669
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It can be seen independently.

670
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Or there are some interactions

671
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
between them.

672
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If

673
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
we want to

674
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
use our data

675
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
to disassemble different

676
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
cognitive states

677
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
on this RT,

678
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
in fact,

679
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
there is no way to

680
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
just use one experiment.

681
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It may be necessary to

682
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
do different experiments

683
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to estimate

684
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
what will happen.

685
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
In our case,

686
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we try to say

687
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that there is only one

688
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
influence.

689
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But we can't guarantee.

690
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
If we say that 90% of

691
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
our trial

692
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
is based on

693
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
our imagination,

694
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
because we

695
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
let it do it

696
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
after lunch.

697
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We asked it to

698
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
drive the highway.

699
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We hope to

700
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
let it sleep

701
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
in this way.

702
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
At least

703
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
in this process,

704
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
it is closer to

705
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
what we want it to

706
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
trigger.

707
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Is that OK?

708
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
My question

709
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
has been answered.

710
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
OK.

711
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I will talk about

712
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
this later.

713
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
This is very troublesome.

714
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Many cognitive states

715
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
do not have a good

716
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
objective definition.

717
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
In the future,

718
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
whether it is a brain interface

719
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or cognitive science,

720
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
this is a big problem.

721
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Let me

722
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
continue my research.

723
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
OK.

724
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
As I said,

725
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
our brain wave can be

726
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
divided into different

727
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
characteristics.

728
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Here I list

729
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
some of my

730
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
processing processes.

731
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
EEG will

732
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
do a

733
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
re-referencing

734
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
for different channels.

735
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Here we

736
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
take

737
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the EEG of

738
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
all channels to

739
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
reduce their overall average.

740
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This can remove some

741
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
impurities.

742
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Then we do

743
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
bandpass filtering.

744
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The EEG

745
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
is limited to

746
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
50 Hz or less.

747
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Some low frequency

748
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
waves may

749
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
come from

750
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
moving around

751
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
the device itself.

752
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
We will use

753
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
1 to 50 Hz

754
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
or more

755
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
to filter the EEG

756
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and get

757
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
something that

758
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
really looks like EEG.

759
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But there are still a lot of artifacts.

760
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Downsampling

761
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
reduces our computing time.

762
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Then we do

763
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
subbandpass filtering.

764
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We divide the EEG

765
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
into different brainwaves.

766
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Here are some examples.

767
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Fast and slow.

768
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They are from delta,

769
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
zeta, alpha to beta.

770
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Then we take

771
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
their energy

772
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and do a smoothing.

773
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
We use

774
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
90-second

775
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
moving window

776
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
to smooth

777
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
the EEG

778
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and get our data.

779
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Now we have

780
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the brainwave energy

781
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and the alertness index.

782
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Now let's

783
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
compare the two.

784
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
The y-axis

785
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
represents

786
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
the EEG energy.

787
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The x-axis

788
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
represents the alertness

789
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
index.

790
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The x-axis

791
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
is the slow

792
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
reaction time.

793
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
The y-axis

794
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
represents the EEG energy.

795
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Here are

796
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
delta, zeta, alpha, beta.

797
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I have

798
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
several channels

799
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
with frontal

800
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and central.

801
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Z is the

802
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
midline.

803
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The middle of the front,

804
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
the middle of the middle,

805
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the middle of the parietal,

806
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and the middle

807
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
of the parietal.

808
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
In these positions,

809
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
the EEG energy changes

810
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
in different channels

811
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
are related to

812
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
alertness.

813
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Delta is a positive

814
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
channel. 0.77

815
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
is a positive channel.

816
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Alpha is a

817
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
negative channel,

818
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
negative 0.28.

819
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
When

820
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
alertness decreases,

821
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
the channel

822
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
will decrease.

823
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This part

824
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
has a variability.

825
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Everyone

826
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
does it every time.

827
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The relative situation

828
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
will be different.

829
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Here I use

830
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
a distribution map

831
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
with relative

832
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
details to see

833
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the relationship

834
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
between the brain wave

835
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
and the alertness.

836
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The red is the positive channel,

837
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the blue is the negative channel.

838
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Most of the delta

839
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
is positive,

840
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and the beta

841
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
is negative.

842
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
This graph

843
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
shows the results

844
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
of the brain wave and alertness

845
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
in this experiment.

846
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This graph

847
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
will change

848
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
with time.

849
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This part is to be discussed first.

850
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
If you take the brain wave

851
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
to make a frequency map,

852
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
does it have 4 peaks

853
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
in this alpha,

854
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
beta,

855
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
theta,

856
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and delta?

857
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Or is it a smooth

858
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
continuous frequency map?

859
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If you

860
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
look at the frequency,

861
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it will have

862
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
1 over f

863
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
distribution.

864
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
1 over f

865
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
looks like a

866
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
decline

867
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
curve.

868
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The brain wave

869
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
has a higher

870
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
low frequency energy

871
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and a lower high frequency energy.

872
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So cutting the alpha, beta,

873
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
theta, delta band

874
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is basically just

875
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
cutting a continuous frequency map

876
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
into 4 pieces.

877
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yes, but sometimes

878
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
there will be some peaks.

879
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Although it is 1 over f,

880
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the overall distribution is 1 over f.

881
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We call it

882
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
pain noise,

883
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
one of the noise.

884
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But sometimes

885
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the overall distribution

886
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
will have some small peaks.

887
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Because sometimes the brain

888
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
can have a strong alertness

889
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
such as alpha.

890
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Alpha is when you close your eyes

891
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and especially

892
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the back part

893
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
will start to vibrate

894
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
about 10 Hz.

895
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
At that time,

896
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
there is a small peak

897
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
on the curve of

898
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
1 over f.

899
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It looks a bit like this.

900
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What I'm thinking is

901
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
if your energy spectrum

902
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
does not have a peak,

903
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
if you cut it into 4 pieces

904
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and then divide it into

905
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
these 4 groups of data

906
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to do machine learning,

907
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I don't think it will enhance

908
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
the effect of machine learning.

909
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Because it may be

910
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
on the edge of the band

911
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
that you cut.

912
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But if you have a peak

913
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
in alpha today,

914
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
you separate alpha

915
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and other

916
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
data to do

917
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
machine learning training,

918
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I think it will have a more obvious effect.

919
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That's why I asked this question.

920
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I understand what you mean.

921
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So if you use

922
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
some really meaningful band

923
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
to do

924
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
machine learning,

925
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
the effect will be

926
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
better.

927
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes, I agree with you.

928
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You must put a lot of

929
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
impurities into it.

930
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But because

931
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
the problem I'm going to solve later is

932
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
how do I say it?

933
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I can't give up on each one.

934
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because each one has

935
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
mutational problems,

936
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
so each one sometimes

937
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
becomes the best feature

938
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
that appears on top.

939
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So

940
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
there's no way

941
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to narrow it down

942
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
to a better feature.

943
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I have to

944
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
use so many features.

945
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That's the situation.

946
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
OK, thank you.

947
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
OK.

948
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm going to talk about

949
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
machine learning.

950
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's a regression problem.

951
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Because I want to

952
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
predict

953
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the change of

954
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
the alertness

955
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
index.

956
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's a continuous value.

957
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The output of the model

958
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
must be a continuous value.

959
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It must be close to this value.

960
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I just did some

961
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
processing.

962
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's the same here.

963
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Then I put the energy of the brain wave

964
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and the reaction time

965
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
recorded by our experiment

966
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
in the

967
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
processed alertness

968
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
index into the model.

969
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Then I train it.

970
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Then I get a

971
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
regression model.

972
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It can turn the brain wave

973
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
into the alertness index we estimated.

974
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But there's a problem.

975
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I've been talking about it.

976
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Human variability.

977
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We will

978
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
divide it into

979
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
inter-subject or intra-subject.

980
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Inter-subject and subject

981
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
have some variability.

982
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I want to invite you

983
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to do an activity.

984
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The dancer you see now

985
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
is teleporting.

986
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Just make a sound.

987
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I can see both sides.

988
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So you can see this

989
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and that.

990
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I can see what I want to see.

991
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I've seen this picture so many times in my life.

992
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But I can only see one side.

993
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't know why.

994
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I really want to see the other side.

995
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Some people see the retrograde

996
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and some people see the subject.

997
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Some people want to see

998
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
what they want to see.

999
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I also

1000
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
want to see the other side.

1001
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Then I go to see it.

1002
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It will follow my

1003
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
direction.

1004
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
This part is

1005
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
the same stimulus to

1006
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
different people.

1007
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Our brain

1008
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
will react differently.

1009
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
This is just an example.

1010
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It tells you that

1011
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
everyone's brain is different.

1012
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Our brain

1013
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
will react differently

1014
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
to the same stimulus

1015
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
at different times.

1016
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The brain wave change

1017
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
related to the brain wave

1018
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
is actually the same.

1019
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Different people are different.

1020
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
A person does the experiment

1021
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
on a different day.

1022
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Here I put my data.

1023
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I gave an example.

1024
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I just said

1025
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
to use the distribution of correlation

1026
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
as a relationship

1027
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
between the brain wave and the alertness

1028
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
of a certain experiment.

1029
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Here I have a S5-1,

1030
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
which is the fifth subject.

1031
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Do the driving experiment.

1032
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The correlation we get is like this.

1033
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
There are three reds here.

1034
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
From Theta to Alpha

1035
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
to Beta

1036
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
are all positive.

1037
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But this is

1038
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
the second time he did it.

1039
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
The second time he did it.

1040
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
We see that it's completely different.

1041
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Delta is positive.

1042
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The other three are negative.

1043
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Even Alpha is negative.

1044
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
If we use his first experiment

1045
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
to train our model,

1046
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
we will find that

1047
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
the effect will be very poor

1048
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
the second time.

1049
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But we did a lot of experiments.

1050
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We recorded a lot of people.

1051
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
For example, the 41st subject

1052
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
when he did it for the fifth time,

1053
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
he had this pattern.

1054
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's very similar to subject 5.

1055
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So different people

1056
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
have similar reactions

1057
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
on the brain wave we want to look at.

1058
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
If so,

1059
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I can take the data

1060
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
of subject 41

1061
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
for the fifth time

1062
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
to train a model.

1063
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
If we use it for the second time

1064
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
of subject 5,

1065
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
the effect will be very good.

1066
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Of course, this is what we can do

1067
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
after the test.

1068
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This session is very similar to this session.

1069
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But we can't

1070
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
When subject 5

1071
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
comes, we have a way

1072
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to know that we want to use

1073
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the model of subject 41 to give it.

1074
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That is a

1075
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
engineering challenge

1076
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
or a scientific challenge.

1077
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
How do we do this?

1078
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I want to ask a question.

1079
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Sorry.

1080
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I want to ask a question.

1081
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The time they do the experiment

1082
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
is probably fixed.

1083
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Like you said, after lunch.

1084
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
The time

1085
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
is probably fixed.

1086
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yes.

1087
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This looks

1088
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
a bit like

1089
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the problem I just mentioned.

1090
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
There may be different factors.

1091
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
The brain activity

1092
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
between different sessions

1093
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
may be different.

1094
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yes.

1095
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
For example,

1096
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
if you want to measure drowsiness,

1097
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
your second session of subject 5

1098
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
is similar.

1099
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes.

1100
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
In other words,

1101
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
if you can have another task

1102
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
or a subjective report

1103
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
to verify

1104
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
what happened in each session,

1105
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
you may be able to

1106
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
go back and say that

1107
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
this brain wave is more like

1108
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
A or B or C.

1109
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, this is what I want to do.

1110
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Is there anything else

1111
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
we can measure

1112
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
faster?

1113
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Then we can know

1114
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that this should be

1115
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
similar to the previous session.

1116
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Then we can use it.

1117
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Next,

1118
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I will develop this.

1119
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
OK.

1120
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The actual operation may be more complicated than this.

1121
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
In other words,

1122
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
my brain activity of drowsiness

1123
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
is similar to

1124
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
your brain activity of mind wandering.

1125
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
There is a relationship between

1126
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
brain state and brain state.

1127
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It may be like this.

1128
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Everyone may have a different brain state.

1129
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Of course,

1130
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I have a brain state

1131
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
corresponding to

1132
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
the brain activity of mind.

1133
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But it doesn't mean

1134
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
that everyone's brain state

1135
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
is similar.

1136
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I don't know.

1137
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That may be the actual difficulty.

1138
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It feels like it can be done.

1139
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Of course,

1140
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
it's good.

1141
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But we can't

1142
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
analyze other factors

1143
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
in this experiment.

1144
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's a pity.

1145
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Next,

1146
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I will deal with

1147
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
the relationship

1148
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
in a data-driven way.

1149
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
OK. Thank you.

1150
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I have a question.

1151
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This page.

1152
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I want to ask

1153
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
about the black dots

1154
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
on the image.

1155
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The black dots are the

1156
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
corresponding probes

1157
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
of the hat.

1158
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But the hat is actually

1159
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
a spatial distribution of the sphere.

1160
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's not a flat 2D circle.

1161
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yes.

1162
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
How did you

1163
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
project the image

1164
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
from the spatial distribution of the sphere

1165
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
to the image you drew now?

1166
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Or is it just a visual image?

1167
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Do you preserve

1168
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the distance between each dot?

1169
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Is it a specific

1170
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
projection like a map?

1171
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Or do you arrange it one by one?

1172
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
This value

1173
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
is only used in visualization.

1174
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So if the relationship is distorted,

1175
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
it won't affect much.

1176
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Because I...

1177
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
You only take

1178
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
exactly the position above.

1179
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
OK.

1180
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Like this is 30 channels.

1181
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So I only have those 30

1182
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
channels of data.

1183
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And what happens in the middle?

1184
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That's all visualizations.

1185
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
They are inserted

1186
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and projected.

1187
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I want to tell you about this.

1188
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
What I was thinking is

1189
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
if you process the data like this

1190
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and then throw it away,

1191
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
it sounds like you will re-weight

1192
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the effect of each data.

1193
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And it may smear

1194
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
what's physically happening in your brain.

1195
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I don't know what you mean.

1196
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
OK.

1197
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
This is purely visualization.

1198
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
OK. Thank you.

1199
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Like you said, some people

1200
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
use mapping as data.

1201
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And I don't like it.

1202
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Because it's like a problem.

1203
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So we just talked about

1204
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
how to find

1205
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
a model that is similar to

1206
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
the new people in the database.

1207
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
What's the advantage of this?

1208
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
We call it Subject Transfer.

1209
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It transfers the model

1210
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
from one person to another.

1211
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
The advantage is that

1212
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
we used to say

1213
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
we try to collect

1214
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
each person's data,

1215
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
brainwaves and behaviors.

1216
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We try to collect more data

1217
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
to build a model.

1218
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
We believe that it will have a good performance

1219
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
for the same person.

1220
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We call it Self-Decoding.

1221
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Because of some variability,

1222
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
it often fails.

1223
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So we want to use

1224
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Subject Transfer.

1225
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
We use a small amount of data

1226
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
as an indicator,

1227
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
as a brain signature.

1228
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Then we can

1229
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
find a suitable model

1230
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
from our database

1231
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and use it.

1232
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Then we can start

1233
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
to detect

1234
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
its alertness level.

1235
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
What should we use

1236
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
for this

1237
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
relatively small amount of data?

1238
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
What I'm talking about

1239
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
is

1240
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Baseline Activity.

1241
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Baseline Activity

1242
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
is a standard state.

1243
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Baseline Activity

1244
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
can also be called

1245
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Task Activity

1246
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
or Task Free Activity.

1247
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It means that

1248
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
this subject is not doing anything

1249
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and it has nothing to do with your task.

1250
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Then the brain activity at that time.

1251
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
In the past, there were many studies

1252
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
to see

1253
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
when the brain was not doing anything,

1254
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
the brain's

1255
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
existing activities

1256
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and the specific activities

1257
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
after you really gave it a task.

1258
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Is there any connection?

1259
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
On the brain wave,

1260
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
we found that

1261
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
from RESTing data,

1262
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
you use ICA

1263
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
to look at

1264
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
some

1265
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
decomposed

1266
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
component activity.

1267
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Then you can use that

1268
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
to help it in the action

1269
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
imagination of this specific task.

1270
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You can find it

1271
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
from RESTing data

1272
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
to find out the pattern

1273
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
of its action imagination.

1274
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
When a person is not doing

1275
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
action imagination,

1276
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
his data can tell you

1277
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
what his pattern looks like

1278
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
when he is doing action imagination.

1279
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
In addition, there is RESTing data

1280
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to predict

1281
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
the performance of the brain interface.

1282
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Because not everyone

1283
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
can master

1284
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
how to use the brain interface.

1285
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
RESTing data

1286
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
can tell you

1287
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
if this person is suitable for using the brain interface.

1288
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Another study

1289
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
is from RESTing.

1290
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
This is MRI data,

1291
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
fMRI data.

1292
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
It predicts

1293
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
from RESTing fMRI

1294
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
that under a specific

1295
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
cognitive task,

1296
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
the activation mapping is like this.

1297
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
There is a lot of evidence

1298
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
that your RESTing

1299
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
data and your

1300
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
task data

1301
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
are related.

1302
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Back to

1303
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
how we choose the right model,

1304
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I thought

1305
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
if we use a small piece of RESTing data,

1306
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
we can find the right model

1307
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
for the new person.

1308
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Here I think

1309
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I have a lot of models

1310
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
from the past

1311
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
experiments.

1312
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I have built a lot of models.

1313
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The new person

1314
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
is called Target Subject.

1315
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Then we record a baseline.

1316
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
This is recorded

1317
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
in the alert situation.

1318
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
That is to say,

1319
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
this person

1320
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
in our

1321
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
simulation driving

1322
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
simulation car

1323
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
is not moving,

1324
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
he is not turning the steering wheel,

1325
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
he is not doing anything,

1326
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the car is moving forward,

1327
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
he doesn't have to do anything,

1328
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
the data during that time,

1329
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
we treat it as a brain signature.

1330
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
We use this to estimate

1331
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
who is more like

1332
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the new person

1333
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
and the model in the original database.

1334
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We do a sequence

1335
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
for this model,

1336
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and then do a fusion,

1337
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
which is to combine those models

1338
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and outputs together.

1339
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Finally, we do a recalibration,

1340
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because sometimes

1341
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
there are some offsets.

1342
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Finally,

1343
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
we can give this subject

1344
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
to estimate his alertness.

1345
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Any questions?

1346
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Can you explain

1347
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
the pairing process again?

1348
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
OK.

1349
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
How do you find

1350
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
a person

1351
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
to pair with

1352
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
a car make a session?

1353
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
OK.

1354
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I have

1355
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
a backup slide here.

1356
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
For the new person,

1357
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I will have his baseline data.

1358
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It is

1359
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
his energy in different

1360
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
bands and in different locations.

1361
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
We use this to compare

1362
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
the data of all other people

1363
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
in my database.

1364
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Then I estimate his similarity.

1365
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I use this similarity

1366
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
to assume that

1367
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
if he is

1368
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
in the baseline state,

1369
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
the pattern of these two people is similar,

1370
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
then I believe

1371
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
their EEG alertness

1372
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
model will be very similar.

1373
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That's how I do it.

1374
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
OK.

1375
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
In other words,

1376
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
you just showed us

1377
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
a session.

1378
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
According to this model,

1379
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
their default baseline

1380
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
activity should be very similar.

1381
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Yes.

1382
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
OK.

1383
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Thank you.

1384
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I have a post-trial analysis here.

1385
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
In other words,

1386
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
we use baseline activity

1387
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
to predict the similarity.

1388
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Is it really their similarity?

1389
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
The real similarity here

1390
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
is that I put

1391
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
a model of a person

1392
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
and a session

1393
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
to use the data of another person.

1394
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Then look at their

1395
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
performance afterwards.

1396
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
There is a real similarity

1397
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
offline.

1398
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I also use baseline activity

1399
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
to estimate their

1400
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
subject-subject similarity.

1401
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Then I predict

1402
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
the performance

1403
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I can get.

1404
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I found that these two things

1405
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
are quite similar.

1406
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You can see a correspondence here.

1407
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's actually the same as what I predicted.

1408
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
There is an accuracy here.

1409
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
If I use this,

1410
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I can do what I just did.

1411
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It means that at least

1412
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
part of my assumption is correct.

1413
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Because of this,

1414
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
we can look at

1415
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
our prediction

1416
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
results.

1417
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
The black line here

1418
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
is the change of time

1419
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
in the entire experiment.

1420
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's a black line.

1421
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The result we predict

1422
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
is to get close to this black line.

1423
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
We can see that

1424
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
the relevant details of different

1425
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
curves can express

1426
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
how accurate we predicted.

1427
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
The blue part here

1428
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
is the traditional way.

1429
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Each subject uses

1430
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
the data he has recorded

1431
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
to train a model

1432
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
to look at his prediction results.

1433
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
The red line is

1434
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
the method I just mentioned.

1435
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
We look at a small section

1436
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
of baseline activity.

1437
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
We use other people's models

1438
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
to predict his alertness.

1439
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You can see that

1440
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
on this example,

1441
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
red is better than black.

1442
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
This is their curve.

1443
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They are related to

1444
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
the actual ground truth here.

1445
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
On this example,

1446
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
the method

1447
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
of subject transfer

1448
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
is slightly better.

1449
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I have a small question.

1450
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
This concept

1451
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
is like a donation, right?

1452
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
If you can

1453
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
find a group of people

1454
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
whose genotype

1455
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
or model

1456
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
is similar to yours,

1457
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
can you use this method

1458
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
to match

1459
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
their data?

1460
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yes.

1461
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
OK.

1462
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
In other words,

1463
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you can only do

1464
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
a few hours.

1465
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
If you use this method,

1466
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
you can use

1467
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
an infinite amount of data.

1468
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
If you recruit a lot of people,

1469
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
a lot of people can match.

1470
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
The data pool will keep increasing.

1471
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
That's right.

1472
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Thank you.

1473
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I have a question.

1474
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The picture in the front page

1475
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
is the actual.

1476
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
No, the next page.

1477
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yes, the next page.

1478
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
This is

1479
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
a different way

1480
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to do it.

1481
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Now you draw a line.

1482
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But if

1483
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
you divide your data

1484
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
a little bit,

1485
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it's a bit like

1486
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
repeating the same thing

1487
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
500 or 1000 times.

1488
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Your prediction

1489
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
will be a little bit different every time.

1490
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Then you can put your

1491
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
red line into a red band.

1492
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Do you know what I mean?

1493
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
There is an error.

1494
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Yes, the range of the band

1495
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
is basically

1496
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
the range of uncertainty

1497
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
of your model.

1498
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
OK.

1499
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So every time you run,

1500
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
it will be a little different.

1501
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Did you hear that?

1502
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So every time you run,

1503
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
it will be a little different.

1504
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yes, so I'm curious.

1505
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Except for the line you show now,

1506
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
the uncertainty

1507
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
behind each line

1508
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
may not be the same.

1509
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
For example,

1510
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
predictability is particularly good

1511
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
in this specific case.

1512
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It may actually be fluctuate up.

1513
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But the band is actually very wide.

1514
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So it may not be particularly good.

1515
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh.

1516
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
This is a good question.

1517
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Because usually

1518
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
if you plot this prediction,

1519
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
you will plot 95% confidence interval.

1520
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
He is actually talking about this thing.

1521
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You should plot this thing out.

1522
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
OK, got it.

1523
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yes.

1524
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
But I see that it's a lot.

1525
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I probably feel that

1526
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
there should be nothing to argue about.

1527
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It should be effective.

1528
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
But if it's very close,

1529
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I'll be more curious.

1530
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
This is better than that.

1531
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I might want to see the error bar.

1532
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Oh, got it.

1533
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yes, this is good.

1534
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I should be able to put that

1535
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
confidence interval

1536
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
in as well.

1537
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Because I just want to compare

1538
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
their correlation.

1539
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Then I just draw the line.

1540
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So if I draw the curve,

1541
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I can have a better

1542
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
that

1543
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
better than

1544
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
better

1545
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
measure to see

1546
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
their performance.

1547
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yes, that's what I think.

1548
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Because I think if you have an error bar,

1549
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
you can clearly say this is better, this is worse.

1550
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yes, but

1551
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
if you just want to show features,

1552
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
it looks like they all work.

1553
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And they all work pretty good.

1554
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I think.

1555
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
OK, got it.

1556
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Because the way I compare here

1557
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
is that every time

1558
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I go to see the correlation

1559
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
of different methods.

1560
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And for different people,

1561
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I compare their correlation

1562
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and then

1563
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
conclude which method

1564
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
is better.

1565
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
This is my current approach.

1566
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's simpler,

1567
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
but it might not be the best.

1568
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Hello?

1569
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yes, if we have a better

1570
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'll ask you again.

1571
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
OK.

1572
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We can discuss later.

1573
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
OK, thank you.

1574
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
OK, I'll continue.

1575
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
OK, so just now

1576
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I used the correlation to see

1577
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
different methods

1578
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and their overall performance.

1579
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Here I just put all

1580
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
the subjects I tested

1581
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
together.

1582
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Just now Shaoming mentioned

1583
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
that my data increase

1584
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
will be good.

1585
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So I went to test

1586
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
if the size of my database

1587
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
just now

1588
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
is different.

1589
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The way I did it

1590
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
is that I cut off

1591
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
some data

1592
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
from my database.

1593
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Randomly cut off some data

1594
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and use the subject as a unit.

1595
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I'll see if my method performance

1596
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
will increase

1597
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
when the subject increases.

1598
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Y-axis is the average

1599
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
correlation coefficient.

1600
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Blue is the traditional method.

1601
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Use your own data

1602
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
to train a model.

1603
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Red is our

1604
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
method of subject transfer.

1605
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Grey is the same

1606
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
subject transfer, but without

1607
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
our baseline activity

1608
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
to choose those models.

1609
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You can see that

1610
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
our method

1611
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
will increase

1612
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
when the size increases.

1613
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But if you don't use

1614
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
the baseline correction,

1615
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
it will be a little worse.

1616
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
A little worse.

1617
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Then continue to talk about

1618
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
the next picture.

1619
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I will compare

1620
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
if we do this,

1621
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
will the calibration time be reduced?

1622
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Traditionally, you have to

1623
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
record your own data.

1624
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
If we want to record

1625
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the alertness to become drowsy,

1626
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
it takes a long time.

1627
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Traditionally, it takes a long time

1628
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
to get the data you need.

1629
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
This will cause

1630
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
a long calibration time.

1631
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Our new method is to

1632
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
use baseline activity.

1633
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's easy to get baseline activity.

1634
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Just don't move.

1635
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Less than two minutes of data

1636
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The past method

1637
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
is about 18 minutes.

1638
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
There is no difference.

1639
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
My conclusion

1640
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
is that I can reduce it

1641
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
from 18 minutes to

1642
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
less than two minutes.

1643
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
In terms of calibration reduction,

1644
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
subject transfer can give us this effect.

1645
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
In this case,

1646
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
we really need to use our brain

1647
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
to predict alertness.

1648
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It will be much better

1649
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
if we use our brain to

1650
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
predict alertness.

1651
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
There is another question

1652
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
that people often ask.

1653
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
This hat looks like this.

1654
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
No one wants to wear it.

1655
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Is there a better way

1656
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
to measure our brain?

1657
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I was thinking

1658
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
that when we measure our brain,

1659
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
hair is a big problem.

1660
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
If we avoid hair,

1661
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
we can use some simple devices.

1662
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We can also use

1663
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
these sensors

1664
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
on our skin.

1665
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
If we can use these

1666
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
to measure our brain,

1667
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
more people will be willing to use it.

1668
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You don't have to damage your hair.

1669
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It won't be uncomfortable.

1670
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I tested that

1671
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
if I only use the front ear and

1672
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
these channels next to the ear,

1673
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
there are only six channels.

1674
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Can I use these six channels

1675
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
to make a comparison

1676
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
with the two heads

1677
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
with 32 channels?

1678
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I found that

1679
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
if you only use the channels

1680
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
without hair,

1681
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
the classification accuracy

1682
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
can be the same

1683
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
as the classification

1684
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
with all channels.

1685
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
There is no significant difference.

1686
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So we can actually

1687
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
use the BCI

1688
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
on alertness

1689
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
or these channels

1690
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
with no hair.

1691
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
This way,

1692
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
our device can be more convenient.

1693
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Here are some problems

1694
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
that we need to solve

1695
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
when we really want to use it.

1696
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The first one is

1697
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
to reduce the calibration time

1698
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
by using subject transferring.

1699
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Here we verify that

1700
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
we don't need to use so many channels.

1701
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
We can do this

1702
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
with only one channel.

1703
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Here is a demonstration

1704
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
of how our future

1705
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
system will work.

1706
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We just mentioned

1707
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
that we use response time

1708
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
as a ground truth

1709
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
for our alertness.

1710
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
To be more precise,

1711
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I plan to use the distribution

1712
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
of response time

1713
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
as alertness

1714
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
to define our alertness.

1715
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So if your distribution is shorter

1716
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and the peak

1717
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
is shorter,

1718
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the y-axis is

1719
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the response time

1720
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and the unit is the second.

1721
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So if this is a very narrow distribution,

1722
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
it is a better alertness.

1723
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
If the distribution

1724
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
is very wide,

1725
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
it is easier to have

1726
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
a longer response time,

1727
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
which is a bad alertness,

1728
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
and then

1729
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
here is

1730
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
a demonstration

1731
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
that my black line

1732
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
is my now,

1733
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and then I use

1734
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
the previous

1735
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
brainwave data

1736
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
to predict that

1737
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
from now on to 90 seconds,

1738
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the distribution of

1739
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
response time

1740
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
is a

1741
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
thing that

1742
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
will change

1743
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
over time.

1744
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Then

1745
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
when this time

1746
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
passes, I can use some

1747
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
offline tests

1748
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
to see

1749
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
if my response time

1750
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
really falls

1751
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
at a relatively high rate.

1752
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
These white dots

1753
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
are the response time

1754
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
that we draw

1755
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
based on

1756
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
this, and you can play it a little bit.

1757
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
OK, so you can see

1758
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
that now this is

1759
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
its distribution is

1760
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
narrower, so the color here is

1761
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
also more obvious, and then this is

1762
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
the response time we actually recorded.

1763
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It is easier to fall

1764
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
within this range,

1765
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
in a better state of

1766
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
alertness, and then

1767
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
as time goes by, we can see that

1768
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
this person's

1769
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
distribution keeps drifting

1770
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and then finally becomes wider,

1771
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
which means that

1772
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
he is not in a good condition.

1773
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm starting to

1774
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
sleep.

1775
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Like this,

1776
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
it's

1777
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
like this,

1778
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
it's

1779
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
like this,

1780
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
its distribution has become wider,

1781
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
and then this side is also blurred.

1782
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Then you can also see that

1783
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
there are some

1784
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
long response times,

1785
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
which means that

1786
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
our prediction is roughly

1787
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
real data

1788
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
to verify that this prediction

1789
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
is correct.

1790
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It will keep going.

1791
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
This is a bit

1792
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
like a weather forecast,

1793
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
we go to its learnings to make a forecast.

1794
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Does anyone have any questions here?

1795
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Sorry, this forecast is

1796
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
a few seconds ago, I might have missed it.

1797
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
OK, this black line is now,

1798
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
so I'm going forward

1799
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
to predict 90 seconds,

1800
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and within 90 seconds, its probability distribution is here.

1801
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Yes, so let's see

1802
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
that I predicted like this in the front,

1803
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
and then the real response time

1804
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
is it just below the one I just predicted?

1805
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
OK, OK.

1806
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
This is the distribution I just predicted.

1807
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Then I

1808
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
plan to continue

1809
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
to do it.

1810
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I hope that this thing can really

1811
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
be used in

1812
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
many applications.

1813
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
In addition to driving,

1814
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
many jobs that require

1815
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
attention and focus

1816
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
may be able to use this thing.

1817
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
In addition, I also want to

1818
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
use this thing to see

1819
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
if there is a way to

1820
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
actually see if our brain

1821
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
uses

1822
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
the change of

1823
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
learning

1824
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
to see if it has anything to do

1825
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
with learning.

1826
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Or we can look at

1827
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
ADHD or other

1828
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
more specific people,

1829
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
are they different

1830
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
from normal people

1831
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
in this part of

1832
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
learning?

1833
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Take learning as a tool

1834
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
to see if

1835
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
different groups

1836
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
have different differences.

1837
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I would like to thank

1838
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
many people and the lab

1839
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
and my funding is mainly

1840
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
sponsored by Lu Jun.

1841
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Thank you all.

1842
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

1843
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And applause, great.

1844
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Do you have any questions?

1845
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
You can ask now.

1846
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Questions.

1847
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
There are some comments.

1848
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
The first one is a small question.

1849
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
You said it was sponsored by Lu Jun,

1850
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
is it the United States?

1851
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
The project sponsored by

1852
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Lu Jun in the United States.

1853
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I'm just curious.

1854
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Are you an American?

1855
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
No,

1856
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
this project

1857
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
is not sensitive.

1858
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So it can

1859
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
have a project

1860
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
with many schools

1861
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
to help Lu Jun do things.

1862
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
He donated money to many schools

1863
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
to help him do things.

1864
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
This project mainly wants to

1865
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
look at the brain interface

1866
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and how to use

1867
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
sound science

1868
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
in some situations.

1869
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I see.

1870
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
At least in physics

1871
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
or astronomy,

1872
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
if there is

1873
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
military sponsorship,

1874
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
they usually have a lot of

1875
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
work to do.

1876
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Who is your nationality?

1877
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
What is your nationality?

1878
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
What is your background?

1879
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Yes, they have a lot of projects

1880
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
that require citizenship.

1881
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The unit that gave us the money

1882
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
requires you to be a citizen

1883
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
to work there.

1884
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Even PR is not allowed.

1885
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I see.

1886
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I have something

1887
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
that I find interesting.

1888
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I think

1889
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
if I were to do something

1890
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
in the future,

1891
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
for example,

1892
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
this person has started to hallucinate.

1893
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
We all have this experience.

1894
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You sit next to a co-driver

1895
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
and the driver starts to hallucinate.

1896
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You say, hey, don't sleep.

1897
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But the idiot

1898
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
wakes up and brakes.

1899
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
It's actually very dangerous.

1900
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
So I think

1901
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
the reaction of Awakening

1902
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
to make this whole thing

1903
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
a complete and useful thing

1904
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
is a very important part, I think.

1905
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yes, well said.

1906
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yes, we also saw

1907
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
that if it was

1908
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
during sleep,

1909
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
we used sound to wake him up

1910
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
to see if it was useful

1911
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
after waking him up.

1912
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But we didn't really see

1913
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
what you said.

1914
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Braking randomly.

1915
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Yes, but I think it's possible.

1916
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Yes, it's possible.

1917
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yes.

1918
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That's my suggestion.

1919
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I have two questions.

1920
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Okay, I have two questions.

1921
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
The first question is

1922
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
related to your hardware.

1923
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You mentioned that

1924
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
if you only use a few channels

1925
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
without covering the hair,

1926
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
the effect is the same.

1927
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Do you use dry electrodes

1928
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
to measure signals?

1929
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
In my research,

1930
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I use the same electrodes

1931
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
for all of them.

1932
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
They're all wet electrodes.

1933
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I just look at the results

1934
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
from different locations.

1935
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Because I have to compare,

1936
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I still use the same method

1937
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
to measure.

1938
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Because I actually

1939
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
went to San Diego a few years ago

1940
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and he showed us

1941
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
his lab

1942
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
using the dry electrodes

1943
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
for baseball caps.

1944
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Baseball caps?

1945
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Baseball caps are the most primitive form.

1946
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But they mainly

1947
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
turn electrodes into dry electrodes

1948
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
so they don't need to be covered.

1949
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So I'm curious

1950
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
about your current experiment.

1951
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Is there anyone

1952
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
still using dry electrodes?

1953
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Or most of them are still covered?

1954
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
In fact, dry electrodes

1955
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
are becoming more and more popular.

1956
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Because people find it useful.

1957
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It takes less time.

1958
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And

1959
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
subjects like it more.

1960
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
But it's not necessarily more comfortable.

1961
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Because dry electrodes

1962
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
usually need

1963
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
some special design

1964
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
on the hair

1965
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
to pass through the hair.

1966
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So a lot of dry electrodes

1967
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
make some corners,

1968
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
deep corners,

1969
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
and longer hair.

1970
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So it's not comfortable to wear for a long time.

1971
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So I specialize in

1972
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
the part without hair

1973
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
because there are a lot of

1974
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
choices for the sensor

1975
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
because it doesn't need to deal with hair problems.

1976
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And for the

1977
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
adhesive type,

1978
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
it's better for

1979
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
long-term measurement.

1980
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Because most people

1981
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
wear dry electrodes

1982
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
and they start to feel pain

1983
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
after a few hours.

1984
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Okay.

1985
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
My second question

1986
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
is a bit of a disaster question.

1987
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Most of the BCAAs I've seen

1988
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
are taken signals from the brain

1989
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
and transmitted to the computer

1990
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
for related processing

1991
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
or other applications.

1992
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But is it possible that

1993
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
in the future, or is there anyone

1994
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
who is already doing it?

1995
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It's a bit like the opposite.

1996
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So the BCAAs are being taken signals

1997
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and transmitted to the human brain

1998
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
to try to manipulate human behavior.

1999
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Yes.

2000
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
There are a few non-BCAAs.

2001
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I'm talking about non-BCAAs

2002
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
because BCAAs are directly

2003
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
transmitted to the computer.

2004
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Non-BCAAs

2005
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
have a kind of TMS,

2006
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
which is a pass-through magnetic field.

2007
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It uses a very strong magnetic field

2008
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
to try to

2009
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
trigger

2010
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
brain activity

2011
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
in a certain area.

2012
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
At the moment,

2013
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
we know

2014
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
that

2015
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
the doctor

2016
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
can look for

2017
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
the magnetic field

2018
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
in a certain area

2019
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and your hand will move.

2020
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But

2021
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
this thing

2022
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
hasn't been

2023
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
fully studied.

2024
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So what changes

2025
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
can it cause?

2026
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
There is not much

2027
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
relevant evidence at the moment.

2028
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
So it's still under development.

2029
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Can I say something?

2030
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Yes.

2031
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Someone in our lab has done this.

2032
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I haven't done it myself.

2033
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
But basically,

2034
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
it's close to a one-to-one response.

2035
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
For example, if you stimulate

2036
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
the visual cortex,

2037
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
some people will see crossfade,

2038
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
which is a flash.

2039
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
As mentioned earlier,

2040
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
if you stimulate the motor,

2041
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
it will move in a certain area.

2042
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
You can find out which finger moves.

2043
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
For example, if you stimulate a certain area,

2044
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
it will map out

2045
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
which finger moves.

2046
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
For hearing,

2047
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
relatively few people

2048
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
have done it.

2049
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
For example, compared to EEG or MRI,

2050
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
a group of people

2051
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
have been doing TMS research.

2052
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
There are also TDCS, TACS, etc.

2053
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Do you have any other questions?

2054
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I'm going to ask a question.

2055
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Wait a minute.

2056
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I don't have a question.

2057
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I just want to say

2058
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I want to stop recording.

2059
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
But you can

2060
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
continue.

2061
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
OK, no problem.

2062
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I'm sorry.
