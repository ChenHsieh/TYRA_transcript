00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I am the host for this week, Lin Yu-Wei.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I am very happy to invite our speaker today, Zhou Zhijie.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
He obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at NTU,

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
and is currently a doctor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Lincoln.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Under the guidance of Professor Dai Yu-Chang,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
he has been conducting research on wearable devices and biomimics for medical purposes.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Zhijie and his speech today.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Now let's give the microphone to our speaker today, Zhijie.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, for the introduction.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Hello, everyone. I am Zhou Zhijie.

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Without further ado, let's get to the topic.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
First of all, I would like to introduce to you

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
why wearable devices have become a hot topic in recent years.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Basically, it can be divided into several aspects.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
The first is the concept of non-invasive.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
The concept of non-invasive means that the device does not need to enter our body.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
You may have been to the hospital for injections or blood draws.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
Once something enters your body, the first reaction is pain.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
In addition to the pain, the immune system will also react to foreign bodies.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
For example, some white blood cells or other immune cells will attack foreign objects.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
Basically, it will cause a lot of inflammation, swelling, pain, and heat.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Therefore, wearable devices basically avoid such risks.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
Many technology giants like Apple and Fitbit

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
want to study non-invasive devices first

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
and see where their limits can be pushed.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
Then they will consider the so-called minimally invasive devices.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
In fact, there is a huge barrier between non-invasive and minimally invasive.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
Whether it is from the perspective of devices or from the perspective of government agencies like the FDA,

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
the biggest barrier is still entering the body.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Once you enter the body, there is a lot of risk.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
Stay outside the body is a very low-risk device.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Basically, wearable devices have become so popular recently.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Next is the so-called big clinical data.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
I believe everyone has heard of big clinical data.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
The meaning of big clinical data is that this device can provide some diagnostic information.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
This diagnosis is also a bit tricky.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
How can we determine the value of the diagnosis?

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
What metrics are really useful?

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
The third part is the so-called Autonomous Sensing.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Autonomous Sensing is not as complicated as you think.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Just put the wearable device on your body and it will automatically start to measure.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Then you don't need to intervene.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
Then it can continuously send this data out in a wireless way.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
The advantage is that even if you are not conscious, for example, when you are sleeping,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
this device can still continue to measure and send the data out.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So it can let us see some things that we couldn't see before.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
For example, when you are sleeping, it can help you measure the cycle of sleep,

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
or the heartbeat when you are resting, and so on.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
The fourth aspect is that it is very easy to compare with portable devices,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
such as mobile phones, smartphones, or even tablets.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
Basically, these portable devices can be used as a relay station.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
You can imagine that your wearable sensor is a bit like a place to send signals.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Then store these signals in the portable device.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Basically, the computing power of these portable devices is relatively strong,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
and the bandwidth to upload data is relatively high.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
On the one hand, it can be used as a relay station, and on the other hand,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
it can be used as a place to send signals.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
There are a lot of benefits that you can think about.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Next, I will talk about the logic of why we want to use wearable devices

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
to monitor the health of our body.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
There is a study in Stanford,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
which is called digital health.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
It is a comparison of regular visits to the hospital

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
and digital health.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
The so-called digital health is actually

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
collecting all the data that should be collected at the hospital,

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
digitizing it,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
and then processing these digitized data.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
This study is actually very simple.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
There are only two main variables.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
One is to measure the skin temperature,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
and the other is to measure the heart rate.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
If I put the sensor on the patient

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
for a long time,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
the patient will inevitably get sick.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
when the patient is sick

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
are basically the same.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
are basically the same.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
are basically the same.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
are basically the same.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
are basically the same.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
are basically the same.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
are basically the same.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
are basically the same.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
are basically the same.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
are basically the same.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
The wearable sensor has some information in it.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
How do we get this information out?

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
How do we get this information out?

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
How do we get this information out?

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
We have big clinical data.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
It takes about 24 hours to get this data.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
It takes about 24 hours to get this data.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
It can be useful when you sleep.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
It can be useful when you sleep.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
It can be useful when you sleep.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Heart rate...

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Heart rate...

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
Heart rate...

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
Heart rate...

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
It's basically when you wake up.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Can you tell if a person is healthy or sick?

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
It's from the data we get from these sensors.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
For example, a disease has a certain distribution in the data space of this sensor.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
So this is a very interesting question.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
Before wearable devices appeared,

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
it was basically completely blank.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
The information we can get in Sleep is very limited.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
However,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
there are some privileges at this stage of sleep.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
For example, when you sleep, your body basically doesn't move.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
It's great for sensors.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Because you have less noise in your daily life.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
For example, your motion noise.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Or when you do other things during the day, your heart rate suddenly changes.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
But when you sleep, it doesn't.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Some wearable sensors are already measuring

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
heart rate during rest and sleep.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
I'll show you some data later.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Location

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
It mainly depends on where our sensors can be placed in the body.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
This is a research done by Georgia Tech.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
It looks at how the motion impedance is affected

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
when your sensors are placed in various parts of the body.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
The motion impedance is when your sensors are placed in a specific body location.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
What impact does it have on your activity?

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
On the left is the male, on the right is the female.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
You can see that the range is a little different.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
You can see where our wearable devices are often placed.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
For example, the bowl.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
It's a good place to put it.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
This is another metric.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
It tells us

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
what sensor is most suitable for measuring

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
when it is placed in a specific location.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
For example,

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
the red bar

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
is used to measure whole body motion.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
It measures the movement of the whole body.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
You can imagine that your limbs are often moving.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But if you want to track the center of the body,

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
the red bar is used to measure the center of the body.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
For example, the joint stretch

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
is measured by the elbow and the knee joint.

14:10.000 --> 14:15.000
The last one is

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
where the sensor is placed.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
This is interesting.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
You can compare it with the two pictures.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
For example, many devices are placed in the wrist

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
or ankle.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
Next, I will talk about

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
the future of wearable devices.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
The trend is like this.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
From the era of personal computers,

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
the market trend is to reduce the size of the computer.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
From personal computers to portable devices,

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
to wearable devices.

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
The so-called computing unit

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
is getting closer to the body.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
The advantage is that you don't need much delay

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
to make computing.

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
This is the size of the market of wearable devices.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
This is the size of the market of wearable devices.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
This is the size of the market of wearable devices.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
At first, the market size was the largest.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
But when Apple Watch appeared,

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
it appeared around the middle of 2015.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
It immediately ate up the market share.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
From 2016 to 2017,

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
the largest was Apple Watch.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
The largest was Apple Watch.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
The largest was Apple Watch.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
The largest was Apple Watch.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
The next is the trend I imagine.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
From 2000, the so-called smartphone has appeared.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
In 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
In 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
PPG is a method of optical heart detection.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
PPG is a method of optical heart detection.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Motion is basically an accelerometer.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
ECG is a heart rate map.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
Blood pressure is basically easy to get information.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
Blood pressure is basically easy to get information.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
In the next 10 years,

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
In the next 10 years,

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
In the next 10 years,

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
In the next 10 years,

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
In the next 10 years,

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
In the next 10 years,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
In the next 10 years,

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
In the next 10 years,

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
In the next 10 years,

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
In the next 10 years,

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
In the next 10 years,

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
In the next 10 years,

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
In the next 10 years,

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
In the next 10 years,

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
In the next 10 years,

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
In the next 10 years,

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

20:15.000 --> 20:20.000
In the next 10 years,

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
In the next 10 years,

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
In the next 10 years,

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
In the next 10 years,

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
there may be some new wearable devices.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
In the next 10 years,
