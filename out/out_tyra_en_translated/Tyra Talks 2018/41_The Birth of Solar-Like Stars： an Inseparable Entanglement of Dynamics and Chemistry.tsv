0	19000	Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are approaching the end of the year, so we may not have a speech next week.
20000	28000	Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Yang Yaolun to tell us about his doctoral research.
28000	33000	Dr. Yang Yaolun is now a doctoral candidate for the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin.
33000	36000	In fact, he is about to graduate.
36000	42000	When he was in college, he graduated from the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin, and then came to the United States to study astronomy.
42000	55000	His specialties and research interests include early-phase star formation, including observations and simulations.
56000	66000	In his doctoral research career, he has used various telescopes such as Herschel, ALMA, and SOFIA to do his research.
66000	72000	What is interesting is that he is also the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.
72000	74000	What kind of event is this?
74000	85000	They will regularly give speeches to the public on astronomy at the bar.
85000	90000	They have now grown to more than 250 people attending each time.
90000	96000	Dr. Yang Yaolun is the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.
96000	109000	Today, he will talk about the topic of the birth of solar-like stars and the inseparable entanglement of dynamics and chemistry.
110000	120000	Let's welcome Dr. Yang Yaolun to give a speech.
120000	126000	Thank you.
126000	129000	I have been involved in this project for a long time.
129000	132000	I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you.
132000	141000	Over the past few years, I have been doing research on star formation at UT Austin.
141000	147000	I am a 6th-year PhD student at UT Austin.
147000	150000	My main advisor is Neil Evans.
150000	156000	We mainly do various observations on star formation.
156000	167000	We use models to explain the physical and chemical phenomena observed in early star formation.
167000	171000	Dr. Yang mentioned SOFIA observations.
171000	180000	What is SOFIA?
180000	186000	SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observations for Infrared Astronomy.
186000	192000	It is an astronomical observatory for infrared.
193000	196000	Why do we use SOFIA for infrared observation?
196000	199000	Because there are a lot of water vapors in the atmosphere.
199000	202000	These water vapors emit a lot of infrared rays.
202000	207000	When we observe on the ground, we only observe the water vapors on the earth.
207000	217000	So, many times, we use a telescope, such as Spitzer or Hubble, to observe infrared rays.
217000	228000	If I remember correctly, we can avoid 95% to 99% of water vapors by using a telescope.
228000	235000	This is SOFIA.
235000	241000	You can see that SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747.
241000	249000	You can see that there is a bulge in the middle section of the tail of the plane.
249000	250000	It is not very clear here.
250000	253000	It is a hole in the middle section.
253000	257000	A 2.7-meter telescope is placed in the hole.
257000	260000	When the telescope flies up, the door will open.
260000	261000	This is how it is observed.
261000	280000	Astronomers and technicians discuss how to make the observation easier to achieve and adjust the strategy in time.
280000	285000	This is how my advisor and I are going to get on the plane.
285000	287000	It is very different.
287000	289000	This is a military airport.
289000	294000	When you enter the airport, you will go up the stairs.
294000	301000	There is a B-2 bomber in the same airport.
301000	306000	This is the inside of SOFIA.
306000	313000	The blue part is the instrument.
314000	319000	The other side of the closed cabin is the telescope.
319000	321000	The other side of the telescope is the mirror.
321000	323000	The other side is the instrument.
323000	326000	There is a balance on the weight on both sides.
327000	342000	Different instruments, telescopes, and mission operators monitor the observation on these stations.
342000	345000	This is a very complicated task.
345000	360000	NASA considers every flight of SOFIA as a mission.
360000	362000	There is a mission director.
362000	367000	There is a mission briefing before departure.
367000	371000	This is the route we flew that day.
371000	376000	We flew from Palmdale, California, about an hour and a half north of LA.
376000	379000	You can see that the route is very strange.
379000	387000	Basically, the route is determined by each arc.
387000	390000	One arc is for a target.
390000	392000	Here we have six or seven targets.
392000	397000	The longer, the longer you stay on the celestial body.
398000	400000	Let's move on to today's topic.
400000	403000	Today's topic is mainly about star formation.
403000	414000	How do we understand the dynamics of early planetary orbits and the corresponding chemical changes?
414000	419000	This is a picture of our galaxy.
419000	424000	You can see a lot of these black irregularities in the middle.
424000	426000	This is what we call Darkland.
426000	429000	It has a lot of dust.
429000	431000	It is also a higher density place.
431000	434000	It is also an area where stars are forming.
434000	440000	If we zoom in to one of them, the Molecular Cloud,
440000	444000	It is mainly a star-forming place.
445000	449000	These black areas are also the so-called dust gathering areas.
449000	452000	It is a place where stars form early.
452000	456000	If we switch to infrared light,
456000	465000	You can see that there are a lot of these pillars or even what we call filamentary structures.
465000	473000	These are from what we imagine as a celestial sphere on Earth.
473000	477000	It's like a sphere in the sky, but it's not a ball or even a block here.
477000	481000	It's more like a texture or a filamentary structure.
481000	483000	Then through these filaments,
483000	489000	The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.
489000	491000	The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.
491000	495000	Then pull to the middle and then reach a high enough density.
495000	499000	Then trigger the activity of this star formation.
499000	505000	This is when the star formation occurs.
505000	507000	You will have a lot of.
507000	513000	Basically, the density will be from 10 to 3 or 10 to 5.
513000	517000	This is the mole per cubic centimeter.
517000	521000	It will be quickly multiplied by 10 to the power of 9 to the power of 10 to the power of 4.
521000	523000	This is a very large number of changes.
523000	527000	In the process, if you have, um.
527000	530000	At the beginning, um.
530000	532000	When the collapse, um.
532000	534000	You're going to have a little bit of, uh.
534000	536000	The angular momentum is in the outermost part.
536000	542000	If you have this smaller angular momentum, it's in a very small area.
542000	544000	It's going to be a lot of rotation.
544000	546000	It's going to be a lot of rotation.
546000	550000	At this time, the degree of rotation is likely to make this.
550000	554000	The collapse of the star formation is not very effective.
554000	556000	That is to say, your, uh.
556000	559000	The gas becomes itself to rotate there, not to continue.
559000	561000	Continue, uh.
561000	563000	It's sucked into the middle of the star.
563000	565000	In the process, there will be a lot of.
565000	567000	We call outflow, and then go.
567000	569000	Go to these, um.
569000	571000	The high-speed rotation of the matter is released.
571000	573000	And then go in to reduce.
573000	575000	The angular momentum of the whole system.
575000	577000	You see the green ones here.
577000	579000	The matter that looks like a jet is the outflow.
581000	583000	Now, this is a simulation.
583000	585000	That is, um, a simulation.
585000	588000	Roughly describe that we are from a filament.
588000	591000	And then slowly, uh, develop into.
591000	593000	It will start with a filament, and then zoom in.
593000	596000	And then you'll see a star.
596000	599000	The early shape of the star.
599000	601000	The situation is a lot of molecules.
601000	603000	Very, very fatal molecules.
603000	605000	How to be in that state.
605000	607000	And then, um.
607000	609000	Collapse and then erupt.
609000	611000	That's what you saw in the picture just now.
611000	613000	This kind of outflow.
618000	620000	OK, so you can see this whole process.
620000	622000	Is very, very.
622000	624000	Very big change, and then, um.
625000	627000	It's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.
627000	629000	Irregular structure.
629000	631000	So.
631000	633000	We also found in observation.
633000	635000	That's what it is.
635000	637000	You can see here, this one.
637000	639000	The picture behind this black and white picture is.
639000	641000	Uh, the distribution of molecules.
641000	642000	This is.
642000	644000	And then the different symbols in front of it.
644000	647000	It means that we are directly observed.
647000	648000	Early star.
648000	650000	Uh, where it appears.
650000	652000	You can see most of it.
652000	654000	Early stars are in, um.
654000	656000	These molecules.
656000	658000	Uh, it's also a more fatal place, so it's produced.
658000	660000	So, um.
660000	662000	We can probably get one of these.
662000	667000	Uh, scenario is to say that you first have a lot of very fatal clouds and dust.
667000	669000	And then through.
669000	674000	Um, these clouds and dust may slowly or even quickly.
674000	675000	Um.
675000	677000	It will collapse to the middle and then become.
677000	680000	Uh, a star or a few stars, I don't know.
680000	683000	So in this process, a very important thing is to say.
683000	687000	Oh, this is probably a very simple one.
687000	692000	Uh, cartoon pattern to express the words is that we have a, uh, a core at the beginning.
692000	693000	We call pre-stereo core.
693000	696000	Simply put, it's the core before the stellar.
696000	698000	So it's called pre-stereo core.
698000	700000	And then you start to collapse.
700000	703000	These core collapse to the middle and become, uh.
703000	706000	Uh, in the early days, it was called pro-star.
706000	708000	So we called this core pro-stereo core.
709000	711000	At the same time, it may, uh.
711000	712000	Um.
712000	714000	It produces a lot of, uh, these.
714000	717000	These flow, this orange side is called the flow.
717000	718000	What about the evolution?
718000	720000	These substances.
720000	724000	The surrounding matter is either sucked into the middle and becomes a part of the star.
724000	725000	Or.
725000	727000	It will be affected by a lot of feedback.
727000	728000	And then it just.
728000	730000	It's just slowly, uh, dissipated.
730000	732000	And then the rest of you are left with a disk.
732000	733000	Because.
733000	737000	There's still a lot of matter, um, in the middle.
737000	739000	The middle part of the high-speed rotation.
739000	741000	There's no way it's very direct.
741000	743000	It's sucked into the middle, uh, on the planet.
743000	745000	So there's a disk.
745000	746000	What about this side?
746000	748000	This disk is, um, planet.
748000	750000	It's where the stars are produced.
750000	753000	So gradually, this disk will slowly evolve into, uh.
753000	755000	Generally, we recognize the planter system.
755000	756000	Just like.
756000	759000	Our solar system, we may be somewhere here.
759000	761000	Okay, um.
761000	763000	So we, uh.
763000	766000	There's a pretty important one.
766000	768000	Uh, the question is, is this.
768000	771000	In the early days of this info, from this.
771000	773000	When you want to produce a pro star.
773000	774000	What?
774000	776000	Uh, it's like a process like this.
776000	779000	How much is his time scale?
779000	781000	Okay, um.
781000	784000	In the pre-status evolution, it's not quite certain now.
784000	786000	So basically.
786000	788000	Um.
788000	790000	If a core starts to collapse.
790000	792000	To become.
792000	795000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
795000	797000	Um.
797000	799000	It's about.
799000	802000	2 million years.
802000	804000	Relatively short.
804000	807000	From disk to disk, it's about 10 million years.
807000	813000	So then a, like our sun, our sun can probably live.
813000	815000	10 million years.
815000	818000	So this is probably their, maybe 1% of the time.
818000	823000	1% of the time.
823000	825000	Then I have another question.
825000	827000	Uh, that's it.
827000	830000	How do you say this?
830000	833000	Such a process.
833000	835000	With the limit, for example, is Modern Universe.
835000	838000	Or, for example, Z3, Z5.
838000	840000	Or something like that.
840000	843000	Or these things will only happen in the near future.
843000	845000	So there is no difference.
845000	848000	I'm going to ask you to go in.
848000	854000	Well, it's actually happening, but it's also happening in the early days.
854000	862000	There are even a lot of active research areas that are doing so-called first star, which is the first star that starts the earliest.
862000	865000	The biggest difference is in.
865000	866000	Uh.
866000	868000	It's in the cold, it's.
868000	869000	Um.
869000	874000	This core, a dance core, he wants to collapse, he doesn't need.
874000	875000	Uh.
875000	877000	It doesn't have to be dynamic.
877000	878000	If he is.
878000	879000	Uh.
879000	883000	The temperature is very high, he is very, his thermal motion is very strong, so he.
883000	889000	His thermal pressure, he can easily be greater than this gravity to him.
889000	891000	This middle attraction, so.
891000	894000	Um, when the temperature is very high, it is not easy to collapse.
894000	896000	So he has to be cold enough for him to collapse.
896000	898000	Of course, in the early universe.
898000	900000	Um, I should say, um.
900000	903000	So how do you make this core cold?
903000	907000	Usually a very important mechanism is called, uh, radio cooling.
907000	909000	Basically, uh.
909000	919000	Your energy, uh, is absorbed by molecules, and then molecules, molecules, decay, connect, decay, and then turn into radiation, radiation, and then your energy leaves this system.
919000	921000	So you, you will slowly become cold.
921000	923000	That molecule or.
923000	924000	Um.
925000	929000	It's more, except for hydrogen and hydrogen, all of them are quite useful for cooling.
929000	931000	That's relative to the early universe.
931000	932000	You will be weaker.
932000	937000	So, in the early universe, everyone will think that you can become very, you can become very big.
937000	941000	And then, and then it's easy to form a super big quality, etc.
941000	942000	And so on.
942000	948000	I believe that we haven't observed anything yet, but there should be a lot of simulation to do this part.
951000	952000	Okay, thank you.
954000	956000	Okay, so, um.
956000	961000	So, from an observational point of view, we want to know, uh, how does this collapse happen?
961000	964000	What kind of mold does this material go through?
964000	969000	From the outside of this core to the area that is transferred to the inside.
969000	973000	So, like, in this simulation, it's simulating.
973000	975000	How does this core collapse?
975000	977000	And then, in the end.
977000	982000	You can see that this middle collapse is very, very short at the beginning.
982000	985000	Compared to the time point after that.
985000	989000	So, uh, you can see that this is the same as the previous one.
989000	991000	You can see that it is very irregular.
991000	995000	And so it means that there may be a lot of structures in it.
995000	997000	Different structures, different modes.
997000	1001000	Depending on the angle you look at, there may be an outflow.
1001000	1003000	Other places may see info.
1004000	1006000	So, um.
1006000	1011000	For this info measurement, we mainly want to know how this info started.
1011000	1012000	And then how did he do it?
1012000	1014000	For example, how far is he?
1014000	1015000	How big is it?
1015000	1017000	What kind of size scale starts?
1017000	1019000	What kind of characteristic?
1019000	1022000	For example, how big does this core need to grow at what temperature?
1022000	1023000	He will start to have info.
1023000	1026000	So what's his process?
1026000	1028000	He's with, uh.
1028000	1030000	Uh, the radius is getting smaller and smaller.
1030000	1031000	How fast is it increasing?
1031000	1034000	Or even not increasing, so the radius is getting smaller and smaller.
1034000	1036000	It may be slower or faster inside.
1036000	1038000	So how did he evolve in the end?
1038000	1040000	It becomes the inside.
1040000	1043000	This rotation dominates the region.
1043000	1047000	It's like saying, uh, this disk, the early disk.
1047000	1049000	A region like that.
1049000	1054000	How did he go from the original radio info motion to the rotation?
1055000	1057000	So, uh.
1057000	1060000	Through this view, we want to know what the model of this info is.
1060000	1063000	We have a way to write a very good model.
1063000	1065000	To simulate this part.
1065000	1068000	And then there's this chemical change.
1068000	1070000	How to change with this info?
1070000	1073000	I'll talk a little bit more about this later.
1073000	1075000	So now I'm going to mention it.
1075000	1079000	And then in a bigger structure.
1079000	1084000	Uh, this info is actually for our so-called initial mass function.
1084000	1085000	Very important.
1085000	1086000	What is the initial mass function?
1086000	1088000	It's a bit like saying.
1088000	1091000	Uh, we're going to build a galaxy now.
1091000	1092000	Build a star.
1093000	1095000	The star of different quality, how much is the ratio?
1095000	1098000	So it's called initial mass function, and it's less likely to be large.
1098000	1102000	Small quality stars are more that this one.
1102000	1103000	Uh.
1103000	1106000	Mass distribution is the initial mass function.
1106000	1107000	Uh.
1107000	1112000	But these initial mass functions are mainly referring to the stars that have already been generated.
1112000	1114000	So we're in the early days.
1114000	1117000	In the morning, we really want to know, OK.
1117000	1122000	If we have all of these, big, big, small, small, different sizes of core,
1122000	1124000	What kind of traces will these cores become?
1124000	1130000	The core mass distribution between them and the initial mass distribution and the star mass distribution.
1130000	1132000	Uh, what's the change?
1132000	1137000	So we hope to get to know this model in the future.
1137000	1138000	Can be.
1138000	1143000	There are some hints that say, OK, if we have a core, it may be a solar quality.
1143000	1146000	That may be how much of it will become, uh.
1146000	1148000	How much of the middle star will be 3?
1148000	1153000	So, do we hope that we can use this model to do this research?
1153000	1156000	Go to approach the problem.
1156000	1162000	How do we go from this blue core mass function to this dash line, all kinds of different dash lines?
1162000	1163000	Uh, initial mass function.
1165000	1168000	The other thing is that we're in the early days.
1168000	1170000	Uh, these are a lot of binary systems.
1170000	1175000	And in the general, uh, already formed, we know, uh.
1175000	1180000	Most of the stars are binary, that is, uh, double stars or more.
1180000	1181000	Uh, multiple system.
1181000	1183000	So we saw that in the early days.
1183000	1189000	So you want to know how this early star is how to form this kind of binary system.
1189000	1193000	So what's the impact of this binary system on this info?
1193000	1197000	Or what kind of criteria do you want to reach?
1197000	1200000	What kind of threshold will trigger this kind of fragmentation?
1200000	1205000	Fragment into different two or three or more sources.
1207000	1208000	So we want to know.
1208000	1211000	Uh, this initial condition, what is it?
1211000	1212000	How big is it?
1212000	1214000	How much is its quality?
1214000	1217000	So I hope we can get to know how much.
1217000	1219000	How much mass will be in the middle?
1219000	1221000	How much will be in the middle?
1223000	1225000	Okay, so this is another one.
1225000	1227000	This is a very neat system.
1227000	1229000	It has three, three, three stars in the middle.
1229000	1231000	And then you look at the structure.
1231000	1234000	So we still don't know why it's like this.
1235000	1237000	Okay, the other part is.
1237000	1242000	Hey, we're like this, this MWC480, this, this disk.
1242000	1244000	You see a lot of this kind of structure.
1244000	1246000	Very neat structure.
1246000	1250000	But we also see a lot of different, uh, more complex molecules.
1250000	1254000	Like this CH3N or this is different.
1254000	1255000	Um.
1255000	1258000	Uh, more large-molecule organic compounds.
1258000	1261000	So, uh, we were in the early, uh.
1261000	1264000	The core stage also saw a lot of these, uh, organic compounds.
1264000	1265000	So these.
1266000	1270000	Organic compounds, because organic compounds, ultimately, they will become.
1270000	1273000	It will enter the interstitial atmosphere, and then it may be.
1273000	1275000	Trigger, uh.
1275000	1278000	The main part of the life cycle, because these organic compounds are.
1278000	1279000	Maybe it's just.
1279000	1282000	In addition to speaking more broadly, it may be.
1282000	1285000	Even the first step of life, or even the seed of life.
1286000	1289000	So we want to know that in the early star evolution process.
1289000	1292000	How do these chemistries change with the information?
1292000	1296000	Um, the same, I'm going to do a lot of explanation in the back.
1299000	1302000	Okay, so our goal is to find out how this information happened.
1302000	1305000	Then we are in our current method.
1305000	1309000	We are, uh, want to measure, uh, through the distribution of molecules to measure, uh.
1310000	1313000	Uh, the performance of, uh.
1314000	1317000	Kinematic structure is simply through.
1317000	1320000	Its distribution of, uh.
1320000	1323000	To analyze that in the end, his, uh, we look at this.
1323000	1326000	The path of the movement of the gas inside.
1326000	1328000	What does it look like?
1328000	1331000	Here, if we look at it from this antenna,
1331000	1334000	This is a very simplified one on the left.
1334000	1337000	Um, the look of the core info.
1337000	1340000	One of the more common models is the middle.
1340000	1343000	Info's velocity is higher, and the outside info's velocity is lower.
1343000	1346000	So you can simplify this thing to the right.
1346000	1349000	This picture is like this.
1349000	1352000	Uh, the red one is, um.
1352000	1355000	Uh, the red one is, um.
1355000	1358000	This, uh, the red one is, um.
1358000	1361000	We've seen the path.
1361000	1364000	Because he has this radio motion, so you can.
1364000	1367000	Um, you can draw a circle like this.
1367000	1370000	A trace, and then they, um.
1370000	1375000	The line of sight above the two points is the same.
1375000	1378000	It means that you will have two, you will have two groups of gas.
1378000	1381000	And then they, for you, his, uh.
1381000	1384000	What is it called?
1384000	1387000	The speed is the same.
1387000	1390000	But they are in different places.
1390000	1393000	Uh, this will cause, uh.
1393000	1396000	He will look like he's on the left.
1396000	1399000	A profile like this.
1399000	1402000	Um, yeah, that's about it.
1402000	1405000	And then, and then the middle of this, this is the dip.
1405000	1408000	It's just, it's just, it's from the outside.
1408000	1411000	Um, gas in your, maybe it's a cold gas.
1411000	1414000	It's a strong radiation that comes in behind the absorption.
1414000	1417000	Because you're cold in front of you, so you're more likely to be excited.
1417000	1420000	Then you will be absorbed by this cold material.
1420000	1423000	So you see a dip.
1423000	1426000	Um, if you have a higher resolution.
1426000	1429000	You can see, uh, like this.
1429000	1432000	It's like this, if this purple, this.
1432000	1435000	Shady area refers to our telescope beam.
1435000	1438000	Uh, you can see the cold gas outside.
1438000	1441000	Uh, gas, but it's still, uh, moving to the center.
1441000	1444000	It's still falling on to the center.
1444000	1447000	That kind of, uh, cold gas will give you one.
1447000	1450000	It's not in the deep, it's not in, uh.
1450000	1453000	Source velocity of an absorption.
1453000	1456000	Because he's still far away from you.
1456000	1459000	And then he's going to make this redshift absorption on the right.
1459000	1462000	That's basically the profile we want to see.
1462000	1465000	We want to measure a profile like this.
1465000	1468000	And then, um.
1468000	1471000	And then when you, uh, in the back, we have this in the middle.
1471000	1474000	Every collapsing star will have one in the middle.
1474000	1477000	Um, continuous source, he might be.
1477000	1480000	Uh, this is the hottest place in there.
1480000	1483000	The temperature is very high.
1483000	1486000	Maybe it's a few thousand degrees.
1486000	1489000	Then he just gives you a very strong black body radiation.
1489000	1492000	So if you put it on, this radiation, this, um.
1492000	1495000	Radiation continuous radiation will also be absorbed by the cold material in front.
1495000	1498000	It's the radiation that's going to be absorbed.
1498000	1501000	So in the end, you're going to get something like this.
1501000	1504000	This kind of continuous, originally your continuous may be flat.
1504000	1507000	But in the middle of this part, uh, because you have material in.
1507000	1510000	Away from you in this velocity, so you'll be a part of it.
1510000	1513000	It's absorbed, so you actually see it.
1513000	1516000	Uh, observation is observed in your telescope.
1516000	1519000	It will probably look like this.
1520000	1523000	So, of course, if we're in, uh, according to this.
1523000	1526000	The two front and back ends of the continuum.
1526000	1529000	Go to it.
1529000	1532000	When you correct the continuum, you'll get this.
1532000	1535000	It's a strange one.
1535000	1538000	We'll see, uh, the middle absorption is.
1538000	1541000	Less than 0.
1541000	1544000	That's actually not because we assume the continuum in the middle.
1544000	1547000	Still, uh.
1548000	1551000	On the surface, it's part of it.
1551000	1554000	So we basically want to measure a line profile like this.
1554000	1557000	And then analyze it like this line profile.
1557000	1560000	To understand that we, uh, uh.
1560000	1563000	I've seen the inside of this line of sight.
1563000	1566000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
1569000	1572000	I want to ask a question.
1572000	1575000	Hey, that.
1575000	1578000	Why is that profile?
1578000	1581000	That is, these profiles are not symmetrical to that.
1585000	1588000	OK, OK, this is the part I just skipped.
1588000	1590000	Uh.
1590000	1593000	OK, if we go back to the two circles on the right, this picture.
1593000	1596000	Um, in the middle, I write this high high temperature.
1596000	1599000	The place is more central.
1599000	1602000	And then on both sides, uh.
1602000	1605000	Large radius is the place where the temperature is lower.
1605000	1608000	Then you can imagine it as, um, in this.
1608000	1611000	Uh.
1611000	1614000	In your foreground, in front of you, your foreground is your red.
1614000	1617000	The foreground material is basically redshift.
1617000	1620000	That is, it is falling to the center, so it is redshift to you.
1620000	1623000	But in this redshift part, you will have.
1623000	1626000	Um, high temperature is behind.
1626000	1629000	Low temperature is in front.
1629000	1632000	It means that you are more like you have a cold thing in front of a hot thing.
1632000	1635000	So this cold thing will absorb the back.
1635000	1638000	The hot gas gives you the radiation.
1638000	1641000	Uh, but in the blue shift part, it is in the back side of the envelope.
1641000	1644000	You will, you, you don't have this situation.
1644000	1647000	It is the cold material behind the hot material.
1647000	1650000	So you don't have this kind of self-absorption.
1650000	1653000	So this is why the redshift peak.
1653000	1656000	Will be lower.
1657000	1663000	Why is that the same shape in Continuum is not symmetrical.
1663000	1666000	Because continuum is continuum, only in the middle.
1666000	1671000	If you imagine it is a radiation from the very last look of the Curtain.
1671000	1674000	I went to the middle, so I got the continent.
1674000	1677000	So continue only in, only in RTS part is absorbed because of the continent.
1677000	1680000	In front of it, there is no material of BlueSchi Photo.
1680000	1683000	Oh, I see.
1683000	1686000	Ok, thank you.
1686000	1694000	Yes, so about 20 years ago, people started to measure this kind of profile.
1694000	1697000	Then this is usually measured with a radio wave network.
1697000	1700000	That was usually used in the past.
1700000	1703000	It's like the small ears we usually think of.
1703000	1704000	Or is it bigger?
1704000	1707000	Maybe it's a 10-meter network mirror or a 10-meter dish.
1707000	1709000	Then measure these different molecules.
1709000	1712000	Then try to measure the profile just now.
1712000	1713000	Then you can see here.
1713000	1717000	The first one, in addition to the sensitivity, is not very good.
1717000	1719000	There are a lot of different structures.
1719000	1720000	It has a lot of this kind of broad profile.
1720000	1723000	Or even you don't have a very obvious absorption.
1723000	1726000	Even the most important thing is that you don't have less than 0.
1726000	1727000	The so-called no less than 0.
1727000	1732000	The most important thing is that this absorption is very likely to be.
1732000	1734000	Uh, you're in front of this source.
1734000	1737000	Other completely unrelated clouds to you.
1737000	1738000	Caused absorption.
1738000	1740000	You can't test it.
1740000	1742000	Uh, is this absorption real?
1742000	1744000	It belongs to what you see now.
1744000	1746000	If you can see this absorption.
1746000	1747000	Uh.
1749000	1750000	Drop to 0.
1750000	1752000	If it becomes negative.
1752000	1755000	You can find a way to move your telescope's beam.
1755000	1757000	Then you can say, OK, if I move away from the middle.
1757000	1759000	This has a continuum source.
1759000	1762000	See if there's any change in this absorption.
1762000	1764000	You can be more sure.
1764000	1767000	When is it confirmed that this absorbent material is associated with?
1767000	1771000	The audience is the core that you can see.
1771000	1775000	So that because the relationship between decisions and the ability to ask.
1775000	1780000	Uh, this question, about 20 years ago, was studied widely, and maybe 5 to 10 years later.
1780000	1782000	Everyone thinks this okay, it's almost done.
1782000	1785000	You can't just keep doing it, so just wait.
1785000	1786000	Um.
1786000	1789000	Uh, new generation, the voltage waves of thisicated.
1789000	1792000	Power garage to not be able to have a better optimization result.
1793000	1794000	So what is Oma?
1794000	1796000	Oma is, uh.
1796000	1799000	Uh, Akitama Large Millimeter Sub-millimeter Array.
1799000	1804000	It is a wireless wave array on the Akitama Desert plateau in Chile.
1804000	1805000	Then.
1805000	1807000	He mainly.
1807000	1811000	There should be 66 antennas, which is probably like the bigger antenna outside.
1811000	1815000	Each antenna is a 12 meter antenna, and there is a smaller one in the middle.
1815000	1817000	Another, uh, separate array.
1817000	1818000	Uh, it's 7 meters.
1818000	1819000	Then he is.
1819000	1822000	Uh, he's basically a whole world.
1822000	1825000	A collaboration, the United States is NRAO.
1825000	1827000	Oh, that's not NRAO, that's NRC.
1827000	1830000	NRC is Canada's National Research Council.
1830000	1833000	Then Japan's NLJ, Europe's ESO.
1833000	1836000	Taiwan is A, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
1836000	1837000	Uh, there's participation.
1837000	1839000	And then there's Chile.
1839000	1842000	And then this is open to the world.
1842000	1843000	Um.
1843000	1845000	Astronomers can apply to observe.
1845000	1847000	Then he mainly.
1847000	1851000	Uh, the biggest bonus is that he can have a very, very good resolution.
1851000	1852000	His.
1852000	1854000	He can see very, very small things.
1854000	1856000	Then basically the array is.
1856000	1861000	Uh, the telescope is, uh, your resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by.
1861000	1862000	Uh, you, you.
1862000	1864000	The diameter of your telescope.
1864000	1867000	The wireless wave array is simply a mirror.
1867000	1868000	Cut.
1868000	1871000	Cut into a lot of little ones.
1871000	1872000	Uh, a different telescope.
1872000	1876000	Then, so you can pull the two telescope very far as a telescope to use.
1876000	1879000	So, like this, the biggest of this.
1879000	1881000	Uh, baseline is called baseline.
1881000	1884000	Simply put, his diameter can be up to 15, 15 kilometers.
1884000	1887000	Yes, it can be analyzed to a very small area.
1887000	1897000	Ok, then, at the beginning of this, we started with two more similar profiles that we just drew at the beginning.
1897000	1899000	Like the left side, this is a.
1899000	1904000	This is a, uh, organic molecule, uh, Chinese, what is this English Miso?
1904000	1905000	Uh.
1905000	1911000	This is the appearance, you can see, if we, uh.
1911000	1918000	After taking the continuum off, you can see this absorption is enough, and then you can see his, uh, absorption.
1918000	1919000	Redshift.
1919000	1925000	And then in the same way, in this other source, we also see the same thing.
1926000	1929000	Uh, but in these two cases.
1929000	1934000	These are still relatively small, because the first one, like the left one, is an organic molecule, so his.
1934000	1938000	He may, uh, in those early stars, uh.
1938000	1940000	The abundance is not so high.
1940000	1943000	Uh, not much, so the image is relatively weak.
1943000	1952000	Then, like the source on the right, it is a relatively, uh, darker source, so his continuum is not so high, so his absorption is relatively small.
1953000	1961000	Then, in my main research, I mainly want to use, uh, the target, the other, which is the B, H, R, 71.
1961000	1966000	Then go to understand, see if we can measure a better, uh.
1966000	1971000	Uh, the signature of the infor, which is the double peak, and then analyze it.
1971000	1977000	Then he is also a very isolated, uh, early, uh.
1977000	1984000	Uh, and then if you look at it in the optical band, it's a black thing, basically all of it.
1984000	1987000	Uh, all kinds of dust, uh, and gas.
1987000	1990000	Then, in the infor, you can see that he has a beautiful outflow.
1990000	1992000	In the radio, you can also see a beautiful outflow.
1992000	1994000	He actually has two sources in the middle.
1994000	1999000	Then, here, we just focus on the RS1, which is the main source.
2000000	2005000	Ok, then we are in Alma cycle 4, so we propose, and then we get our data.
2005000	2009000	It looks like the right side, which is very much like the way it was drawn before.
2009000	2015000	Especially this HCL plus, this curve is basically the same as the front.
2015000	2018000	Then you can see here, although, um.
2018000	2025000	This absorption is very wide, but you can probably see that he is actually in, uh.
2025000	2030000	Redshift velocity still has a lot of absorption, which proves that he is actually part of it.
2030000	2035000	It comes from, um, the middle, uh, those who are really falling in the gas.
2035000	2037000	To produce absorption.
2038000	2040000	That, uh.
2041000	2043000	Ok, then we need to analyze this curve.
2043000	2046000	We actually need to use one.
2046000	2049000	We can't just read it out of this.
2050000	2055000	Absorption is in, maybe it's in 0.5 kilometers per second, and then you'll know.
2055000	2060000	Uh, I, you might know there's something in 0.5 kilometers per second falling in.
2060000	2065000	But you don't know if he's in, you've seen this line of sight in which place.
2065000	2070000	That, uh, because you have absorption and emission mixed together.
2070000	2074000	So we have to, um, use a very common technique in astronomy.
2074000	2077000	The technique is ready to transfer the calculation to find a way.
2077000	2081000	Um, to model the curve we see.
2082000	2088000	That way to transfer, simply put, uh, if I'm here now, every one of these, this, this.
2088000	2091000	The shape is a, a, a, a gas.
2091000	2094000	All right, you may have radiation on the left.
2094000	2100000	Come in, and the radiation will be in the gas, it may be absorbed by the research, your research will become weak.
2100000	2105000	Or after you have been absorbed, or you, you, this, this gas is actually very hot.
2105000	2110000	So he has some, uh, he has some black radiation, or he has some of his own radiation.
2110000	2112000	So you, he may have, there will be a mission.
2112000	2117000	So, in these energy transitions, he may be part of it.
2117000	2122000	It becomes the temperature of this gas, or, uh, inside the excite.
2122000	2124000	The level population of different molecules.
2154000	2159000	Your mother from the beginning to the end, and then you can know from the inside.
2159000	2160000	Uh.
2160000	2165000	Radiation to the end, uh, we observed what it should look like.
2165000	2168000	And then, uh, through, uh.
2168000	2175000	The process of more than once, and then to get a better model to explain what we saw in front of us.
2177000	2180000	So, in fact, what we do is very, um.
2180000	2183000	It's tedious, but it's also, um.
2185000	2186000	Um.
2186000	2191000	It's actually okay, it's actually not that tedious, but it's a lot of iteration, a lot of iterative process.
2191000	2196000	Basically, after we have a model, we can get it, we can say, okay, our, our.
2196000	2198000	What does the density of the envelope look like?
2198000	2199000	Um.
2199000	2202000	Info this, uh, velocity should look like.
2202000	2207000	We can throw it into, uh, different radio transfer models to do.
2207000	2210000	Uh, this is where we separate gas and dust.
2210000	2212000	Because basically.
2212000	2213000	Um.
2213000	2216000	First of all, we use, uh, dust.
2216000	2219000	Uh, it's the continuation of the part of the register.
2219000	2221000	Go to, uh.
2221000	2224000	To constrain this whole envelope structure.
2224000	2226000	For example, this envelope.
2226000	2228000	Uh, his, uh.
2228000	2229000	What is the density?
2229000	2231000	So, uh, what is the change in the radius?
2231000	2234000	How much does he stand behind this?
2234000	2235000	His.
2235000	2237000	Uh, what is the angle?
2237000	2239000	How much is it?
2239000	2242000	Then, when we determine this envelope structure.
2242000	2245000	Let's put it in again.
2245000	2247000	And then we'll figure out that we're okay.
2247000	2250000	If we follow this structure, we'll get the spectrum.
2250000	2251000	What should it look like?
2253000	2257000	Okay, so, uh, this is what we did before, uh, the model.
2257000	2259000	And then here, uh.
2259000	2261000	See this is, uh.
2261000	2263000	That is.
2263000	2265000	The spectrum of BHS 1.
2265000	2267000	That's behind this.
2267000	2269000	The gray line is the spectrum.
2269000	2271000	And then this is probably.
2271000	2274000	Uh, 2 microns, 3 microns, up to.
2274000	2277000	Up to 1 millimeter range.
2277000	2278000	And then.
2279000	2280000	Uh.
2281000	2283000	The blue circle is our model.
2283000	2286000	And then the red square is the observation.
2286000	2288000	And then you see most of us.
2288000	2289000	We just fit through this.
2289000	2292000	To fit, we put the model fit to the observation.
2292000	2294000	And then we'll get a.
2294000	2297000	Uh, a better model to describe this envelope.
2297000	2299000	For example, I drew it like this here.
2299000	2301000	But actually, how do we construct this?
2301000	2304000	How much is his output angle?
2304000	2306000	What is the density distribution of the envelope?
2309000	2311000	Okay, so you don't have to say.
2311000	2313000	It's more like it's coming out of the outflow.
2313000	2315000	And then the long way is coming out of the envelope.
2316000	2318000	Okay, and then.
2318000	2322000	Uh, I said earlier that we're going to take this envelope structure.
2322000	2325000	Plus, uh, we can think of a way to model this.
2325000	2328000	Uh, but in fact, one of the very, very important.
2328000	2330000	Uh, the factor is chemistry.
2330000	2332000	So the chemistry is not.
2332000	2335000	Uh, well, so the chemistry is not just thinking, okay.
2335000	2337000	What are you going to have?
2337000	2339000	And it's this kind of molecule.
2339000	2342000	Is it possible to exist in that kind of condition?
2343000	2346000	In the atmosphere, you can see it, especially in.
2346000	2349000	Um, these dense core, the density in the middle is very high.
2349000	2351000	And then the temperature is quite low.
2351000	2354000	So it's possible to be frozen on top of these dust.
2354000	2356000	Then if it freezes, you, you, you.
2356000	2358000	You can't do it in him.
2358000	2360000	You expect the atmosphere to give you a curve.
2360000	2362000	And see that this is.
2362000	2364000	So there's a different chemical abundance profile.
2364000	2366000	You might be out there, you might have.
2366000	2370000	Uh, the radiation from other places might take you.
2370000	2372000	By H, this is an example of H.
2372000	2374000	You might let him.
2374000	2377000	It's a separation of two different things, or it's.
2377000	2380000	In there, he might be frozen on top of the dust.
2380000	2382000	Or in this one, he's going to be with some, uh.
2382000	2384000	Active molecules interact with each other, and then.
2384000	2386000	Produce fat particles, and then he disappears.
2386000	2388000	So you can't measure it.
2388000	2390000	So in the middle, we're going to.
2390000	2392000	Mainly, like I've been in.
2392000	2394000	Uh, it's been a long time.
2394000	2396000	It takes a while to say what we're going to do.
2396000	2398000	A relatively good abundance profile.
2398000	2400000	To explain our data.
2402000	2404000	So, uh.
2404000	2406000	Basically, we need to understand this kind of info profile.
2406000	2408000	Uh, we're going to take our dust model.
2408000	2410000	You can get density, temperature, and velocity.
2410000	2412000	And then we add our.
2412000	2414000	Chemical abundance.
2414000	2416000	The, uh.
2416000	2418000	We're going to find a way.
2418000	2420000	Uh, get a spectrum.
2420000	2422000	If you don't feel good, we'll go back.
2422000	2424000	Modify and change, so this is very.
2424000	2426000	Uh, a long one.
2426000	2428000	Uh, the process.
2428000	2430000	Uh, this is us.
2430000	2432000	Uh, hey.
2432000	2434000	Um, uh, yeah, that's good.
2434000	2436000	The front is almost the same.
2436000	2438000	That's my question.
2438000	2440000	Um, like this, like this, like this.
2440000	2442000	It's a relatively small system.
2442000	2444000	Uh, that kind of info.
2444000	2446000	Or the final outflow.
2446000	2448000	The distribution of gravity.
2448000	2450000	It's all about, uh, normal.
2450000	2452000	That matter is good.
2452000	2454000	If there is a dark matter, he has a way.
2454000	2456000	It doesn't really matter.
2456000	2458000	It doesn't really matter.
2458000	2460000	And.
2460000	2462000	I'm not sure if it's early.
2462000	2464000	Early universe will be affected.
2464000	2466000	But at least in the modern universe.
2466000	2468000	Uh, the general assumption should be dark matter.
2468000	2470000	Mainly in the outer galaxy.
2470000	2472000	It's in the black building.
2472000	2474000	So I rarely.
2474000	2476000	I heard that.
2476000	2478000	Uh, dark matter will affect.
2478000	2480000	It's the evolution of these.
2480000	2482000	At least in the.
2482000	2484000	In the region.
2484000	2486000	So I don't think there's much.
2486000	2488000	Big impression.
2488000	2490000	Uh, because I.
2490000	2492000	My idea is like this.
2492000	2494000	If today, in some of those.
2494000	2496000	Dark matter can be strong with them.
2496000	2498000	Interacting, then there will be some small.
2498000	2500000	Small structure, for example.
2500000	2502000	Is a relatively clumpy phenomenon.
2502000	2504000	Uh, maybe.
2504000	2506000	Can be constrained, but I don't think so.
2506000	2508000	I can't see it.
2508000	2510000	Yeah, I guess I can't see it.
2510000	2512000	If you have a big.
2512000	2514000	It should be very, very small.
2514000	2516000	That's probably like a micro lens.
2516000	2518000	You're looking at things.
2518000	2520000	So.
2520000	2522000	Uh, so I'm going to be like this.
2522000	2524000	A system should be able to see it.
2524000	2526000	The current observation.
2526000	2528000	The relationship should be.
2528000	2530000	Very far away.
2530000	2532000	Maybe there will be, but it's hard.
2532000	2534000	Yeah.
2534000	2536000	Okay, thank you.
2536000	2538000	So, uh.
2538000	2540000	Like this, like me.
2540000	2542000	This model is our latest.
2542000	2544000	This is the latest model we got.
2544000	2546000	Actually, it was about two days ago.
2546000	2548000	Uh, uh, on the right.
2548000	2550000	Uh, blue is our data.
2550000	2552000	Then orange is our current model.
2552000	2554000	Then you see our model.
2554000	2556000	Roughly capture is data.
2556000	2558000	The feeling.
2558000	2560000	But you can see, for example, in Russian.
2560000	2562000	We still miss a lot of emissions.
2562000	2564000	So, uh.
2564000	2566000	This is this is actually.
2566000	2568000	Now.
2568000	2570000	In the future, we should continue to do more.
2570000	2572000	Uh, different tuning, and then even.
2572000	2574000	To understand that there is no way to make up.
2574000	2576000	Uh, to make up for this part.
2576000	2578000	Missing mission.
2578000	2580000	Uh, to understand that it is possible to say.
2580000	2582000	Um.
2582000	2584000	Of course, our current model is very, very.
2584000	2586000	Symmetry is basically a.
2586000	2588000	Symmetry model.
2588000	2590000	Um.
2590000	2592000	The first one is to understand that, okay.
2592000	2594000	Under this very strong assumption.
2594000	2596000	Is there any way to make this model better?
2596000	2598000	What if it doesn't work?
2598000	2600000	How do we break this?
2600000	2602000	This assumption.
2602000	2604000	And it won't cause too much.
2604000	2606000	The freedom.
2606000	2608000	Okay, you can say whatever you want.
2608000	2610000	Um.
2610000	2612000	So, uh, this is probably the future.
2612000	2614000	The main thing to do in the next month or two.
2614000	2616000	That's on the left.
2616000	2618000	This picture is.
2618000	2620000	Basically, it's like.
2620000	2622000	Uh, if you look at.
2622000	2624000	The mission map.
2624000	2626000	Then if you take the middle continent.
2626000	2628000	It's like this.
2628000	2630000	The dark place in the middle is the continent.
2630000	2632000	After being removed, it causes a very strong absorption.
2632000	2634000	Just like the right side, you see this very strong absorption.
2634000	2636000	So when you get close, you will become negative.
2636000	2638000	And then up and down like this.
2638000	2640000	This bright spot is because.
2640000	2642000	Uh, you have all flow, so all flow is up.
2642000	2644000	Uh, up and down, this, this, this direction.
2644000	2646000	So, uh.
2646000	2648000	Uh.
2648000	2650000	Uh, the density is relatively low, so it is easier to be heated.
2650000	2652000	So it's brighter.
2652000	2654000	Ok, then.
2654000	2656000	Why do you say this?
2656000	2658000	Info will affect this chemistry?
2658000	2660000	That is to say.
2660000	2662000	Uh, simply put, if there is a group, a group of gas.
2662000	2664000	Now he, he is from.
2664000	2666000	Um, this envelope.
2666000	2668000	The outer circumference keeps traveling.
2668000	2670000	You are affected by the infogravity.
2670000	2672000	You can't travel to the middle.
2672000	2674000	And then falling to this star or disk.
2674000	2676000	It will pass through the middle.
2676000	2678000	Different temperatures.
2678000	2680000	The middle may be getting hotter and hotter.
2680000	2682000	Basically, it's getting hotter and hotter.
2682000	2684000	Because there is a pro star in the middle.
2684000	2686000	Pro star is emitting a very strong emission.
2686000	2688000	That, but this info.
2688000	2690000	This chemistry is determined by.
2690000	2692000	Say, ok, I have this, this group of gas.
2692000	2694000	This group of gas will be at different temperatures.
2694000	2696000	How long will it take?
2696000	2698000	If he is very slow.
2698000	2700000	Then he may spend a long time in every place.
2700000	2702000	That or even.
2702000	2704000	He may spend more time in the lower temperature.
2704000	2706000	Or at a higher temperature.
2706000	2708000	That will affect.
2708000	2710000	Uh, at different temperatures, it will affect.
2710000	2712000	Um.
2712000	2714000	It should be said that at different temperatures.
2714000	2716000	The chemical reaction you can produce is different.
2716000	2718000	That, and every chemical reaction.
2718000	2720000	The time scale is also different.
2720000	2722000	If you are at low temperature, although you have a lot.
2722000	2724000	Low temperature chemical reactions can be produced.
2724000	2726000	But if you just spend it at low temperature.
2726000	2728000	Very short time, then those reactions.
2728000	2730000	Will not be for, um.
2730000	2732000	The chemical state of these molecules.
2732000	2734000	Uh.
2734000	2736000	The state has caused any change.
2736000	2738000	What about the other way?
2738000	2740000	To see is to say.
2740000	2742000	Um, we are actually using these molecules.
2742000	2744000	The.
2744000	2746000	The radiation to go.
2746000	2748000	To trace this.
2748000	2750000	The envelope inside the dynamic.
2750000	2752000	If we don't understand which side of the road.
2752000	2754000	These molecules are sometimes our interpretation.
2754000	2756000	It will become incorrect.
2756000	2758000	That.
2758000	2760000	Another point is what I said before.
2760000	2762000	Uh, the evolution of the dynamic code.
2762000	2764000	Will affect you.
2764000	2766000	What is the chemical reaction you can produce?
2766000	2768000	So these two are a bit like interaction.
2768000	2770000	It's like being tied together.
2770000	2772000	It's hard for you to separate one from each other.
2774000	2776000	That's to say here.
2776000	2778000	At different, for example, at low temperature.
2778000	2780000	You may have a lot of free.
2780000	2782000	You have a lot of deterioration.
2782000	2784000	H will become very low.
2784000	2786000	Then, more.
2786000	2788000	So-called medium tension.
2788000	2790000	You will have a lot on the surface of this dust.
2790000	2792000	Different chemical reactions.
2792000	2794000	That will cause the chemistry.
2794000	2796000	The people who do the chemical model will tell you.
2796000	2798000	That this may produce different species.
2798000	2800000	Different species.
2800000	2802000	Now, at high temperature.
2802000	2804000	When it comes to Kelvin.
2804000	2806000	Uh, you used to be.
2806000	2808000	The ice is frozen on the dust.
2808000	2810000	These molecules may all come out because the temperature has risen.
2810000	2812000	So it will affect us.
2812000	2814000	What you see is different.
2814000	2816000	Or at different temperatures.
2816000	2818000	There will be different changes.
2818000	2820000	Well, basically, uh.
2820000	2822000	There will be two in the early stars.
2822000	2824000	There are currently two different types of observations.
2824000	2826000	Uh, source, one is called.
2826000	2828000	Uh, the other is.
2828000	2830000	One carbon molecule source.
2830000	2832000	That's basically it.
2832000	2834000	His original meaning is.
2834000	2836000	It represents his small hot core.
2836000	2838000	What is the hot core?
2838000	2840000	It is a relatively large-capacity source.
2840000	2842000	He may be.
2842000	2844000	100, 1000, even a few thousand.
2844000	2846000	Uh, the sun.
2846000	2848000	A source.
2848000	2850000	Uh, we've been observing for a long time.
2850000	2852000	Oh, in these sources.
2852000	2854000	You'll see a lot of mess.
2854000	2856000	Different organic molecules.
2856000	2858000	So this kind of.
2858000	2860000	The source is classified.
2860000	2862000	It's classified as a hot core.
2862000	2864000	Because he doesn't have to be hot enough.
2864000	2866000	These molecules will become gas.
2866000	2868000	Let you be observed.
2868000	2870000	So the hot core is.
2870000	2872000	We observe similar chemical states.
2872000	2874000	A lot of organic molecules.
2874000	2876000	It's a relatively low quality.
2876000	2878000	Little quality.
2878000	2880000	Uh, 0.5 to.
2880000	2882000	Uh, 10.
2882000	2884000	Uh, range.
2884000	2886000	That's another one.
2886000	2888000	One carbon molecule source is.
2888000	2890000	Uh, in the same process.
2890000	2892000	We found.
2892000	2894000	Uh, there's another kind of source.
2894000	2896000	Um, he doesn't have a lot of this.
2896000	2898000	He still has a lot of organic molecules.
2898000	2900000	It doesn't look like this.
2900000	2902000	Uh, so-called.
2902000	2904000	Uh, long convention means that he has a lot of carbon.
2904000	2906000	One by one.
2906000	2908000	So you might see something like C2H.
2908000	2910000	C4H or something.
2910000	2912000	C7H.
2912000	2914000	These carbons are both.
2914000	2916000	Maybe it's a double or three.
2916000	2918000	Three pieces together.
2918000	2920000	He can have a lot of carbon stuck together.
2920000	2922000	And then you don't have any other hydrogen atoms.
2922000	2924000	Or other different atoms.
2924000	2926000	That, um, in.
2926000	2928000	Hot core, you know, these saturated molecules.
2928000	2930000	It means that these points.
2930000	2932000	The square or triangle is opened to pick up different functional groups.
2932000	2934000	Then produce different organic molecules.
2934000	2936000	That's in chemistry.
2936000	2938000	Um.
2938000	2940000	Their, uh, their formation path is different.
2940000	2942000	So now it's.
2942000	2944000	Uh, everyone.
2944000	2946000	From the model, from the control.
2946000	2948000	Try to characterize it.
2948000	2950000	Is the first one really true?
2950000	2952000	Or is it just that we see two different extremes?
2952000	2954000	In fact, there are a lot of overlaps in the middle.
2954000	2956000	Or say.
2956000	2958000	Hey.
2958000	2960000	In terms of models, how can we produce a lot of long carbon molecules?
2960000	2962000	How can we produce a lot of, uh, these saturated complex molecules?
2962000	2964000	That's the same source.
2964000	2966000	In the same observation.
2966000	2968000	We measure a lot of, uh.
2968000	2970000	Uh, organic molecules.
2970000	2972000	Like the middle one.
2972000	2974000	This is very high.
2974000	2976000	This is outstanding.
2976000	2978000	This is more than this.
2978000	2980000	This is the four panels in front of it.
2980000	2982000	I'll show you.
2982000	2984000	Uh, four panels.
2984000	2986000	This is the four main lines.
2986000	2988000	But we also found that in.
2988000	2990000	The other places of this spectrum.
2990000	2992000	We see a lot of weaker emissions.
2992000	2994000	And then we identify them.
2994000	2996000	In fact, uh.
2996000	2998000	Most of them are from organic molecules.
2998000	3000000	And then we identified it.
3000000	3002000	There should be 14 different organic molecules.
3002000	3004000	On the right side.
3004000	3006000	Some of them are quite complicated.
3006000	3008000	There's alcohol, alcohol.
3008000	3010000	Or some different, uh.
3010000	3012000	Calcium, different.
3012000	3014000	Uh, his isotope.
3014000	3016000	Uh, his isotope.
3016000	3018000	And then we found that in different sources.
3018000	3020000	Inside?
3020000	3022000	Like here, we have three different sources.
3022000	3024000	That.
3024000	3026000	Basically, they are, uh, these three sources.
3026000	3028000	Their, um,
3028000	3030000	Luminosity difference will be more than 10 times.
3030000	3032000	So the so-called luminosity is basically.
3032000	3034000	Uh, depending on the control.
3034000	3036000	How much of the radiation can be released in the middle?
3036000	3038000	How bright is the star in the middle?
3038000	3040000	How bright is the process in the middle?
3040000	3042000	That's the difference in brightness.
3042000	3044000	So in such a big different source.
3044000	3046000	Inside?
3046000	3048000	We found that his organic molecules.
3048000	3050000	For methanol.
3050000	3052000	Uh, the abundance is about the same.
3052000	3054000	That is to say, you can see these three symbols.
3054000	3056000	Basically, they are all quite close.
3056000	3058000	That, uh, that means.
3058000	3060000	Um.
3060000	3062000	The middle of this.
3062000	3064000	Um.
3064000	3066000	How much is the luminosity?
3066000	3068000	How strong is the radiation in the middle?
3068000	3070000	It doesn't affect the production of these complex molecules.
3070000	3072000	Well, since it's not.
3072000	3074000	The middle, uh, this radiation.
3074000	3076000	If you say carbon, that means it's in front.
3076000	3078000	These, uh.
3078000	3080000	In the early days, these complex molecules.
3080000	3082000	It's already formed.
3082000	3084000	He might be in, uh.
3084000	3086000	When it freezes on the ice.
3086000	3088000	Through some of the relatively low temperature.
3088000	3090000	Some reactions are formed.
3090000	3092000	When he travels to the middle, it's relatively high temperature.
3092000	3094000	He was released.
3094000	3096000	To the gas station, and then you see it.
3096000	3098000	So he didn't have too much.
3098000	3100000	Processing produces different.
3100000	3102000	So this is a very small sample.
3102000	3104000	But I.
3104000	3106000	It's just a hint.
3106000	3108000	This is actually with, uh.
3108000	3110000	The prediction of the chemical model is quite close.
3112000	3114000	So, in addition, we found that we can do this.
3114000	3116000	Uh, complex molecules can also give us some.
3116000	3118000	Uh, can imagine the signature.
3118000	3120000	Uh.
3120000	3122000	Let's look at the cartoon on the right.
3122000	3124000	Simply put, if you have a structure like this.
3124000	3126000	The middle of this gray ring.
3126000	3128000	The middle of this gray ring represents a disk.
3128000	3130000	And then you might have an info outside.
3130000	3132000	Now we have, like, we're going down from the top.
3132000	3134000	This, this disk.
3134000	3136000	If you look at it from the left.
3136000	3138000	If it's yellow, this disease.
3138000	3140000	You can see, uh.
3140000	3142000	On one side, there's a red shift emission.
3142000	3144000	It's far from you.
3144000	3146000	It's a red emission.
3146000	3148000	But at the same time, you can see it in the back.
3148000	3150000	Uh, blue shift, the info.
3150000	3152000	So you become one of the same.
3152000	3154000	There's the same offset inside.
3154000	3156000	You can see at the same time.
3156000	3158000	There's a blue shift and a red shift emission.
3158000	3160000	It's not the same as if you're just a disk.
3160000	3162000	If you're just a disk.
3162000	3164000	Your left.
3164000	3166000	It's all going to be, for example, it's all going to be a red shift emission.
3166000	3168000	It's all going to be a blue shift emission on the right.
3168000	3170000	It's all going to be a blue shift emission on the right.
3170000	3172000	In this case.
3172000	3174000	You'll see two different kinds.
3174000	3176000	At the same time, you'll see a blue shift and a red shift emission.
3176000	3178000	So this is our left.
3178000	3180000	We're in, uh.
3180000	3182000	What you see in the observation.
3182000	3184000	Offset you can see.
3184000	3186000	If it's 0.1, we can see it at the same time.
3186000	3188000	You can see the blue shift and the red shift emission.
3188000	3190000	So if it's.
3190000	3192000	It's just a desk.
3192000	3194000	You'll see two triangles.
3194000	3196000	It's in the upper right corner and the lower left corner.
3196000	3198000	So that's what we're talking about.
3198000	3200000	Um, and then at the same time, this.
3200000	3202000	If you go in and analyze it.
3202000	3204000	A morphology like this.
3204000	3206000	Or what kind of structure is it?
3206000	3208000	We found that he was in the middle.
3208000	3210000	It's 50 to 100.
3210000	3212000	It's a disk.
3212000	3214000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
3214000	3214000	
3214000	3216000	Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
3216000	3218000	This is the mission.
3218000	3220000	I found that we can use it at the same time.
3220000	3222000	Hcl plus.
3222000	3224000	That's the mission to trace.
3224000	3226000	Um, the info of the envelope skill.
3226000	3228000	Um, the info, uh, the same complex.
3228000	3230000	A lot of molecules can give us some.
3230000	3232000	Uh, more central information.
3232000	3234000	So the goal for the future is to figure out a way.
3234000	3236000	If we can put this big tree, we should say.
3236000	3238000	Envelope skill and desk have two different dynamics.
3238000	3240000	Let's see if we can get a better one.
3240000	3242000	Uh, info model.
3242000	3244000	At the same time, we see a lot of different structures.
3244000	3246000	This is the other thing we can do.
3246000	3248000	We see a lot of different outflow structures.
3248000	3250000	It's just a school picture.
3250000	3252000	Um.
3252000	3254000	So, um, it means that we're actually this observation.
3254000	3256000	There's only an hour of observation time.
3256000	3258000	But he probably can bring it to us.
3258000	3260000	It may be more than three projects.
3260000	3262000	It may be more than three projects.
3262000	3264000	Um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um.
3264000	3266000	Um, so, um, so, um, so, um.
3266000	3268000	Um.
3268000	3270000	Ok.
3270000	3272000	We're going to ask again.
3272000	3274000	Um, you can go back to the first two.
3274000	3276000	In the front page.
3276000	3278000	Uh, just, uh.
3278000	3280000	Uh, uh, next page, next page.
3280000	3282000	There's one.
3282000	3284000	That's right, this page.
3284000	3286000	Just.
3286000	3288000	It's just that I just missed it.
3288000	3290000	Why is there only a complex?
3290000	3292000	You can do this thing.
3292000	3294000	Then you before.
3294000	3296000	It's the few lines that are very bright at the beginning.
3296000	3298000	Why can't I see this?
3298000	3300000	Um.
3300000	3302000	Basically,
3302000	3304000	the front.
3304000	3306000	Those in the front, for example,
3306000	3308000	it may have some.
3308000	3310000	It may have some destruction in the middle.
3310000	3312000	But even if those models don't have destruction,
3312000	3314000	it's relatively simple.
3314000	3316000	It may be.
3316000	3318000	It may be in the middle.
3318000	3320000	It's very high, but it's because of its.
3320000	3322000	Um.
3322000	3324000	It may be at the same time,
3324000	3326000	from 10 to 2000,
3326000	3328000	all of them.
3328000	3330000	So in terms of analysis,
3330000	3332000	it causes a lot of complexity.
3332000	3334000	The advantage of the complex model is that
3334000	3336000	the first one, most of the time,
3336000	3338000	it's in the state of defrosting.
3338000	3340000	It may have to be more than 100 Kelvin.
3340000	3342000	The temperature, it will go to the gas phase,
3342000	3344000	and you can see it.
3344000	3346000	That's a relatively simple model.
3346000	3348000	It may be 20 K, 40 K,
3348000	3350000	you can see it.
3350000	3352000	So, um, this kind of temperature
3352000	3354000	constraint, let the complex molecule
3354000	3356000	basically gather in a very
3356000	3358000	compact center,
3358000	3360000	or this scale place.
3360000	3362000	So basically,
3362000	3364000	its existence itself is self-selected,
3364000	3366000	so that you can probe
3366000	3368000	a very well-defined or
3368000	3370000	very compact region.
3370000	3372000	So, of course, other simpler
3372000	3374000	molecules can also be traced in the middle.
3374000	3376000	You can find other molecules in the middle,
3376000	3378000	but it's relatively difficult to analyze.
3378000	3380000	Oh, okay.
3380000	3382000	Got it. Thank you.
3382000	3384000	Okay, so
3384000	3386000	we basically, so maybe we have
3386000	3388000	a case now, that is, this source, we can
3388000	3390000	derive an info model,
3390000	3392000	and then we can connect from this core
3392000	3394000	and then draw a line to trace
3394000	3396000	its evolution from core to
3396000	3398000	a star case.
3398000	3400000	But in the future,
3400000	3402000	we should
3402000	3404000	pursue more samples,
3404000	3406000	so this observation is actually
3406000	3408000	very simple.
3408000	3410000	15 minutes on source,
3410000	3412000	the rest is actually calibration.
3412000	3414000	15 minutes on source,
3414000	3416000	you can measure so many things.
3416000	3418000	So it should be very,
3418000	3420000	if we have a good argument,
3420000	3422000	it is actually
3422000	3424000	relatively easy to push
3424000	3426000	more samples,
3426000	3428000	maybe 10 or even 50 sources,
3428000	3430000	you can probably know, okay,
3430000	3432000	the evolution of different mass sources
3432000	3434000	So this is more of a future
3434000	3436000	direction.
3436000	3438000	Then I will put my summary here,
3438000	3440000	and then if you have any other
3440000	3442000	questions, you are welcome.
3442000	3444000	Thank you.
3444000	3446000	Then
3446000	3448000	please turn on the microphone.
3448000	3450000	We are now applauding,
3450000	3452000	thank you for
3452000	3454000	giving us a speech.
3454000	3456000	Thank you.
3456000	3458000	Thank you.
3458000	3460000	I don't know if you have any questions.
3462000	3464000	If you have any questions,
3464000	3466000	remember to turn on the microphone.
3466000	3468000	I will ask another question.
3468000	3470000	Okay.
3470000	3472000	Just stop here.
3472000	3474000	The picture in the upper right corner,
3474000	3476000	you just said you are
3476000	3478000	using your
3478000	3480000	radiative transfer model
3480000	3482000	to fit your
3482000	3484000	observation data.
3484000	3486000	So
3486000	3488000	you
3488000	3490000	will use, for example,
3490000	3492000	like MCMC,
3492000	3494000	you may run one first,
3494000	3496000	and then compare the observation,
3496000	3498000	and then come back to adjust the parameters,
3498000	3500000	and then run again?
3500000	3502000	Or is it
3502000	3504000	theoretically possible?
3504000	3506000	Theoretically it is possible, but
3506000	3508000	the biggest
3508000	3510000	limitation is that we
3510000	3512000	are running this 3D radiative transfer,
3512000	3514000	because this is a very high density
3514000	3516000	place, so
3516000	3518000	running a model of realization
3518000	3520000	takes a very long time.
3520000	3522000	A realization may take 2 hours, 3 hours.
3522000	3524000	So if you are MCMC,
3524000	3526000	you may have to map,
3526000	3528000	so you have to probe this parameter space.
3528000	3530000	If you need 1000 models,
3530000	3532000	it will take 3000 hours
3532000	3534000	per source.
3534000	3536000	So we later thought
3536000	3538000	it was not very feasible.
3538000	3540000	But
3540000	3542000	some
3542000	3544000	other studies do simpler
3544000	3546000	sources, they use MCMC
3546000	3548000	to characterize different
3548000	3550000	parameters. But I think that's
3550000	3552000	actually very important.
3552000	3554000	Maybe we can
3554000	3556000	test, for example,
3556000	3558000	other things are all fixed,
3558000	3560000	we will
3560000	3562000	change the chemical abundance profile.
3562000	3564000	Because that's actually
3564000	3566000	a pretty
3566000	3568000	hand-tuning parameter.
3570000	3572000	We currently have some ideas
3572000	3574000	to see if we can
3574000	3576000	optimize the radiative transfer
3576000	3578000	calculation. For example,
3578000	3580000	we can fix the gradient,
3580000	3582000	some more technical considerations
3582000	3584000	can be relaxed.
3584000	3586000	So I think
3586000	3588000	in the future, maybe I will
3588000	3590000	do some more
3590000	3592000	small experiments. But
3592000	3594000	I think this part
3594000	3596000	has its own
3596000	3598000	limitations. So
3598000	3600000	if you can do MCMC
3600000	3602000	optimization,
3602000	3604000	it should be
3604000	3606000	in a more
3606000	3608000	special situation.
3608000	3610000	So
3610000	3612000	your current approach is
3612000	3614000	to run one first
3614000	3616000	and see if it's not
3616000	3618000	right. Then you probably
3618000	3620000	know what
3620000	3622000	parameter to choose.
3622000	3624000	Yes, it's the brain
3624000	3626000	to guide the search.
3626000	3628000	For example,
3628000	3630000	we have a lot of different tools
3630000	3632000	to do this. For example,
3632000	3634000	we have some tools
3634000	3636000	that can tell us,
3636000	3638000	in this beam,
3638000	3640000	as a function of radius,
3640000	3642000	what our velocity looks like.
3642000	3644000	If I want to say that I think
3644000	3646000	the emission at a certain velocity is too low,
3646000	3648000	I'll see if I can adjust it,
3648000	3650000	or see
3650000	3652000	what the reason is.
3652000	3654000	It takes a lot of time to
3654000	3656000	model the inspection,
3656000	3658000	and then think about
3658000	3660000	how to adjust it.
3660000	3662000	Got it.
3662000	3664000	It feels like
3664000	3666000	a project
3666000	3668000	that can be used for machine learning.
3668000	3670000	Yes, I hope so.
3670000	3672000	Who can help me do this?
3674000	3676000	Yuting can help you.
3676000	3678000	She's really good at it now.
3678000	3680000	Okay.
3680000	3682000	In January,
3682000	3684000	I'll need your help.
3688000	3690000	Before today's speech,
3690000	3692000	before everyone
3692000	3694000	came in,
3694000	3696000	we talked about
3696000	3698000	the content of today's speech,
3698000	3700000	which is still being written and submitted.
3700000	3702000	If you want to discuss,
3702000	3704000	you can contact our speakers directly.
3704000	3706000	You can
3706000	3708000	put your email in the chat.
3708000	3710000	Whether you want to be contacted
3710000	3712000	or you want to contact someone,
3712000	3714000	you can exchange
3714000	3716000	contact information here.
3716000	3718000	Or you can Google it.
3718000	3720000	You can Google it directly.
3722000	3724000	The recording of our speech will be delayed
3724000	3726000	until February or March next year
3726000	3728000	before it is uploaded.
3728000	3730000	The reason is that it is now
3730000	3732000	being written.
3732000	3734000	Do you have any questions?
3738000	3740000	If you don't have any questions now,
3740000	3742000	I'll promote it.
3742000	3744000	I'm going to put
3744000	3746000	the two main websites
3746000	3748000	in the chat.
3750000	3752000	One is our Facebook,
3752000	3754000	the other is our website.
3754000	3756000	If you go in,
3756000	3758000	you can see
3758000	3760000	the purpose of our project.
3760000	3762000	We hope that through
3762000	3764000	young people
3764000	3766000	working in the research circle,
3766000	3768000	we can cooperate with each other
3768000	3770000	and exchange research information quickly,
3770000	3772000	get to know each other,
3772000	3774000	and share information.
3774000	3776000	If you support such a project,
3776000	3778000	we hope you can consider
3778000	3780000	joining the member.
3780000	3782000	I also put the information
3782000	3784000	for joining the member in the chat.
3784000	3786000	More importantly,
3786000	3788000	we are now open to sign up
3788000	3790000	for the 2019 speech.
3790000	3792000	If you are in the past year
3792000	3794000	or expected to be in the next year,
3794000	3796000	there will be interesting research discoveries
3796000	3798000	or information or ideas
3798000	3800000	to share with you.
3800000	3802000	I also put the link
3802000	3804000	in the chat.
3804000	3806000	There are several websites here,
3806000	3808000	you can go in and play.
3808000	3810000	I'll ask one last time,
3810000	3812000	do you have any questions?
3812000	3814000	By the way,
3814000	3816000	Yaolun's email is in the chat,
3816000	3818000	so you can ask him directly.
3818000	3820000	Thank you.
3830000	3832000	If there are no questions,
3832000	3834000	let's turn on the microphone
3834000	3836000	and thank Yaolun again.
