1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome everyone to today's Terra Talk.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today is the whole summer vacation of Terra.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Because we did not plan for the summer vacation at the beginning of this year.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Because there are a lot of people joining this year.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we arranged a new session during the summer vacation.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today is the first speaker, the speaker of the summer vacation program.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today's speaker is Chen Xinhao.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He graduated from the Department of Atmospheric Engineering of NTU.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He is currently a doctoral student in the Department of Atmospheric Engineering of NTU.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He is about to graduate.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
His interest is mainly in the hot zone area,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is near Taiwan.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is the analysis and simulation of the diagnosis of the weather phenomenon to the mid-level.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then there is a special thing that everyone in Taiwan is very familiar with.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Disastrous weather such as typhoons or heat currents after noon.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In terms of method, it is mainly used for numerical and weather forecasts.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then he can provide this simulation to give a fixed amount of precipitation forecast and assessment.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In addition to the research part, Chen Xinhao is a very good friend of mine for more than 10 years.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We were classmates of the Taita Bicycle Club.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He had a very famous feature when he was on the club.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He is a human weather forecaster.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It is very important to the bicycle club.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So let's listen to him today.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How did he become an atmospheric scientist from a human weather forecaster?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The method of numerical simulation.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The topic he often tells us is

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Medium-Range Cloud Resolving Typhoon Rainfall Ensemble Forecast for Taiwan Through Time-Lagging Approach.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This topic is very long.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So I hope Xinhao can tell us what his Chinese vocabulary is.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Without further ado, let's applaud and welcome him.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello everyone.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I am Chen Xinhao, the speaker today.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can call me Guige.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Maybe because when I report to the police,

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The main setting is related fields of research.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So if there is something in the middle that you can't understand,

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can interrupt and ask.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Because today I will report to the previous seminar.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then I will explain the name a little bit.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The topic I want to talk about today is

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Medium-Range Cloud Resolving Typhoon Rainfall Ensemble Forecast for Taiwan Through Time-Lagging Approach.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is what he came up with after I came in from the PhD class.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:03,000
For Taiwan, there is a new typhoon forecast strategy.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, I don't care.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's start with the first one.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In our country, typhoon and rainfall are extremely low.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Every year, there will be a large loss of all kinds of life.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Typhoon is the main cause of Taiwan's drop in water.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is the typhoon in 2016.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
From 26th to 29th.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is the drop in water for 26 hours.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The amount of wind and rain they bring can be compared to Taiwan.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Anyway, the typhoon is an important drop in water in Taiwan.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In addition, Taiwan is different from other places.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Taiwan is not a high mountain.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
When the typhoon passes, it will cause a terrible drop in wind and rain.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Taiwan also has a lot of people living in the mountains because of the underground population.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The map is a map of Taiwan's geography.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The black spot is the location of the Yuliang Station in Taiwan.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because of the high mountains and the people living in the mountains,

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
These two characteristics of Taiwan cause the typhoon forecast.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The maximum drop in water will be higher than other places.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
For example, mainland China.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
These big countries will have a higher drop in water.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
In the past, it was thought that the forecast limit was about three days.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It is generally thought that the area model forecasts more than 72 hours for numerical weather.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The following results are low in reference value.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wang Teng conducted an 8-day drop in water forecast in cloud analysis mode.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We evaluated five typhoons in 2002 and two typhoons in 2013.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There are a total of six typhoons.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We found that the drop in water forecast is different from the above past.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We found that the drop in water forecast may be in 8 days or 4 days, 6 days, or 3 days.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
These 10 days make a reference value drop in water forecast.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There is a conclusion in this paper.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Our path is different.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
However, the drop in water forecast is still useful.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This paper is to break down the past.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let me briefly introduce the current detailed forecast method.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The blue dot is the start time.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The blue dot is the start time.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The method of forecasting more than 10 years ago is to forecast 72 hours before the start time.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The current detailed forecast method is based on different physical parameters.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Based on different physical parameters, there are different rules.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Then make about 20 to 30 conditions and forecast for 3 days.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The drop in water time for this target will be about 20 to 30 days.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The picture on the bottom right is a detailed forecast result for the 2013 Kaohsiung typhoon.

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The blue dot is a detailed member.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The forecast is different.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The middle is a detailed black line.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The result of the current detailed forecast is like this.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let me briefly introduce the difference.

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
As mentioned earlier, they divided all the calculation resources into 20 parts.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The concept of the difference in detail is that I put 20 parts of the forecast resources in the same place.

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then I increase the frequency and increase the forecast range.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I only run single mode.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And I have a forecast of 8 days.

98
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then every 6 hours, the start time will increase by about 6 hours.

99
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In this way, there will be more than 20 members for the target time.

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is the difference in detail.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a little different from the current forecast.

102
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Because it's regional mode, the maximum level is the same.

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There are also 24 members.

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The forecast range is about this.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Then the X-17 forecast.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The cloud analysis X-17 forecast.

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The forecast range is about the red box.

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Then the distance between the two networks.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Its resolution is higher.

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The forecast range is larger.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The length of the forecast is also longer.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I forgot to show my little arrow.

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The members of Ensembl will be used in a while.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And the calculation resources they use are about 1500 core systems.

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's all about 1500 core systems.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In other words, it can do this.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I raise the resolution.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I raise the forecast range.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The length of the forecast is also longer.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then there are about the same number of members.

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then use the same data.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In the model, we use the Japanese National University developed

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
X-17 forecast mode.

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is a non-linear model.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The key is that there is no linearization.

126
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The original physics is the same process.

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
On the right is the conversion method of its six waterfalls.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There are all kinds of models.

129
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Hello, Gui, can you hear me?

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The first example I explain is that.

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
In 2013.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The bottom left is the final path of the Central Meteorological Bureau.

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The red box is the original X-17 forecast range.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The top right is the observation waterfall from August 29th to 30th.

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The bottom right is the forecast a few days ago.

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's about this time, the observation time.

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The color bar is the waterfall.

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can see that after the meteorological conditions are strong.

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The path is very similar to what it did a day ago.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Its strength is weak.

141
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But it is a strong deterrent.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This picture is the forecast from August 22nd.

143
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
For the target time, from August 29th to 30th.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can see that the forecast can be calculated from August 22nd.

145
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When the meteorological conditions are weak.

146
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can tell the disaster prevention unit.

147
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There may be more than 311 waterfalls in the south.

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Maybe you don't know 311.

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
311 is about the same size as Yanda Waterfall in Pingting.

150
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because the weather conditions are different.

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The weather forecast is different.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So the result is good or bad.

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Some results are better.

154
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Some results are not the observed weather forecast.

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So the meteorological conditions will be observed.

156
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
After August 24th, the meteorological conditions will be observed.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The meteorological conditions will be observed.

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This method is based on.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Before a lot of days.

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It can provide the meteorological conditions of the disaster prevention unit.

161
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Provide meteorological conditions.

162
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Then it will be on August 26th.

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
On August 18th.

164
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It will be 5 kilometers below zero.

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
24 members.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It will provide.

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is their detailed frequency.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The detailed frequency of 24 members.

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
After 24 reports.

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Add their water.

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then.

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They are like this.

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The other is the poured water.

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Although the progress is similar.

175
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
As time goes by.

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000

The error will be magnified.

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000

Then there are not 24.

376
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Isn't there 24?

This is.

378
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000

531
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This.

532
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because the left side

533
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,760
expect it to have a

534
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,000
trend

535
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
other than

536
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the left

537
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
5km

538
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
24 layers

539
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Every importance

540
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Besides

541
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We just mentioned

542
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Temperature drop in 24 hours

543
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If I put the drop in time

544
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,800
up to 48 hours

545
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
In fact, the Kangrui Typhoon

546
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Drop in 48 hours

547
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Then we color bar

548
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
300 to 1500

549
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Then its value is about

550
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
700 or so

551
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
742

552
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
That

553
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
I don't know if this typhoon

554
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Do you have any impression

555
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
This typhoon is

556
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Lai Ching-Ting's mayor

557
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
When he was the mayor

558
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
He was in Tainan

559
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
He used to

560
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Before this typhoon

561
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
He was called God Lai

562
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Then

563
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Then

564
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
His god place

565
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
It's written on it

566
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I think I'm going to take a vacation

567
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Then Ching-Ting said

568
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I don't want to take a vacation

569
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Then

570
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Then the next day

571
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
No wind, no rain

572
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
He became God Lai

573
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
What about this typhoon

574
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
He did the same thing

575
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Then he fell from the mountain

576
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I don't know if you have any impression

577
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
On this matter

578
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
This typhoon

579
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Then this typhoon in Tainan

580
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
It's raining a lot

581
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Then salt water

582
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Then

583
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Lai Ching-Ting insisted

584
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
You have to go to work

585
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
So

586
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
It's pretty bad

587
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
it is good

588
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
That

589
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
So

590
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
The precipitation in 48 hours

591
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
It's the same on August 23

592
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
That is

593
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Six days ago

594
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
He can have

595
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Precipitation

596
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Then

597
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Of course

598
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Some precipitation

599
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Some precipitation

600
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Have been grasped

601
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
The one who ran away in the middle

602
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Did not grasp

603
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Precipitation

604
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
But he had a trend

605
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Uh

606
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Excessive at first

607
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Then again

608
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Uh

609
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
The big environmental trend is

610
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
This typhoon may not affect Taiwan

611
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
But gradually came back

612
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Tell him

613
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Oh, this typhoon

614
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
May really affect Taiwan

615
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Then

616
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
A day ago

617
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Three days in advance

618
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
And tell you

619
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Uh

620
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Typhoon

621
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
It looks like this

622
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Then

623
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Typhoon

624
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Here

625
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
More than 200

626
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
That

627
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
His shortcoming is

628
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Your mechanism

629
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Can't grasp

630
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Then he can't

631
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
In many days

632
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Provide

633
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Uh

634
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
The trend of precipitation

635
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Uh

636
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
It's raining

637
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
It's raining

638
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Gradually

639
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Uh

640
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
One by one

641
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
It's raining

642
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
I think the model

643
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Should go in this direction

644
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I think he

645
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
He can't provide such

646
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Uh

647
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
That two days

648
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Result

649
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Can

650
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
That is

651
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Five or six days ago

652
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Provide such precipitation

653
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Then

654
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Then

655
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
The typhoon

656
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Three or four days

657
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Provide such precipitation

658
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
One or two days

659
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Uh

660
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Collect

661
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Should be

662
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Five kilometers per hour

663
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Twenty-four meters

664
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
He

665
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
There is no way to go

666
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
That

667
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
If for

668
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
It will rain for three days

669
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Uh

670
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
The example I chose here is

671
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Typhoon Morak

672
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
That

673
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Morak is a typhoon

674
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
He actually

675
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
In 2019

676
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Typhoon

677
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
The typhoon

678
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Uh

679
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
The most famous thing

680
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Is

681
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
In the small village

682
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Right

683
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
That

684
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
What about this method

685
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Uh

686
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
But

687
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Let's talk about it first

688
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
This technology

689
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
There was no such thing at that time

690
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
And

691
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
There was no such thing at that time

692
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Calculation resource

693
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Now this

694
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Calculation resource

695
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Gradually increasing

696
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
He can use this way

697
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
That

698
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
If

699
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I

700
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I am

701
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Only three days

702
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
If this typhoon

703
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
Just three days

704
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
That is

705
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
He can't provide

706
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Everyone is

707
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Oh

708
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
He must be

709
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
After it started

710
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
He told me

711
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Oh this mode

712
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Three days

713
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
He rained

714
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Will

715
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
Become

716
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
How

717
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
This typhoon

718
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Observed in

719
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Taiwan's Zhongpu Mountain Area

720
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
More than 1,500 kilometers

721
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
The value is about 2,000

722
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
But

723
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
If I forecast eight days

724
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
There is a way

725
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
For the next three days

726
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Preliminary forecast

727
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
That

728
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Because my show in front

729
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
He is a weather forecast

730
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
With five kilometers

731
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
That now

732
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I can't fix it

733
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Because they

734
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Can't do it

735
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
If he only forecasts three days

736
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Then

737
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Here's a little conclusion

738
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Is

739
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
In general

740
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
He is a weather forecast

741
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Can be called

742
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
The current weather forecast

743
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Earlier

744
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Provide

745
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Damage

746
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
That's it

747
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
If the rainfall

748
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
The rainfall time

749
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Longer

750
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
One day

751
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Half a day

752
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Two days

753
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Three days

754
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
So if the rainfall time is long

755
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
It increases the possibility of dust

756
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
That way

757
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Just call

758
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Current

759
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
More useful

760
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Then

761
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I want to talk about another typhoon

762
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Is the Subing typhoon

763
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
That

764
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Hello

765
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
The typhoon

766
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
In

767
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Because

768
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
I

769
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Can you hear me

770
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
This is a strong typhoon

771
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Then

772
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Observation room

773
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
24 hours

774
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Then he is very powerful

775
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Is in

776
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Uh

777
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Hsinchu Miaoli Mountain Area

778
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
About 1500

779
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
800

780
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
876 meters

781
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
About water

782
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
That

783
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
This typhoon

784
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
His strength is stronger

785
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Then he can be in 20 hours

786
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
More than 800 meters

787
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Water

788
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Then

789
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
What's next

790
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Just tell everyone

791
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Uh

792
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,800
His name is

793
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
M01 M02

794
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Is

795
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Uh

796
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Uh, let me mention it first

797
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Because we

798
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
The laboratory also provides

799
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
TTFR

800
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Typhoon flood research center

801
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Then they

802
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
In charge of running this

803
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Typhoon forecast

804
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
They have members

805
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Then

806
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Every school has to provide

807
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Not every school

808
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Must provide

809
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
Some schools are interested

810
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Will provide some

811
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Typhoon results

812
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Then put it in this

813
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Then for everyone's reference

814
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
That

815
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Simply put

816
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
This is the typhoon forecast

817
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
M01

818
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,800
M02

819
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Then

820
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Uh

821
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Shida also provides a member

822
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
M17

823
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
That

824
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Basically he

825
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Every member is

826
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
5 km

827
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
But only M17

828
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
With me below

829
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
This is the typhoon forecast

830
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Made

831
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Typhoon forecast

832
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
That can be seen

833
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Uh

834
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
In fact, every result

835
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
The situation is different

836
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Then my red box

837
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Is

838
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Means

839
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Uh

840
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Typhoon

841
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
More than 700

842
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
More than 700

843
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Because

844
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm in a lot of

845
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
I also talked about it in my video

846
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Taiwan because of heavy rainfall

847
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Mountain area

848
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
So

849
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
The water level

850
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Exploded

851
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Very serious

852
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
For example, if my water level

853
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Exploded 310

854
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
That

855
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Everyone knows

856
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
That is probably

857
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Go down

858
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Go down the mountain area

859
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
But if the mountain area

860
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
700-800 meters

861
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Down

862
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Water

863
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
That might be

864
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
A disaster

865
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
That is

866
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
That

867
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
5 km resolution

868
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Can be calculated

869
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
That is

870
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
About 24 members

871
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
More than two-thirds

872
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Did not explode

873
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Uh

874
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Water level

875
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
But in 2.5 km

876
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Members

877
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Just

878
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
There is a way to explode

879
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
That is also for this typhoon

880
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Just change different timing

881
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Then my initial time

882
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Is always

883
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
In

884
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Close

885
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
This observation time

886
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
So

887
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You can see that

888
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Is

889
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
The result will be more and more

890
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Closer observation

891
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
But one thing

892
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Has not changed

893
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Uh

894
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
5 km resolution

895
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Members

896
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
N01 N02

897
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
And so on

898
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Then in addition to N17

899
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
They explode

900
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
This kind of

901
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
possibility

902
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Not so much

903
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Then he

904
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
This explosion

905
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Strange

906
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I do not know why it looks like this

907
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
933

908
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
It looks like this

909
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Then the time of the experiment

910
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
The same is 2.5 km

911
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
He can master the water level

912
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
That

913
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
5 km members

914
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
There is no way

915
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
But the time of the experiment

916
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Everyone is getting closer

917
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
But

918
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Now there should be half

919
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Explode the water level

920
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
That

921
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Then everyone thinks

922
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Oh

923
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
We may

924
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Really

925
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Will be so much

926
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Then I am here as a lady

927
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Is

928
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
There are two sentences

929
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I said before

930
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
That

931
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Because my understanding is improved

932
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Can explode the water level

933
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
That

934
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
These things are

935
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Uh

936
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
What I did a few years ago

937
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
That

938
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
He is

939
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Will be a

940
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Effective way

941
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
But he also has a

942
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Uh

943
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
The problem is

944
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Say

945
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Hey

946
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
That

947
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I just talked a lot

948
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
That is to say

949
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Oh

950
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
If it's on the left

951
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
The water level is

952
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
That

953
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
On the right

954
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
The water level is

955
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
That

956
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Before I have this black observation

957
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Before

958
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
How do I know

959
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
The path is right

960
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
Which path

961
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Your reference value is higher

962
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Then you tell me

963
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Say

964
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Oh

965
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
So recently

966
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
The trend is

967
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
The more to the middle

968
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
The more to the back

969
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
The closer the time

970
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
The water level

971
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
The closer

972
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Will be more like

973
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
So

974
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I'll just watch the last one

975
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
So

976
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
What I'm doing now

977
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
That is

978
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Uh

979
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
If the observation comes in

980
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I use

981
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Machine learning method

982
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
He can judge that

983
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Hey

984
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
On the left

985
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
These exposed

986
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Observation

987
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Far

988
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
So they

989
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Uh

990
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
The machine will learn

991
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Oh

992
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Their credibility

993
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Lower

994
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
That

995
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
These on the right

996
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
The credibility is lower

997
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
That

998
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
The method I use now

999
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Can give

1000
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
He

1001
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Every

1002
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Pre-report member

1003
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
His

1004
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Uh

1005
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Water level score

1006
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
That is to say

1007
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Hey

1008
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
I 2618

1009
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
This report

1010
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
His water level score

1011
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
May be

1012
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
70 points

1013
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
This may be

1014
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
60 points

1015
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
That

1016
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
May be too far

1017
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Because he is too far from the observation

1018
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
So he

1019
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Water level score

1020
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
With

1021
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
2 points

1022
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Something like this

1023
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Let's make an example

1024
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
That this is

1025
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
What I'm doing now

1026
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
That

1027
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Uh

1028
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Because

1029
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Because machine learning

1030
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
He needs more

1031
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Cases

1032
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,800
So

1033
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I have run a lot of

1034
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Is

1035
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Recently

1036
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Keep running

1037
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Run more cases

1038
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Want to give

1039
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Uh

1040
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Computer

1041
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
More things to learn

1042
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Recently

1043
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Keep doing

1044
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Such a thing

1045
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
That

1046
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
That why

1047
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Uh

1048
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
What is that

1049
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Why

1050
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
The machine's forecast can't do this

1051
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Because they

1052
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
No

1053
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Six days ago

1054
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
No five days ago

1055
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
No four days ago

1056
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
The captain is three days

1057
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
So they can't

1058
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Use this method

1059
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
To support the forecast

1060
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Then give out

1061
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Each

1062
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Score

1063
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
That

1064
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
The last one

1065
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Is

1066
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Because we

1067
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
This method has

1068
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Past

1069
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Forecast results

1070
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
So we can use

1071
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Objective method

1072
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
To

1073
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Guide us

1074
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
That

1075
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
My report today

1076
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Is

1077
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Probably this

1078
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
About this

1079
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Then

1080
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Uh

1081
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Just

1082
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Report to everyone

1083
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
I don't know if everyone has any questions

1084
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Like this

1085
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Can you hear me

1086
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Can anyone hear me

1087
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
Oh

1088
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Can hear

1089
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I found a very serious problem

1090
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Because

1091
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Without turning on

1092
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
He didn't

1093
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
No

1094
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
No sound

1095
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
So I just

1096
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
If you didn't speak

1097
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I didn't hear it

1098
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
Oh ok

1099
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
So you can hear it now

1100
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Yes yes I can hear it now

1101
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
I don't know if you interrupted me in the middle

1102
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Have

1103
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I tried a few times

1104
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
But it doesn't matter

1105
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
I just want to ask a question

1106
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
That

1107
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Ok

1108
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Does everyone have a question

1109
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
If there is no problem

1110
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I ask one first

1111
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Just

1112
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
You are running this

1113
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Ensemble time

1114
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
You said you ran

1115
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
More than 20

1116
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
More than 30

1117
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Their

1118
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Initial conditions

1119
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Is it all

1120
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Is it exactly the same

1121
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Or

1122
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
You will use some

1123
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
For example, observe

1124
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
The actual inaccuracy

1125
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Go

1126
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Go

1127
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
That is to say

1128
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
To slightly disrupt

1129
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
His initial conditions

1130
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Then let him run

1131
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
You said that way

1132
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Is it

1133
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Oh

1134
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Uh

1135
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
In that way

1136
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
The difference is

1137
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Different

1138
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
The initial time is different

1139
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Because

1140
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Uh

1141
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
To put it simply

1142
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Uh

1143
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
For example, this is the 7th

1144
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Assuming it's the 22nd

1145
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay

1146
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
After 6 hours

1147
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
He will have different

1148
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
That is to say

1149
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I

1150
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
8 o'clock in the morning

1151
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Start forecasting

1152
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Then

1153
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
This is

1154
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
2 o'clock in the afternoon

1155
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
The initial conditions of the two

1156
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Is different

1157
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
So

1158
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
The result they caused

1159
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Is the same

1160
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
He didn't

1161
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Add any

1162
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Disturbance

1163
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Like this

1164
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Oh so you won't say

1165
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
To slightly disrupt

1166
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I mean

1167
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
For example, for example

1168
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
What is your air pressure

1169
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
What is the temperature

1170
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Then

1171
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
For example, your air pressure is

1172
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
1

1173
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Oh no

1174
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
No no

1175
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
The temperature is 30 degrees

1176
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
You are 30

1177
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Then add a

1178
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,800
Random constant

1179
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
That constant is

1180
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Is

1181
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
For example, minus 0.2

1182
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Something like that

1183
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Then let the random number add

1184
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
because

1185
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Originally you measured

1186
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
There will be

1187
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Uncertainty

1188
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Still not

1189
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
You are

1190
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
These things are fixed

1191
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
Is a very certain number

1192
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Enter

1193
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Yes

1194
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
What is the number it predicts

1195
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I put it in

1196
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Just like this

1197
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Because

1198
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Because because

1199
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Because one

1200
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Run a round every six hours

1201
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
So i don't need

1202
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Do

1203
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Such action

1204
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
That

1205
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Typical ensemble

1206
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
He

1207
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Can use this technology

1208
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
That

1209
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
The result

1210
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
The result is

1211
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Some of them

1212
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Members are

1213
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Use this method

1214
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
This method

1215
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Made

1216
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Uh-huh

1217
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Then

1218
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Yes

1219
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I have another question

1220
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Just

1221
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
There was a show in front of you

1222
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Say

1223
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
You are now

1224
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Typically running these things

1225
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Are using

1226
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
One or two thousand cores

1227
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
right

1228
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Correct

1229
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
OK

1230
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
That

1231
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
You think

1232
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
This

1233
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Computation

1234
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
This hardware

1235
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Restriction

1236
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Is

1237
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Is

1238
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Main

1239
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Accuracy

1240
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Restriction

1241
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Just say

1242
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
For example, I will give you 5000 cores

1243
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Can you do it

1244
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Obviously better

1245
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Uh

1246
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Mainly

1247
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Maybe this model

1248
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
He wrote

1249
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Is that

1250
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
He

1251
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Must be distributed

1252
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
1500

1253
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
After parallel computing

1254
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
He has to combine again

1255
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Just take it apart

1256
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
And stick it up

1257
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Is that he will divide

1258
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
These two actions

1259
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Uh-huh

1260
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
That

1261
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
1500

1262
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Core

1263
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
When you want to stick it up

1264
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Is actually

1265
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,800
It also takes a lot of time

1266
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Uh-huh

1267
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Let's say it becomes 5000

1268
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Maybe he is

1269
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Parallel computing

1270
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
He will double

1271
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
But he is stuck

1272
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
May increase

1273
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Much

1274
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
So actually the biggest difference

1275
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
OK

1276
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
So actually the biggest difference

1277
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Still your

1278
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
That

1279
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
The logic behind that thing

1280
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Is your algorithm

1281
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Like you want

1282
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
How do you sign your grid

1283
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Then what do you want to resolve

1284
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Then how do you arrange your time

1285
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
I

1286
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
I think

1287
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Just now

1288
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Because i don't

1289
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I have no ability to change the mode

1290
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Then

1291
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
So my current use

1292
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Test result

1293
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Probably use this

1294
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Core number

1295
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
He is

1296
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Uh

1297
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
In the forecast result

1298
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
With

1299
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
The time of use

1300
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Is

1301
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Is balanced

1302
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Because actually

1303
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
The number of days to forecast

1304
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
He

1305
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Must be

1306
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Must be effective

1307
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
You can't be

1308
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
Uh

1309
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,800
For example, I can

1310
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
20,000 core

1311
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Then run

1312
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
The range is global

1313
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Then the efficiency is super high

1314
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
But he ran

1315
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
The typhoon is not raining

1316
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Yes yes yes

1317
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
The typhoon is not raining

1318
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Then there is no

1319
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
No problem

1320
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
He

1321
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Uh

1322
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Is my

1323
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
My design is

1324
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Uh

1325
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Stabilize time and efficiency

1326
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Then

1327
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Uh

1328
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Stabilize resolution

1329
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Then

1330
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Stabilize strength

1331
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Then he is

1332
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
I think

1333
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
After evaluation

1334
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I think

1335
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Very balanced

1336
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,800
A more balanced design

1337
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
Then increase or decrease

1338
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
I think

1339
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
That's what I just explained

1340
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Say

1341
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Because he needs you

1342
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
After evenly distributed

1343
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
He has to be united

1344
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Then when united

1345
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
because

1346
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
Japan

1347
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Japan National University

1348
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Their design

1349
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Use a core

1350
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
To do

1351
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Combination action

1352
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
That

1353
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Maybe in the future

1354
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Will also

1355
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
I am

1356
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I want to say

1357
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I want to talk to them all day

1358
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
You

1359
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
It seems like

1360
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
No

1361
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
I

1362
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I want to talk to them later

1363
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
OK

1364
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Hurry up

1365
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
OK

1366
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Any other questions

1367
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I can do

1368
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
I see

1369
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Does anyone have

1370
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Any other questions

1371
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Because I

1372
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
In fact, I can ask a lot of questions

1373
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
I think it's quite interesting

1374
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I have a lot of questions

1375
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
But

1376
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Let's let others ask

1377
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Does anyone have any questions?

1378
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
No one has a problem?

1379
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Or

1380
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Or you still can't hear me

1381
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Because I can hear it

1382
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Yes, because I can hear it

1383
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
OK

1384
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Then I have another question

1385
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
My question is

1386
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
About machine learning

1387
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Yes

1388
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm not sure you

1389
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
You are

1390
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Someone has a problem

1391
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
But

1392
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
You speak

1393
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I didn't hear you

1394
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
The microphone is on

1395
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
But

1396
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
necessary

1397
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
The more necessary

1398
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
The more necessary

1399
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
In fact, I don't know how to read

1400
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
OK

1401
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Yes, we didn't hear your voice

1402
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
You can type it

1403
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
I heard it

1404
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I can't hear it again

1405
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
No sound

1406
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
I think you can type it

1407
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
His question is

1408
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
He asked

1409
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Double typhoon forecast

1410
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
What is the difference between single forecast and double typhoon forecast?

1411
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
Double typhoon forecast

1412
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
What is the difference between single forecast and double typhoon forecast?

1413
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
You said in a forecast

1414
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Will there be two typhoons?

1415
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I think that's what it means

1416
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Yes, he said that's what it means

1417
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
For the model

1418
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
It's just that the complexity will increase

1419
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
The forecast time will be a little longer

1420
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,800
That

1421
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
I don't think there's anything wrong

1422
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Because

1423
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
There will be two in the model

1424
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
Rotating

1425
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Then they have to

1426
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Say

1427
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
They

1428
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
The water will rise and move

1429
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
The air rises and moves

1430
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
The air rises and moves

1431
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
It's going to freeze

1432
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
It will rain after freezing

1433
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
After the rain

1434
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
It will rise and move

1435
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Then the water will rise and move

1436
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
They have been

1437
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Calculating this kind of thing

1438
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Because there are two typhoons

1439
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Inside

1440
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
So the model is more complex

1441
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,800
The forecast time will be longer

1442
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
but

1443
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Almost a little bit

1444
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
About 10% or so

1445
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
6 hours

1446
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
6 hours

1447
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
That

1448
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Will there be any difference?

1449
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
Yes

1450
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
OK

1451
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
He said

1452
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
I see

1453
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Thanks

1454
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
OK

1455
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Does anyone else have any questions?

1456
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
If not

1457
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Today we

1458
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Wait a minute

1459
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Yes

1460
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,800
OK

1461
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
Please say

1462
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
He said

1463
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
The satellite measurement resolution

1464
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,800
About how much

1465
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Because of the satellite

1466
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Simply put

1467
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
How many satellites are there?

1468
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
One is

1469
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Earth satellite

1470
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Another one is

1471
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Satellite orbit

1472
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
That

1473
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I don't know

1474
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I don't know

1475
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I don't know

1476
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
I don't know

1477
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800
I don't know

1478
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
I don't know

1479
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
I don't know

1480
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I don't know

1481
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
I don't know

1482
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I don't know

1483
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
I don't know

1484
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,800
I don't know

1485
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
What is the difference?

1486
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
What about the satellites?

1487
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,800
That is to say

1488
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
The Earth is here

1489
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Then he is

1490
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Keep going around the earth

1491
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Then he

1492
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Because it keeps going around

1493
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
So he flew a long way

1494
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
I don't know why

1495
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Anyway, he

1496
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Because of this design

1497
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
He flew a long way

1498
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Then there is another satellite

1499
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
That is the earth

1500
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
When the earth is here

1501
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
He is going to

1502
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
The earth follows

1503
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
He keeps going around the same place

1504
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Then

1505
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
This one flies higher

1506
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Because according to what gravity

1507
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Then rotate and so on

1508
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
This one is higher

1509
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
That resolution

1510
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
I personally

1511
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
In the image

1512
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
How far back to the satellite

1513
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Probably

1514
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,800
To

1515
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
It's pretty thin

1516
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Then it depends on

1517
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,800
When was it produced?

1518
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Because like the earth head satellite

1519
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
Previous

1520
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
For example, China's wind cloud

1521
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Satellite

1522
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Then

1523
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
With the latest

1524
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Australian space

1525
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Is it Australia?

1526
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Let's call it the sunny track 8

1527
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Then

1528
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Their resolution

1529
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
It's not the same

1530
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
You have to ask me

1531
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
That number

1532
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
I personally

1533
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
Because I am

1534
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Touch mode

1535
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I didn't touch the satellite

1536
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
My resolution to them

1537
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
To what extent

1538
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I am

1539
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
No impression

1540
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,800
But if you need

1541
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Just

1542
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
What do you want to see my painting?

1543
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,800
I can only insert it for you

1544
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
But my impression is not too low

1545
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,800
That is

1546
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Uh

1547
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Is there a few hundred meters?

1548
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Then their resolution is probably a few hundred meters

1549
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,800
100 meters or 40 meters

1550
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Super cool

1551
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,800
So the next question he asks is

1552
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,800
So as the initial condition

1553
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,800
Data input

1554
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Will the resolution be higher than the simulation?

1555
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Uh

1556
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
Right

1557
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Oh

1558
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Correct

1559
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Because this is actually with me

1560
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
What I was thinking was a bit similar

1561
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
What I was thinking was

1562
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
Because you observe the limit of resolution

1563
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
So what you know

1564
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,800
The limit is actually this big

1565
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
and so

1566
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,800
I think it can be

1567
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
You input the initial condition

1568
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Then put it at this level

1569
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Smear it

1570
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
It's more reasonable

1571
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
You don't know

1572
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
Then run a lot of ensembles

1573
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Then go and see

1574
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Do you have this smear

1575
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
How much

1576
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Influence

1577
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,800
But it seems

1578
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
It will take a lot of time

1579
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,800
Yes, there is no way

1580
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
Do it before the valid time

1581
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
I guess

1582
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Um

1583
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,800
What you are talking about

1584
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
Uh, what the atmosphere is doing is

1585
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Data synchronization

1586
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,800
Simple

1587
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
His name is called data synchronization

1588
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,800
In other words

1589
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
This is

1590
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,800
It's almost the same as what you said

1591
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
That is

1592
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Uh

1593
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,800
At the beginning of atmospheric simulation

1594
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
There will be a global

1595
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
Global mode

1596
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
Its resolution will be about 20 kilometers

1597
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
About 10 kilometers

1598
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Then it forecasts the whole world

1599
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Then

1600
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
After he ran

1601
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
It will be based on satellites

1602
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
And then the radars all over the place

1603
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
Aerial balloons all over the place

1604
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
We will be on the ground

1605
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,800
A small balloon

1606
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Then the blue instrument hanging below

1607
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,800
Then up

1608
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Then they will collect this vertical

1609
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Temperature pressure

1610
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Wind speed

1611
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
He will collect such information

1612
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Then go

1613
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Tell this global mode

1614
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,800
Uh, where am I

1615
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
What is his observation

1616
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Then he will follow this observation

1617
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,800
Correction mode

1618
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Then this global mode

1619
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,800
Will be after the calculation

1620
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,800
Cut

1621
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Send to various places

1622
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Then come to the area mode

1623
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
Like the one I'm using now

1624
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
This is the area mode

1625
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Then his

1626
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,800
The resolution will be higher than the global mode

1627
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
20 kilometers

1628
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,800
That's what you just said

1629
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,800
I think that's it

1630
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Then he put

1631
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
Observation data transmission mode

1632
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
This thing

1633
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
It's called data transmission

1634
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Hey

1635
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
Is anyone talking?

1636
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,800
No, no, I'm listening to you

1637
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,800
Oh, I want to say my microphone

1638
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
Is it

1639
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Because no one is talking

1640
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
So he

1641
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
The system is closed

1642
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,800
No, no, no, no, no, no

1643
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
OK, that

1644
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
We have 4 minutes

1645
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
Is there any other question?

1646
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
Is

1647
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Is it just doing numerical?

1648
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Or the question of atmospheric

1649
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,800
In addition to

1650
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
In fact, the question we asked should be

1651
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Asked almost

1652
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
So do you have any games?

1653
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
More scientific questions

1654
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Or have their own interests

1655
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,800
Just ask

1656
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
For example, let me show you one.

1657
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Just

1658
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
I am actually curious about one thing.

1659
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Is this

1660
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
This one

1661
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
Let me talk about the objective prediction.

1662
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
Have

1663
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,800
How big a chance

1664
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
Will be adopted by the government

1665
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
Or they are

1666
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,800
Anyway, they are

1667
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,800
After reading the data, I still have to tell you

1668
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,800
There is no problem with this return screen. We want to build a house.

1669
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Or they will really refer to professional advice.

1670
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,800
Because

1671
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Uh

1672
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
The disaster prevention units are probably divided into

1673
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,800
layers

1674
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
Is generally in contact with the people

1675
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Is the Central Meteorological Bureau

1676
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,800
The things that the Central Meteorological Bureau releases to the people

1677
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Must be credible

1678
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,800
To a certain extent

1679
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
He can only be released

1680
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
But

1681
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
But if you want to fight for validity

1682
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Is to become a disaster prevention unit

1683
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
Then he must have a little understanding of the weather.

1684
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,800
For example, he knows

1685
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,800
The credibility of the forecast a few days ago

1686
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Uh, for reference

1687
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,800
How about a few days later

1688
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,800
I did this set of things.

1689
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Is for the disaster prevention unit

1690
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
Use

1691
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
I don't seem to have answered your question.

1692
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
I think

1693
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
Are you asking

1694
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
But my question is more like

1695
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,800
That

1696
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
The chiefs who decided to take a vacation

1697
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
Does he have a weather forecast?

1698
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,800
Or is he just looking at it?

1699
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Uh

1700
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Basically should have

1701
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
I know Taipei City has it.

1702
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
but

1703
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
I don't think it's safe.

1704
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Uh, don't keep talking.

1705
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
Because we are still recording

1706
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
That one

1707
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,800
A very good question

1708
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
I think it's very interesting

1709
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
We all know that you want to run this numerical

1710
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
You have to enter the initial condition

1711
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Then let him propagate

1712
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
To have a border condition

1713
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
He just came from the global model.

1714
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
As I just said a few minutes ago

1715
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
He is running a global model first.

1716
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
Then the global model

1717
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
He is another model

1718
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
He doesn't need a border condition.

1719
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Should be round

1720
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
He is that

1721
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
Symmetry

1722
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
Will be connected

1723
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
But because of the range

1724
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
Will grow

1725
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
He is

1726
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Then he needs to be initialized

1727
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
OK

1728
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
Let me repeat the question he just asked.

1729
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Because I just saw it directly.

1730
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,800
His question is actually weather simulation

1731
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Do you need a border condition?

1732
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
Because we actually see it now.

1733
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
It's all a frame and you have Taiwan.

1734
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,800
But if you say

1735
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
This frame is windless

1736
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
It's not very reasonable, so this is a pretty good question.

1737
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,800
I just told you what the question was.

1738
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Ok, now it's just 7 o'clock.

1739
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Do you have any questions?

1740
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
If there is no problem

1741
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,800
I will announce it again.

1742
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,800
When you clap, you have to turn on the microphone.

1743
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,800
Only the speaker can hear

1744
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Let's applaud again, thank you Xinhao.

1745
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,800
Thank you

1746
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Stop recording
