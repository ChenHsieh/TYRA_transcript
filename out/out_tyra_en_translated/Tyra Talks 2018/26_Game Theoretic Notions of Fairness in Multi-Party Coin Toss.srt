00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to today's Tera Talk.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're honored to have Lin Weikai with us today.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Lin Weikai has been a good friend of mine for many years.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Lin Weikai is now a third-year PhD student at Cornell,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
majoring in Computer Science.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Lin's research focuses on cryptography.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
His main focus is on Oblivious algorithm.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This allows the algorithm to store data without revealing the content.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He majored in Chemistry when he was a college student.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He majored in Computer Science when he was a master's student.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He majored in Computer Science when he was a master's student.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Before his PhD,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
he worked as a software engineer at Chengxin.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He also worked as a research assistant at the Central Academy of Sciences.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What Lin is going to talk about today is the concept of Oblivious algorithm.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But today, he's going to talk about a new definition of

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
the fairness of multiparty coin tossing.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
By the way, remember to turn on the microphone when you clap.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you for such a wonderful introduction.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The title is complicated,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but I assume most of you have heard of the theorem of the game.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Today's topic is

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the concept of coin toss.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm going to talk about the relationship between coin toss and the theorem of the game.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This work was done by Zhong Kaimin at the Central Academy of Sciences.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Guo Yue, Rafael, and I are both at Cornell.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Cornell Tech is a campus at NYC.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Cornell has a new campus at NYC.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's talk about the topic of coin toss today.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The motivation of this research is very realistic.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Although I usually do theoretical research,

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
our motivation is very realistic.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What is the motivation?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Trump and Xi want to hold a summit.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Where will it be held?

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Trump wants to hold it in DC.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Xi wants to hold it in Beijing.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If these two people can't get along,

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
what should they do?

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The easiest way is to make a decision by tossing a coin.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If these two people can't get along,

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
how can they toss a coin?

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is a tricky question we are going to discuss today.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If these two people can't get along, how can they toss a coin?

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's not talk about whether the coin toss will be fair or not.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If they can't get along,

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
if Trump tosses a coin here,

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xi won't believe it even if he doesn't see it.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So what should they do?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If I have a way to toss a coin,

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
a way to toss a coin remotely,

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
if the coin tosses out,

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Xi is in DC,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Xi is in Beijing.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If the coin tosses out remotely is fair,

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
everyone will be happy.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Half and half chance.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In the game,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
someone will tell you that there is a payoff.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What is the coin toss?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Which side has how many payoffs or utilities?

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But let's not talk about this.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In history,

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
there is a hotline between the United States and the Soviet Union.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe there is also a hotline between Trump and Xi.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If they don't meet, they can talk on the phone.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If there is a question in the middle,

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
you can interrupt me at any time.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I hope everyone can understand what I am talking about today.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you don't understand,

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
don't be afraid.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Try to ask.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The purpose of the hotline is that

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you say one sentence, I say one sentence,

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and the other party can hear what I say.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then there is nothing else.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So the hotline can't help you directly

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
toss a coin.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not such a good thing.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But what can the hotline do?

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The hotline can communicate on both sides.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After the communication,

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the hotline may have an output.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
B is equal to 0 or B is equal to 1.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's the same side.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The hotline can do this.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It can help you create a random variable.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Its value is 0 or 1.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The probability is 0.5 or 0.5.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What I want is to get a random variable.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's a random variable defined by math.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you are familiar with the random variables defined by math,

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
or you've heard of it in class,

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have a way to get the two sides to toss a coin.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How do you do it?

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Trump throws a coin first.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The coin is 1.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then Trump says to Xi on the phone,

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
my coin is 1.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then Xi says,

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I got it.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your coin is 1.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then both sides agree that the coin is 1.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If Trump throws a fair coin,

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
this method may work.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But Xi is obviously not happy.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If Trump is a bad guy,

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and he didn't throw the coin at all,

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
it's not a good thing for Xi.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He won't agree with the result of the coin toss.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't say that Trump made a mistake at the beginning,

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and made it unfair.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Even if he made a very complicated LeTouJi,

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and recorded it,

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and sent it to Xi through a hotline,

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Xi won't believe it.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If Trump didn't cheat,

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it may work.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But neither side believes each other.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is a common problem in cryptography.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If neither side doesn't believe each other,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
what should we do?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
A long time ago,

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
there was a technology called commit.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Trump first calculated a number X

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
using SHA.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then he told Xi.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This thing is called commit.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Xi said,

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you calculated X, I calculated Y,

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and then E.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then Trump said,

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
my X is below E,

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and then he made a mess.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In order to hide the E at the beginning.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then these two sides,

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
X and Y, XOR,

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
is the result of the coin toss.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In cryptography,

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
these two things are simplified

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
into commit and open.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That is,

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
he wrote an X,

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and then sealed it in the envelope to Xi.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
After Xi received it,

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
he opened the envelope.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The purpose of the envelope

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is to prevent the person

151
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
who wrote the envelope from changing.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The person who received the envelope

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
can't see it for the time being.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is called commit and open.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In the past...

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have a question.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Does this hotline

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
have a rule

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that you have to do it one by one?

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Can't you say it at the same time?

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you say it at the same time,

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
everyone says 1, 2, 3,

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and I say 1 or 0,

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and everyone says XOR.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is a very good question.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But because everyone doesn't believe it,

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
they might say it slowly.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So...

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This hotline

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
has a rule

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that you have to do it one by one.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't say it at the same time.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can't say it at the same time.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I should say that

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I didn't assume

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that this hotline

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
had to do it one by one.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But Trump and Xi agreed

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and...

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If someone says it slowly,

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
what should you do?

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do it again?

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, yes.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then it will be endless.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay, good.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Also,

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
when we imagine a hotline,

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
we can't judge

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
who says it slowly.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because of the message delay,

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
we can't be sure

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
who says it slowly.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If we do it one by one,

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
we can be sure of the order.

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay, got it.

196
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So,

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
at the same time,

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
on the internet,

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
it's hard to judge.

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a good question.

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's say

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
all the protocols

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
are one by one.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And the order is...

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay,

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
then,

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
this thing,

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
this commit and open,

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
if you have a good commit,

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
when you commit,

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the other side can't be opened.

212
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And the other side of the bus

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
can't be tampered with.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then this thing,

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this coin toss thing,

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
can be done fairly.

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Because when it commits to x in advance,

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it doesn't know what will happen to y.

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And when it commits to y,

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it doesn't know what x is.

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So,

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
the result will be

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
fair.

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And

225
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
we can be sure

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the other side can't tamper with the result.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Then,

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
this thing,

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
we've been talking about fairness.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What kind of fairness

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
do we want?

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The formal definition of

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
mathematics is

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the expected value is 0.5.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The result of the commit is only 0 and 1.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And the probability is 0.5.

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So the expected value is

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
0.5 times 0 plus 0.5 times 1

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
equals 0.5.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I want the expected value

241
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to be exactly 0.5.

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Then,

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
if you look at this thing carefully,

244
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
it's not exactly 0.5.

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll talk about this later.

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So it usually adds

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
a very small fraction,

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
negligible.

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But let's leave it alone.

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I just want 0.5.

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Then,

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
this thing,

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
unfortunately,

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
in the

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
previous result,

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
a long time ago,

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
about 30 years ago,

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
what can't we do?

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This

260
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
adversary,

261
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
like Trump or Xi,

262
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
can end

263
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
earlier.

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This protocol is not finished yet.

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He said I'm not going to play like this.

266
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
this adversary

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
is

269
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
only when there is a limited

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
computing power,

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
this

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
protocol,

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
this is easier for the protocol

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to do.

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's assume that Trump and Xi

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
have limited

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
computing power.

278
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's all polynomial time

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
algorithm.

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This polynomial time,

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you may not be familiar with it,

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
but

283
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you can make a decision

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
within a few seconds.

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
any

287
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
protocol like this,

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in the result of this cliff,

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
it can design

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
an attacker to crack

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
any protocol.

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to achieve the expected value

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
is exactly 0.5,

295
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
no protocol can do it.

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The result is

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
such a strong impossibility.

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That is to say,

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
no protocol can do this.

300
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In this way,

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
let's take a look at this example.

302
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Just

303
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
commit and open this example.

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Here,

305
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
we are using the

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
new hash function.

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's not new, it's about

308
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
more than ten years.

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So far, everyone still believes that SHA-256

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
is difficult to crack.

311
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
For example,

312
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Bitcoin is still in use.

313
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
How to

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
crack it?

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Xi's

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
computing power is

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
infinite,

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
he can easily

320
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
decrypt SHA-256x

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
which is equal to a certain number.

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
As long as he violently

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
tries all the x,

324
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
he can decrypt the x.

325
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
After Xi knows

326
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the value of x,

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
he can choose a relative y

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
so that the result is what he likes.

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
For example, he likes 0.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
0 represents Beijing.

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So when he sees that the value of x is 1,

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
he chooses a y

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
so that the result is Beijing.

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Trump doesn't know

335
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that he was fooled.

336
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He can only delete 1.

337
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The result is what Xi wants.

338
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
if

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
one of them

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
has

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
infinite computing power,

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
something may happen.

344
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
what I said last time

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
is even stronger.

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Even if Xi only has

348
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
limited computing power,

349
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
he can still attack.

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How effective

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
this attack method

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
can be?

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It can make the expectation value

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
deviate

355
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
to any

356
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
deviation

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to any

358
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
deviation

359
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to any

360
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
deviation

361
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
to any

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
1 in three rounds.

363
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
1 in three rounds.

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The number of attacks

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
is about 1 in three rounds.

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is a very powerful attack.

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
For example,

369
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
For example,

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
For example,

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the attacker

372
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
has infinite computing power.

373
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He can make

374
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
his expectation value

375
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
deviate to 0.5.

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He can choose

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
what he wants.

378
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But if he only has

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
limited computing power,

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
he can't

381
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
make the expectation value

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
deviate so much, but he can

383
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
deviate to a certain number,

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
which is 1 in three rounds.

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I just gave a random number,

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
but according to this protocol,

387
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
it is about 1 in three rounds.

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The expectation value is 1 in three rounds.

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
From 0.5 to 0.5 plus 1 in three rounds

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
is 0.8.

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
the result of

393
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
cleave is very strong.

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You can't make a fair copy.

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Because no matter what protocol,

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
it can create an attacker.

397
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Then

398
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
make an effective attack in a limited time.

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
here

401
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
There is another thing

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to talk about this attack.

403
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This

404
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What kind of

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
impact will it have at the beginning and end?

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
For example,

407
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
at the beginning, I talked about the simplest

408
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
protocol.

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Trump threw a copper plate,

410
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and Xi Jinping received it and

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
admitted that it was a copper plate.

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He admitted the result of the copper plate.

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This thing

414
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
has a fail-stop.

415
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
If one of them

416
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
can end early

417
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and not late,

418
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
it is difficult to achieve

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
a fair result.

420
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
For example, Trump threw a copper plate,

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and he saw this copper plate

422
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
was not what he liked.

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He said, then I won't play.

424
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Then

425
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
this

426
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If you don't play, Xi Jinping

427
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So far

428
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
we still assume that he is

429
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
honest

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
to follow the game rules at the beginning.

431
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He received

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
a copper plate message

433
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and then he

434
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
admitted that the message of the copper plate

435
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
was their consensus.

436
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But

437
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
one of them is not late,

438
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
what is the other party's consensus?

439
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is

440
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
difficult to say.

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In order to have a consensus,

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
we usually have to define

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
one of them

444
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is not honest and not late.

445
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What should the other party say?

446
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Xi Jinping

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
threw a copper plate

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and it was 0.5.

449
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Or he has to

450
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
fix the output

451
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
0 or 1

452
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's hard to say.

453
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Trump

454
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
can see what he is doing

455
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
honestly

456
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and decide

457
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
when to end

458
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and when not to end.

459
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The entire output

460
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
is completely controlled

461
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
by the dishonest

462
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
party.

463
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Then

464
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
there is no fairness

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
or

466
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
security.

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The result of this copper plate

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
output

469
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
its fairness is the security

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I want.

471
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
the focus here is

473
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
this

474
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
computationally bounded

475
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
the attacker's

476
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
computing power is limited

477
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and it can end early

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
these two things.

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If one of them is missing

480
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we all know

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
we all know

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
it can be done

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If I assume

484
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
the attacker will never

485
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
end early

486
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
then this copper plate

487
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
can be played

488
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
up to 0.5

489
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
but these two conditions

490
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
these two computationally bounded

491
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and failstop

492
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
when these two conditions exist at the same time

493
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
we can't do it.

494
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And the proof that we can't do it

495
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
is to really build a

496
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
attacker

497
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and then target

498
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
any protocol

499
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
to attack.

500
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So

501
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
but

502
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
but

503
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
when you look at the first page

504
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you may find it

505
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
strange

506
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
if Trump can't end early

507
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
then Xi Jinping can

508
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
say I like to be in Beijing

509
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
then I will be in Beijing.

510
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is

511
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
another definition

512
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
of

513
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
the focus

514
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hello

515
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Hello

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Is my connection broken?

517
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can't hear you.

518
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ok

519
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So

520
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Can you hear me?

521
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I can't hear you.

522
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can hear you.

523
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But

524
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I can't hear the speaker.

525
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Ok

526
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Ok

527
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So the connection is broken.

528
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let me contact him.

529
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello

530
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Can you hear me?

531
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I can hear you.

532
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I can hear you.

533
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I can hear you.

534
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
How are you?

535
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I can't hear you.

536
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I am scared.

537
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I can't hear you.

538
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't hear you.

539
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,020
So

540
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,020
I call you

541
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,020
because

542
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
I can't hear you.

543
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
I can't hear you.

544
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I can't hear you.

545
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
I can't hear you.

546
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,020
Can you hear me?

547
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
I can hear you.

548
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
I can hear you.

549
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
I think my internet is down.

550
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
I don't know where I am.

551
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,020
I just

552
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,020
talk about

553
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
the commit and open

554
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
protocol can

555
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
protect

556
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
good people.

557
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,020
And

558
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
why this protocol

559
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
can protect good people?

560
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
If

561
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
one side

562
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,020
can't finish early,

563
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,020
the other side

564
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,020
will be happy to say

565
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
the other side is bad

566
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
so I can

567
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
protect my own interests

568
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
to protect the interests of good people.

569
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
So I will

570
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
produce the result

571
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,020
that good people like.

572
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Because

573
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
the other side can't finish early.

574
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,020
And

575
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,020
this

576
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,020
is just

577
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,020
one example.

578
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
Of course, you can also

579
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
let the other side finish early

580
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
and Trump

581
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
will choose the result he likes.

582
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
This is another case.

583
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
In short,

584
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,020
the commit and open

585
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,020
protocol

586
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,020
can

587
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,020
guarantee

588
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
the

589
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,020
previous definition.

590
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Even if

591
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
one side is attacking

592
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
and the other side's expectation

593
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,020
is still over 0.5,

594
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
the payoff is still over 0.5.

595
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
Because

596
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,020
the basic idea

597
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,020
is simple.

598
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,020
If one side can't finish early,

599
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,020
the other side will be happy

600
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
to choose the result he likes.

601
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
He can choose.

602
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,020
So

603
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
if one side can't finish early,

604
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,020
the other side is

605
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
a good person.

606
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,020
If a good person chooses the result he likes,

607
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
his expectation value will not be

608
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,020
reduced by bad people.

609
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Is it okay

610
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
to go this far?

611
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
If it's okay,

612
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,020
it will be a little more complicated later.

613
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
But

614
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,020
the most important thing to define here

615
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,020
is to protect the expectation value of good people.

616
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,020
And the payoff

617
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
is the most important point.

618
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
First,

619
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
we need to define

620
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
what a good person is.

621
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Second,

622
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
what a payoff is.

623
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
The payoff is

624
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,020
the protocol.

625
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
After running the result,

626
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,020
I look at the result and decide

627
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
how much benefit this result will bring me.

628
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Then

629
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
I define

630
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
that I want to protect the interests of good people.

631
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,020
The expectation value is greater than a certain number.

632
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Of course,

633
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
if I say a little more here,

634
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,020
the payoff

635
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,020
is completely

636
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
restricted to

637
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
the payoff function

638
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
defined by this example.

639
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
The payoff function itself is very simple.

640
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
But

641
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
in Game Theory,

642
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
there are many strange payoffs

643
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
that will make

644
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
these results strange.

645
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,020
But we won't discuss those today.

646
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,020
Even in my paper,

647
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
there is no way to discuss so much

648
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
because there are too many strange payoffs.

649
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
But the simplest

650
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
payoff function

651
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
is the focus

652
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
of this paper.

653
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Okay,

654
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,020
next,

655
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,020
next,

656
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
well,

657
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
well,

658
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,020
well,

659
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
what you see here

660
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
is that there are only two players

661
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
and two parties

662
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
playing.

663
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
The two parties

664
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
can achieve

665
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
the fairness

666
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
in this

667
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,020
fairness in interest.

668
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,020
The result

669
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
may not be fair,

670
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,020
but the interest is fair.

671
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
Then we start.

672
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,020
But a very natural question is

673
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
when

674
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
you add one more person,

675
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,020
is there any way

676
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
to achieve

677
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,020
the fairness?

678
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
So we just

679
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,020
add one more person.

680
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Then

681
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
I don't know if the third person

682
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,020
is Jin Xiaopang or

683
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,020
Putin.

684
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
Anyway, it's A, B, C.

685
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,020
Then

686
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
we assume the simplest

687
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,020
is

688
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
what kind of output

689
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
do these three people like

690
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,020
is public.

691
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,020
It's also public

692
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
who aborts early and

693
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
doesn't play early.

694
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
So if C aborts early

695
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
and doesn't play,

696
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
A and B will not play

697
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,020
sooner or later.

698
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
So let's assume

699
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,020
all the messages are public.

700
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,020
Maybe you can imagine

701
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,020
three hotlines or something.

702
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Or

703
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
now this very popular

704
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,020
blockchain

705
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
messages are all public.

706
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
So if one of them doesn't play

707
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
or if one of them sends

708
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
a message, the other two can

709
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
know at the same time.

710
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,020
One of the possible applications

711
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,020
may be

712
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,020
eating dumplings and tigers

713
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
on the blockchain.

714
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
But how do these three people define

715
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,020
eating dumplings and tigers?

716
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
You can also say

717
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
the result of

718
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
eating dumplings and tigers

719
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
is 1.

720
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
If the person who chose 1

721
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
is 1,

722
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,020
then he won.

723
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,020
If the person who chose 0 is 0,

724
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
he also won.

725
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
Of course, this payoff is not

726
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,020
0.3. So in some cases,

727
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,020
the seller of

728
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
eating dumplings and tigers may lose money.

729
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,020
And the loser is not ABC.

730
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,020
It's the one who

731
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,020
opened the casino.

732
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
This is just

733
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
one example.

734
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
But

735
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,020
in terms of game theory,

736
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
there are many

737
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
forms of this game.

738
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
But for now,

739
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
let's focus

740
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
on this

741
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
simplest example.

742
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
I just want to

743
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
ask

744
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
to protect the

745
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
real

746
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
interest.

747
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Can we do this?

748
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Then

749
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
this definition

750
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
we call it Maximin.

751
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Maximin is also

752
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
a terminology borrowed

753
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
from game theory.

754
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
In the game,

755
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
Maximin means

756
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,020
everyone

757
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
maximizes

758
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
their own

759
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
interest.

760
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
I want to

761
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,020
minimize

762
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,020
my own interest.

763
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Basically,

764
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
it means

765
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
when others maximize

766
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,020
their interest,

767
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
I want to maximize

768
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
my own interest.

769
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Why is it called Maximin?

770
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Because if one side is maximized

771
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
and the other side is minimized.

772
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Anyway,

773
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
intuition

774
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
means

775
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,020
I want to protect good people.

776
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Good people

777
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
are people who play according to the rules of the game.

778
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
The interest of good people

779
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
should be greater than or equal to 0.5.

780
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,020
This is the expectation value.

781
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,020
After this thing is defined,

782
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,020
the first question we ask is

783
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
whether it can be done.

784
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Of course, there are other definitions

785
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,020
of Maximin.

786
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Some are very natural.

787
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Some may seem

788
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,020
unnatural in some scenarios.

789
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,020
But we'll talk about it

790
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
later.

791
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
For now,

792
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
let's focus on

793
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,020
the definition of

794
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,020
protecting good people's interests.

795
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,020
Let's pause here.

796
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,020
Is this definition clear?

797
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,020
My definition is

798
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,020
that my protocol

799
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
should protect good people's interests.

800
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
This is my definition.

801
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
Then I ask

802
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
whether this protocol

803
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,020
can be constructed

804
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
to protect good people's interests.

805
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
I have a question.

806
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
You said

807
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
we should protect

808
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
according to the rules of the game.

809
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
This is a starting point

810
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,020
of your research.

811
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,020
I can understand this.

812
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
The concept of

813
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
protecting good people's interests

814
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,020
is translated to

815
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
greater than or equal to 0.5

816
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,020
for the expected payoff

817
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
of honesty.

818
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
You said your game

819
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
is not zero-sum.

820
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
Is greater than or equal to 0.5

821
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
greater than or equal to 0.5?

822
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
You asked

823
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
a good question.

824
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I don't write

825
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
a quantifier here.

826
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
For example,

827
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
A, B, C are all honest.

828
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
They all follow the rules of the game.

829
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
Then

830
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
everyone's

831
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,020
expected value is 0.5.

832
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
So you will ask

833
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
the total expected value is 0.5.

834
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
So I

835
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
don't have a quantifier here.

836
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
It's just that

837
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
every honest is greater than 0.5.

838
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
Oh, I see.

839
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
I define

840
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
it as

841
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
A, B, C

842
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
all follow the rules of the game.

843
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,020
But they

844
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,020
may not

845
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
care about each other.

846
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
They may not like each other.

847
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,020
But they all follow the rules of the game.

848
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,020
They are all good people.

849
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,020
So the better way

850
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
is that

851
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,020
if I follow the rules of the game,

852
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,020
it's my best choice

853
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,020
among the players.

854
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,020
This question

855
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,020
will become another definition.

856
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,020
What you just said will become another definition.

857
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
So we'll

858
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,020
discuss it later.

859
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
OK, thank you.

860
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
OK, so

861
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
if

862
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
this definition

863
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,020
is not a problem,

864
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,020
then we can

865
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,020
discuss

866
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
a simple example.

867
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
When everyone

868
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
wants the result to be

869
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
1, or everyone

870
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,020
wants the result to be 0,

871
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,020
then

872
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
this thing

873
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,020
is extremely simple.

874
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,020
This thing

875
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,020
is extremely simple.

876
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,020
As long as

877
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,020
everyone sees

878
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020
the same side number,

879
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
then everyone outputs

880
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,020
the same side number.

881
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020
As long as everyone sees

882
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
the same side number,

883
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,020
then everyone outputs 1.

884
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,020
Then everyone is happy.

885
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,020
For example,

886
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
if everyone wants the result

887
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,020
to be 1,

888
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,020
then everyone outputs 1.

889
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
The dealer

890
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
in the casino is not happy,

891
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,020
but the rules of the game

892
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,020
are set.

893
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,020
The players are happy

894
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,020
because everyone can win.

895
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
But this example is not very interesting.

896
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
Because

897
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,020
if

898
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,020
Trump, Xi and Putin

899
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,020
all want to go to DC,

900
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
then

901
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,020
they don't need to discuss this thing.

902
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,020
They are happy to go to DC.

903
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
So

904
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
this case is not interesting.

905
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,020
Let's change to

906
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,020
a more complicated one.

907
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,020
If one of the players

908
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
has a different side number,

909
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,020
he is a minority.

910
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,020
But

911
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,020
I assume

912
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,020
the bad guy who doesn't follow the rules of the game

913
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,020
can only do one thing,

914
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,020
which is

915
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,020
he can't play earlier.

916
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,020
I also have

917
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,020
a slightly more complicated

918
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
rule of the game

919
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
that can protect

920
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
the interests of good people.

921
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,020
How to do this rule of the game?

922
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,020
It's very simple.

923
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Let the minority throw the coin.

924
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,020
After throwing the coin,

925
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,020
he tells the result of the coin

926
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,020
to the other two players.

927
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
Then the other two players

928
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,020
are very happy to receive the coin.

929
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
Then the game is over.

930
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Why

931
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,020
can this rule of the game

932
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,020
protect the interests of good people?

933
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Because

934
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
this game only forces

935
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
one person to speak from the beginning to the end,

936
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
which is the minority.

937
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
If the minority

938
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,020
speaks,

939
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,020
he follows the rules of the game.

940
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,020
If he wants to speak,

941
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
he must follow the rules of the game.

942
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
Otherwise, he will shut up.

943
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
If he speaks,

944
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
it means he follows the rules of the game.

945
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
This coin is also

946
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
fair.

947
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
After the other two players

948
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
receive the coin,

949
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
they follow the rules of the game.

950
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Because

951
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
everything is fair

952
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,020
according to the rules of the game.

953
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,020
If the only person

954
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,020
who speaks

955
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
does not follow the rules of the game,

956
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,020
how can he not follow the rules of the game?

957
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,020
He can only

958
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,020
shut up.

959
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,020
He does not say what he should say.

960
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,020
This is his only way

961
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
not to follow the rules of the game.

962
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
When A and C see B

963
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
do not follow the rules of the game,

964
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,020
they are happy to decide that B is a bad person.

965
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
A and C can be happy to say

966
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
that we do not care

967
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,020
about the loss of the bad person.

968
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
We just follow our happiness.

969
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
So

970
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,020
what I just

971
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
talked about

972
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
is to prove

973
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
that the rules of the game

974
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,020
can easily protect

975
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,020
the interests of good people.

976
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
So

977
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,020
if the only thing

978
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,020
bad people can do

979
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
is not to play,

980
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
this thing is also easy to do.

981
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
Just

982
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
as I just said,

983
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
throw a coin, send a message,

984
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
and it's over.

985
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,020
But

986
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,020
these examples

987
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,020
of Trump and Xi

988
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,020
or Putin

989
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,020
are not like this.

990
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
They may

991
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,020
not follow the rules of the game,

992
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,020
not throw a coin,

993
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,020
so

994
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,020
the previous one, B

995
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
threw a coin and sent a message,

996
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
this thing is

997
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,020
that the bad guy

998
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
may not follow this rule at all.

999
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,020
And

1000
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
if he doesn't follow this rule,

1001
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,020
then

1002
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,020
he can't protect

1003
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
the interests of good people.

1004
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
This is what we call

1005
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,020
random

1006
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,020
input.

1007
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
This is what we call

1008
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
random input.

1009
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,020
This is what we call

1010
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
random input.

1011
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,020
Everything is not fair

1012
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,020
when it is tampered with.

1013
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,020
And

1014
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,020
And

1015
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,020
And

1016
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
the main difficulty

1017
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
of this project is

1018
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
to discuss

1019
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
whether this case

1020
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
is fair

1021
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,020
to Maximin.

1022
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,020
And

1023
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,020
And

1024
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,020
We

1025
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,020
We

1026
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
spent a lot of time

1027
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,020
We spent a lot of time

1028
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
discussing whether he can do it or not.

1029
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
We can't think of a way

1030
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
to really do this thing

1031
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,020
to protect

1032
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
honest players.

1033
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
But we can't prove

1034
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
that he can't do it.

1035
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
So we can't do this thing.

1036
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
At the beginning,

1037
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
we thought he could do it.

1038
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,020
The reason is

1039
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
The reason is

1040
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,020
The reason is

1041
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
When bad guys

1042
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,020
When bad guys

1043
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,020
are restricted,

1044
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
there is a solution.

1045
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
There are

1046
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,020
many technologies

1047
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
on traditional documents

1048
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
that allow

1049
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
that allow

1050
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
a simple example

1051
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
that allows a simple example

1052
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
to resist

1053
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,020
the restricted bad guys.

1054
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
And then,

1055
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
we get a

1056
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
cryptographic operation

1057
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
and get a

1058
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
protocol that

1059
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
the bad guys are not restricted

1060
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
but still safe.

1061
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
This is called the game rule.

1062
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Because

1063
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
there are a lot of experiences in our documents,

1064
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
we can upgrade

1065
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,020
this security

1066
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
in different situations.

1067
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
So when we first

1068
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
saw this problem,

1069
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
we can upgrade

1070
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,020
the security

1071
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
with what we already know

1072
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
or what we already know

1073
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
in the documents.

1074
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,020
But

1075
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
later on,

1076
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
we moved more documents

1077
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
and finally proved that

1078
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
it can't be done.

1079
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
And

1080
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
especially

1081
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,020
the bad guys

1082
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,020
can't be done

1083
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
like

1084
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
what I said earlier

1085
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,020
about the result of cleave.

1086
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
We really built

1087
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
a

1088
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
limited time attacker

1089
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,020
a polynomial time attacker

1090
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,020
to attack

1091
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
any

1092
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
protocol like this.

1093
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,020
And

1094
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
the middle proof is more complicated.

1095
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,020
I won't talk about it.

1096
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,020
But

1097
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
the point is

1098
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
these protocols

1099
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
can't be done

1100
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
in a lot of situations.

1101
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
And the proof

1102
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
is

1103
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
the proof

1104
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
taught in high school or

1105
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,020
university math class.

1106
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,020
The technical details

1107
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
in the middle

1108
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
are skipped.

1109
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
But I think

1110
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
this

1111
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
thing

1112
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
should be

1113
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
conveyed.

1114
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
I defined

1115
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
a

1116
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
so-called

1117
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
fair board

1118
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
for a

1119
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,020
specific payoff function.

1120
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,020
This is very specific.

1121
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
I have countless payoff functions.

1122
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,020
Only this

1123
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
payoff function

1124
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
can't be

1125
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
fair.

1126
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
Maybe other payoff functions can.

1127
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,020
Because

1128
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
some payoff functions

1129
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
are easy to do.

1130
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
For example, if everyone's payoff looks the same,

1131
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
it may

1132
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,020
degenerate to a

1133
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
case I just discussed.

1134
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,020
And

1135
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,020
the so-called

1136
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,020
profit of the city

1137
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,020
is defined

1138
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,020
in this way.

1139
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,020
So there must be

1140
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,020
some way to define

1141
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,020
the profit.

1142
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,020
But even in such a simple way

1143
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,020
to define

1144
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020
the profit,

1145
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,020
there is still

1146
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,020
no way to

1147
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,020
protect the profit.

1148
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,020
This is the message

1149
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
I want to convey.

1150
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,020
And

1151
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,020
one more thing.

1152
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,020
Even if

1153
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,020
the attacker has limited computing power,

1154
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,020
it still can't be protected.

1155
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,020
If your attacker

1156
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,020
has very limited

1157
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
computing power,

1158
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,020
you still can't

1159
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,020
protect the city's

1160
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,020
profit.

1161
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,020
So

1162
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,020
what I just said

1163
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,020
is back to the first example.

1164
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,020
Where should

1165
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,020
Trump and Xi meet?

1166
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,020
They can decide.

1167
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,020
But

1168
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,020
when one person becomes the third person,

1169
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,020
and Putin is added,

1170
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,020
there is no way to

1171
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,020
protect the city's profit.

1172
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,020
This is the

1173
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,020
biggest message

1174
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,020
I want to convey.

1175
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
There must be

1176
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
one or two people

1177
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,020
whose profits will be damaged.

1178
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,020
And

1179
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,020
the witness here

1180
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,020
is very complicated.

1181
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
But

1182
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,020
it's just a simple

1183
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,020
expected value calculation.

1184
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,020
But there are a few more turns.

1185
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,020
But

1186
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,020
I won't

1187
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,020
talk about

1188
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,020
the details.

1189
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,020
So

1190
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,020
to sum up,

1191
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,020
more than three people

1192
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
can be grouped

1193
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,020
into

1194
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,020
a larger

1195
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
organization.

1196
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,020
For example,

1197
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
if I have

1198
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,020
ten people,

1199
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,020
I can group

1200
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,020
them into

1201
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,020
three large groups.

1202
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,020
If

1203
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,020
the three large groups

1204
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,020
correspond to

1205
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,020
what I just said,

1206
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,020
they still can't

1207
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,020
do it.

1208
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,020
Or if I can

1209
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,020
correspond to two people,

1210
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,020
I can tell you

1211
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,020
the result of

1212
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,020
Cliff earlier.

1213
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,020
So

1214
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,020
this...

1215
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,020
Actually I was going to ask

1216
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,020
if you keep saying

1217
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,020
you have three parties

1218
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
and you want to generalize

1219
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,020
what N-Party will do.

1220
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,020
Intuitively,

1221
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,020
it makes sense.

1222
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,020
If you can group them

1223
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,020
into three parties,

1224
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,020
you can reduce the problem.

1225
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,020
But if you say

1226
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,020
the bad guys

1227
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,020
can be grouped

1228
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,020
into a group of bad guys,

1229
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,020
you still have to assume

1230
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,020
the bad guys

1231
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,020
are good to each other.

1232
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,020
They are honest.

1233
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,020
So the shared information

1234
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,020
is what they are doing.

1235
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,020
They know

1236
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,020
each other is breaking the rule.

1237
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,020
Yes.

1238
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,020
Your question is very good.

1239
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,020
So I will

1240
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,020
jump a little bit

1241
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,020
to talk about

1242
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,020
high-level.

1243
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,020
I assume

1244
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,020
the bad guys

1245
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,020
I mentioned

1246
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,020
are

1247
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,020
good guys

1248
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,020
and bad guys.

1249
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,020
The bad guys

1250
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,020
have

1251
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,020
a common...

1252
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,020
What is it called?

1253
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,020
For example,

1254
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,020
they have

1255
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,020
a bad guy

1256
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,020
controlling them.

1257
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,020
So your question is

1258
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,020
maybe

1259
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,020
the bad guys A

1260
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,020
and bad guys B

1261
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,020
have different interests.

1262
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,020
So they

1263
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,020
control each other.

1264
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,020
So far,

1265
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,020
I assume

1266
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,020
the bad guys A

1267
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,020
and bad guys B

1268
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,020
have a bad guy leader.

1269
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,020
Maybe he is not

1270
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,020
in the game.

1271
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,020
But he is the leader of the bad guys.

1272
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,020
He controls all the bad guys.

1273
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,020
All the bad guys

1274
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,020
cooperate with each other.

1275
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,020
So

1276
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,020
for the

1277
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,020
bad guys

1278
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,020
or good guys

1279
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,020
two or three

1280
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,020
should be

1281
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,020
easy to explain.

1282
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,020
Did I answer your question?

1283
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,020
Yes.

1284
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,020
It's the same as I thought.

1285
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,020
OK. Thank you.

1286
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,020
I will talk about

1287
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,020
the bad guys A

1288
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,020
and bad guys B.

1289
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,020
Sometimes,

1290
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,020
the bad guys A and bad guys B

1291
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,020
don't always

1292
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,020
have the same leader.

1293
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,020
But

1294
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,020
to sum up,

1295
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,020
most examples

1296
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,020
can't be used

1297
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,020
to protect

1298
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,020
the good guys.

1299
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,020
Unless

1300
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,020
the problem is simple.

1301
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,020
Only one

1302
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,020
person has different preferences.

1303
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,020
And the bad guy is very limited.

1304
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,020
He can only

1305
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,020
play. He can't do anything else.

1306
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,020
Only a small piece

1307
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,020
can be

1308
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,020
justified.

1309
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,020
The justification defined

1310
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,020
under Maximine

1311
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:33,020
can only be justified

1312
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,020
by a small piece.

1313
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,020
The rest can't be justified.

1314
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,020
It's quite sad.

1315
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,020
Just now,

1316
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,020
the host

1317
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,020
asked

1318
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,020
some good questions.

1319
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,020
For example,

1320
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,020
I defined

1321
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,020
that the good guys' interests can't be damaged.

1322
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,020
My starting point is to protect the good guys' interests.

1323
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,020
The other starting point

1324
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,020
is more like

1325
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,020
game theory's

1326
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,020
Nash Equilibrium.

1327
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,020
The so-called bad guys

1328
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,020
or corrupt parties

1329
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,020
must have

1330
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,020
a certain economic motivation

1331
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,020
to do bad things

1332
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,020
to break the rules.

1333
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,020
This is

1334
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,020
another

1335
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,020
definition.

1336
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,020
This definition is very natural.

1337
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,020
For example,

1338
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,020
I defined a set of game rules

1339
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,020
in a certain game.

1340
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,020
Even if

1341
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,020
there is a

1342
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,020
bad guy controlling

1343
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,020
certain people,

1344
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,020
he becomes a bad guy.

1345
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,020
But the bad guys

1346
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,020
controlled by the boss

1347
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,020
don't have to

1348
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,020
listen to the boss.

1349
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
They have to

1350
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,020
listen to

1351
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,020
the boss

1352
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,020
to increase

1353
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,020
their own interests.

1354
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,020
Then,

1355
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,020
Nash Equilibrium

1356
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,020
requires

1357
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,020
the boss

1358
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
to increase

1359
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,020
the interests of the bad guys.

1360
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,020
This is

1361
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,020
very difficult

1362
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,020
for the boss.

1363
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,020
Especially,

1364
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,020
for example,

1365
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,020
what I said

1366
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,020
from the beginning is that

1367
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,020
the output is only 0 or 1.

1368
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,020
Your preference

1369
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
is only 0 or 1.

1370
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,020
If the boss

1371
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,020
controls both

1372
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,020
0 and 1,

1373
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,020
the boss

1374
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,020
can't

1375
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,020
satisfy

1376
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,020
both sides.

1377
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,020
Because

1378
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,020
one side's interest increases,

1379
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,020
and the other side's interest decreases.

1380
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,020
So,

1381
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,020
this definition is

1382
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,020
called Strong Nash.

1383
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,020
Strong Nash is borrowed

1384
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,020
from Nash Equilibrium.

1385
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,020
But in fact,

1386
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,020
this definition is easier

1387
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,020
to achieve than Maximine.

1388
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,020
Because the boss

1389
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,020
can do less

1390
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,020
and receive more restrictions.

1391
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,020
So,

1392
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,020
it's very easy

1393
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,020
to be fair

1394
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,020
under this definition.

1395
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,020
I don't know

1396
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,020
if the boss is a bad guy,

1397
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,020
or a good guy.

1398
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,020
As long as the two sides

1399
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,020
have different preferences,

1400
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,020
let them play

1401
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,020
what I said at the beginning.

1402
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,020
One side commits

1403
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,020
X,

1404
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,020
the other side

1405
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,020
decides a random Y,

1406
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,020
and the other side

1407
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,020
commits at the beginning,

1408
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020
opens the envelope

1409
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,020
and decides what X1 and X2 are.

1410
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,020
Everyone

1411
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,020
listens to them.

1412
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,020
No matter how many people are there,

1413
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,020
10, 100, 1000,

1414
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,020
as long as two people

1415
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,020
are working.

1416
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,020
This thing

1417
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,020
is easy to prove.

1418
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,020
Just list all the conditions

1419
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,020
and it can be proved that

1420
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,020
this game rule

1421
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,020
can achieve

1422
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,020
Strong Nash.

1423
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,020
The boss can't

1424
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,020
increase

1425
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,020
the benefits of the boss.

1426
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,020
Let's go back to the first page.

1427
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,020
If you think about it,

1428
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,020
you will find

1429
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,020
these two definitions

1430
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,020
are exactly the same

1431
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,020
in 2Party.

1432
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,020
Because in 2Party,

1433
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,020
there are only two people.

1434
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,020
In 2Party,

1435
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,020
under this payoff,

1436
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,020
it is a completely zero-sum game.

1437
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,020
The situation of the two people

1438
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,020
is symmetrical.

1439
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,020
So the payoff of the bad guy

1440
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
is equal to

1441
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,020
the payoff of the good guy.

1442
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,020
This was established

1443
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,020
in Zero-sum.

1444
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,020
In the case of two people,

1445
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,020
there is only one bad guy

1446
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,020
and one good guy.

1447
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,020
So these two definitions are exactly the same.

1448
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,020
But in 3 or 4 people,

1449
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,020
or more people,

1450
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,020
these two definitions are completely different.

1451
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,020
One is

1452
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,020
almost impossible.

1453
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,020
The other is

1454
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,020
almost possible.

1455
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,020
This is a big difference.

1456
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,020
In addition to these two definitions,

1457
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,020
in my paper,

1458
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,020
I will consider

1459
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,020
other definitions.

1460
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,020
Maybe more natural, maybe more complicated,

1461
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,020
I don't know.

1462
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,020
The first one is

1463
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
the benefits of good people alone.

1464
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,020
In the case of Group,

1465
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,020
I don't consider the benefits alone.

1466
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,020
I consider the benefits of all good people

1467
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,020
to be added.

1468
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,020
The benefits of good people

1469
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,020
to be reduced

1470
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,020
or the benefits of bad people

1471
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,020
to be added.

1472
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,020
There may be different

1473
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,020
situations.

1474
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,020
For example,

1475
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:23,020
when the boss controls

1476
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,020
a group of bad guys,

1477
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,020
he may add all the benefits of the bad guys

1478
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,020
and divide them.

1479
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,020
This may be

1480
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,020
a suitable

1481
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,020
model for discussion.

1482
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,020
For example,

1483
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,020
the feasibility of these two

1484
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,020
is between Maximin

1485
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,020
and StrongNash.

1486
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,020
These four definitions

1487
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,020
are a bit complicated,

1488
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,020
so I won't talk about them all.

1489
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,020
Anyway,

1490
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,020
in the case of

1491
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,020
only two people,

1492
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,020
these definitions are equivalent.

1493
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,020
In the case of two people,

1494
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,020
the total is equal to the individual.

1495
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,020
In the case of zero-sum,

1496
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,020
the increase of bad people

1497
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,020
is equal to the decrease of good people.

1498
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,020
So these four definitions

1499
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,020
are the same

1500
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,020
in the case of two people.

1501
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,020
However,

1502
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,020
they are completely different

1503
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,020
in the case of more than three people.

1504
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,020
If you have learned

1505
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,020
or seen

1506
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,020
some game theory,

1507
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,020
you will

1508
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,020
immediately think of

1509
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,020
the question just asked by the host.

1510
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,020
There are

1511
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,020
various settings in game theory,

1512
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,020
such as the payoff function.

1513
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,020
Maybe the payoff function

1514
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,020
I just gave is not the most natural.

1515
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,020
In some cases,

1516
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,020
the payoff of zero-sum is more natural.

1517
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:53,020
Or in some cases,

1518
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,020
what kind of outcome

1519
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,020
does everyone like?

1520
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,020
What kind of outcome

1521
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,020
does everyone like?

1522
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,020
Where does Trump like to meet?

1523
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,020
Where does Xi like to meet?

1524
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,020
Maybe

1525
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,020
the payoff function

1526
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,020
is not the most natural.

1527
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,020
Maybe it's private.

1528
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,020
Everyone doesn't know.

1529
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,020
This is a more natural setting.

1530
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,020
In some cases,

1531
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,020
it may be like this.

1532
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
Of course,

1533
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,020
from the beginning to the end,

1534
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,020
I only talked about

1535
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,020
throwing a coin.

1536
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,020
Then this coin has only two sides,

1537
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,020
0 or 1.

1538
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,020
Then the coin becomes a dice.

1539
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,020
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1540
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,020
Or I want to do something more complicated.

1541
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,020
For example,

1542
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,020
Trump and Xi want to

1543
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,020
add their salaries together.

1544
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,020
Something like this.

1545
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,020
These are all questions

1546
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,020
that can be discussed in depth.

1547
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,020
But there are a lot of questions

1548
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,020
that can be studied.

1549
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,020
This paper

1550
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,020
only discussed a small part of

1551
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,020
the blue ones.

1552
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,020
So this is

1553
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,020
the coin toss I talked about today.

1554
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,020
Thank you everyone

1555
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,020
for taking the time to listen to me.

1556
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,020
Thank you.

1557
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,020
Please turn on the microphone.

1558
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,020
Let's give a round of applause

1559
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,020
to our speaker today.

1560
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,020
Do you have any questions?

1561
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,020
No.

1562
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,020
Let me ask you a question.

1563
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,020
This question is not

1564
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,020
related to the content of the lecture.

1565
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,020
Did you publish this paper?

1566
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,020
Or did you throw it away?

1567
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,020
Do you want to

1568
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,020
write down the title of the paper

1569
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,020
and some other information

1570
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,020
that we can find,

1571
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,020
such as the date of the paper

1572
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,020
and so on.

1573
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,020
Then it will be recorded.

1574
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,020
If you are interested,

1575
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,020
you can look for it.

1576
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,020
How can I write it?

1577
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,020
I don't know.

1578
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,020
You can jump back to your PowerPoint.

1579
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,020
Okay.

1580
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,020
Just type it here.

1581
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,020
We can see it now.

1582
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,020
Wait for me.

1583
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,020
Text box.

1584
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,020
Okay.

1585
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,020
Now we are typing the text.

1586
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,020
Do you have any questions?

1587
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,020
Do you have any comments?

1588
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,020
You can ask some basic questions.

1589
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,020
For example,

1590
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,020
what do you study

1591
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,020
and so on.

1592
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:47,020
I have an interesting question.

1593
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,020
Of course,

1594
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,020
this is the most fundamental

1595
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,020
scenario.

1596
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,020
Then we can

1597
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,020
think about

1598
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,020
a special example.

1599
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,020
But now you...

1600
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,020
Let me think.

1601
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,020
So what you just said

1602
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,020
is basically

1603
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,020
your maximum

1604
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,020
and the two parties below

1605
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,020
are two extremes.

1606
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,020
They can be discussed.

1607
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,020
But those in the middle

1608
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,020
are in, for example,

1609
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,020
how many parties do bad people have?

1610
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,020
Are the interests of bad people

1611
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,020
completely the same?

1612
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,020
In these cases,

1613
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,020
your conclusion

1614
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,020
is related to

1615
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,020
N,

1616
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,020
how many good people and bad people

1617
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,020
are assigned to each other.

1618
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,020
What is the relationship between them?

1619
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,020
Will it affect your conclusion?

1620
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,020
Yes.

1621
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,020
I...

1622
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,020
I just posted

1623
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,020
the conference here.

1624
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,020
I will jump back to my PowerPoint.

1625
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,020
It is...

1626
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,020
In...

1627
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,020
In Max and Min,

1628
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,020
the simple case

1629
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,020
is that

1630
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,020
when greater than or equal to 3,

1631
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,020
it is impossible.

1632
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,020
In the middle,

1633
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,020
the group Max and Min

1634
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,020
is the same as Max and Min,

1635
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,020
greater than or equal to 3,

1636
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,020
it is impossible.

1637
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,020
It is related to N.

1638
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,020
Three people can't do it,

1639
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,020
or four people can't do it.

1640
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,020
In the middle,

1641
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,020
no matter how many people can do it,

1642
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,020
it is related to N.

1643
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,020
Does this answer the question?

1644
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,020
Yes.

1645
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,020
Actually, this is just the beginning of my question.

1646
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,020
I should say that

1647
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,020
I also expect that

1648
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,020
this thing is related to N,

1649
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,020
and N will affect your conclusion.

1650
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,020
If this is the case,

1651
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,020
it is closer to

1652
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,020
the realistic situation.

1653
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,020
For example,

1654
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,020
how do you study in computer science?

1655
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,020
Do you calculate one by one?

1656
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,020
Or do you use

1657
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,020
Monte Carlo

1658
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,020
to use empirical methods

1659
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,020
to conclude

1660
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,020
some relationships,

1661
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,020
such as the relationship with N,

1662
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,020
or what is the solution

1663
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,020
under some threshold,

1664
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,020
what do you usually do?

1665
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,020
So,

1666
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,020
the question asked by the host

1667
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,020
is more like

1668
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,020
I have

1669
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,020
a set of definitions

1670
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,020
on the left,

1671
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,020
a set of

1672
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,020
maybe it is the sky,

1673
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,020
maybe it is

1674
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,020
some

1675
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,020
realistic

1676
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,020
problem motivator

1677
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:43,020
definition,

1678
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,020
a set of

1679
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,020
motivator definitions,

1680
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,020
how do I discuss

1681
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,020
or

1682
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,020
how do I discuss

1683
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,020
the definition on the left

1684
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,020
whether it can be done

1685
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,020
or not,

1686
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,020
especially

1687
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,020
in this

1688
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,020
current

1689
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,020
talk discussion

1690
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,020
it is

1691
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,020
related to N,

1692
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,020
and how

1693
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,020
to say

1694
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,020
how much can be done

1695
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,020
and how much can't be done.

1696
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,020
In this

1697
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,020
work,

1698
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,020
there is

1699
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,020
no good way.

1700
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,020
In the middle,

1701
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,020
every case

1702
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,020
where N is greater than

1703
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,020
how much can't be done,

1704
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,020
is used

1705
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,020
to

1706
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,020
transform

1707
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,020
to make another statement

1708
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,020
N is greater than how much can't be done.

1709
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:47,020
For example,

1710
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:49,020
at the beginning,

1711
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,020
N is greater than 2,

1712
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,020
the first result is

1713
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,020
the lower bound of cleave.

1714
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,020
The following

1715
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,020
is to

1716
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,020
extend

1717
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,020
the first

1718
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,020
cleave's

1719
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,020
impossibility

1720
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,020
to 3 and 4.

1721
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,020
In this example,

1722
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,020
there is no good way.

1723
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,020
There may be

1724
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,020
other examples,

1725
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,020
but

1726
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,020
these definitions

1727
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,020
are

1728
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,020
the definitions of

1729
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,020
cleave.

1730
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,020
We

1731
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,020
don't have

1732
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,020
these continuous

1733
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,020
or

1734
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,020
continuous

1735
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,020
or functional

1736
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,020
mathematical tools

1737
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,020
to use.

1738
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,020
For example,

1739
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:53,020
I asked

1740
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,020
if there is

1741
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,020
Monte Carlo

1742
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,020
or experiments

1743
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:01,020
to prove

1744
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,020
those

1745
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,020
experimental

1746
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,020
methods,

1747
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:11,020
we usually

1748
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,020
avoid them.

1749
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,020
Because

1750
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,020
experimental methods

1751
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,020
are difficult to prove.

1752
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,020
Even if there are

1753
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:23,020
only 3 or 4 small numbers,

1754
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,020
it is not possible

1755
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,020
to prove.

1756
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:29,020
So,

1757
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,020
we

1758
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,020
rarely use them.

1759
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,020
Maybe

1760
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,020
we don't know

1761
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,020
how to use them

1762
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,020
to prove them.

1763
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,020
Our

1764
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,020
proof

1765
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,020
is here.

1766
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,020
It is more

1767
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,020
comprehensive.

1768
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,020
We calculate the probability.

1769
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,020
After that,

1770
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,020
we use...

1771
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,020
For example,

1772
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,020
here,

1773
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,020
we calculate the expectation

1774
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,020
and the probability.

1775
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,020
Then, we use the average

1776
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,020
to conclude

1777
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,020
whether it is possible or not.

1778
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,020
I see.

1779
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,020
Thank you.

1780
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,020
Do you have any questions?

1781
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,020
Hello.

1782
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,020
I have a question.

1783
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,020
Please go ahead.

1784
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:31,020
I still don't understand.

1785
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,020
Can you

1786
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,020
explain

1787
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,020
how to

1788
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,020
reduce

1789
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,020
3 to 3?

1790
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,020
How to reduce

1791
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,020
almost

1792
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,020
and malicious

1793
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,020
to 3?

1794
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,020
This

1795
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,020
is a good question.

1796
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,020
It is very simple.

1797
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,020
Let's assume

1798
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:03,020
n is equal to 4.

1799
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,020
If n is equal to 4,

1800
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,020
in this line,

1801
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,020
unanimous

1802
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:11,020
is the same.

1803
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,020
Almost is one less.

1804
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,020
Only one less.

1805
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:17,020
If n is equal to 4,

1806
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:19,020
it is...

1807
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,020
I just type it.

1808
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,020
It is 0, 1,

1809
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,020
1, 1.

1810
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,020
It is 0, 1, 1.

1811
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,020
Of course,

1812
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:31,020
it is symmetric.

1813
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,020
0 may be in one person.

1814
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:35,020
We don't know.

1815
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,020
We don't care.

1816
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,020
It is 0, 1, 1.

1817
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,020
Then,

1818
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,020
you have to ask

1819
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,020
whether

1820
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:47,020
there is a rule

1821
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,020
that allows 4 people

1822
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,020
to protect

1823
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,020
the interests of honest people.

1824
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,020
Let's assume

1825
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,020
there is a rule

1826
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,020
that allows

1827
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,020
4 people

1828
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:03,020
to protect

1829
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,020
the interests of honest people.

1830
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,020
What do we do?

1831
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,020
We do

1832
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,020
that

1833
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,020
I don't care

1834
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,020
whether 1, 1, 1, 1 is a good person or a bad person.

1835
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,020
I tie

1836
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,020
the two people

1837
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,020
who like 1 together.

1838
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,020
It is

1839
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,020
a person.

1840
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:27,020
It is

1841
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,020
a fatter person.

1842
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,020
They all like 1.

1843
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,020
The fatter person

1844
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,020
likes 1.

1845
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,020
If

1846
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,020
there is a rule that allows

1847
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,020
4 people to protect

1848
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,020
the interests of honest people,

1849
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,020
I tie

1850
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,020
the two people who like 1 together.

1851
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,020
Then,

1852
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,020
they

1853
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:53,020
play according to the rules of 4 people.

1854
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,020
I don't care

1855
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,020
whether it is a good person or a bad person.

1856
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,020
After

1857
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,020
I tie

1858
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:03,020
the two people together,

1859
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,020
there are only 3 people left.

1860
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,020
Their preferences

1861
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,020
are 0, 1, 1.

1862
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,020
Their preferences are 1.

1863
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,020
So, I tie

1864
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,020
their preferences to 1.

1865
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,020
If

1866
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,020
there is a rule that allows

1867
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,020
4 people to protect the interests of honest people,

1868
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,020
it is a rule

1869
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,020
that allows 3 people

1870
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,020
to protect the interests of honest people.

1871
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,020
Okay.

1872
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,020
Okay.

1873
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,020
It feels like a math problem.

1874
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,020
Yes.

1875
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,020
It's what we often do.

1876
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
We don't have a good tool.

1877
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,020
Is it the same

1878
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,020
for other preferences?

1879
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,020
Do you tie all 0s

1880
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:49,020
and 1s together?

1881
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,020
This question

1882
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,020
is a good question.

1883
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,020
We tie

1884
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,020
0s and 1s together.

1885
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:59,020
Then, we tie

1886
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:01,020
other 0s and 1s together.

1887
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,020
Why do we tie like this?

1888
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,020
It's because

1889
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,020
Cliff's result said

1890
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,020
that

1891
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,020
when you play

1892
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,020
with two parties,

1893
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,020
you must have a way

1894
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:17,020
to make them leave

1895
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,020
0.5.

1896
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,020
I don't know

1897
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,020
if it's from 0.5 to 1

1898
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,020
or from 0.5 to 0.

1899
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,020
But there must be one side.

1900
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,020
I don't know which side it is.

1901
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:31,020
He didn't tell you.

1902
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,020
But after

1903
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,020
tying 0s and 1s together,

1904
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:37,020
if it's one side,

1905
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,020
in my definition of

1906
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,020
maximum,

1907
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,020
it will definitely hurt

1908
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,020
one of the 0s and 1s.

1909
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,020
Because 0s and 1s are tied together.

1910
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,020
Okay.

1911
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,020
It doesn't matter which side it is.

1912
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,020
So,

1913
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,020
I can get

1914
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,020
a contradiction like this.

1915
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,020
Okay.

1916
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,020
It's amazing.

1917
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:03,020
The thing is that

1918
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,020
you can go down

1919
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,020
a few pages.

1920
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,020
I don't remember.

1921
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,020
Go down again.

1922
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,020
This is also right.

1923
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,020
The method of

1924
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,020
strong Nash equilibrium

1925
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,020
is that you call a 0 and

1926
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,020
a 1 out.

1927
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,020
Then they are tied together.

1928
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,020
The reason why this method

1929
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,020
can't be used in Max and Min

1930
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,020
is that you may choose

1931
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,020
0 and 1.

1932
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,020
One of them is a bad guy.

1933
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,020
I'll cut it here.

1934
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,020
I sent two representatives

1935
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,020
to point at the board.

1936
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,020
Why this thing

1937
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,020
doesn't work

1938
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,020
in Max and Min?

1939
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,020
The question is like this.

1940
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:57,020
The definition of Max and Min

1941
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:59,020
is that

1942
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,020
the benefits of good people

1943
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,020
can't be harmed.

1944
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,020
So,

1945
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,020
in the definition of Max and Min,

1946
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,020
the bad guy doesn't care

1947
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,020
about his own benefits.

1948
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,020
The bad guy

1949
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,020
can lose money.

1950
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:19,020
But the good guy

1951
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,020
just wants to harm the good guy maliciously.

1952
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,020
For example,

1953
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,020
the red one is the bad guy

1954
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,020
and the green one is the good guy.

1955
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,020
Can you tell the difference?

1956
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,020
The red one is the bad guy

1957
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,020
and the green one is the good guy.

1958
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,020
I can tell at the beginning.

1959
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,020
Sometimes the color is not enough.

1960
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,020
Because some people

1961
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,020
have color blindness.

1962
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,020
There are three bad guys

1963
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,020
and two good guys.

1964
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,020
If the bad guy just wants to harm

1965
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:55,020
the good guy maliciously,

1966
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,020
he can point to the bad guy

1967
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,020
and the good guy will like him.

1968
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,020
Then he will be harmed.

1969
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:03,020
He doesn't care.

1970
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,020
The good guy is happy.

1971
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,020
But as long as the good guy is not happy,

1972
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:09,020
Max and Min won't work.

1973
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:13,020
So, this thing

1974
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,020
doesn't work in Max and Min.

1975
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:17,020
Does it have anything to do with

1976
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,020
the question

1977
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,020
the host asked at the beginning?

1978
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,020
Do I consider

1979
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,020
all the benefits of the good guy

1980
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,020
or the benefits of the good guy

1981
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,020
individually?

1982
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,020
My strictest condition

1983
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,020
is that I can't harm

1984
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,020
every benefit of the good guy.

1985
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:37,020
So, Max and Min

1986
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,020
can't harm every good guy.

1987
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,020
Yes.

1988
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,020
This is a difficult question.

1989
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,020
The definition

1990
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,020
is tricky.

1991
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:53,020
There will be a lot of groups

1992
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,020
after the number of people.

1993
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,020
I have a question

1994
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,020
that is unrelated.

1995
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:03,020
If

1996
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,020
there is

1997
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,020
something

1998
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,020
that is completely random

1999
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,020
and everyone agrees that it is random.

2000
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,020
For example,

2001
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,020
there is a quantum stack.

2002
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,020
For example, the radiation of the sun.

2003
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,020
This is also possible.

2004
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,020
But you have to observe

2005
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,020
the same thing in two places.

2006
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,020
Yes.

2007
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,020
There is

2008
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:29,020
something called quantum entanglement.

2009
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,020
Do you know this?

2010
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,020
I know.

2011
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,020
There are two examples.

2012
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,020
For example,

2013
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,020
they have to spin up together

2014
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,020
and spin down together.

2015
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,020
I assign these two

2016
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,020
to two people

2017
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,020
who are far away.

2018
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,020
They observe this example.

2019
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,020
Spin up

2020
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,020
means one place.

2021
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,020
Spin down means another place.

2022
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,020
In this way,

2023
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,020
can we solve this problem?

2024
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,020
We don't need these protocols.

2025
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,020
There will be

2026
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,020
some ways

2027
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,020
that you can operate.

2028
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,020
Actually,

2029
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:13,020
I know entanglement,

2030
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,020
but I'm not familiar

2031
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,020
with how to do it.

2032
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,020
For example,

2033
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,020
you mentioned that

2034
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:23,020
you have to create two examples

2035
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,020
that have entanglement.

2036
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,020
I'm not

2037
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,020
familiar with it.

2038
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,020
Can we

2039
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,020
do this entanglement

2040
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:35,020
in advance

2041
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,020
and

2042
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,020
bias to

2043
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,020
one side?

2044
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,020
I'm not sure.

2045
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,020
Maybe.

2046
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,020
It seems that

2047
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,020
we need some proof

2048
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,020
to prove that

2049
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,020
the entanglement

2050
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,020
we created at the beginning

2051
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,020
is fair.

2052
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,020
I really don't know.

2053
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,020
I just heard it.

2054
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,020
After creating the entanglement,

2055
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,020
you have to give

2056
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,020
these two entanglement to two people.

2057
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:11,020
In this

2058
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,020
long-distance definition,

2059
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,020
it may not be

2060
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,020
very suitable.

2061
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,020
I don't know if there is a better explanation

2062
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:21,020
that it can't be done.

2063
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,020
But you have to

2064
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,020
give two bits

2065
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,020
to two people,

2066
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,020
or give two examples to two people.

2067
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,020
Actually,

2068
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,020
it doesn't

2069
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,020
go well with this

2070
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:37,020
definition.

2071
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,020
Why don't I

2072
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,020
create an entanglement

2073
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,020
and give the result to two people?

2074
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:45,020
OK.

2075
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,020
It makes sense.

2076
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,020
It doesn't seem that

2077
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,020
it can be solved.

2078
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,020
But I think

2079
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,020
there is room for discussion.

2080
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:57,020
Because some

2081
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,020
can prove

2082
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,020
that the entanglement

2083
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,020
is fair.

2084
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:05,020
Another thing

2085
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,020
I want to ask is

2086
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,020
at the beginning,

2087
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,020
what I said

2088
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,020
is that

2089
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,020
1, 2, 3,

2090
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,020
everyone says a number at the same time,

2091
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,020
and then X, O, 2.

2092
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,020
Why can't

2093
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,020
everyone

2094
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,020
say X, O, 2

2095
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,020
at the same time

2096
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:29,020
and then

2097
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,020
say the number?

2098
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,020
If it's

2099
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,020
more than 12 o'clock,

2100
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,020
you lose.

2101
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,020
It's the same with fail-stop.

2102
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,020
Fail-stop means

2103
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,020
if you are slow,

2104
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,020
you lose.

2105
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,020
Yes, but

2106
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,020
I think

2107
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,020
at the same time,

2108
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,020
it's difficult in practice.

2109
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,020
One is in China,

2110
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,020
the other is in the U.S.

2111
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,020
The distance is

2112
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:01,020
quite far.

2113
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,020
The transmission message

2114
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,020
may also have a delay

2115
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,020
of 0.0 seconds.

2116
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,020
0.0 seconds

2117
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,020
plus

2118
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,020
on the food,

2119
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:15,020
if the light

2120
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,020
is directly

2121
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:19,020
connected,

2122
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,020
it may be OK.

2123
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,020
But the network on the food

2124
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,020
has passed many host

2125
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,020
and the delay

2126
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,020
may be almost 1 second.

2127
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,020
You can't be sure

2128
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,020
how much time is there.

2129
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:35,020
59 minutes and 59 seconds.

2130
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,020
Is 1 second enough?

2131
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,020
Or

2132
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,020
too much

2133
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,020
will be a bit slow.

2134
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,020
It's hard to decide.

2135
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,020
At the same time,

2136
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:49,020
this is mainly

2137
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,020
difficult to do on the food.

2138
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,020
So people think

2139
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:55,020
if you can't do it

2140
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,020
or you can't prove it,

2141
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,020
you give up.

2142
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,020
Failstuff

2143
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,020
also requires a time.

2144
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,020
Yes, failstuff

2145
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,020
is...

2146
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,020
Yes, failstuff is...

2147
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,020
Let me put it this way.

2148
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,020
At the same time,

2149
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,020
the rules are tight.

2150
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,020
At the same time,

2151
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,020
after my message

2152
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,020
is sent out,

2153
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,020
it takes at least

2154
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,020
1 second to send it.

2155
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,020
It may not work if I arrive early.

2156
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,020
Because if I arrive early,

2157
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:35,020
there will be a relatively slow output.

2158
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,020
It won't work if I arrive late.

2159
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,020
Is it slow output

2160
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,020
or is it

2161
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,020
slow? I don't know.

2162
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,020
But failstuff

2163
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,020
has a relatively large

2164
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:51,020
range.

2165
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:53,020
I can

2166
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,020
arrive in 0 seconds

2167
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:57,020
or 10 minutes.

2168
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,020
So the range is relatively large.

2169
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,020
If I can't wait for you for 10 minutes

2170
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:05,020
and you haven't sent it out,

2171
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:07,020
it's just

2172
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,020
1 second

2173
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,020
or 1 minute

2174
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:13,020
to send it out.

2175
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:15,020
So the

2176
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,020
condition is

2177
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,020
strictly

2178
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,020
weak.

2179
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Very interesting talk. Thank you.

2180
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,020
Thank you.

2181
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:31,020
Actually,

2182
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,020
it's been more than 10 minutes.

2183
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:35,020
Please turn on

2184
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,020
the microphone again.

2185
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,020
