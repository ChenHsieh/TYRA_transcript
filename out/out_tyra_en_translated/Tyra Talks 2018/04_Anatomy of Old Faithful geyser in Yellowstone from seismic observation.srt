00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Q&A

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today's speaker is Dr. Wu Xinmei, a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, majoring in geoscience.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Before coming to the U.S., she was a graduate student of the Department of Geosciences at NTU.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Xinmei and I have met in many areas that are not overlapping.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I met Xinmei when she was a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My wife and Xinmei were classmates in college.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
After coming to Caltech, she met another Taiwanese friend in the Department of Physics, and turned out to be Xinmei's classmate.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
She will be talking about Anatomy of Ophethal in Yellowstone from Seismic Observation.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's give her a round of applause.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, by the way, you have to turn on the microphone to hear the applause.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you for the introduction.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today's presentation is a relatively easy one.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
There won't be a lot of formalities.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will focus on the concepts.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because people are not familiar with geoscience or geophysics,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I will focus on the concepts and focus on Ophethal Geyser.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ophethal is a very famous geyser in the U.S.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you go sightseeing in Yellowstone Park, you will definitely go to Ophethal.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I hope you will find this topic more interesting.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
First, let's talk about Yellowstone.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yellowstone is on the left of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is the intersection of the three states.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is the area of the National Park.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ophethal is on the right of Wyoming.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let me introduce Ophethal first.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ophethal is a place where people rarely go to sightseeing.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
People usually go sightseeing to Ophethal.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Because it takes about five hours to get to many national parks.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So if you drive from Ophethal to Yellowstone, it will take about five hours.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you have a chance to visit, you can come and visit.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yellowstone is famous for its volcanic activity.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
People have heard of Ophethal.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But if you come to the National Park to sightsee,

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
what you see is not volcanic activity.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's more like a geyser, a hot spring, or a hydrothermal feature.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll go into more detail later.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you drive from West Yellowstone to Ophethal,

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
it will take about 30 to 40 minutes to get to Ophethal.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So, after you drive in,

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you will see the National Park,

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and then you will see Ophethal.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, after you drive in,

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you will see parking lots,

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and then you will see the Visitor Center.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then you will see Ophethal.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then you will see Ophethal.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And then you will see Ophethal.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can sit here and wait for it to erupt.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can find the pathway up here,

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and the upper part is called the Geyser Hill.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's called the Geyser Hill because this is the place

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
with the highest density in the world,

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and it has the hydrothermal feature.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, you can see a lot of things smoked or hot water,

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
hot springs, and some geysers.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So, if you come to Yellowstone,

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
you will definitely come here for a walk.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, you can see things like this.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's very colorful.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A lot of colors.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
These colors are usually some biological,

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
microorganisms here.

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There are a lot of microorganisms here,

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
so the colors you see are mainly caused by

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the impact of the geysers.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, this is the map from the north to the south.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is the Geyser Hill,

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and there are a lot of hydrothermal features

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
around it.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is Old Faithful,

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and it's just over there.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's a video on the right,

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because we go out there every year.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, this is the video.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So, I thought Americans knew,

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
but a lot of Americans have never been here,

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
so they wouldn't be surprised.

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Old Faithful has a lot of features.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
First of all, it's spectacular when it erupts.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Second, it can be predicted.

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It can predict when it will erupt next time.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And if you go to the tourist center,

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
they will put up a sign

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to tell you when it will erupt next time,

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
so you can sit there and wait.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But there's usually a 10-minute error.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you Google Old Faithful Webcam,

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
you can see that there's a real-time camera

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
looking at Old Faithful.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I heard that a lot of people who like geysers

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
watch Old Faithful Webcam every day.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you're interested, you can Google it.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Old Faithful can predict,

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
which means that the eruption

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
from this time to the next time

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is very stable.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So the graph on the right

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
shows all the statistics

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
from 2000 to 2011.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is the probability.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The horizontal axis is the eruption interval,

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
which is how long it takes

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
from the first eruption to the next eruption.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And it has a peak value of about 92 minutes.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So this is the prediction

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
for the last 10 to 20 years.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But if we look at the longer period,

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
from 1878 to now,

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the eruption cycle is about 60 minutes

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to the present 90 minutes.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And then there's another one.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You can see there's a little peak here.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's not very obvious.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's divided into long eruption intervals

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and short eruption intervals.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The short one is about 60 to 65 minutes.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And then the long one and the short one,

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you can...

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know what it's called in Chinese.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Anyway, a lot of park rangers

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
will do all kinds of things

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in the National Park,

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
or they'll do a lot of things.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
For example, look at the length of the eruption.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The eruption time is about 2 to 5 minutes.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If it's a long eruption,

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the next eruption will be 90 minutes later.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But if it's an eruption

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that feels like it's going to be gone in two minutes,

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the next one will be about 60 minutes later.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So all the predictions

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
for the Old Faithful eruption

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
are based on what you can see on the surface.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But the National Park

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is a very protected environment.

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So even if there are a lot of geologists

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and geophysicists

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and geophysicists

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
doing research here,

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
they can't do research for a long time.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They might come for a few hours

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
or a few days.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Although the Old Faithful eruption

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
has been recorded

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
about 100 years ago,

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it is still possible

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
to make the next prediction

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
based on the data from the eruption.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So why is there a long-term change

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or why is there a short-term change

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
or why is there a short-term change

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
or why is there a long-term change?

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The real mechanism is still unclear.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you have any questions,

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
you can ask at any time.

156
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let me talk about

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
how we use geophysics

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
or geophysics

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to study the structure of the fountain.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
People are usually unfamiliar

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
with seismology.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Although seismology is traditionally

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
known as earthquake science,

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
it mainly uses some relatively large energy,

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
such as very large earthquake energy,

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to understand the information

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
from the source

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
to the process in which you receive it.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So why do we want to study the fountain

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
or the interstitial fountain?

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
First of all,

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it has a very important indicator.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In fact, all the structures

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
under the ground

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
or some physical mechanisms

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
are quite similar to volcanoes.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So you need a lot of water

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to get to the bottom of the fountain.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There is a narrow channel

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
called the conduit,

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and there is a reservoir

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
below it.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There is also a volcano,

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
which you may have heard of.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In the process of temperature pressure

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
or building,

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
they move forward.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can see the animation here.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
These are the lava,

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
because of the temperature

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and pressure below,

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and some mass.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The lava is mass,

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and then it moves forward

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
to a critical value,

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and then it moves back.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The lava is a mass,

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and it moves forward to a critical value,

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and then it moves back.

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Most of the volcanic prediction

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
is to use the mass movement

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to generate signals

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and contact delays.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you have an earthquake

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
near the volcano,

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you can get some earthquake signals.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So geysers have similar principles.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But when it comes to studying volcanoes,

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
a lot of them erupt every few million years

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
or every volcano grows differently.

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And it's dangerous to study volcanoes.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
A lot of people don't want to die

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
because of studying volcanoes.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So if we can find a way

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to understand the mechanism

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
of geysers,

217
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
we might be able to

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
apply our understanding

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
of volcanoes in the future

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and do some analysis of volcanic disasters.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hello.

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Before you move on to the next page,

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'd like to ask a question.

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Someone has a question.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Wu Mengchang has a question.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Do you want to ask it yourself?

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You can turn on the microphone.

228
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Can you use artificial geysers

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and your internal structure

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to create animations?

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Animation?

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you mean volcanoes or geysers?

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I mean your animation.

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There are a lot of studies

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
on volcanoes.

236
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's not just one or two studies.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If you go to IRIS,

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you can find a lot of

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
visual education content.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Most of the research on volcanoes

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
is very complicated.

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If it's an earthquake signal,

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
it's coming from a very deep

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
or shallow place.

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There are a lot of ways

246
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
to analyze it.

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The geyser I'm going to talk about

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
is a bit applicable.

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you have any questions,

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
please feel free to ask.

251
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll talk about

252
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
traditional geyser theory.

253
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's what I use.

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If there's an earthquake,

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the geyser energy is very strong.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It will pass through

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
different waves.

258
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
For example,

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
if you put a station here,

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you can receive the geyser signal

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
from that station.

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Geyser theory uses

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
such a geyser signal

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to analyze the source of the earthquake

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
or what effect it has

266
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
on the path of the geyser.

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is the most traditional geyser theory.

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
In other words,

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
if you have a geyser,

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you can use this energy

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to study the structure

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
between the source and the receiver.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you know the source,

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you can use it to study the path.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is a bit of a trade-off,

276
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
but there are many different kinds of research.

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's scientific.

278
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We can verify each other

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and it will become believable.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I think this is the only way

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
to look at the internal structure of the earth.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
NASA is now putting a geyser on Mars,

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
so it's very difficult

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
to predict the structure of Mars.

285
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is a bit of a trade-off.

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now I'm going to talk about

287
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
my own research.

288
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm going to talk from the biggest structure

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to the smallest structure.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This is our yellow picture.

291
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is a picture of Mars.

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
This is a picture of Mars.

293
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This is our yellow picture.

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is a picture of Mars.

295
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is the Geyser Hill.

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is the Geyser Hill.

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is the Geyser Hill.

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The red circle is the path.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The red circle is the path.

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Each red circle is our instrument.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We don't know what to look at

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We don't know what to look at

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We try to spread it evenly.

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We try to spread it evenly.

305
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Let's see what we can get

306
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Let's see what we can get

307
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's about this big

308
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's about this big

309
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can go and dig a lot in a short time

310
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You can go and dig a lot in a short time

311
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

312
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

313
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If an earthquake may impact an environment or human activity,

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If an earthquake may impact an environment or human activity,

315
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

317
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
As fast as you can imagine,

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
it's a long forest.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
As fast as you can imagine,

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
this type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
this type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

325
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is not a traffic jam,

327
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but a structure.

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
but a structure.

329
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
but a structure.

330
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
but a structure.

331
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but a structure.

332
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but a structure.

333
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but a structure.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but a structure.

335
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But what can you prevent?

336
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But what can you prevent?

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What will you do?

338
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,020
Likewise, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunken because of the distance.

339
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,000
Similarly, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunked because of the distance.

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,160
Similarly, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunken because of the distance.

341
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,200
Similarly, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunken because of the distance.

342
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,380
Use a common fact to distinguish between two sign boards.

343
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,520
Use a common fact to distinguish between two sign boards.

344
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,620
Use a common fact to distinguish between two sign boards.

345
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,360
you can find the signal that's stored in the noise.

346
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,860
you can find the signal that's stored in the noise.

347
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,720
Find its origin.

348
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,740
Find its origin.

349
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,400
Find the recommendation time.

350
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,080
Use concrete feedback to perform cross-student calculations to find its origin.

351
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,100
Use concrete feedback to perform cross-student calculations to find its origin.

352
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,160
Do you have time or distance?

353
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,660
Do you have time or distance?

354
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,660
Do you have time or distance?

355
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Do you have time or distance?

356
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Do you have time or distance?

357
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Do you have time or distance?

358
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Do you have time or distance?

359
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Do you have time or distance?

360
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Do you have time or distance?

361
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
Do you have time or distance?

362
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Do you have time or distance?

363
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Do you have time or distance?

364
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Do you have time or distance?

365
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Do you have time or distance?

366
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Do you have time or distance?

367
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Do you have time or distance?

368
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Do you have time or distance?

369
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Do you have time or distance?

370
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
Do you have time or distance?

371
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Do you have time or distance?

372
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
Do you have time or distance?

373
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Do you have time or distance?

374
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Do you have time or distance?

375
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
Do you have time or distance?

376
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Do you have time or distance?

377
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Do you have time or distance?

378
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Do you have time or distance?

379
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
Do you have time or distance?

380
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Do you have time or distance?

381
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

382
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

383
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

384
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

385
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

386
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

387
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

388
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

389
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

390
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

391
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

392
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Good or bad roaring dragon

393
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,160
But when it's high frequency

394
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
You can see I drew a box here

395
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Blue area

396
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
High frequency when it passes through the blue area

397
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
You can see its waveform

398
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,160
The first waveform is late, very obvious

399
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
The second is that it has a lot

400
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
Smaller and higher frequency

401
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Wiggle is

402
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
One by one we call coda

403
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
What does this mean

404
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
This means that the high frequency

405
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Small wave

406
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Relatively small wavelength

407
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
In a shallow place

408
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
When it passes through this area

409
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Obstructions

410
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Here are some

411
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Objectivity

412
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Of course, you can use some

413
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Earthquake learning methods to guess

414
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
What is the situation

415
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
You can also be a model

416
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I won't talk too much

417
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Because of this

418
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Observation results

419
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Find out

420
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
There is a relatively large

421
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Hello

422
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
I have a problem with the front page

423
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
it is good

424
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
My question is

425
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Did you frame the blue box

426
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
It's obvious when you frame it

427
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
There is clustering

428
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
This is different from the other set of data

429
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
But if you don't frame the blue box

430
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I slipped when I looked at my eyes

431
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Really

432
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I mean

433
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Very difficult

434
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
Can be seen at a glance

435
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
If your test today

436
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Ten more times

437
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Isn't it more difficult

438
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
I'm curious

439
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Technically

440
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Try to adapt

441
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,160
For example

442
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Machine learning

443
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Autoprocessing

444
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,160
Pre-selection

445
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Interpret

446
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Or you can see it

447
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
This

448
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
This picture is for us

449
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Very obvious

450
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Can be seen

451
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
So

452
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
I think machine learning is definitely the future trend

453
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
My boss is still working with

454
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Computer science

455
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Want to do real-time

456
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Real-time

457
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
To see the changes

458
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
But these are more

459
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
And especially machine learning

460
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
You need some training data

461
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
You have to have some

462
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,160
Know some

463
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Knowledge

464
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
You can apply it to the future

465
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Prediction

466
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,160
But machine learning is definitely

467
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Must do

468
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I didn't talk about this bar

469
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
This bar is

470
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
We predict

471
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
This distance

472
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
If I predict the same speed

473
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,160
Where will they be

474
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
So it will be obvious

475
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
You see them

476
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
1 km

477
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
But this area

478
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
They become

479
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
0.5

480
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
I think

481
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,160
It must be good

482
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
You have to see

483
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Very small

484
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
But this is very obvious

485
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
We have to

486
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
To see

487
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
I think

488
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
The answer is good

489
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
So we can

490
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Different frequency

491
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Different sensitivity

492
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
So we can

493
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Sensitivity and range

494
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
To estimate

495
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
This thing

496
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
How big

497
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
This thing

498
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Relatively deep storage

499
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Water

500
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
All to

501
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
The system

502
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Water

503
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Water

504
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
If it's a volcano

505
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
It may be a lava pool

506
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I forgot to say

507
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
The slope is from A to A

508
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
So it's just a slope

509
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
The low frequency I just talked about

510
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
Southwest

511
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Ice Age

512
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
Northeast

513
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Lava

514
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
The purpose is

515
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
Because

516
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,160
We have a lot of volcanoes

517
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
Taiwan also has a volcano

518
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
But geyser

519
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Feature

520
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Very rare

521
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Why is it rare

522
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
You have so many hot springs

523
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
It actually needs a specific geological structure

524
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
To be able to

525
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Such a condition

526
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
For O-Facebook

527
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
The first one you can see

528
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
This

529
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Reservoir

530
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
Like a reservoir

531
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
It's not directly

532
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
At the bottom of O-Facebook

533
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
It's in the southwest

534
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Why

535
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Because

536
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Relative to this

537
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Geyser

538
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
It's easier to break

539
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,160
If you have temperature or pressure

540
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Give it a lot of temperature or pressure

541
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
It's easier to fracture

542
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
So when you have water

543
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
From below

544
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
They prefer

545
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
It's easier to break

546
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
This is another

547
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Result

548
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Then I just said it was big

549
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
I'm going to talk about it now

550
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
It's not me

551
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Let's talk about this little one

552
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Smaller

553
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
What I'm talking about now

554
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Bubble trap is this one

555
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
It's probably in this

556
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
It's about 300 meters deep

557
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Then

558
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
The depth is about

559
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
20 to 60, but this is much smaller

560
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
This is probably

561
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
20 meters deep

562
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Then the width

563
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Then they said

564
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
This is another way

565
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
They set up a lot of stations

566
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
It's on O-Facebook

567
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
You can see this

568
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
It's completely different from our first station

569
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
This is a little bit denser

570
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Then it's more focused

571
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
They don't use

572
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,160
The source

573
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
They use O-Facebook

574
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Their own source

575
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Then go and see

576
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
For example, I have an energy here

577
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Then I have a very dense array above

578
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
My energy to this station

579
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
They will have a time difference

580
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
So they use

581
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Array

582
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Very dense array

583
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
All the energy

584
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Where did it come from

585
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
I'll talk more about it later

586
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
This energy

587
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Now

588
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
It's part of the structure

589
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
They found

590
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,160
For example, from the last station

591
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Between

592
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
The energy is divided into two areas

593
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
The first area is almost vertical

594
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Under O-Facebook

595
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
The second area is the red area

596
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Is more to the south

597
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
A little bit

598
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Because of this discovery

599
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
I think

600
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
O-Facebook structure

601
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
It may not be

602
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Just a channel

603
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
There will be other

604
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
This is called

605
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Cavity or bubble trap feature

606
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
It has an offset structure

607
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,160
The constraint here

608
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Not very good

609
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
But after all, the energy still comes from here

610
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
It means that there is actually

611
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
There is a structure here

612
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
This discovery

613
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Very important

614
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Because you said

615
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
A lot of modeling

616
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Geyser modeling

617
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Research

618
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
It actually needs very

619
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Determine

620
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,160
What does it look like

621
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Do you have one

622
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Involved in this

623
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
It's very different

624
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
So

625
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
This discovery is actually quite a lot

626
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
More surprised

627
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
Then

628
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Conjured

629
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
This structure is too small

630
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
All

631
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Referred

632
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Conjured

633
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
From this reference

634
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
This is about 20 years ago

635
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Whether it's Caltech or Berkeley

636
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Then they just put it directly

637
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Camera

638
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Put the camera down

639
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
From O-Facebook

640
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Put it down

641
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
What does it look like

642
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
What does it look like

643
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
If you are interested, you can watch YouTube

644
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
That feels like

645
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Explore outer space

646
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
Satellite environment

647
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Anyway, it looks like this

648
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Then there will be a lot of explanations

649
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Why do they do this

650
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
What did you find

651
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
The interesting thing is that they

652
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
In the past

653
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Maybe the instrument or something

654
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Will not receive more restrictions

655
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
You can't be there when it erupts

656
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
So they are

657
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
This observation

658
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Actually did it for two or three years

659
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Then what did you say in the first year

660
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,160
It's a big bubble

661
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
In the water of Bolin

662
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Then go down

663
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Then go again in the second year

664
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Then the main thing is

665
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
About 20

666
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
He can

667
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
The camera can reach about 20 meters

668
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
20 meters deep

669
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm not sure

670
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
If this restriction is also

671
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
If you have a feature next to you

672
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Then its pipe is very narrow

673
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Then you may not be able to get out of the video

674
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Can be seen

675
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
But this kind of observation

676
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Is very reliable

677
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,160
What you see is what

678
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160
If it is an earthquake signal

679
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Or some signals

680
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
He actually

681
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
There is an error

682
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
You have to measure

683
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,160
How much

684
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Ok

685
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
The first half of the structure is like that

686
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
If you have any questions, you can ask now

687
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
How much time

688
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
If not, I have to continue

689
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
What I'm talking about now

690
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Old Facebook

691
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Your own

692
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
What is the signal

693
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
That is

694
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
This paper

695
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
He is mainly using signals

696
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
I think this will be more interesting

697
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Ok

698
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,160
So if you have a station

699
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Put it in

700
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
It should be super close

701
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Maybe put it next to it

702
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Then this will be

703
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
If that station is on the ground

704
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
This is the signal we received

705
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
This is a whole day

706
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
This is a 24-hour signal

707
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,160
So you see he is 90

708
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
About 90 minutes

709
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
Every 90 minutes

710
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Related cycle

711
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Then

712
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
If we only look at one

713
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,160
If we only look at one

714
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,160
This is about 100 minutes

715
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,160
So there is a burst

716
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
If you look at it

717
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,160
Where do you think it will be

718
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Where

719
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
I probably won't

720
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
This red curve

721
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
It is the real record

722
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,160
To the time of the burst

723
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,160
So you see before he

724
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,160
We think

725
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
More than 10 hertz

726
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
More than 10 hertz

727
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
The signal

728
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Even stronger than

729
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
The signal when you burst

730
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
This signal

731
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,160
If we zoom in

732
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
You can see a very obvious

733
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Event

734
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
This kind of signal

735
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,160
From

736
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
We are talking about

737
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Bubble collapse

738
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,160
For example, you cook

739
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
You cook a pot of soup

740
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
There will be a lot of small bubbles

741
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Then slowly float to the front

742
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Colder water

743
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Then they will

744
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Break off

745
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Break off

746
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
Every event

747
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Relative

748
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Relative to

749
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
You can see a lot here

750
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Recorded

751
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Then this picture

752
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
This is the signal

753
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
You see the water coming out

754
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
The first one

755
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Before the burst

756
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
The energy is much smaller

757
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Then he grew up

758
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
It's completely different from them

759
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Then

760
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
We won't talk about it today

761
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,160
The signal of the burst

762
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Before the burst

763
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Like these signals

764
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
Can bring us

765
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
How can we do research

766
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
How can we use these signals

767
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
To understand

768
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
What is it

769
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
So

770
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
There are a lot of

771
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
The first

772
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Burst every 90 minutes

773
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Why

774
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
So

775
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
This kind of thing

776
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
There is a fixed pattern

777
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
There will be a certain pattern

778
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
There will be a certain pattern

779
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
For example, here

780
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
There is no event

781
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Then there will be more

782
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
So the first one

783
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Let's calculate

784
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
How many

785
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Along the time

786
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
How many

787
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
This event

788
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Then do the statistics

789
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
30

790
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
A total of 30

791
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Is

792
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
One

793
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
A total of 30

794
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
Then

795
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Use eruption time

796
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
As a reference

797
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Then all the time

798
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Relative to the time of the burst

799
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
20

800
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
20 minutes before the burst

801
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
20 minutes before the burst

802
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
40

803
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
40 minutes before the burst

804
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
60 minutes before the burst

805
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
Then hope that if we

806
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Collected a lot of eruption cycles

807
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
See if there is a fixed pattern

808
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
This is the number

809
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Gray is the number

810
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Gray is the number

811
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
So it has a very

812
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
The fixed pattern is

813
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
It will have a number

814
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Peak

815
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
20 minutes before

816
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
20 minutes before the burst

817
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Then there will be a decrease

818
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Then there will be an increase

819
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Then the red is

820
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
If you consider not only the number

821
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
You consider the size of each event

822
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
Then the pattern will look like this

823
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
In addition to the number

824
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
What else can be done

825
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
You can see

826
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Each of these events

827
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,160
You can see

828
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Is there a number

829
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Or they all look different

830
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Or they actually have a set model

831
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
So what you can do is

832
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
I don't know if you know

833
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Cluster analysis

834
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Use it

835
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
For example, you have

836
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
You have a box of blocks

837
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
It may have different shapes

838
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
Different colors

839
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Then you can sort by color

840
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
You can also sort by shape

841
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,160
You can also sort by whatever you want

842
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Then our sorting method is

843
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
The similarity of the waveform

844
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
For example, this looks like this

845
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Or this looks like this

846
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Use this to sort

847
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Then the sorting method is

848
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
The same is the cross-section coefficient

849
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
This is not a function

850
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
We just use it

851
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
When they are the most similar

852
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,160
What is the coefficient

853
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
So the coefficient will be between 0 and 1

854
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,160
0 is the least similar

855
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
1 is exactly the same

856
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Then this

857
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Same

858
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
This is the time series

859
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
You can compare it

860
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Eruption time

861
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Then

862
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
20 minutes

863
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
To do cluster analysis

864
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
Every blue dot is every event

865
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
If this is a cluster ID

866
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
If the ID is very close

867
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
If they are nearby

868
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,160
It means they are more similar

869
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
If it's the same ID

870
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,160
That means between them

871
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,160
At least 0.8

872
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
The coefficient is at least 0.8

873
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
So it's from 0 to 1

874
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
If it's the same ID, it's probably 0.8

875
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
0.8 will be

876
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,160
The number is very similar

877
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,160
So the first thing to pay attention to

878
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
You can see

879
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
For example, there is a cluster here

880
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Is it closer to the ID?

881
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Then there is another one here

882
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Then there is another one here

883
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
There is another one here

884
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,160
Another thing to pay attention to

885
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,160
You can find different clusters

886
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,160
They are relative

887
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Relative to the time of eruption

888
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
It's different

889
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,160
Like this cluster

890
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,160
It's more likely to be 40 minutes to 80 minutes

891
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Then this cluster

892
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
It's about 30 to 60 minutes

893
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
36 to 60 minutes before the eruption

894
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
Before the eruption

895
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Actually nothing

896
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Fewer events

897
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
Like this cluster

898
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
It's more like late

899
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
You

900
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Did you spray all the water this time?

901
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Is it before the next eruption?

902
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
It's slowly accumulating

903
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Maybe there will be water

904
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Fill in

905
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Fill in the hot water

906
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Or fill in the underground water nearby

907
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Or it's building

908
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
Its pressure and temperature

909
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Then it will erupt until it reaches a critical value

910
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,160
Then in the front

911
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
We say this is called recharge

912
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
It's a bit like recharge

913
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,160
I don't know how

914
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Then the early recharge

915
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
It's more likely to have this kind of wave

916
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
That mid-range recharge

917
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
There will be a wave like this

918
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
There will be a wave like this

919
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
This is actually good news

920
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
Because you have this pattern

921
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
If it is fixed

922
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,160
If it is every eruption

923
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
If it has this pattern

924
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
We can use it to study a lot of things

925
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
We can study

926
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Where did this wave come from?

927
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
What is its source?

928
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,160
Is the location different?

929
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Is the shape of its source different?

930
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,160
There are still many possibilities

931
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
Or you can use this pattern

932
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
There are many eruption cycles

933
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,160
If they are all the same

934
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
We can use this pattern

935
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
To do prediction

936
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Especially machine learning

937
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,160
If this pattern is

938
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Between certain error ranges

939
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
Then you can use

940
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
Such data as knowledge

941
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,160
You already know the knowledge

942
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
Then as training data

943
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
If you can have more data in the future

944
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Or you can

945
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,160
For technological progress

946
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,160
You can use this information

947
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
To do machine learning

948
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,160
These are the four clusters I chose

949
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Let's see what they look like

950
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
You can find an average

951
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Let's see what this group looks like

952
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
Let's see what this group looks like

953
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
Let's see what this group looks like

954
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
Let's see what this group looks like

955
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
This is the first cluster

956
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
This is the first row

957
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
The second cluster is the second row

958
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,160
The third cluster is the third row

959
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,160
The fourth cluster is the fourth row

960
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
The red one is for time series waveform

961
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,160
The blue one is for frequency

962
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
The blue one is for frequency

963
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,160
The units are hertz

964
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,160
So it's 0 to 100 hertz

965
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,160
So it's 0 to 100 hertz

966
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,160
So it's 0 to 100 hertz

967
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,160
The good news is that these four waveforms

968
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,160
The good news is that these four waveforms

969
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,160
If we do not see the EU flu

970
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,160
They will be very similar

971
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,160
If we do not see the EU flu

972
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,160
They will be very similar

973
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,160
we can see that the frequency ratio

974
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
we can see that the frequency ratio

975
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,160
The low frequency waveform

976
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
The low frequency waveform

977
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,160
is likely to be 10 Hz

978
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,160
like this

979
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,160
is like this

980
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
There's only one eruption cycle

981
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,160
There's only one eruption cycle

982
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,160
If we use the same method

983
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,160
If we use the same method

984
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,160
If we use the same method

985
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,160
We can see that the other eruption cycle

986
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,160
We can see that the other eruption cycle

987
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Is it the same?

988
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,160
Or is it different?

989
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
You will find that

990
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,160
These two look very similar

991
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,160
These two look very similar

992
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,160
These two look very similar

993
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,160
These two are a little different

994
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
But the low frequency part is very close

995
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
But the low frequency part is very close

996
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,160
This is also good news

997
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
This is also good news

998
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,160
It's not just the eruption time

999
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,160
It's not just eruption time

1000
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,160
Even the inner process

1001
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Even the inner process

1002
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,160
Is very close

1003
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,160
Is very close

1004
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,160
At least 10 years

1005
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,160
At least 10 years

1006
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,160
So

1007
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,160
What can you do

1008
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,160
I just mentioned

1009
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,160
I just mentioned

1010
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,160
I am planning to do a more detailed prediction

1011
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,160
I am planning to do a more detailed prediction

1012
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,160
Not just the pulses, but ability to combine the numbers

1013
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Or, you could even set the times and odds

1014
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Add lots of videos

1015
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,160
Add lots of videos

1016
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,160
Like deep learning machine learning

1017
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Do prediction

1018
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
And if the country really gives them the green light

1019
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,160
And if the country really gives them the green light

1020
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,160
And if the country really gives them the green light

1021
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,160
If the terrain is great

1022
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
You could do monitoring

1023
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,160
And make sure this works

1024
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,160
To be more scientific

1025
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,160
I'm curious about the bimodal eruption

1026
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
I'm curious about the bimodal eruption

1027
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,160
Why sometimes it's 90 minutes

1028
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
Why sometimes it's 60 minutes

1029
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,160
If you have a complete data set

1030
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,160
You can use a lot of data to do statistics

1031
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,160
You can use a lot of data to do statistics

1032
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,160
Why sometimes it's 60 minutes

1033
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,160
This is important

1034
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,160
Like when we talk about volcanoes

1035
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
How do we predict the next eruption

1036
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Last time it was 60 million years

1037
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Last time it was 10 million years

1038
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,160
And the last picture is also outdoors

1039
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,160
And the last picture is also outdoors

1040
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,160
Outdoors is beautiful

1041
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,160
But it's cold

1042
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,160
Not fun

1043
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
It's open in winter

1044
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,160
We went there in November

1045
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,160
We went there in November

1046
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,160
Because it's easy to get super cold

1047
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,160
Because it's easy to get super cold

1048
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,160
And it's open in December

1049
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
But only for snowmobiles

1050
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,160
If you want to see what winter looks like

1051
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
If you want to see what winter looks like

1052
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,160
You can rent a snowmobile in December

1053
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,160
You can rent a snowmobile in December

1054
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
But it will be cold

1055
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,160
But it will be cold

1056
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Thank you

1057
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
Please go ahead

1058
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
It's hard to understand

1059
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
What am I saying?

1060
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
I said if it's hard to understand, you can say it

1061
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Because I will adjust it next time

1062
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Because I don't know how to do it

1063
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
No, I think you said it very well, very clearly

1064
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
Oh, really? Thank you

1065
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
She kept nodding her head, she said it very clearly

1066
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Okay, Meng Chang has a question

1067
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
You can just ask

1068
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Turn on the microphone

1069
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
Okay, I want to ask

1070
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,160
They can't see the changes directly?

1071
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,160
So in our field

1072
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,160
First, you have to have a source

1073
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,160
For example, you do X-ray

1074
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,160
X-ray or something, you have to have an energy

1075
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,160
Or radar, you have to have an energy

1076
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,160
To hit it

1077
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,160
But if your energy is not strong enough

1078
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,160
Or the frequency is not right

1079
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,160
You won't be able to see the scale you want

1080
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,160
The scale or the depth

1081
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
So if we want to look at the ground

1082
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
It usually requires relatively strong energy

1083
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
You have to be

1084
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
For example, have you heard of

1085
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
Oil companies will use a big car

1086
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
To fix it

1087
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,160
But this kind of energy is very

1088
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,160
It will destroy the environment

1089
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
If you have been there

1090
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,160
There will be a lot of warnings

1091
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
You can't jump

1092
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,160
Or you can't go to certain places

1093
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,160
Some people will go crazy

1094
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,160
Because these

1095
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,160
They need a very special environment

1096
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,160
This environment is relatively fragile

1097
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,160
You can't let that water

1098
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,160
Release pressure to the surface

1099
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,160
So we are now

1100
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,160
If you want to look at the underground environment

1101
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
Then you have to go through

1102
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,160
A more indirect method like us

1103
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,160
You have to use some natural energy

1104
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,160
Or something

1105
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,160
But there is a limit to this

1106
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,160
Because the source of these energies

1107
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,160
You can't control

1108
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
You have to find the right source

1109
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
Find the right thing

1110
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
You can use it to see

1111
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
What you want to see

1112
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
But my impression is

1113
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Like oil companies

1114
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
They look at

1115
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,160
They also have

1116
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,160
I have heard that they may also use

1117
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
The so-called atomic clock

1118
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
Because the atomic clock

1119
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
The density of the surface changes

1120
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
The change of gravity

1121
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
There will be a change in the structure

1122
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
Very sensitive

1123
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,160
So he can use the atomic clock

1124
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,160
To measure

1125
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,160
This place

1126
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,160
What is its composition

1127
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Correct

1128
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,160
No need for destructive things

1129
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,160
I am not

1130
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,160
I don't know much about the atomic clock

1131
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,160
But I think if

1132
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,160
If there is such a way

1133
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,160
If you can see

1134
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,160
Everyone should have used it long ago

1135
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
So I think he should have his limits

1136
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Because there are actually a lot of

1137
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
Battery

1138
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,160
Battery

1139
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
I forgot how to say

1140
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Some ways to use batteries

1141
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,160
Very local

1142
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,160
But it is very limited

1143
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,160
It is limited to

1144
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,160
The range of your ears

1145
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,160
If your ears are small

1146
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,160
You want to see such a small structure

1147
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,160
But you can only see about 1-2 meters deep

1148
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,160
But if you want to see

1149
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,160
Big structure

1150
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
If you want to look deeper

1151
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Left and right

1152
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Lateral extension

1153
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
Can't see a few meters

1154
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
This kind of thing

1155
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,160
So I think every one

1156
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,160
We all use this kind of indirect

1157
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
More indirect method

1158
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,160
This method has its own limits

1159
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,160
So I don't know the atomic clock

1160
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,160
But I think he must use his limits

1161
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,160
Otherwise, everyone has used it long ago

1162
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Because the atomic clock is still

1163
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
A very big country

1164
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,160
A plan to find a way to build

1165
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Because he is

1166
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,160
Probably only the United States, Japan

1167
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,160
France

1168
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,160
I'm doing these things

1169
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,160
So I don't know

1170
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
Maybe it's very expensive

1171
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,160
But I heard before

1172
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,160
I heard before

1173
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,160
There is a private company

1174
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
Sponsor a laboratory

1175
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,160
Their publication

1176
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Will not be put on the table

1177
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,160
But there is a private company

1178
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,160
To pay for their research

1179
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,160
So I guess the cost

1180
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
May be a lot

1181
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,160
That's about it

1182
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
But the oil industry is super poor now

1183
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,160
We are almost out of work now

1184
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,160
So I don't know

1185
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,160
Maybe it's hard to pay

1186
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Now the oil is super cheap

1187
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Thank you

1188
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,160
But it's a very good proposal

1189
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
Actually, I don't know much about it

1190
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Does anyone else have any questions?

1191
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
Let me ask a question

1192
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,160
Just

1193
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Because we just saw all the data

1194
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,160
It's all in the real world

1195
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,160
The horizontal axis is the real time

1196
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Then the vertical axis is your

1197
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,160
But you are

1198
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,160
Under such data

1199
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
You just actually emphasized

1200
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
Most of the time

1201
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
The time to trigger

1202
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,160
No matter when you assume

1203
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,160
Or the real time

1204
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,160
Then you calculate the time

1205
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,160
My first question is

1206
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,160
Then you said cross correlation

1207
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,160
Can remove a lot of

1208
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Uncorrelated background

1209
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
If you look at

1210
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,160
Amplitude, will there be any new

1211
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
Information or better resolution

1212
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,160
This is the first

1213
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,160
The second is that since you want to do

1214
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,160
Cross correlation

1215
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,160
You plug that

1216
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,160
The position of the measuring instrument

1217
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
Shouldn't it be

1218
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,160
Very strict and uniform

1219
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,160
But I think you seem to be

1220
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,160
A little bit along the way

1221
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,160
Is it okay?

1222
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
Let's talk about the first government

1223
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,160
Government

1224
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
This is a very good

1225
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,160
Good question

1226
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Generally speaking, we are

1227
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,160
It's easy to come up with

1228
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
Is the time difference

1229
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,160
This message

1230
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,160
In the most traditional earthquake

1231
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,160
Because of the relationship

1232
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,160
Or because of a lot of uncertainty

1233
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,160
For example, your earthquake

1234
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,160
For example, you have a small one here

1235
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Earthquake, it will decline

1236
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,160
But not just because of the distance

1237
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,160
It's because of what you've been through

1238
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Or is there anything next to you

1239
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
Influence its transmission

1240
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160
These will affect the government

1241
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
So the first one is traditional

1242
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
Or what I'm talking about now

1243
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,160
I'm talking about this result today

1244
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,160
It doesn't include government information

1245
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Second, if the government

1246
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,160
The message is to be applied here

1247
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,160
It will be relatively difficult

1248
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,160
But we're doing it now

1249
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,160
Because it's not just one

1250
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,160
There are a lot of features here

1251
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,160
That every feature

1252
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,160
For example, like this station

1253
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,160
There is a very strong pool nearby

1254
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
It gives it a lot of energy

1255
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,160
For government information

1256
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,160
If you look at the whole area

1257
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,160
Then it will be a lot of

1258
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,160
Localized government

1259
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,160
But for cross-referencing

1260
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,160
We're promoting now

1261
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,160
There are a lot of people

1262
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,160
Trying to include

1263
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,160
The so-called government

1264
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,160
But you have to be sure

1265
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
It's a real signal

1266
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,160
It's not a lot of

1267
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Localized artifacts

1268
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
Then

1269
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,160
We're going to do it again

1270
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
What's the second question

1271
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
My second question is

1272
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
You're in this station

1273
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
It's basically saying

1274
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,160
Is there any limit

1275
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Because I think this position

1276
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
Is there an average

1277
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
It should affect you

1278
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160
Cross-correlation structure

1279
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
You're talking about

1280
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
You said

1281
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
The address conditions below

1282
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
It's just that

1283
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,160
The distance between the station and the station

1284
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Need to be even

1285
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
My idea is

1286
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,160
Between your station and station

1287
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,160
To be on this projection

1288
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,160
It should be very even

1289
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,160
Then you will

1290
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,160
You're going to be

1291
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
The result of your cross-correlation

1292
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
You can make it lower

1293
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,160
I think I don't know

1294
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,160
That if you want

1295
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,160
If you want to do

1296
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,160
If you want to do

1297
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,160
If you want to do

1298
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,160
Of course it's very

1299
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Very very complete

1300
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
But if you're really going to

1301
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,160
It's almost impossible

1302
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,160
It's almost impossible

1303
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,160
But of course it's more

1304
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,160
The more complete the better

1305
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,160
I think we've done our best

1306
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,160
And he doesn't allow us to go

1307
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,160
He doesn't allow us to go

1308
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,160
We can't leave this path

1309
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,160
You can only be next to the path

1310
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,160
So this is already the best

1311
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,160
And then

1312
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,160
Will there be a systematic effect

1313
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,160
I think it will

1314
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,160
But if

1315
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,160
It depends on your size

1316
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,160
For example, we want to look at

1317
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,160
A relatively large structure

1318
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,160
Our structure is here

1319
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
Between your station and station

1320
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,160
These are a little uneven

1321
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,160
The relative error is actually for this structure

1322
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,160
It's more minor

1323
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,160
So when we're doing

1324
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,160
Any research

1325
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,160
We have to think about the first

1326
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,160
The second one is between our station and station

1327
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,160
Is the distance suitable

1328
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,160
To explain something like that

1329
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,160
So

1330
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,160
That's about it

1331
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,160
And then the government

1332
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,160
This question is very good

1333
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,160
But I'm still doing it

1334
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
But of course I want to have government information

1335
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,160
But because it's going to be too much

1336
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,160
Localized energy

1337
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,160
Is there any question?

1338
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,160
Felt like

1339
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,160
Zhen said very well

1340
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,160
But she really understands

1341
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,160
I don't know what she knows

1342
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,160
But she heard very well

1343
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,160
You can do it

1344
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,160
What did you say

1345
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,160
There's a lift

1346
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,160
Right

1347
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,160
You can do it

1348
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,160
You can ski

1349
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Ok

1350
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Our time

1351
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,160
Today is just right

1352
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,160
The speaker's time is very good

1353
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,160
I want to use

1354
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
The right of the host

1355
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,160
To ask everyone to turn on the microphone

1356
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Otherwise, there is only my voice

1357
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,160
Let's applaud again

1358
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,160
Thank you to our speaker

1359
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,160
And thank you all for coming

1360
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,160
See you next week

1361
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,160
Bye bye

1362
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
Thank you

1363
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,160
Can I turn it off now?

1364
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,160
Yes
