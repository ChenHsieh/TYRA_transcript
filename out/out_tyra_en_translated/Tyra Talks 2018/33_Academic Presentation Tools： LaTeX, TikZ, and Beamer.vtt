Q&A SESSION

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Today's speech topic is very special and I like it very much.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
The speaker is Liu Junlin.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
He is going to talk about LATEX and DINNER today.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I will briefly introduce the speaker today.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
The speaker got a doctorate in electrical engineering from Caltech this year.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
His main field of research is digital signal processing and statistical signal processing.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
This is a brief introduction of the speaker.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Without further ado, let's welcome the speaker to talk about today's speech tool.

00:46.000 --> 00:54.000
Please turn on the microphone and let's clap together.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Let's start the speech.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
We'll leave the time to Junlin.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Thank you.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I need to turn on the microphone.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
You can turn it on, I'll turn it off.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Then I'll turn it on here.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Okay, thank you.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Thank you for the invitation from TAIRA.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
I am honored to give a special academic speech today.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Today's speech topic is mainly about LATEX.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Another tool called TIKZ and DINNER.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
How to use these three tools in academic reports.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
Before talking about this topic, I want to mention why I want to talk about this topic.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
First of all, when I received the invitation, I also thought about whether to talk about my special research topic.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Thinking about it later, I think it's too professional.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
It may not be useful to everyone.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.000
Then I turned to talk about some tools in the academic world that I have a little experience with.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
These three tools.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
By the way, let me share my experience with these tools.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Next is my speaker.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The speaker will first do a brief introduction.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Then I will focus on these three tools.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
Then show some of the presentations I made.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Presentations made with these three tools.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Finally, a little summary.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Before starting the whole talk, I want to show you a picture.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
I believe everyone should have at least a little experience in academic research.

02:42.000 --> 02:50.000
In fact, academic research can be divided into several stages.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Suppose you want to do academic research.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
First of all, you need to have the most primitive research idea.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
According to this idea, you have to make a corresponding plan.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
For example, how much funding to apply for, how many students to receive, and how large your lab needs.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
After these things, you are responsible for managing people or managing the progress of the plan.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
After having people or progress, you may need to design experiments and collect data.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Then make a corresponding conclusion based on your data.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
The last step, I personally think it is a very important step.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
When you have the results of your research,

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
You may have to publish it to the appropriate conference and magazine.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Make the right oral report and promote your results to let others know.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
I believe that many research topics are related to this research cycle.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
The topic of my report today is related to this research cycle.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
But I'm not going to share with you how to find new research topics.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm not going to teach you how to do research.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Of course, it has nothing to do with the following topics.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Of course, it has nothing to do with my research topics.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
The topic of my report today is related to the sixth topic,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Publication and Presentation.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
It has a little bit to do with these two topics.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
But I'm not going to teach you how to write a paper or how to do oral expression.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
This is another topic.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
My main focus today is to show you a picture.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
This picture...

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Because of copyright issues, I didn't put the original picture on the screen.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
I'll just put a copy and I'll show it to you.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
After I click on it, I have to change to share, right?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
This one.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I don't know if you can see this picture.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
If you know Ph.D. Comics, it's actually a...

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
When you read the textbook, you can draw a picture like this.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I'll show you.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
This is a pretty close ecology in the academic world.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
When you finish writing the paper, you show it to the boss.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
The boss will change it for you for the first, second, and sixth time.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Or later...

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
According to what he wrote, I don't know how many times.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
49 times, right?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
This is actually something that happens quite often in the academic world.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Because everyone wants to adjust the quality of the paper to be very perfect.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
After it's very perfect, it will be sent to the magazine

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
or find a way to try to publish it.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
In this case, you can see that this student is in great pain.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
The reason for the pain is actually...

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
There are several reasons.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
The first one is that he changed it back and forth many times.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
You can see that the file name is different every time.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Suppose you look at this Revision 8, Common File.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Do you know what the boss changed?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
You probably can't tell.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
You don't know what the boss did just by looking at the file name.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
There's another one. You can look at the photo.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
He also wrote a track change.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
After you open the file, he might say,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh, what did he change in this file?

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
But if I want to compare this Revision 18 with Revision 2,

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
it should be quite difficult in this situation.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
I'm actually using this comic as a motivation today.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
We can use LaTeX to deal with this situation more effectively.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
It won't be so painful to change the paper.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm going back to the original...

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
This is my story.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
My report today is mainly focused on LaTeX.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
I believe that everyone has a little background on LaTeX.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Someone calls it LaTeX.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I personally like to call it LaTeX.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Because the word LaTeX has another meaning.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
It's actually a text layout system.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
I will introduce a tool called TIKZ later.

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
It's actually a interface that can display images in LaTeX.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Finally, I mentioned what Beamer is.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
It's mainly used to make videos.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay, then...

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay, then I won't talk too much nonsense.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
I'll just go straight into what LaTeX is.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
LaTeX is actually the most primitive version.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
It's called TeX.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
It was actually designed and published by Professor Donald Knuth.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
It's a layout system.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
The so-called layout system means that

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
it designs the text you want to type

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
with a text file.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Then, through the layout system,

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
it can design the font size and distance of the text

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
and then prepare it into a final version of the file.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
This is the so-called layout system.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
The version of TeX is very interesting.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
You can see it's a strange number.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
There's actually a story behind it.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Professor Knuth was quite confident in the text he wrote.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
So he felt that the text he wrote had very few bugs.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
So if someone found a bug,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
he would give a corresponding check as a reward.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Then when TeX was revised,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
the number would be added,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
but the way it was added was not the usual software,

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
which is to add 1 and add 2.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
It's the number of decimal places after pi.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
This is the current version.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
The little story is that

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
if Knuth can't maintain it in the future,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
the final version will be changed to pi.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
So it's still a prime number.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Then it might become pi at some point.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
This is the TeX system.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
What we often use in LaTeX

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
is to add some additional instructions to TeX.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
These instructions allow us to

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
efficiently arrange a file.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
For example, in a academic document,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
it usually has a title and author.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Then you may want to control the size of the page.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You have to add a password.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
LaTeX will wrap these functions

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
into some very simple applications,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
so you don't have to worry about

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
what the format of the title, author, and password is.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
You just need to focus on what your content is.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
If you have any questions,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Let me ask you here.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
You turned on your microphone,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
that is, your speaker.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
So if everyone is talking, you can hear it.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm not sure if you turned it on or not.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh, right.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Okay, that should be fine.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh, yes, I just muted it.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay, I'll move on to the next page.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm sure you all have experience with LaTeX.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'll just quickly talk about it here.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
LaTeX mainly inputs a text file

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
and then goes through some layout systems.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
After going through the layout system,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
you can output the final file.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
Usually, the text file name is .tex.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
After going through the layout system,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
there are a lot of different options here.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I just mentioned .tex and LaTeX.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
There are other different ones later.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
They are used for different layout situations.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
The final result of the layout

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
may be this kind of different file names.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
The most common is to arrange the file into a PDF file.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
This is the LaTeX system,

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
which is the most basic concept.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Okay, in the next page,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I'll briefly introduce

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
the basic structure of a LaTeX file.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I'd like to ask

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
if you think this is too simple.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
You may think it's too simple.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
If you all have experience.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
No, no.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
No?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So do I need to explain a little more?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yes.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I said no, no.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Does that mean you need to skip it?

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I think it's just right.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That's it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Let's talk about it quickly.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Okay, let's talk about it quickly.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
A standard LaTeX file is probably...

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
First, it will have a command

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
called document class start.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Then the GuaHu part will specify

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
whether I want this file to be an article,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
a report, or a book.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
It will first define

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
the approximate size of this file.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Then usually after this document class,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
there will be a part of the area

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
called use package.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
That is to say, this file,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
some of the commands it will need,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
for example, more complicated math,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
or some special font,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
or some other functions,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
such as if there is a hyperlink,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
or some special color,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
or drawing.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
These enhanced functions

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
are usually introduced with this use package.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
This is the second part of this file.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
The next part is that

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
these commands will specify

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
what the title of this file is,

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
and then its author,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
the author's name at the back,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
and then the date of this file.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It's very simple to use.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You just type in this command

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and change this part to say

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
what the title is,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
what the author's name is,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and what the date is.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
This part is usually called preamble.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
The real file starts

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
with the beginning document,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
the end document.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
The latex command is

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
that most of the commands

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
are processed by the beginning and end.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
The beginning means

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
that I am now at the beginning of a certain environment,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and the end is the end of this environment.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
So from the 10th and 15th lines,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
this means that

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
between the 10th and 15th lines,

13:48.000 --> 13:58.000
I will describe the content of this file.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
After defining the file,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
we can see that the 11th line

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
is a command called makeTitle.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
This command means that

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
based on the title author date I specified earlier,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
I will make a corresponding

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
title shape.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
The important part of this part is that

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
when you do this,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
you don't have to worry at all

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
about how big the title font is,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
how big the author font is,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
or how much the date font should be.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
This part of the latex

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
will help you

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
to arrange it according to the specified command.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
So all you have to do is

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
focus on your content.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
For the 12th to 14th lines,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I will simply show an example.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
It can arrange some mathematical parameters.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Here I use a command called

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
beginAlign and endAlign

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
to insert a mathematical value

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
with a whole width.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
This command will also add a

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
function number behind the function.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
This is a very simple one.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Of course, there are a lot of commands behind it.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
I don't want to mention so many time factors.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
This is a standard example.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Next, I will show you that

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
if you are really interested in

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
making real latex files,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
there are some that I have used,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
and there are some editors

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
or some interfaces that I recommend.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
There are usually two types of editors.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
There is a type of editor

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
that I call Latex Specific.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
This type of editor

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
will automatically

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
compile the compiled file

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
and sometimes compile the PDF

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
to the same interface.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So you can

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
click some quick buttons at the same time

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
and you can quickly see

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
the contents of the compiled file.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Then there are often used

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
text maker, text studio, textworks, etc.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I just had a discussion with the host

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
that there are some web page interfaces

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
such as Overleaf or ShareLatex.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
These interfaces mean that

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
you don't need to install anything at all.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Your stuff is stored in the remote server.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
As long as you open the web page, you can edit it.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
You don't have to worry about

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
which editor to use to edit it.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It has done a good job of compatibility.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
As long as you focus on the content of the file,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
the format of the file

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
will automatically arrange it for you.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
This is one type.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I call it Latex Specific.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
There is another type.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I call it General.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Basically, as long as you can open the text file,

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
you can do this.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I often use things like

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Vim, Emacs, etc.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
I personally like to use Sublime Text.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
You can also use Windows Notebook.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
It depends on your preference.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
As long as you can open the text file,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
you can edit and save it.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
As for the layout system,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
if you use a single board Latex,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
you need to install a larger system.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
This system includes

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
the editing interface I mentioned earlier.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I often use things like

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
TechLive, MiKTX, or MacTek.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
These are used separately.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
TechLive can be used for Windows or Linux.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
MiKTX is mainly used for Windows.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
This is mainly used for Mac.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
After editing,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
you can choose

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
which PDF monitor you want.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
There are many different choices.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
This is mainly to give you an overview.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
What are the most basic Latex tools?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
How do we make a simple text file?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
What is the content?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The first is the background.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Next, I will introduce the main focus of this talk.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
I think everyone will be more interested in this.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But if you come to listen,

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
you should already have a good understanding of Latex.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
So for this picture,

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
you might think it's acceptable.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
The meaning of this picture is

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Latex vs Word.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
Horizontal represents the complexity of processing files.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Y-axis represents the time you need.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
The meaning of this picture is

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
when your file is very small,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
maybe only one page,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
or one or two pages,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
not much content,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
maybe only text,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
when it's simpler,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
in this case, you can use Word

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
to make this file in a very short time.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
But when your file is very large,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
for example, you want to write a journal paper,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
you want to write a book,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
some problems will arise.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
At present, I still don't know

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
how to use Microsoft Word

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
to effectively solve these problems.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
But Latex has a corresponding method.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Here, I would like to say

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
that I will compare Word and Latex.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I personally use Latex more often,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
so I might be a little biased.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I might think Latex is better.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
The same function,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Word may also be able to achieve.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
If you want to discuss with me,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
please feel free to interrupt me.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
The first point I want to discuss

19:55.000 --> 20:04.000
is the difficulty of mathematical editing.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
If you use Microsoft Word,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
the tool you often use

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
may be called a square editor.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Some people may think that

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
the square editor is too ugly.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
They will use tools like MathType.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
These tools are mainly

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
used to edit the square editor with a mouse.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
So you need to use a mouse

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
to click here and there

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
to select some up and down icons,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
to select some root numbers,

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
some special mathematical symbols.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't say this is not good.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
This is an input method.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
But if you use Latex,

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
suppose you want to input the following symbol,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
you can use Word at all.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
You don't have to leave the keyboard.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
Just input these symbols with the keyboard

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
and you can output the following mathematical equation.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
You may think

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
how to convert this equation

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
to these strange symbols.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
This actually depends on

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
your familiarity with Latex.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
For example,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Begin and Align

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
means that I inserted a row of wide mathematical equations.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
The input method

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
is actually quite similar to the way we read.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
It's the same from left to right.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
If I need a square,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
I will enter a square.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
If I need the initial a,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I will enter an a.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
This command means

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
I want the initial a in mathematics.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
It's very similar to the way

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
to input words in mathematics.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
I need an initial u, initial c, initial v,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
and then a right square.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
This symbol means up and down,

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
and then up and down plus 1.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
So this command

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
is not the final result,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
but in terms of reading,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
it's actually quite in line with people's reading habits.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
It's the same from left to right.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Another advantage I use is

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
when Latex is in the array,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
you can add blanks and arrays at will.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
So you can put a very complex mathematical equation

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
with very effective arrays.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
You can insert an array or a blank

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
to make it easier to read.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So like me,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
this equation represents this part.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Then according to the following

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
different structures of this mathematical equation

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
to make a relative array.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So when you want to change the mathematical equation,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
you can also easily go back

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
to the relative Latex part

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
to change its original code.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
This is my personal experience.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
The first advantage is that

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
the mathematical equation is very easy to input.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Let's pause for a moment.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Do you have any questions?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
I want to...

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
I guess I should turn this on.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Then you can turn it on.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
It's okay.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Then I'll just use your side to talk.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
It's okay.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
I want to share something with you.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's a powerpoint plug-in.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
It's called Iguana Text.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I'll post it in the chat room for everyone to see.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
It's actually...

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Because you mentioned that

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
the Microsoft equation is an editor.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
It's actually very ugly.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
So someone developed a powerpoint plug-in.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
In fact, all the mathematical equations

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
are still using Latex code.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Basically, it's also

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
what the author shared on the screen.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
It just happens to be a plug-in

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
that can be placed directly in your powerpoint.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
So it's beautiful.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
This Iguana Text

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
is a very, very advanced

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Microsoft equation editor.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
So I'll post it in the chat room

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
and share it with you.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Thank you for sharing.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Because I...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
My computer is actually Linux.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
So it's...

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Iguana Text can't be installed at all.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
It can be installed, but...

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It's very painful.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
It's very painful.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
So I'm just...

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I'm not familiar with this aspect of the plug-in.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Okay, so this is...

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I personally think the first advantage is

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
to edit in a mathematical way.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Okay, what about the second part?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
This is a personal experience

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
of sharing.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
That is to say,

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
when you need to deal with

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
a very large file,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
suppose you want to write a doctor's thesis,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
and then suppose your research results

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
are very rich,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
you write up to 500 pages.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Yes, write a 500-page doctor's thesis.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
If you have Word experience,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
that is, you open a 500-page Word file,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
what will happen?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I haven't really opened it myself,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
but I've heard people share their experience

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
that usually this situation is...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
First of all, when you open the file,

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
it will be very, very slow

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
because it needs to scan all 500 pages.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Then next,

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
if you have some text blocks in the middle,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
some blocks you pulled yourself,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
it will be slower

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
because it needs to load these blocks.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
Okay, but for our purpose,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
these steps are not necessary.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
We just need to change

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
a paragraph in our text.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
So the focus of our focus

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
should be to pick this paragraph

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and then modify it.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
After that,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
that is, to do this,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
it should not need to be loaded

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
into other blocks.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
If it's Word,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't know yet

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
how to avoid this problem.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Suppose you have a 500-page thesis.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
If it's LaTeX,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
it can use a...

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It's a bit like writing a word.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Suppose you write a thesis,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
you can use a file called

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Thesis.txt for your thesis.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Under this file,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
you separate the different content.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
You may need to separate a file,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Introduction a file,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Topic 1 separate a file.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Under Topic 1,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
you can have your own Introduction,

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
your own introduction,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
your own translation.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
That is to say,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
you make your file

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
a system plan.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Distribute different content

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
into different files.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
The advantage of this is that

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
if I want to change

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Example 1 of Topic 1,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
I just need to open this file

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
and make a relative modification.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I don't need to

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
load all the files.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
This is the first advantage.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
The second advantage is

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
if I want to see

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
the result of this part of the translation,

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
I can translate this

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
Thesis.txt file,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
but I can put

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
these unnecessary ones,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
such as

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Example 1,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Introduction,

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Topic 2,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Topic 3,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Conclusion,

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
I can just block it.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I have a simple version.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Thesis.txt only has

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Example 1 in Topic 1.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
I only do translation

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
for this file.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
So I can see right away that

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I changed this thing,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
and it will look like this

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
in the real file.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
So this can reach

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
a very large file,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
we make it a system partition,

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
then we can edit

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
a small file,

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
and we can see

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
the result of the editing very quickly.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
This is my personal opinion

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
the second advantage of LaTeX.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Next is

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
to continue to the next one.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
The third advantage

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
is the compatibility problem.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
If you often use

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Microsoft Word,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
you may still remember

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
about ten years ago

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
there was a

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Dock version

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
to DockX version

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
a pain period.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Dock version is mainly

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
I think DockX version

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
is Office 2007

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
Word 2007 plus

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
about ten years ago.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Anyway,

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
there is this pain period.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Before that,

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
it was all DOC version.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Like this file format change

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
there will be some

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
some trouble.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Suppose you wrote a paper

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
twenty years ago,

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
you may now

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
the format will run out.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
This thing,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
especially in the academic world

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
it should not be allowed.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Suppose you have a picture

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
you run out

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
then your data will run out.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
So it's very troublesome

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
to maintain anything.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Microsoft has such

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
DOC to DOCX

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
history.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
So it's hard to guarantee

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
DOCX may be changed

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
to other formats.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
It's hard to say.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
So this is a

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
history of Word.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Another one is

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
even if you use the same file

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
you use DOCX.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
If you use different versions of Word

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
it may run out a bit.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Maybe its line

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
or font will be a bit

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
not the same as your original edit.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Suppose some people don't have Word

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
they use Pages or LibreOffice

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
it may be different.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
This is the same

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
in academic papers

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
a very disadvantageous phenomenon.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Another one is

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
you may use different computers

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
different operating systems

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Windows, Mac.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
This file

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
may not be able to run

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
in other operating systems.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
If you use LaTeX

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
its editable file

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
is actually Word.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
So Word

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
you can run a lot of things.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
You can run a notebook

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
and Mac, Linux

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
all can be run.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
The final file is PDF

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
almost every platform can support PDF.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
There are a lot of software

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
you can use.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
This is my

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
third advantage

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
from my experience.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
The file format is Word

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
and there is no DOC, DOCX

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
or other problems.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Next I will

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
Is there any questions?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
All right.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Next I will look at

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
one of my personal experiences.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Look at the picture on the left.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I will draw it roughly.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Suppose you have a paper

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
you are writing a journal paper.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
This box represents

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
one of your pictures

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
it is Figure 1.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Then you are in the text

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
in the paragraph

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
you need to mention Figure 1.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Then in a certain place

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
you need to mention 20%

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
this number.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Then in another place

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
you need to mention

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
X equals 10

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
this message.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Then this 20%

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
and X equals 10

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
it may actually be

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
one of the Figure 1

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
some data points

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
the conclusion.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
I use red here

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
means

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
red means

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
my experiment data.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
The file is here

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
there is no problem

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Word or LaTeX

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
can reach this function.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Now suppose there is a situation

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
suppose your boss is not satisfied with Figure 1

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
he is not satisfied with the parameters

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
he thinks you change the parameters

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
to see if these numbers

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
become more effective.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
So in some cases

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
you may need

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
after you finish writing the paper

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
you need to update your data.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Maybe you need to run again

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
run to a new set of data.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
In terms of updating

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
in concept

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
the red part

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
needs to be updated together.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Because you run a new result

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
your Figure content changes.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
So this Figure 1

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
it

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
you may also

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
in the process of text editing

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
this Figure 1 becomes Figure 2.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
So this

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
this

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
this

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Figure 1 also needs to be relatively modified.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
This number

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
needs to be modified

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
according to your experiment data.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
If you use Word

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
you can think about

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
if you use Word

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
how to achieve this?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Maybe you just

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
run MATLAB again

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
generate another picture

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
and then

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
after the picture is generated

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
you put the picture back

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
back to Figure 1

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
put the picture back

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
then you have to remember

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
you need to change 20%

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
you may now become 15%

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and now X may not be 12

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
X may become 12

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
So

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
a job

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
you need to change Figure 1

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
at the same time you have to pay attention

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
you have to change 20%

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
with X

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
all these things need to be changed.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
When your file is complicated

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
this thing will appear

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
more times.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
So if it appears

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
100 times

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
then you change 95

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
you have 5 forgotten to change.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Then your data is wrong.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Okay, then LaTeX has a solution

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
that is

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
first you can use

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Label and Reference

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
to update

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
your Figure numbers.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
If you use LaTeX

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
to write paper

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
this value should be used often.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
This is my own

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
experience

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
that is

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
20% and X is 10

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
These two data points

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
are actually related to Figure 1.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
So before you use LaTeX

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
you can

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
when you write MATLAB

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
you generate two text files at the same time

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
output 20% and X is 10

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
that is, the city directly input these two numbers

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
it is for two different files

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
when you write paper

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
you directly include these two files

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
right

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
so you

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
when you write a file

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
you have to pay attention

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
that is

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
what value

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
is related to what

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
then put all these things

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
together

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
then it is convenient to update

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
this is one of my

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
experience

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
because

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I also studied for a while

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
then I found out that

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
LaTeX has this

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
quite convenient function

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
that

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
the last one I

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
this picture I

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
showed you before

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
that is

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
final.doc

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
that is

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
if you use Word

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
you will keep changing

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
and then

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
change the name

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
then you may track

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
do not know how

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
this can track

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
but it may be

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
very difficult to say

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
the difference is very far

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
version to track

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
that if LaTeX, then

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
first I have to state that

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
LaTeX itself

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
it does not provide

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
that is the file tracking function

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
it needs to add some other

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
software

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
then

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
I often use my own

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
software called GIT

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
that if you have written

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
that is

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
a relatively large software

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
project

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
project

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
GIT is actually a management

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
that is

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
a program code

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
version control system

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
it can control

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
that is to say

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
this program code

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
at what time

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
by which

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
program designer changed

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
what part of who changed

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
then

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
these changes

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
it will have a relative record

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
then

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
between different users

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
to do

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
these changes

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
record

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
it integrated

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
in the same project

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
so

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
this

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
GIT is actually

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
a pretty

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
I personally think

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
pretty great invention

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
because it can

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
like that

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
software engineering

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
some super big project

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
it can use

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
a lot of people together

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
that is

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
a lot of engineers

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
to do the same software

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
then it can ensure that

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
different engineers

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
will not change

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
other engineers

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
the result

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
so

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
that

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
this function

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
it actually

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
needs to use

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
LaTeX file

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
plus GIT

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
to achieve

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
that

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
I only simply list

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
a few keywords

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
if you use

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
GIT

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
this software

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
to monitor

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
that is

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
LaTeX file

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
file

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
change

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
text

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
you wait

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
to come up

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
and say

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
you can control

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
that is

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
your file

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
at what time

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
to change

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
what place

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
you

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
usually

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
commonly modified

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
that is

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
you add text

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
or delete text

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
then

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
right

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
then GIT

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
has a feature

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
that is

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
every time you modify

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
you can do

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
something like

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
change block

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
it can

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
send a simple report

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
that

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
in this version

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
which file was changed

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
then

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
you can do

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
very detailed

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
so

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
that

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
with this feature

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
you do not have to

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
that

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
change content

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
it forced

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
because

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
this is not easy

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
to read

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
that

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
use GIT

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
can also be

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
very easy to

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
reply to the changes

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
before

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
then

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
you can do

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
a lot of people

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
in this

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
cooperation

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
that

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
this is

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
my personal experience

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
that

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
finally show you

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
that

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I mentioned

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
the first five

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
advantages

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
that

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
probably

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
the second

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
with

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
this

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
with this

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
second

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
and the fourth

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
is my personal experience

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
that

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
good

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
later if

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
we use more advanced

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
there are some other

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
features

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
like

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
we can

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
write a paper

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
in

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
is to use

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
reference

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
when

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
it can

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
automatically

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
help you

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
form a format

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
automatically

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
help you

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
arrange

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
that

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
you write

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
paper

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
you want to

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
change

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
that

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
good

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
that

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
this is mainly

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
that I

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
currently

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
include the

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
part of

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
that

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
you have any

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
questions

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
or want to

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
discuss

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
it

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
is very

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
welcome

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
that

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
I will

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
continue

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
good

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
that

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
next

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
I want to

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
discuss

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
a called

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
TIKZ

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I'm sorry

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
I have a

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
small problem

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
that

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
you said

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
you can

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
output

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
a certain

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
or a certain

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
number

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
when

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
that

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
side I do not

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
understand

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
you say

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I can

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
picture

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
picture, then

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
I can

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
understand

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
that I

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
output a

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
picture

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
and then

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
I just

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
reference

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
to that

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
picture

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
and then

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
feature

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
will not

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
change

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
but you

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
is to produce

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
a picture

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
you are using

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
tools like

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
MATLAB

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
or something like

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
that

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
you are using

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
RR

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
RR

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
good

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
that should

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
also be

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
the same

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
meaning

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
good

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
I mean

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
that

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
because

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
this is just

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
a reference

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
picture

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
if my

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
feature 1

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
is a

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
long

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
picture

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
I did not

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
draw

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
then this

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
20%

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
represents

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
that

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
the second

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
data point

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
is the first

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
data point

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
of 20%

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
it represents

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
this

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
question

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
and then

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
in the file

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
especially

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
use

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
a number

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
20%

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
to

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
represent

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
is

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
particularly

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
emphasize

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
this picture

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
of a

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
feature

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
like this

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
here

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
integrated

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
that is to say

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
when you output

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
this picture

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
this picture

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
has included

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
20%

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
of this information

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
in the

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
inside

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Oh

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
right

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
that

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
good

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
so now if you want

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
to update data

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
you run

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
the experiment

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
20%

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
becomes 15%

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
in this picture

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
looks like

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
15%

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
but you

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
you become

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
you have to go back

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
to your paper

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
part of

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
the 20%

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
manually changed

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
to 15%

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
so

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
your

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
figure

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
is not a

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
that it actually

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
contains another

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
thing I do not know

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
what this

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
is called

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
because this

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
I have not used

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
but your

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
figure is not a

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
example of a

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
.eps

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
such a file

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
I

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
look at

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
my back

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
there is no

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
case

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Oh

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
I

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
that

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
but I can

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
that I

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
take as an example

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
suppose

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
now this is

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
what I want

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
to be

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
good

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
then

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
he

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
he is

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
this strange

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
picture

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
and then

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
suppose

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
I wrote

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
later

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
when I

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
specifically

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
mentioned

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
that

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
this function

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
is the lowest

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
point

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
is the lowest

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
point

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
0.2

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
I

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
that

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
now

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
suppose you

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
teach

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
you to run

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
another picture

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
this function

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
of the picture

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
that you become

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
you later

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
in that

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
article

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
when you

41:40.000 --> 41:41.000
do not

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
0.2

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
this place

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
you have to

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
follow your

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
picture

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
to do

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
relative

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
modification

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
that

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
OK

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
I guess

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
I guess

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
his question

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
should be

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
that

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
I will mention

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
the next section

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
I personally

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
prefer to

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
use

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
latex

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
to

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
draw

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
that

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
of course

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
I know a lot of users

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
will save

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
EPS

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
right

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
that I just

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
mentioned the

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
problem is

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
that he

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
is with you

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
picture

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
is not

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
directly

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
related

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
so

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
should be

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
said

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
if you are

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
in the

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
picture

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
this

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
can achieve

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
this thing

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
but I

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
want to mention

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
that

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
latex

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
can also

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
do

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
control

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
these

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
things

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
that

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
I

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
want to

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
say

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
this page

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
is that

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
you

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
file

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
some

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
part of

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
the data

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
with

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
some other

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
other

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
other

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
part of

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
the data

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
they are

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
related to each other

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
that if

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
you

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
are writing

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
files after

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
you did not

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
put this thing

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
into consideration

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
that you have to

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
manually update

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
figure 1

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
manually update

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
this 20%

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
and manually

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
update this

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
three parts

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
because you

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
write files

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
when you did not

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
pay attention

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
to you

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
is to write

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
separately

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
when you

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
update

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
you become

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
because you

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
know that the

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
red part

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
is actually

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
these data

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
points these

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
values are

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
related to each

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
other

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
so if you

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
have this

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
concept, then

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
you can

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
put

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
figure 1

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
these

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
or these

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
values

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
are output

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
into three

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
different files

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
figure 1

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
maybe you

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
figure 1.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
EPS

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
is a file

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
and then this

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
20%

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
you may

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
output

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
a data

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
1.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
TXT

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
and then

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
this place

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
you may output

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
a data

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
2.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
TXT

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
and then this

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
data 1 and

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
data 2

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
you have to

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
use your

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
MATLAB

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
or R to

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
generate

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
when you

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
are drawing

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
a good calculation

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
at the same time

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
you put

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
20%

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
and 10%

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
it out

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
output

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
into two

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
TXT

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
EPS

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
and then you

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
input data

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
1.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
TXT

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
and data

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
2.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
TXT

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
so

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
this is

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
ok

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
I know

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
this is

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
a personal

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
use

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I think this

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
is very practical

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
and if you

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
want to change

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
a lot of things

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
at once

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
you have to

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
remember this

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
thing

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
I

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
wrap up

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
a little bit

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
now this

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
20%

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
but

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
when I do

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
figure 1

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
I do

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
another thing

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
called

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
data 1

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
equals

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
20

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
measure

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
right

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
thank you

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
ok

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
this is mainly

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
practical

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
and

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
this

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
doesn't seem

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
to have a book

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
talking about

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
this

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
this is

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
more of a

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
writing habit

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
here

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
to remind

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
the distance

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
is

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
time

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
I

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
will

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
talk about

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
TIKZ

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
and

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Beamer

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
TIKZ

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
is a

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
language

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
that can

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
draw a

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
picture

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
and

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
it can

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
directly

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
do the

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
drawing

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
in

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Lighttime

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
and

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
I

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
personally

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
like it

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
because

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
this is a

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
basic introduction

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
so I

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
jump to

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
some basic

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
things

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
that

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
I

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
just

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
mentioned

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
is the

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
EPS file

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
so I

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
think you

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
have some

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
basic

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
knowledge

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
of the

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
file

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
basically

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
a

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
file

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
can be

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
classified

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
as a

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
quantity

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
file

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
or

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
a

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
dot

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
file

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
a

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
quantity

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
file

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
different

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
lines

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
different shapes

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
different words

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
and their

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
color they

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
are stored

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
information

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
so when you

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
enlarge the

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
picture

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
when it

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
can be

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
based on

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
these

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
shapes

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
colors

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
to do

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
the same

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
proportion

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
so you

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
will not see

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
these

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
sentence

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
phenomenon

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
that

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
dot

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
picture

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
means that

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
that

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
special

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
academic report

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
academic research

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
it

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
actually

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
quantity picture

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
is a better

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
choice

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
because

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
back to the

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
beginning

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
is that you

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
have to do

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
academic report

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
you have to

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
say that

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
the precise

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
and concise

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
is that

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
you describe

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
things to be

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
precise

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
like this

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
is not

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
acceptable

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
like this

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
is not

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
acceptable

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
for

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
this

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
setting

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
you may

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
standard

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Latex may

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
be less used

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
because most of the

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
blocks may still

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Matloft

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
paste well

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
output into

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
EPS

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
and then add

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
in

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
that

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
TIKZ

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
this

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
reading kit

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
it is

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
such

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
a process

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
it

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
is called

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
a begin

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
and then

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
TIKZ

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
this

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
way is

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
it draws a

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
point it

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
designated

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
coordinates

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
such as

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
the

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
seventh line of

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
this instruction

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
means that

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
I start

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
at the

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
coordinates

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
negative

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
0.50

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
has been drawn

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
to 0.50

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
so I

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
have drawn

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
this line

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
and then

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
this bar

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
arrow

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
means that

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
I want to draw

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
a line

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
and then the

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
arrow is

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
the second

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
this instruction

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
means that

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
I'm at

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
1.50

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
this coordinate

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
I want to put

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
a node

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
and then the

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
node content is

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
X

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
so I have

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
a X

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
here

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
and then

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
this node

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
is to

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
the right

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
of this

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
coordinate

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
node

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
is to

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
put a

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
text

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
instruction

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
and then

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
the middle

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
number can

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
specify that

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
I want to ask

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
your arrow

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
symbol is

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
which line

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
is the first line

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
of the middle number

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
right

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
so your arrow

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
is this

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
is drawn

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
is

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
a

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
so

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
the seventh line

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
is only to draw

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
arrow

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
that the eighth line

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
is to draw

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
X

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
that

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
nine and ten

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
this line

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
is that it can

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
combine the

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
instruction

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
I can draw

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
arrow

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
while drawing

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
text

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
this means that

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
from 0.5 to

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
0.5

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
draw a

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
arrow

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
after

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
I put a

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
node

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
and this node

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
is in

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
this

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
0.5

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
above

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
I want to draw

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
a Y

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
right

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
so I can draw

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
X axis

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
and Y axis

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
and then

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
some other

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
people like to say

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
I can draw

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
a rectangle

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
rectangle

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
is to say

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
I specify

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
four

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
four points

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
I draw

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
from this

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
negative one

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
negative one

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
this point

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
to positive one

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
this is

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
two relative

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
points and then

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
I want to draw a

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
rectangle

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
and then this

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
instruction means that

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
I want to draw a

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
circle

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
and then this

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
0.0 is the

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
circle

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
and then the

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
radius is

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
one

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
and then

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
green means

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
that I want to

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
draw it

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
in green

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
that 14-16

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
instruction means

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
that I want to

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
draw it

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
in green

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
and then

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
it is

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
this

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
curve

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
right

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
big and

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
dash

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
it means

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
a rough curve

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
and then

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
these things

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
mean

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
the point

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
so I

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
specify some

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
points

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
that

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
point

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
here

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
I use

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
a cartoon to

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
represent

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
cartoon

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
means

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
that

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
the front

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
is the

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
point

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
so I

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
use

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
degree to

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
represent

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
and then the

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
second point

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
is the

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
radius

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
so I

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
equal to

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
90

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
equal to

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
this point

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
start

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
and then draw

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
a line

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
to the

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
angle is

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
210

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
and then draw

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
the angle

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
is 330

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
and then this

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
cycle is

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
back to

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
the original

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
point

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
so I have

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
to mention

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
here is that

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
you use this

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
set of tools

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
you can be very

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
precise to draw

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
the picture

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
you want

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
because of

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
these numbers

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
you can see

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
it is

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
this circle

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
it with this

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
square is

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
cut

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
you can imagine

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
if you draw

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
this picture

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
with PowerPoint

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
you can draw

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
that square

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
and circle

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
cut

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
may be

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
you need to adjust

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
quite a long

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
should be able to draw

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
but to adjust

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
quite a long

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
because you specify

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
this axis

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
you can also

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
ensure that

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
this triangle

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
is the inner

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
circle

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
and you can be sure

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
that this point

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
on the circle

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
so

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
simply put

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
I want to say

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
that you use

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
this set of

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
TIKZ

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
is very

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
precise drawing

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
you can draw

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
the picture

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
very precisely

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
so

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
this comparison

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I skip

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
because of

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
time

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
so

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
next I will

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
introduce

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
called

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
PGF

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
PLOT

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
it is actually

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
based on

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
TIKZ

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
a set of

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
drawing

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
package

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
yes

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
it is

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
mainly

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
it can draw

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
like this

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
picture

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
and it

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
has a very good

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
compatibility

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
with

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
LaTeX

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
and

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
it

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
is also

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
I thought

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
it

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
because it is

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
text

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
so you can

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
simply say

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
you draw a picture

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
you can

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
ensure that

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
I changed the picture

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
where

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
this may

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
use

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Office

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
autofocus may be

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
quite difficult

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
because

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
like you

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
to adjust the position

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
you just adjust a pixel

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
you may be in

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Word

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
is more difficult to see

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
the change

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
but if you use

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
the text

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
you use this

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
TIKZ

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
to track the

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
words you can

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
see the

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
change in

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
this

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
because of time

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
so I'll show you

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
a simple

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
example

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
is good

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
this is also my

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
experience

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
here

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
if you want to

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
draw a picture

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
and paste it

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
into the paper

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
usually

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
the workflow is

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
I first use

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Meta

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
or Python

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
or

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
suppose to

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
write a

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
script

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
after writing it

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
out of the

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
corresponding

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
picture

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
and then save it

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
as a

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
After saving the

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
picture file

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
you put the

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
picture file

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
into the

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
file

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
so it's

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
like this

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
this picture

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
actually has

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
some problems

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
if you are

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
large enough

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
it has some

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
problems

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
the first

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
problem is

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
that these

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
words are too

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
small

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
but the

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
size of the

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
words

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
depends on

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
the ratio of

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
your picture

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
if you put

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
the picture

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
into the

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
picture file

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
some words

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
look fine

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
but if you

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
put it

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
too large

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
the words

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
look too

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
small

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
so it's

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
not easy

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
to read

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
this also

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
tells us that

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
the size of the

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
words

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
is related

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
to the

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
file

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
so

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
controlling

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
the

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
size of

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
the

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
words

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
should be

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
handled

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
in

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
a

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
systematic

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
way

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
the second

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
problem is

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
that

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
for some people

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
it's

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
too

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
systematic

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
so

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
it should

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
be handled

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
in a

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
systematic way

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
because it

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
depends on

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
the

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
ratio of

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
the

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
word

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
and

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
the

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
ratio

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
of

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
the

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
picture

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
and

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
the

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
word

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
so

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
if you

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
use

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
the

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
original

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
workflow

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
you

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
have to

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
manually

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
input

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
the

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
word

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
and

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
manually

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
input

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
the

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
word

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
and

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
manually

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
input

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
the

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
word

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
and

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
manually

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
input

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
the

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
word

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
and

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
manually

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
input

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
the

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
word

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
and

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
manually

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
input

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
the

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
word

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
and

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
manually

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
input

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
the

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
word

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
and

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
finally

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
your

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
application

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
file

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
and

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
you

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
need to

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
decipher

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
that

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
word

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
and

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
eventually

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
you

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
need to

55:56.000 --> 55:57.520
decipher

55:57.520 --> 55:59.000
that

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
word

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
and

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
eventually

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
you need to

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
decipher

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
the

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
word

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
and

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
encode

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
that

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
word

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
and

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
use

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
decrease

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
the

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
word

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
and

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
字

56:17.000 --> 56:24.840
ok

56:24.840 --> 56:26.840
you need to adjust the size of the image

56:26.840 --> 56:28.840
and the font

56:28.840 --> 56:30.840
of course you need to adjust the

56:30.840 --> 56:31.840
initialization of the line

56:31.840 --> 56:32.840
this is

56:32.840 --> 56:33.840
you need to make relative adjustments

56:33.840 --> 56:35.840
according to your file

56:35.840 --> 56:36.840
ok

56:36.840 --> 56:37.840
this

56:37.840 --> 56:39.840
I personally recommend this workflow

56:39.840 --> 56:42.840
because when you want to run another image

56:42.840 --> 56:44.840
you just need to change the raw data

56:44.840 --> 56:45.840
you run it again

56:45.840 --> 56:47.840
you don't need to change the image

56:47.840 --> 56:48.840
you just need to change the raw data

56:48.840 --> 56:50.840
so this data will

56:50.840 --> 56:52.840
be like running another image

56:52.840 --> 56:54.840
you don't need to worry about the size of the word

56:54.840 --> 56:56.840
or the group of the equation

56:56.840 --> 56:58.840
or anything else

56:58.840 --> 56:59.840
ok

56:59.840 --> 57:00.840
this is my recommended workflow

57:00.840 --> 57:03.840
so this is my personal experience

57:03.840 --> 57:07.840
ok

57:07.840 --> 57:08.840
10 minutes left

57:08.840 --> 57:09.840
ok

57:09.840 --> 57:10.840
I don't have much left

57:10.840 --> 57:11.840
ok

57:11.840 --> 57:12.840
for binger

57:12.840 --> 57:13.840
ok

57:13.840 --> 57:14.840
I will talk about binger

57:14.840 --> 57:15.840
binger

57:15.840 --> 57:16.840
is actually

57:16.840 --> 57:17.840
based on LaTeX

57:17.840 --> 57:20.840
it is a system that can be used for projection

57:20.840 --> 57:21.840
like this image

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
is made by binger

57:23.840 --> 57:25.840
binger

57:25.840 --> 57:26.840
I personally think the advantage is that

57:26.840 --> 57:27.840
it has some

57:27.840 --> 57:30.840
pre-defined themes and colors

57:30.840 --> 57:32.840
and these themes and colors

57:32.840 --> 57:34.840
are very suitable for academic reports

57:34.840 --> 57:36.840
academic speeches

57:36.840 --> 57:38.840
and

57:38.840 --> 57:39.840
these files

57:39.840 --> 57:41.840
are all PDF files

57:41.840 --> 57:43.840
so compatibility is not a problem

57:43.840 --> 57:45.840
and of course it also has some other advantages

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
and these advantages are mainly

57:46.840 --> 57:49.840
overlap with LaTeX and TRKG

57:50.840 --> 57:52.840
ok, next I want to show you

57:52.840 --> 57:54.840
an example

57:54.840 --> 57:56.840
let me show you this image

57:57.840 --> 57:59.840
like this

58:16.840 --> 58:18.840
let me play it again

58:18.840 --> 58:19.840
ok

58:25.840 --> 58:27.840
I may choose the wrong window

58:27.840 --> 58:30.840
because I seem to have two windows

58:30.840 --> 58:31.840
this one?

58:31.840 --> 58:32.840
this one?

58:32.840 --> 58:33.840
yes

58:37.840 --> 58:39.840
oh, this one, I know this one

58:39.840 --> 58:40.840
oh, this one, yes

58:40.840 --> 58:42.840
this is

58:42.840 --> 58:43.840
binger

58:43.840 --> 58:45.840
has built-in format

58:45.840 --> 58:47.840
and

58:47.840 --> 58:49.840
there are different names

58:49.840 --> 58:50.840
such as

58:50.840 --> 58:51.840
Ann Arbor

58:51.840 --> 58:52.840
or something

58:52.840 --> 58:54.840
there are a lot of names

58:55.840 --> 58:56.840
this means that

58:56.840 --> 58:57.840
if you go to the projection

58:57.840 --> 58:59.840
to configure its

58:59.840 --> 59:00.840
shape

59:00.840 --> 59:01.840
so you can see that

59:01.840 --> 59:03.840
some projection

59:03.840 --> 59:05.840
it will have some

59:05.840 --> 59:07.840
footnotes

59:07.840 --> 59:09.840
and

59:09.840 --> 59:10.840
some footnotes

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
may be on the left and right

59:12.840 --> 59:13.840
so it can choose

59:13.840 --> 59:15.840
binger's theme

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
and this theme

59:16.840 --> 59:18.840
will control the configuration of the projection

59:18.840 --> 59:19.840
after choosing the theme

59:19.840 --> 59:20.840
you can choose

59:20.840 --> 59:21.840
binger's color

59:21.840 --> 59:23.840
what kind of color I want to use

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
like this

59:24.840 --> 59:26.840
like this may be

59:26.840 --> 59:28.840
red

59:28.840 --> 59:29.840
red

59:29.840 --> 59:30.840
and maybe

59:30.840 --> 59:32.840
some are yellow

59:32.840 --> 59:34.840
some are gray

59:34.840 --> 59:35.840
and so on

59:35.840 --> 59:37.840
so

59:37.840 --> 59:39.840
binger has

59:39.840 --> 59:41.840
a lot of choices

59:41.840 --> 59:42.840
to do

59:46.840 --> 59:47.840
ok

59:47.840 --> 59:48.840
this is

59:48.840 --> 59:49.840
to show you

59:49.840 --> 59:50.840
binger has some

59:50.840 --> 59:52.840
themes and colors

59:52.840 --> 59:53.840
ok

59:53.840 --> 59:55.840
if you want to use binger

59:55.840 --> 59:56.840
to make a projection

59:56.840 --> 59:57.840
actually

59:57.840 --> 59:58.840
this page

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.840
the corresponding code is very simple

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.840
these lines

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.840
if you want to produce a binger code

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.840
you just

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.840
produce a binger slide

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840
you just use

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840
begin friend

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:09.840
end friend

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.840
to deal with it

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.840
and put a

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.840
big quotation mark

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.840
put the binger you want to put in the middle

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.840
put the title you want to put in the middle

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.840
and in the middle

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.840
you just need to focus on

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.840
what your content is

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840
so like my front page

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.840
I mainly put this

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840
prince

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840
put a prince

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840
like this

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840
so

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.840
like this

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.840
uh

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.840
uh

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.840
like this header

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840
or that

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:32.840
footer

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840
I don't have to worry

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.840
binger will automatically

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.840
fill these in for you

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
and

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
this information

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840
is actually

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840
a professional projection

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840
because the audience

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.840
must know

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.840
who you are

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.840
what page you are in

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.840
what is the topic you want to report

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840
ok

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.840
then I will skip it quickly

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.840
then

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840
here are some details of binger

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840
it has some built-in

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.840
like a block

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.840
you can choose

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840
and you can also make

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.840
many different columns

01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840
because of the time factor

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840
I skipped

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.840
binger can do the same

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840
is to

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.840
change pages

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
some effects

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.840
like this

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.840
same

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.840
same video

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840
I can control

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.840
in the first page

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.840
I want to appear

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840
some words

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840
in the second page

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840
appear other words

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840
third

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840
then in another page

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.840
appear other words

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
like this

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840
that means

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840
in the first page

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:21.840
to the last page

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840
I have to appear

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840
this

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840
on-site 1 to end

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840
this line

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840
and then

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840
I jump to the next page

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840
this is the result of the second page

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.840
the second page

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840
it will appear

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840
on-site 2

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840
then

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:33.840
at the same time

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840
on-site 2 and 3

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840
right

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840
that

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840
if I jump to the next page

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
when the third page

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
it should

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840
appear

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840
this

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840
because

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.840
I have to appear

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840
on-site 1 to the last page

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840
then

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840
this page

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.840
middle

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840
this should disappear

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840
so it will become

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840
this

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840
right

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.840
binger

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.840
it can also do

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.840
some

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840
here

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840
is

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:57.840
it used

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.840
many different

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840
videos

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.840
to do

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.840
similar animation

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840
effect

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840
but

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.840
animation

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840
here

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840
is not as good

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
as

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840
powerpoint

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.840
powerpoint

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.840
can also

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.840
binger animation

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.840
is relatively

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.840
simple

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.840
I think it is relatively simple

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840
but

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.840
if we want to do

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.840
academic reports

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840
in fact, I think

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840
this is a good thing

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:20.840
when the mosquitoes

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.840
jump around

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.840
in fact, your

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
your readers

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840
will be a little

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840
confused

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840
like this

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.840
right

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840
good

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.840
that

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.840
this is mainly

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.840
I briefly introduce

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.840
binger

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
that

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
time factor

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.840
I quickly

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.840
show some

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.840
of my own

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.840
presentation

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.840
like this

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840
this is a

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840
poster

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840
and this is

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
made with

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840
LaTeX

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.840
and TI-KZ

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.840
and

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.840
its original file

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:48.840
is actually very large

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:49.840
seems to be

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.840
its width

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.840
seems to be

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.840
64 inches

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840
and

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.840
the length

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840
seems to be

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840
more than 30 inches

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.840
and

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.840
because of

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.840
its

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.840
so I just

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840
output a

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.840
pdf file

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:03.840
that

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.840
during the

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:05.840
production process

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.840
I directly

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.840
pdf file

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.840
it

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840
so

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840
the resolution

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840
is very

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.840
very high

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.840
so

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840
this is actually

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.840
a poster

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840
right

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
that

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840
that

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840
what kind of

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840
restrictions

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.840
are all

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840
drawn with

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.840
TI-KZ

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840
very

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:25.840
spectacular

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840
very spectacular

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.840
right

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.840
that

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.840
can be drawn

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.840
right

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.840
so

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.840
so

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.840
some people say

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840
LaTeX

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840
is very

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840
plain

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840
it is

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840
very

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840
simple

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.840
right

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840
right

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840
so

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
the application

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
is very

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840
simple

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840
it is

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.840
so

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:48.840
just

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.840
the

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.840
first

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840
the

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.840
picture

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.840
is

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840
in

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.840
is

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.840

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840
the

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840
speech

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.840
is

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480
咱

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480
咱

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480
咱

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480
咱

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480
咱

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480
咱

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.480
咱

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.480
咱

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480
咱

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480
咱

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480
咱

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.480
咱

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.480
咱

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480
咱

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480
我想

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.480
那我想

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.480
那我想

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480
現在就我們三個人

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:01.480
因為現在就我們三個人

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480
那現在就我們三個人

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.480
那這樣子

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.480
Oscar你有什麼問題嗎

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.480
Oscar你有什麼問題嗎

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480
有

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480
就是那個

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480
就是那個

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480
就是那個

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.480
就是

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480
就是

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480
就是

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480
就是

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480
就是

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.480
就是

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480
就是

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480
就是

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.480
就是

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.480
就是

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.480
所以我想我

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480
所以我想我的問題是

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480
所以我想我的問題是

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.400
就是

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.400
就是

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400
那麼花多久的時間

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.400
譬如假設你要做出

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.400
你今天這個style就好了

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.400
大概花了多久的時間

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.800
製作出這個東西

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.800
或者說你的learning curve是多陡

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.600
好

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.720
我誠實回答

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.600
我誠實回答

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.880
就這一整期的影片

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880
就這一整期的影片

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.240
我大概

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.240
厲害

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240
認真做

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.400
因為我之前

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.360
就有什麼慢些少增多增

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.480
那認真的做只是

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.480
人生畢業

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.480
那我大概花了三到四天吧

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480
對

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.480
那當然有一些投影片是那種

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.480
像這一頁投影片我是

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.480
我是就直接做

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.480
所以我就是那個code

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.480
直接複製過來這樣

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.480
然後對

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.480
有一些是現成的

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.480
那

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.480
多陡的話我覺得

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.480
我可以跟你分享一下我的經驗

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.480
就是我

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.480
第一次用Latex的話

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.480
大概是

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.480
我十二年前

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.480
我第一次用Latex

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.480
那

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.480
當時是好像有

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.480
有一個作業要

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.480
打那個就是解答吧

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.480
打Solution

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.480
然後他就是請我們用Latex

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480
來打這樣

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.480
那當時我算是第一次

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.480
接觸Latex然後當時我會的功能

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.480
就是把字打出來

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.480
把方程式打出來

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.480
大概就這樣

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.480
然後連

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.480
可能還有基本的reference

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.480
就是說

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.480
方程式1

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.480
文件裡面引用方程式1

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.480
方程式1這樣

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480
那插入圖片其實那個時候還不太會

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.480
所以我大概十二年前

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.480
大概就是文字打出來的程度

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.480
大概我想一下

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480
大概我

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.480
我八年前就是

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.480
我有一群朋友就說我們就是有分組報告

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.480
就說大家

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.480
幾個朋友就說那我們都

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.480
要不要都用Latex來打這樣

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.480
當時就是強迫自己

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.480
因為有通財壓力

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.480
所以就是

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.480
某一門課的所有報告

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.480
都用Latex打

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.480
那當時我自己的經驗就是

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.480
可以把文字打出來

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.480
可以把方程式打出來

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.480
那還會插入一些圖這樣

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.480
那可是圖還是

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.480
簡單的就是

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480
當時還是用PNG的圖

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.480
對然後就是插入圖

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.480
OK那之後就是我上

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.480
授班之後呢

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.480
我就想說

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.480
聽說這個東西對

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:00.480
寫Paper很有用那是不是要認真

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.480
學一下這樣

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.480
我當時授班的時候就是我假設

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.480
如果有書面報告就會

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.480
盡量就是

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.480
把它整理成用Latex

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.480
把它整理成一份文件

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.480
然後

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.480
把一些圖片啊或者是

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.480
重要的方程式推導過程

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.480
把它打成一份Latex文件

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.480
然後

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.480
在那個之後我才

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.480
還會比較多其他功能就是什麼插入

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.480
除了插入圖片之外

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.480
可能還會

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.480
把圖片做裁剪

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.480
或者是插入表格表格

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.480
裡面再插入圖片

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.480
對就是我覺得

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.480
Learning curve是

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.480
根據你手頭上的project

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.480
去決定的

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.480
如果你手頭上的project就是只要

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.480
把字打出來的話那其實

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.480
沒有到非常的困難

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.480
你大概只要知道你

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.480
怎麼把數學方式打出來

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.480
Latex就會排

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.480
排出一個還

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.480
OK的文件給你看這樣

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.480
那如果你後面要進行更多的調整的話

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.480
你就必須要去學一些

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.480
其實我蠻多資訊都是Google來的

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.480
就是如果你

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.480
可以把你的問題

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.480
用英文描述去Google

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.480
通常會找到答案

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.480
有時候會有些線

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.480
你直接複製貼上

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.480
好我不知道

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.480
這樣可能回答有點太長

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.480
反正簡短的回答就是說

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.480
我花蠻多時間的

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.480
我博班也是

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.480
都在處理

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.480
Latex這些格式

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.480
做投影片之類的

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.480
所以花時間

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.480
然後

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.480
取決於你手上的project

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.480
那我個人是覺得做出這些結果

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.480
還蠻有成就感的

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:48.480
對

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.480
不知道這樣有沒有回答到很多問題

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.480
對

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.480
那這樣說好了就是說如果你有想要

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.480
做出什麼

01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:58.480
畫面的話

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.480
你也可以跟我討論這樣

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.480
對

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.480
因為有時候是

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.480
我想要做出某個畫面可是我不知道

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.480
對你的指令是什麼

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:10.480
或是說我不知道要怎麼做出

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.480
這個

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.480
舉例來說像我聽到這一頁

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.480
假設我要做出這個結果

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.480
PowerPoint可能就很簡單

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.480
我就是拉三個文字方塊

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.480
然後字放進去

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.480
那如果是beamer的話你可能

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.480
必須要知道下面這些指令這樣

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.480
可是這種東西就是說

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.480
你知道之後你以後就記得了

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:32.480
然後使用起來就是會

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.480
就是你看到這個圖

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.480
你就知道OK

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.480
所以我就必須要放這些指令才會出現這個結果

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.480
所以這個有時候也是

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.480
取決於你的

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.480
有沒有遇到這個問題

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.480
然後熟悉度怎麼樣這樣

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.480
當然就是

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.480
有任何問題歡迎跟我討論

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.480
對

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.480
感謝

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480
不客氣不客氣

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.480
很高興有人可以

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.480
討論

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.480
比如說就像大概你的12年前

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.480
我可以做出一個Document

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:10.480
然後裡面有一些方程式

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.480
插幾個圖就插幾個EPS圖

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.480
我還沒有辦法像你剛剛講的

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.480
做出那個

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.480
就有raw data跟

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.480
bigger style的那個東西

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.480
這個我主要是個人使用經驗

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.480
那

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.480
我覺得你加EPS

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.480
有它的方便性

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.480
因為你的圖就是EPS嘛

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.480
直接插入

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.480
你只要稍微調一下它的大小就可以了

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.480
那這個有它的方便性在

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.480
我一剛開始也都是這樣做的

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.480
那

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.480
就是我

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.480
有點是

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.480
做越多事情我會發現就是

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.480
每個工具都有

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.480
它的各自一些限制

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.480
那

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:56.480
所以我目前是用這樣的workflow

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.480
對

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.480
如果初學者我還是還蠻建議

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.480
就是直接用EPS把圖放進去

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.480
這樣方便

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.480
可是這樣就會被嫌棄說那個

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.480
像你剛剛講的

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.480
字太小

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.480
這件事情我被嫌了大概100遍

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.480
好這個我也可以稍微

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.480
做經驗分享

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.480
我在換這個workflow之前呢

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.480
我有

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.480
另外一個就是workflow假設

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.480
這個是1這是2.0

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.480
我有一個1.5workflow

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.480
就是

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.480
存檔的時候不要直接存EPS

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480
你像MATLAB可以存

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.480
FIG檔

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.480
我不知道RR可不可以

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:42.480
就是某一種文

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.480
某一種圖檔

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.480
它是可以再被載入

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.480
然後再重新調格式的

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.480
像說如果是MATLAB的話它有一個檔案叫做

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.480
FIG檔

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.480
然後這個檔案呢你可以

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.480
再被MATLAB載入之後

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.480
它跟MATLAB產生圖是

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.480
完全一樣的

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.480
就它會把這些

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.480
格式啊字啊全部都是

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.480
儲存起來存到那個FIG檔

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.480
裡面

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.480
那所以我的workflow

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.480
1.5就是

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.480
除了存PNG

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.480
EPS之外我還會存一個FIG檔

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.480
然後

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.480
1.5的workflow就是說

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.480
假設字太小我就打開FIG檔

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.480
調這個字的大小

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.480
再存成一次EPS

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.480
對

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.480
那這個算是

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.480
workflow 1.5啦

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.480
那勉強可以啦

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.480
你就看這個字太小

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.480
那我就是再開一次再調一次

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.480
再存一次

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.480
是可以

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.480
對

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.480
如果是R的話

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.480
可能要再

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.480
應該是有個相對應的格式它可以存成

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.480
就是最原始

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.480
就是可編輯的

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.480
可能要找一下是哪一個格式

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.480
對

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.480
我就要研究一下

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.480
這個好處就是說

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.480
你不用你程式不用再重跑啦

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.480
因為你的圖是

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.480
就是可編輯的圖已經是

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.480
存好了

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.480
對

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.480
這算是使用經驗

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.480
那初學者還是

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.480
EPS我還蠻建議的

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.480
就是方便而且又是像量圖

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.480
嗯

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.480
好

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.480
那

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.480
請問還有什麼問題嗎

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.480
目前好像還好

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.480
就是總之就是

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.480
就是多練習嘛

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.480
對其實就是取決於說

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.480
你

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:50.480
你用data做了多少

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.480
事情就是

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.480
當你做越多的報告你就會遇到

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.480
越多的

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.480
小地方需要克服這樣

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.480
對那

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.480
當你都克服之後你就

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.480
這東西就會變成是你的這樣

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.480
那當然你

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.480
如果想要跟我討論我也

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.480
非常歡迎我也會把

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.480
相對應的code

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.480
就是把一些code給

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.480
大家看這樣讓大家知道

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.480
這是怎麼做的

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.480
對

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:24.480
我覺得Latex Community它還蠻

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.480
都還蠻和善的啦

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.480
你去Google它都可以找到code

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.480
那我很多code也都是拼湊的

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.480
來的

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.480
對

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.480
所以我覺得

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.480
我覺得重點是要

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.480
要有人一起討論啦如果有人一起討論的話

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.480
就是可能有大家不同的做法

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.480
對

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.480
好謝謝

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.480
現在大家問題好像都差不多了

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480
那我想請問俊霖有特別想要再

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.480
補充嗎

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.480
跟大家講一兩句話就是給所有

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.480
想學Latex的人

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.480
因為我想之後等你講完這段小節

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.480
我就把錄影就關了

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.480
OK

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.480
好了

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.480
我覺得Latex還是取決於

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.480
你的

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.480
你想要做什麼文件

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.480
像這張圖

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:18.480
如果你只是要很簡單的

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:20.480
做個research note的話

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.480
又無所謂的

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.480
可是當你的文件

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.480
複雜度越來越高的時候

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.480
當你要寫論文寫書的時候

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.480
Latex我

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.480
私心推薦啦

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.480
當然一剛開始學習

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.480
門檻是比較高的

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.480
可是如果有相對應的機會去練習

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.480
嘗試把自己的報告用Latex

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.480
去做的話

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.480
我相信大家也都會

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.480
上升

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.480
大家都可以發paper

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.480
好那就這我這集的小節

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.480
謝謝講者

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.480
那這樣我就先把錄影就關起來了
