WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Yes, Project Terra is an international platform for sharing information.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
We hope that scholars from all over the world can share with us

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
the results of our current research and development,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
and more importantly, what is the trend of development.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
This is not something you can easily find in Taiwan.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Project Terra can also provide people who are doing research

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
with opportunities to exchange and collaborate.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
So we hold a seminar like this every week.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
The speakers are basically all members,

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
and they will share their new ideas and research trends.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
Project Terra is a self-releasing organization

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
that is dedicated to public service.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
We have no intention of making any profit.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
All of our members are very enthusiastic doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
You can see our website.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
you can take a look at our website.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
If you are interested in Project Terra,

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
and would like to keep in touch with us,

01:38.000 --> 01:48.000
you can join our membership.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
If you can find other people to work with,

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
we will be happy to help you.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
If you have any questions,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
you can ask us directly.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We are usually very free to talk.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Sure, no problem.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
I would like to remind you that

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
when we have more and more listeners,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
we will set the volume to silent.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
So if you remember to click on the microphone icon

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
before speaking,

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
you can ask questions or

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
if you have any questions,

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
you can directly talk to the speaker, Beta.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Okay, Beta, let's get started.

03:09.000 --> 03:23.000
For some reason, I can't share the screen.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Let me re-join.

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
Okay, thank you, Ted.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
My name is Chengxinda.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
My Chinese name is Ergongcheng.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
My surname is Daoda.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Today, I would like to thank Ted and Terra

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
for giving me the opportunity to introduce

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
a method we are developing.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
This is a new method.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
The main purpose of this method is to deal with

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
the interaction between light and matter.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
We hope to provide a new way

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
to do this.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The method we propose is called

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Mixed Quantum Classical Electrodynamics.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
In English, it should be called

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Quantum-Fixed Mixed Electrodynamics.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I will introduce to you in detail

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
what kind of method it is.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Okay, let me introduce myself.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
My name is Chengxinda.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
My background is that when I was in Taiwan,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I was studying math and physics in college.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I majored in math and physics.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Later, for some reason,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
when I applied to go to college,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I saw that there was a program called

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Chemical Physics in Columbia.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I thought it was very similar to what I was doing.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
It was also something I was interested in.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
So I applied to this program.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I was very lucky to apply to this program.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I found out that when I came to the United States,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I became a chemical physicist.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I have been used as a chemical physicist from beginning to end.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Because of this reason,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I am now working as a chemical physicist

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
at Penn University.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
To sum up,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I use the theory of physics

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
and the computational method developed in physics

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
to study the problem of chemistry.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
My professional field is

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
studying dynamics,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
which is the theory of dynamics

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and the computational method of dynamics.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Specifically,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
my Ph.D. is in Columbia.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I am doing chemical dynamics,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
that is,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
electromagnetic dynamics in a chemical environment.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
My postdoc,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
what I am doing now

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
is a little different from my Ph.D.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I am doing the interaction of light and matter.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Today,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
my talk will focus on

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
my postdoc work.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
OK.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
First of all, what is light?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We often say that light is an object.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Basically,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
light is a very important thing in everyday life.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Light is basically an electromagnetic wave.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Electromagnetic waves

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
are basically the source of all our information.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
We see things in this world.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
From the greatest extent,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
how do we know

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
what happens on other planets

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
or on Mars, for example?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We can

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
reflect the light of the sun from Mars

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
and see from the spectrum of sunlight

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
what kind of matter there is on Mars.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
How much of this matter is there?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Then,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
there are more possibilities

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
in the development of modern science.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
These are no longer visible light.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We have different kinds of light

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
from low energy to high energy.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Then, from the low energy range,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
we have NMR

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
to Raman

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
or IR spectrum.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
These things are

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
lower than visible light.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Within the range of higher than visible light,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
there is UV,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
which is ultraviolet,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
and

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
X-ray spectroscopy, which is more powerful.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Basically, our feature is that

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
basically,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
this

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
spectroscopy

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
shows that

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
the stronger the energy,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
the deeper we can see.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Just like in the form of X-ray,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
we can see that it can

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
reflect the electrons in the inner layer.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
So you can know what the behavior of the electrons in the inner layer is.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
This is one of the functions

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
of light and matter interaction.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
In recent years,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
because of the development of nanotechnology,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
we can make our devices

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
in a smaller scale.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
So we can even use light,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
the quality of light,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
to manipulate matter,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
to change the nature of matter.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
For example,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
we can put

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
a chemical reaction

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
in a cavity,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
and the nature of the chemical reaction

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
may be changed.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Or we can put this chemical reaction

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
on a crystal.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
This chemical reaction may have

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
different behavior.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
There are other

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
different nanostructures,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
nanostructures,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
which can have different

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
effects on light-matter interaction

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
and change the nature of matter.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Another very important example

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
is that in recent years,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
there is a very popular

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
study

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
on how we use

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
light-matter interaction

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
to change,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
for example,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
this paper

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
is a paper

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
about

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
the conductivity

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
of organic semiconductors.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
They put a very thin

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
membrane structure,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
and there is a circle

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
above it,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
and attach it

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
to the organic semiconductor.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
It can change

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
the conductivity of the semiconductor.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It can change it

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
from a bad conductor

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
to a better conductor.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
But these

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
modern developments

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
all use the nature of light-matter.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
When we need

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
to understand the nature of light-matter,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
we need to discuss

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
what is light

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
and what is the difference

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
between classical light and light-matter.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
The classical light

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
is in the left panel.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
We regard classical light as an electromagnetic wave,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
and the development

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
of the electromagnetic wave

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
is based on

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
the Maxwell's equation,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
which is

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
the Maxwell's equation.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
This is a Maxwell's equation

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
without a source.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
This is a

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
propagate,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
a electromagnetic wave moving forward

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
without any source.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
This is the classical view

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
of light.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
In quantum mechanics,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
we regard light as a group

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
of energy.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Its energy

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
is discretized.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
You may have heard of

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
the Uncertainty Principle,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
which is

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
the Uncertainty Principle.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The Uncertainty Principle

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
in light

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
corresponds to

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
the distribution of energy.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The energy may not be

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
only one energy,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
but a distribution of probability.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
How does quantum mechanics

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
evolve light?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It is based on

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
the Heisenberg equation.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
The H is an operator

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
in quantum mechanics.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
The H is an operator

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
in quantum mechanics.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
The H is an operator

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
in quantum mechanics.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
This is a description

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
of how light

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
evolves

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
in a space.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
What is the difference

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
between classical

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
and quantum mechanics?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Let's take a look

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
at the matter part.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We can also see

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
what classical matter

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
and quantum matter are.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Classical matter

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
is a particle

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
or many particles.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Many particles

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
follow

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Newton's law

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
in quantum mechanics.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
We all know

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
classical mechanics.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
A particle has a certain speed

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
and this speed changes over time.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
In classical

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
quantum mechanics,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
we take

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
the energy

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
as a series.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
In quantum mechanics,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
we describe

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
the energy

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
as a wave function.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
In quantum mechanics,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
we describe

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
the energy

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
as a wave function.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
The wave function

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
is a

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
distribution

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
in the direction

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
of space and momentum.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It is not a solid

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
particle.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
It is a

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
distribution

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
in the direction

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
of space

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and momentum.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It is a

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
distribution in the direction

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
of space and momentum.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
It is a distribution

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
in the direction

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
of space

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
and momentum.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
It follows

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Schrödinger's equation.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
It follows

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
classical and quantum mechanics.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
It follows quantum mechanics

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
and quantum light mechanics.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
When we describe

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
the interaction

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
of modern light

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and quantum mechanics,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
we can use

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
quantum light

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and quantum mechanics.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
When we have quantum light

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and quantum mechanics together,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
we can get

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
quantum electromagnetic energy

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
In QED,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
we can

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
integrate the matter

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
and light

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
into the same wave function.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Then they will have a combined Hamiltonian.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Then they use this huge thing

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
to evolve together.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
This can include

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
all the interaction

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
in high-level quantum mechanics.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
But this is

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
a very, very large

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
calculation.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It is very difficult

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
to do a real calculation

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
except for some basic models.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
One of the reasons

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
is that the total wave function

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
contains a lot of

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
degrees of freedom.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
There are a lot of variables

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
in it.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
In a real situation,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
for example,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I take a real nanoparticle

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
or a real

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
nanostructure

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
to calculate this thing.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Basically,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
the current theory can't do it.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So we have

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
a more

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
compromise approach.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
We develop a set

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
called Mixed Quantum Classical,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
which is a combination of classical quantum

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
electromagnetic theory.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
In this, we treat

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
light as classical,

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
as classical,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and material as matter.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Therefore,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
we don't need to evolve

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
the light.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
We only need to care about

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
the behavior of matter.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Then we treat

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
the behavior of light

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
as a time-dependent perturbation.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
We treat it as

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
a driving force.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's like

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
something is pushing

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
matter

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
into evolution.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
This is a more

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
practical approach,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
but it has some problems.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Of course,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
it's OK for some problems.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
This is not

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
the method we first proposed.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
This method has been done by many people.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But it still has some problems.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
The first problem

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
is that it has no feedback.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
The so-called feedback is that

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
we treat the light here

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
as bending,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and we don't

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
transfer any energy

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
to the light.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
We don't

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
transfer any feedback

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
to the light.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Basically,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
if you take the whole system,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
the light and matter

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
together,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
you will find that

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
this theory does not meet the energy conservation.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
The second problem is that

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
we don't have fluctuation.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
There is an uncertainty principle.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
In other words,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I should have a

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
standard difference

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
between light and matter.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Because

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
my thing is a

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
distribution,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I should have a

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
distribution width.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
But here,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
because we use classical light,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
there is no

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
fluctuation.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Another problem

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
is that

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
because we treat it as

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
time-dependent perturbation,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
it is a linear response.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Basically,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
the material

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
responds to

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
what the light pushes.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
The light pushes

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
very hard, and it responds very hard.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
However,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
in strong coupling,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
if the light pushes very hard,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
it can change

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
the quality of light.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
This theory

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
cannot be explained.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
The most serious problem

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
is that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
it cannot capture

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
a very important

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
physical quality called spontaneous emission.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
In Chinese, it is called spontaneous emission.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I will explain what it is later.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
These problems

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
cause

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
classical methods

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
to be stuck there.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
It can't explain

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
the quantum mechanics

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
we want to explain.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
So,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
my job

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
is to

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
develop a new

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
method

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
based on

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
mixed quantum classical dynamics.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
We hope

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
to develop

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
a new method

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
that

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
can

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
reconstruct

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
spontaneous emission.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
We can

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
enforce

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
energy conservation.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
We can also

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
add

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
the fluctuation

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
of classical light.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
How do we

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
do this?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Sorry, I have a question.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Please go ahead.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I want to ask

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
because

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
using all quantum mechanics

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
is a bit difficult.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
We cannot calculate it

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
by analytical solution.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
For example, can't we calculate

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
molecular?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Can't we calculate single element?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Can't we calculate many-body?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Yes,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
usually many-body

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
is

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
exponential n.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Think about

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
how many particles

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
exponential n

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
can't run fast.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
What we can do

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
is

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
to treat some degree of freedom

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
as classical.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
There are many good classical methods

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
to propagate Maxwell's equation.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
For example,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
single molecule

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
can be calculated?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Yes.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
As a

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
chemist,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I want to do

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
something practical.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I see.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I am doing high-performance.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I don't know.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I only calculate one by one.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Two or three more

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
are difficult.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
What we want to do

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
is to put

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
a molecule

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
into a cavity.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
I see.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Is LR

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
the same

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
as Lindblad

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
equation operator?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Thank you.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Is it?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I just want to make sure.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It is very similar.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I will not

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
write it down.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
It is very similar to

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Lindblad,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
but it can't be written as

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Lindblad form.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It is a non-linear term.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It is not like Lindblad.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It is a linear term.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
It is a time-dependent

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
and skewed Lindblad.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I see.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Keep going.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I am looking forward to it.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I will talk about it

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
later.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Basically,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
what we want to do

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
is to

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
make a low-energy

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
chemical system.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
We don't

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
consider

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
relative efficiency.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
We don't consider it.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Next,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
we will talk about

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
spontaneous emission.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
What is

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
spontaneous emission?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
The quantum theory of spontaneous emission

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
was proposed by Dirac

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
in 1927.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Before Dirac,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Einstein introduced

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
spontaneous emission.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
In 1927,

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
he introduced

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
spontaneous emission

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
from the first principle.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
So,

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I consider it

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
as a major contribution.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
What is spontaneous emission?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It is basically

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
a transition.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It is a transition from

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
a stimulated state to an excited state.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
In short,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I have an electron.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
It is in a stimulated state.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
It is in an excited state.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
It emits the same light

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
as the transition energy.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
This is called spontaneous emission.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
The most important thing is

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
a quantum system,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
a two-level system,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
a stimulated state and an excited state.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It still emits

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
in vacuum.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
This is because

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
in quantum theory,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
we use

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
a thing called

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
zero-point energy.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It represents the

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
minimum energy of light in vacuum.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Some theories

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
correspond to

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
vacuum fluctuation.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Although it is in vacuum,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
it still

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
interacts with

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
the quantum system

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
to emit spontaneous emission.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Why is

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
spontaneous emission

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
so important?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Fundamentally,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
it is a quantum process.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
In classical theory,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
it is impossible

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
to get spontaneous emission.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Second,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
spontaneous emission

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
is responsible

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
for almost

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
all light.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
The light we can see

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
is because of spontaneous emission.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Zero light,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
visible light,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
the mechanism at the bottom

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
is because of spontaneous emission.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
It is a

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
leading theory

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
of quantum electrodynamics.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
After Dirac

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
in 1927,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
a group of people

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
started to invest in this field.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Pauli, Wigner,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Eisenberg, Fermi,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Freeman Dyson,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
and Feynman.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
They started to do

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
QED research.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
If we

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
use

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
mixed quantum classical equations

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
to deal with

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
spontaneous emission,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
what will happen?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
I am going to

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
explain

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
what is

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
mixed quantum classical.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
First,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
we can see

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
my mouse.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Great!

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Can you see my mouse?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Yes.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
There is a little

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
lag.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
If you want to stop,

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
please slow down.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
No problem.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
First,

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
let's assume

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
a two-level system

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
is placed in the vacuum.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
The system is

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
completely in spontaneous emission state.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
There is no

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
distribution

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
in the state.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
In

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
mixed quantum classical,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
there is no spontaneous emission.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
This is the line

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I am drawing.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
The line I am drawing

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
is the time axis.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
The axis is the

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
population of

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
the stimulated state.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
The red line

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
represents the

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
time axis.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
The system

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
does not emit any light.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
First of all,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
this is wrong

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
in terms of quality.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
However,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
we found

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
that

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
if I am not

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
completely in the

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
stimulated state,

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
for example,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I have half

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
of the stimulated state and half of the

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
stimulated state,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
I will find that

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
there seems to be a little

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
spontaneous emission.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
However,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
there is still a gap

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
compared to the

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
real spontaneous emission,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
the black curve.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
This is

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
a method we have tried.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
We have tried other methods.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
We have tried other three methods.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
For example,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
we have tried MCCC.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
It is called SQC,

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
or CPA.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
These other methods

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
have problems.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
The right side of the graph

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
represents the curve in the middle

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
of the graph.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
The curve in the middle

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
represents the spontaneous emission rate.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
The red line

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
is the red line

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
in the left side of the graph.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
From there,

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
I get the emission rate

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and compare it

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
with the real

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
spontaneous emission rate.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Sometimes,

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
for example,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
when it is almost at ground state,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
it will be very close

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
to the real

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
spontaneous emission rate.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
However,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
it will get worse and worse.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
When more and more population

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
are at ground state,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
the distance

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
will get bigger and bigger.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
The other methods

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
have the opposite

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
effect.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
This is the second problem.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
The last problem

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
is

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
a very old problem.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Our factory

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
is a classical factory,

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
so there is no

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
any fluctuation.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
If I want to calculate

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
anything about fluctuation,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I must be wrong.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
The method we propose

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
is called

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
PLOS R.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
We call it

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
the average length method.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
We use PLOS R

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
because it is the simplest

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
average length method.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
In the average length method,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
we add

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
LR,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
which is a little bit like

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
the Limplot form.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
What is PLOS R?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It has three functions.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
The first one is

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
an additional relaxation.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
We take some population

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
from the ground state

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
to the ground state.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
The additional population

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
is based on

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
the Ehrenfest equation

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
to deduce

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
how much is missing

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
and how much

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
relaxation we need to add

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
to make it

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
exactly the same

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
as spontaneous emission rate.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
This is the first thing.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
The second thing is

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
that we took some population

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
from the ground state

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
to the ground state

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
in the previous step.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Where does

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
this energy go?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
This energy should be

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
put into

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
the power plant.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It should

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
become

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
a part of

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
the power plant

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
or the magnetic field

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
to ensure

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
that

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
the whole system

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
is energy-stable.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
So we designed a method

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
to make

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
this energy

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
to be put

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
into the power plant.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
We also designed

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
a thing called

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
stochastic,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
which is a random

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
defacing.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
In a random process,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
the system

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
will decide

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
whether to

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
turn the system's phase

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
a little bit.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
It can decide

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
whether to

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
turn the system's phase

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
a little bit.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
This small

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
stochastic defacing

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
introduces

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
the fluctuation

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
of the classical

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
power plant.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I'm not running

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
one trajectory,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
but many trajectories

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
to balance

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
its trajectory behavior.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
We can

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
tell

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
what is

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
the coherent

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
of the power plant

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
we are

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
generating.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Is there

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
a part of

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
coherent,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
which means

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
it has

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
a certain frequency,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
and the other part

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
is incoherent.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
The incoherent part

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
means the frequency

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
shifts a little bit,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
and the value

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
is zero.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
With these three

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
additional

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
plus-or strategies,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
we can

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
recover

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
the green line.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
We can

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
recover

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
the spontaneous

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
emission rate.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It's a little bit

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
of a pain in the ass.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
We know

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
the difference,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
and we can

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
recover the spontaneous

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
emission rate.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
However,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
this is not

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
the selling point.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
The selling point is

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
that we can

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
recover

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
the correct emission rate.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Although our emission

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
will be a pile of

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
thousands of

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
classical

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
power plants,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
on average,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
it will be

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
consistent with the

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
quantum intensity.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Let me

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
explain this to you.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
The blue line

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
is the intensity.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
It's like the

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
square of the power plant.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
The blue line

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
is the

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
square of the

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
power plant.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
We all know

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
that the

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
difference between

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
the average square

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
and the average square

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
is the standard difference.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
From 50-50,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
when the

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
system is

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
50-50,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
the standard difference

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
is smaller.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
If we

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
start from

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
100%,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
from

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
78,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
the two-level

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
system

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
will have a

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
very big standard difference.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
What does this mean?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
It means that

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
from this 100%

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
two-level system,

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
there is no coherence emission.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
The blue line below

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
is the coherence emission.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Anyway,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
we are

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
very satisfied

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
with this result.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
We can see that

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
although we use

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
classical power plants,

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
we are still satisfied

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
with this result.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Now, let's recap

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
what we have done.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
We have proposed

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
ERMFES PLUS R

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Mixed Chromium Classical Dynamics.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It can recover

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
spontaneous emission.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
It also satisfies

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
energy conservation.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
We even

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
modified

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
ERMFES PLUS R

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Mixed Chromium Classical Dynamics

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
to simulate

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
quantum fluctuation.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I have a question.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Sorry.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Can you go back

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
to the previous slide?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Why is the

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
electric field

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
average

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
not zero?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Generally speaking,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
for spontaneous emission,

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
the average square of

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
the electric field

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
should be zero.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
The average square of

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
the electric field

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
is only

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
zero in one situation.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
If the system

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
is fully

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
activated, it is zero.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
However, when the system

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
is fully activated,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
the average square of

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
the electric field

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
is not zero.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Sorry.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
My question is

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
for any electromagnetic wave,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
the average square of

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
the electric field

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
should be zero.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
The average square of

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
the electric field

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
is zero in one situation.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
The average square of

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
the electric field

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
is 0.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Is it right?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Sorry.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
The average square of

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
the electric field

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
is 0.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Sorry.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I have absolute value here.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I want to compare

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
the difference between

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
coherence emission and

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
all emission.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
You can think of it as

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
the amplitude of the electric field.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
It's like a sine.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
It's the value in front of the sine.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Sorry.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
It's the amplitude of the electric field.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
It's the square of

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
the amplitude of the electric field

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
and the intensity.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
I see.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Thank you.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Let's continue.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Now we have this.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Very good.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
I want to do more

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
with this good tool.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I don't want to just do two-level system.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
I want to do a more complicated system.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Of course, it can't be too complicated right away.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
So we looked at two different cases.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
One is Raman.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
The first case is Raman scattering.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
It's to test

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
our

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Ernefest plus R method.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Is there a way to

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
deal with multiple quantum states?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
The second question

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
is called Moller triplet.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Basically, it's a very strong

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
phenomenon.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
We want to test

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
if Ernefest can handle

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
the electric field in the wall.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
First,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Raman scattering.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Raman

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
is basically

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
a

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Indian scientist.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Very cool.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
The most basic model

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
of Raman scattering

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
is three-level system.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
You can see on the right

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
0, 1, 2.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Energy from 0 to

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
1 to 2.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
In the beginning,

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
the system

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
is on 0.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
There is a

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
beam of light coming in.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
This beam of light will

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
pump the electricity from 0 to 2.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
0 and 1

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
are not coupled

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
in the system.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
So,

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
they pump the electricity

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
from 0 to 2.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
There are two possible

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
pathways from 0 to 2.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
One is from 2 to 0

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
or from 2 to 1.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
So,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
the beam of light

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
comes from every transition.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
The beam of light

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
is elastic.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It is the same frequency

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
from 0 to 2

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
and back to 0.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
So, it is called elastic process.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
The other frequency

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
from 2 to 1

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
is called

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
inelastic process.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
In quantum mechanics,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
the whole process

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
can be explained

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
by a formula.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
This is a

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
KHD,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Kramer, Heisenberg and Dirac.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
This is a

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
quantum formula

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
to explain

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
the spectrum.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Why

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Raman Scattering

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
is so important?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
It contains a lot of important information.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
For example, it can tell us

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
the excited state,

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
which is the state above.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
What is the movement

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
of Raman?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
It also contains a lot of

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
molecular structure information.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
For example,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Raman's

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
spectroscopy is used on the surface.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
So, it can know

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
the structure of

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
the molecule attached on the surface.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Is it straight or curved?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
There are different

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Raman's movements.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I forgot to mention that

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Raman has

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
three different transitions

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
with different labels.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
R stands for Reidy.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Reidy means

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
from 2 to 1, which is the elastic part.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Stock Raman

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
is from 0 to 2

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and back to 1.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
This is from 0 to 2 to 1.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
This is called

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Stock's Reidy.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Anti-Stock's Reidy is a

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
weaker signal.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
It still has a chance

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
to go from 1 to 2 and back to 0.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
This is a weaker

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
signal.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
OK.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Next,

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
basically,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
we want to know

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
whether Mixed Kronenklassik

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
can

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
capture Raman's scattering.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
There are some

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
problems here.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Basically, Mixed Kronenklassik

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
does not have a plus R.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
There is only one

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
elastic scattering.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
There is only one R.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
You can see it in the

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
picture.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I have different

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
scattering frequencies

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
from

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
3 quarters

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
to

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
3 quarters of 0 to 2

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
to more than 0 to 2.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
There are different frequencies.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
It is not necessarily resonance.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
This is Resonance Raman.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
OK.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Although I can get

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
this one,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
but

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
in Mixed Kronenklassik,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I don't have

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
any other mechanism

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
to make it go from 2 to 1.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Basically, it is impossible

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
to have any

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Raman's scattering.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
In addition, the old problem of MQC

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
is that there is no fluctuation.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
After adding

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
RMFS plus R solution,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
we will find that

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
the picture on the right

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
can completely recover

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Dock's Raman.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
In fact,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
we can also get Anti-Stock Raman,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
but the signal

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
of Anti-Stock Raman is very small.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
If we draw a

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
log plot,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
there is a signal,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
but it is relatively weak,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
so the signal is very small.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
We can see

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
the Anti-Stock Raman.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
But how accurate

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
is this Anti-Stock Raman?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
So we can

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
compare it

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
with KHD.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
The picture on the top

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
shows

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
RMFS plus R

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
blue line.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
It is almost

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
qualitatively agree with

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
quantum mechanics.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
The red line

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
does not add RMFS plus R.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
We find that there are

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
several order of magnitude

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
difference.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
This picture

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
proves that

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
RMFS plus R

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
is not only a quantitative improvement,

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
but also

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
different physics.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
There is a

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
qualitative difference.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Next,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
we see that

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Riley and

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Raman,

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
RMFS plus R

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
is very similar to

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
KHD.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Let me

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
recap again.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
What did we learn

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
from Raman Scattering?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
RMFS plus R

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
is very similar to

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
KHD.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
RMFS plus R

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
is very similar to

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
KHD.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
RMFS plus R

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
allows us to

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
do the multistate transition.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
allows us to do the multistate transition.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
We can get a multistate transition

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
with a good

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
quantization.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
We don't need

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
to use our hands

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
to create a frequency

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
to make it vibrate.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
We can get a

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
inelastic scattering

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
with RMFS.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Lastly,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I'm sorry,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I interrupted you.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
You can continue.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
I have a question.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I have a question.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
RMFS plus R

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
RMFS plus R

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
RMFS plus R

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
RMFS plus R

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
RMFS plus R

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
RMFS plus R

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
RMFS plus R

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
RMFS plus R

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
RMFS plus R

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
RMFS plus R

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
RMFS plus R

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
RMFS plus R

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
RMFS plus R

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
RMFS plus R

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
RMFS plus R

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
RMFS plus R

46:35.000 --> 46:57.000
RMFS plus R

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
RMFS plus R

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
RMFS plus R

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
RMFS plus R

47:03.000 --> 47:12.000
So if I understand correctly, you add a Resonance Intermediate State in the middle

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
Add a Resonance Intermediate State in the middle

47:15.000 --> 47:24.000
Because if it's Fermi's Golden Rule, you choose an energy and all your In and Out will be Resonant with that energy

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
No, what I mean is

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
What I mean is

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I know

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
For example, I know every transition 2-1

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
2-1 and 2-0

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
They all meet different Fermi's Golden Rule

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
Fermi's Golden Rule is a rate

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
There is a transition rate

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
In my theory

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I can deduce

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
How much is the difference between RMFS and Fermi's Golden Rule

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
Then I will use those three methods to add the difference

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
That's OK

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Let me ask

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Sorry, can you go to the next page?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Yes

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
Next, I want to see the picture on the right

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
Sorry, I want to see the picture on the right

48:23.000 --> 48:30.000
So the input frequency

48:30.000 --> 48:38.000
In these ranges, do you have to re-calculate how to add other parameters?

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Or these are already

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
Omega i

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
There are ten

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
Do you have to add other parameters ten times?

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
That may be easy

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I don't understand

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I just ask

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
It doesn't matter

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Actually, it doesn't matter

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
Every trajectory is exactly the same

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Just change a parameter

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Omega i

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Yes, I just need to change Omega i

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I didn't change anything

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
I didn't change anything else in the calculation

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
So I don't need to re-calculate

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
Can I ask a question?

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
Whether it's Rayleigh or Raman

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You said you want to use Fermi's Golden Rule

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
But in general

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
State 2 is a virtual state

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
So in reality

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
You can't get the real coupling constant

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
How do you solve this problem?

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
Can't get the real coupling constant

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
In practice, you can measure Rayleigh scattering cross-section

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Or Raman scattering cross-section

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
But you can't get a

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Real state and virtual state coupling

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
How much is it?

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Yes

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
It's like this

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
I don't have virtual state and real state coupling here

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
The coupling I use is

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Resonant coupling

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I shouldn't say resonant, sorry

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
The coupling I use is actually 1 and 2 coupling

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Then

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
If you look back from the lab

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
Because my idea is more from

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
First principle

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
If I want to calculate this

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
In fact, the actual molecule to calculate this

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
I will use electronic structure

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
Use electronic structure to calculate the real coupling

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
This coupling

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Not the real coupling

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
In the electronic structure

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
How big is the coupling

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
This coupling is good

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
This coupling can be calculated in the electronic structure

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
It's a transition dipole moment

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
1 and 2 state transition dipole moment

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
The light I hit

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Whether there is resonance

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
I use the transition state dipole moment

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
So what you mean is

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
You have real state in the molecule

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Then you use real state transition dipole moment

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
Then you sum up all these real states

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Yes

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
Because in this mixed quantum classical

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
I don't have any virtual state

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
It's not like the sum over state theory

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I have a lot of virtual state

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
No, this is real state

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Then different frequency

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
Thank you

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
Because it is a bit like a driving system

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
It is a dynamical system

52:09.000 --> 52:14.000
I hope this will answer your question

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
Any other questions?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
No, I will continue

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Where did I just talk about

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
In the end, we want to say

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
In the end, the problem we want to deal with

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Is a strong problem

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
What about this strong problem

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
It's called model triplet

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
It is a two-level system

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Back to a very simple two-level system

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
But there is a very strong classical field

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
What is the biggest feature of model triplet

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
I think the coolest point is that it is classical

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Classical in quantum now

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
It's a bit like laser

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
It's a coherent state

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
It's very close to classical mechanics

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Classical mechanics

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
But the spectrum it emits

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
It's a very, very non-classical

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
It's a very quantum spectrum

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Why is that?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Because this field

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
This field is because it is very strong

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
So it's basically

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It has exceeded all the encirclement theory

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
So we can't use the encirclement theory anymore

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
So in quantum theory

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
It's a bit like a mixing state

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's a bit like a hybridization

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
What about the picture in the lower right corner

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Actually on the left

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
On the left side of this diagonal

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
It's bare state

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I made

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Two-level system

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Generate

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Sorry

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
Two-level system and light frequency

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
The state generated

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Draw it out

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
After the hybridization is drawn

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
You will find that the one on the right is the state after the hybridization

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It's a bit like a mix

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's a bit like a dress state

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
But it's light

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
Hybridization is the hybridization of light and two-level system

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So its energy level

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Will be changed

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Then

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Inside the dress state model on the right

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
It has three different

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Launch frequency

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
The first one

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
We call it T

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Why is it called T? It's actually very simple

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
It's called three

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Three photons

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
You can see it from the highest

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
After one, two, three

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Three times to the lowest

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
So it's called triple

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Three photons

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Then what about F? F is called fluorescence

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Fluorescence is basically

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
It's the lowest level

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
It's the two closest

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Between

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Launch

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Then the other two

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
It's called Rayleigh

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Two Rayleigh

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
It goes through two photons

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
It's called Rayleigh

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
That

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
This

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
The whole quantum theory

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Gave us three different

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Frequency, which means it's three different

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Peak

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Then inside these peaks

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Will be produced

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
It contains the Rabi frequency

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Rabi is

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
The gentleman on the left is Rabi

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
He was actually in Columbia before

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Very cool

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Then

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
The same we can use this

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Mixed quantum classical method

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Let's try

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
We found that if we don't put any

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Change we don't put any

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
We found that this system is basically

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Classical in, classical out

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
It's classical in, it's classical out

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
There won't be much change

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
If you were a kid

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Or high school

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
There is a physical phenomenon

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
That is, you put

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
A pile of protein

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Put in a

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Tie a pile of protein

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Tie a pile of protein on the same pole

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
The pole has a fixed frequency vibration

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
After a long time, they will be synchronized

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Together

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
This phenomenon is basically the same as what we see here

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
It's like

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Although there are many different frequencies in it

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Run in there

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
In fact, we are looking at

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
This mixed quantum classical

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
In a short time, you will see three peaks

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
We can see three peaks

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
But for a long time, you will find that the two peaks next to it

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Gradually disappeared

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Only the middle peak is left

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Basically it is a

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Classical driving system

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Classical in, classical out

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Nothing else

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
The other is

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
There are other old problems

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
We don't have any fluctuations here

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
That

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
With this plus r

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
We will find that this blue line

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Is the line after the plus r

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
We can see that they can

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Have a stable

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Side peak

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
It won't be because of time

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It won't disappear because of a long time

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Why is there a stable side peak?

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
In fact, it is

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
In fact, it is a

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Return to

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Random perturbation

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Stochastic defacing

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It's a bit like

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
In this classical system

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Push it from time to time

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Don't let it fall back

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
The huge frequency

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Don't let it be forever

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Classical in, classical out

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
There is a small stochastic

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Defacing is actually very important here

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
It can make

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
The two side peaks are stable for a long time

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
We want to know

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Here we can see that

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
These three ratios are r

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
With f and t

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
With

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
All classical theory

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
The prediction is consistent

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
We want to know

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Is there any other

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
More interesting properties

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
We can compare with classical theory

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
What about here

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
We show

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
This picture above

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Is the result of an experiment

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
2012

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
The result of the experiment

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
What did it change?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
It is also a model triplet

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Then the different lines

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
From the bottom to the top

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Also different

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Infrared light frequency

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Then you will find that

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
There are several features

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
The wind in the middle

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Almost unchanged

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But the wind next to it

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Different

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Different evolution

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
The first one is

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Peak position

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
You can see the picture on the right

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
The middle line

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
The middle line

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
The middle line is

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Central peak

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
It doesn't change much

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But this

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Side peak

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
It is with

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
This width is called

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Many people call

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Generalized

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Rabi frequency

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It is off resonance

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Not necessarily resonance

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Rabi frequency

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
This experiment

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Very well with theory

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
This

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
This peak

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Basically

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Basically

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
This

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
The position of the peak is not a rare thing

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
So in practice and theory

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Not too much

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Then we

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
In

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
In urbanfest plus r

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
You can also see the same behavior

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
That is to say

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Central peak

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Fixed

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Side peak

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
There is a

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Generalized Rabi frequency

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
These two pictures

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
A little flip

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Because I want to be the same as the left

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
X and y are above

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
The experiment is the opposite

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But if you turn it over

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The color is correct

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Blue against blue

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This is what we observe

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Very good point

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
This is basically

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Is not a difficult thing

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Excuse me

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
In addition to these three peaks

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
There is another peak outside

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Correct

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
There are more on the left and right

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
So that is also

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Resonance

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Resonance

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It may be higher

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Higher

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Correct

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Let me make sure

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I have an impression

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Please tell me

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I remember the so-called

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Because the light is very strong

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
So

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Equal to this original

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
There is an ac

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
This way

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Create two more

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
My previous understanding is like this

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Correct

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
So this calculation method

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Above

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
The method they came up with in 2012

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Is it a simulation method?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
In fact

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Use you today

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The method of analysis

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
The method they use is

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
The method they use is

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Is

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Dark shift

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
There is

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Electrophonic hybridization

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You can put those

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The relationship between

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Calculate

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
OK

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Then continue

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The earliest MOLO paper is

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
1967

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
The earliest prediction

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
MOLO triplet was in 1967

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Then later

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Of course a lot of people

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Just go in and explain this thing

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
There is a very good resource

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Do a lot

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Work in this area

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Then

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Okay, let's take a look at one

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
More interesting thing

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That is, I am comparing

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
This picture is what I compared

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Except that I want to compare

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
The position of the peak, I also want to compare

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Can I get

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Can I get the correct

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Coherence emission

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
What about this one on the left?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
What about this curve?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Quantum mechanics

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Is the whole quantum theory

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
That

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Coherence emission

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
The ratio

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
This green dot

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
There is a dot

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
We use

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Ernest plus r to calculate

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Then we found here

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Especially near the place

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Delta omega is zero

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Near the place

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Very good

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Is there a way

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
We also have a small caveat

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
In fact, this quantum mechanics

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
The theory is based on

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Rotating wave approximation

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It is based on

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Very close to this

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Very close to the resonance

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
So we don't know

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Far away

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Where is the resonance

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The theory of quantum mechanics

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Is our calculation method

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The theory of quantum mechanics

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Is it accurate?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So this place

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
We are not very clear

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Is this place accurate?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Anyway, what we get is

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Quite different

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
At least near the resonance

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Their results are very close

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
What about this thing on the right?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Is a

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Can play

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It can almost surpass

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Rotating wave approximation

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
That is to say

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
If we look at the peak on the left

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
For

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
For

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
For

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Different frequency changes

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
That

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
The red line

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Is the right side peak

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
The blue line is the left side peak

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
That

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Is the quantum theory

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Under this

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Under this

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It is a line

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It will not predict at all

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Irregular situation

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Because it is only

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Focused on

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
One level

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
One level quantum behavior

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Because of this

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Rotating wave approximation

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It only focuses on one level quantum behavior

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
So it can get the middle one

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It's right, but it can't get it

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
At this point

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
But our

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Mixed quantum classical method

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Because I didn't do anything

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Rotating

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Rotating wave

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
So the result I got

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I can get this

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Linear crossing result

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
This result is actually

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
The result of the experiment is the same

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
That is, in practice, we can also see

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
This is not a fixed point

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
It is a

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Linear crossing

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
This result is very

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Exciting result

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
So

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Finally

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
This is a final recap

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
We found this

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
RFS class R dynamics

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It can almost simulate

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Quantum mixing

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
There is no mixing mechanism

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But just use

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Driving field

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
With a small stochastic

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Diffusing, I can simulate

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Quantum mixing

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
We can also

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Very clearly distinguish

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Coherence emission and incoherence emission

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I hope

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
These

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Advantages can tell

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Everyone that we are developing now

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
The theory is a very reliable

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Method

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
To deal with

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Light-material interaction

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
But this method still has a lot of problems

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
This method

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
We are still

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I haven't thought about any

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Quantum mixing

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
That is, our current

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Matter is a very simple matter

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Two-level system, three-level system

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Is a very simple matter

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
From the perspective of a chemist

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
We are

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
We hope that we can

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
At least put some

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Chemistry

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Put potential energy

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Put nuclear

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Put in

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Non-adiabatic dynamics

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Put these different behaviors

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
This is a

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
A good direction

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Another question mark

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Can we get

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Photon counting statistics

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Because there are

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
The second point and the third point

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Very similar

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Anti-function

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Because

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
There is another big feature of monostripe

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I haven't covered here

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Three-wind

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Quantum counting statistics

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Because

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The sequence of light

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So every light

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
For example

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
F light

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
The first one

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The next one may be very close to it

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
T light

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The first one

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Must be far away from it

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Can't release a light right away

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
When you measure the light

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
When the statistics are

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
You will find

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
F light may be

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
In line with

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Poisson distribution

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
T light

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Subpoisson distribution

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
The quality of light

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Will be different

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Here

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
We haven't tried it yet

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Of course

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
There is no light here

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
We can get similar

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Last

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Thermal light

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
If the light is not

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Not

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Not at 0 degree

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
There is a thermal distribution

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Then

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Can we

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
In mixed quantum classical

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Get detail balance

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Or we may

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Violate detail balance

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
The last question

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Is a very important question

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
In many systems

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Two-level system

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Spontaneous emission rate

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
May be changed

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Not in line with Fermi's golden rule

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Spontaneous emission rate

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Because of cavity

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Cavity causes strong interaction

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Strong interaction

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Causes

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
This

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
The frequency of emission will change

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
This method

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Based on Fermi's golden rule

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
May be

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So this is also a possibility

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Need to consider

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Then

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
We do this

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Method

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Method development

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Method development

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
For people

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
The most common thing we do

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Is that we have created a new toy

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Is

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
We want to use it in many places

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Hope many people

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Use it in many places

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
For us

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
A very important question

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
When will it break down

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
This is the most important

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
The most important thing we want to know

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
When does it not work

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
That

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Of course there are many

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Application

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
These things are

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
We hope to push it to

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Other

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Spectroscopy

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Spectroscopy group

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Let's try

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Can we use this

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Same method

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
To see

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Chemistry

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Put it in a cavity

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
It may be because of the interaction with light

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
To change

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Its

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Vibrational energy level

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Because of the change of the vibrational energy level

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
It may have different

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Reaction pathway

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
So it will have different

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
This is

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
This is a thing we can do

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
A direction

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Another application

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Is a new theory

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Called

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Model

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Then

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
In this model

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I use

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Classical source

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Generate quantum light

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Then use this quantum light

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Different light

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Go to

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
The target

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Then

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I can see

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
This target

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Different

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Photon statistics

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
The

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Behavior

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
This is a new thing

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But this thing

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
There is no experimental implementation yet

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
But in theory

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Many people are

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Pursue this direction

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Finally

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
A very

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
In device and material science

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
A very useful application

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Conductance enhancement

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Application

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Conductance enhancement

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Conductance enhancement

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Can be used

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Cavity

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Can be used

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
To simulate

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
We hope

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Can use this method

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
To understand

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Why

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Conductance enhancement

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Finally

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Thank you

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Professor

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Dave Reichman

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
The middle one

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Old man

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Not old

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
With me

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Joseph

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Then

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Half a year

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Visiting scholar

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Half a year

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Visiting scholar

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Maxine

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Arizona State University

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Professor

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
This method

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Generate

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Three-dimensional

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
This method

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I have a

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Electron system

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
The evolution

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
The evolution of the classical electron system

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Maxine is a classical electron system expert

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So he can use

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I don't know the theory

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Put it

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
With some

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Very mature classical electron system

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Combine

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Then Taoli is us

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
A researcher in my group

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Then he is

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
We did a lot of work together

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Finally, I want to thank

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Ted

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Organize the whole

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Let me have a chance to share with you

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Thank you

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Hello

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Thank you

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Everyone

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Does anyone have any special questions?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
The

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
The

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Okay, let me ask

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I am

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Good

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
When we look at it recently

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
What I've been doing lately is

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Light polarization

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Interaction

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Use

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
In the semiconductor

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
What's in there

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
We are looking at it recently

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
In addition to

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Because we are more concerned

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Like what you are talking about now

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Light in classical way

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
The electromagnetic wave

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
To present

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
If like us

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
So we do it

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
We do more polarizations

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Or

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
So it's

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
It depends on the light itself

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
His own characteristics

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Then we recently

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Looking at one is

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
You should probably listen to it

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Just

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
There is

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
This kind of thing

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I'm thinking

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
If there is

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Although it was quite new at first

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
but

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
There is

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
The light is recently

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I think it's a hot topic

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
One

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Have you ever thought about it?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
His whole disease

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
He is also a

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
That one

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
This boundary

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
One of the conditions

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Square

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Its light is a bit like it

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
A wave of rotation

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It's different from the circle

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Still not the same

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So it is

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
There is also a moment

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Then you

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
This may be

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Maybe you are now

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
It may not be the same

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But I want to say

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
You have a way to analyze this

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
The light will be

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
With

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Maybe not yet

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
The interaction of molecules

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Or with any two-level system

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Interaction

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
How does it react

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I think

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
This

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I was not born with light

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
These things are a bit difficult

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I am now

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I am now

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
What they are doing

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Very confident

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I have

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
FDTD

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
These good

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Classic electric mechanics

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
That basically

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
He

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
What he does now

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Different

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Different

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Can do

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
I think

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
If he does this

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
I think it should be

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
The problem you are thinking about is helpful

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Great

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Let's pay attention to this

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Professor

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
I have a question

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Ok

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
This is

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
This is a long-standing question

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I want to know

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
When will it happen

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
When will it happen

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Outer tongue splitting

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Then

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
What is your second

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Outer tongue splitting

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Oh

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Then

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I know it's probably

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Only in molecules

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Or the atomic system

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
This mole triplet will occur

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But in the acetone system

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It will only happen

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
But what is the specific reason

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Do you know

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I don't know the specific reason

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Because my understanding of him

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Same as you

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
He is in

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
In the molecule

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
In the molecular system

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
He will be

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
In the acetone system

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I still have to learn

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I haven't

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I have been doing this

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
This set of theory

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
About a year and a half

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Ok

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
There are still a lot to learn

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Ok

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
There is another thing

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Outer tongue

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
What is the other one

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Called

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
EIT

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Electronic

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Transparency

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
What's the difference between the two

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Transparency

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I really don't know

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Ok

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Out of my

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
You may ask

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Ted may not understand

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I remember EIT

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
With male triplet

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
There seems to be a difference

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
EIT seems to be more in the atom

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But I actually don't remember

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
EIT

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
EIT

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
EIT and

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
The effect of outer tongues looks the same

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But it's completely different from male triplet

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Male triplet you will see three states

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
EIT and

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Outer tongues you see two states

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I forgot

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Sorry

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It doesn't matter

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But I think this is a pretty interesting question

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I think I should

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I should use

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Because male triplet is basically

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
The first thing we try

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Let's try to break down

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
This method

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
See if this method will break down here

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Actually quite good

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
So I was thinking

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Maybe our next project will use EIT

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Ok

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Then another thing

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
You said you add

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You add fluctuation in the electric field

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Then in the classical field

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Add fluctuation

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Then let it

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Looks like there is spontaneous emission

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Then

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Which electric field are you

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Is it driving force electric field

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Add fluctuation

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
No, I'm in the radiation field

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Add fluctuation

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Driving field here

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
We still treat it as

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
It's a

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Electric field running past

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Maxwell equation is linear

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
You can break it down

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
But this

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
If you are in emission

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
That

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Add fluctuation in radiation

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Then

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
You said your addition is

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
You just assume

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It's running above the time

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Then

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
At a certain random time

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Let it change the phase

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Like this

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Then

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
This thing seems to be with that

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Is two-dimensional

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Spectroscopy inside

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
The method they use

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Very similar

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Do you say pump probe method

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Is in two-dimensional

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Spectroscopy inside

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
They have

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
One is called homogeneous line width

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Another one is called

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
No, this is homogeneous line width

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
There are two components

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
The first one is

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Free induction decay

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
The second one is

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Scattering of phonon

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Scattering of other things

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Then the second

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Their assumption

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
They bring in

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Model method

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
In the radiation field

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Add a random

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Phase drop

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
So these two things

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Is it the same

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Actually different

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
A little different

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
That is to say

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
OK

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I want

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
That is

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I want to say one thing

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Because i'm not

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I'm not really

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I'm not really

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Add a random phase

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I am adding a random phase

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
In

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
In

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Two-level system

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Then this two-level system

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Random phase will reflect on the electric field

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
So i'm really adding

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Electric field

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
There are two benefits to this method

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Because

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
My

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
My

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It is natural

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
There are two benefits to this method

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Because my

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Two-level system

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Also need this defacing

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
He also needs

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
This little defacing

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Correct his

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
His fluctuation

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
He also needs this thing

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
From

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
From

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Then another benefit is

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Because i'm

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Put

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
There is actually a

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Difficulty point is because i put

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I want to put this

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Add a little fluctuation

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I can't just add it

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Add to a certain place

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
It just caused his self-interaction

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Will destroy the whole system

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
That

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
So he will have one

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Specific method

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Add it to a correct place

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
That

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
This thing

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Because he

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Because of this field

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
He is not like he is not only a point

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
He is a whole space

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And he has to meet some basic

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
For example, he can't go beyond the speed

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I can't put a field suddenly

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Add to a place beyond the speed

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Right

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Try not to add directly

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
On field

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So when we design this method

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
This fluctuation

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Add to two-level system

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Add to two-level system

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Naturally generate this fluctuation

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
OK

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Then there is a more detailed question

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I want to know this

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Why this classical

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
It's just

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Quantum matter and classical

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Field

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
That

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Only when

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
When that

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
That

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Low

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Low 0

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Low 1 is

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
There will be no emission

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Then there will be other emissions

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I always thought it was all

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
No emission

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Thank you for asking this question

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Because

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Because of my time

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I missed a part

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
That's it

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Here

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Here

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Mixed quantum classical

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Here

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
It's not pure

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Is the most

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
The most basic

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Mixed quantum classical

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It is a mixed quantum classical

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
That is to say

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I am in this

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
This

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
In uranfest

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Two-level system

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Classical

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Field

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Will also

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Interact to two-level system

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Let it decay

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
So this is already a non-linear system

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So you see these

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
These red lines are not

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
A simple

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Simple exponential decay

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So it's a

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
It will continue to

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Self-interact

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
So

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
There will be some decay

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Basically

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
This is

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
One of our recent papers

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
His point is uranfest

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
This is the most basic

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Mixed quantum classical

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Can get some

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Partially correct

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
But

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
He won't get all

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Sorry

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
You can go to the front page

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Let me see what is called uranfest

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
You said

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
His equation

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I didn't write it out

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
OK

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I can give you

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Our paper

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
There is

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
I can check it myself

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Because I didn't

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Write it all out

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
A bit complicated

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Thank you

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Other listeners have no questions

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Discuss

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
If there is no problem

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
That's the end of our speech today

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Thank you all

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Thank you

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Thank you

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
OK

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
You think

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Tell us when you are ready

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
We will put the video up

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
OK

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
OK

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
That's all for today

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
OK

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Good night

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
It's okay

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
4.30

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
OK

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Thank you all

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Bye
