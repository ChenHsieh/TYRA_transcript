00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Mengchang, and I am a student at Mata University.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What I want to talk about today is about 4-way mixing and squeeze light.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you have any questions at any time, you can ask, just turn on your microphone.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My field is in the field of atomic physics, which is relatively low-energy physics.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Our research unit is JQI, which is the United States Department of State.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It is a rather special institution, which is under the Department of Commerce in the United States.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Although they don't sound like they are doing this kind of specialized research,

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
they have actually won four Nobel Prizes in atomic physics.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So it's a pretty special national standard.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My instructor is Paul Leitz.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Our main source of research funding is from the Air Force in the United States.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
At the beginning, I want to let everyone know what squeezing means.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We want to compress all the information into a better measurement.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
After watching the video, let's get down to business.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The experiment we are doing now is using laser light.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The characteristic of laser light is that it is a coherent state.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What is a coherent state?

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know if you've heard of it.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sure you've heard of the non-coherent principle.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The non-coherent principle tells us that we can't...

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We used to think that the results of delta x and delta t must be greater than h-bar.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We can imagine that our laser light has a so-called non-coherent property.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Non-coherent property means that it has its government amplitude and its horizontal axis.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Both of these can't be measured very accurately in practice.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That is to say, it has its limits.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can see that when our laser light is in coherent state,

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Basically, it's always in coherent state.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When it's in coherent state, you'll see its...

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Its FN or phase fluctuation is actually...

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Its result is in...

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That is to say, the curve on the left represents the line that meets the non-coherent principle.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mathematically, we know that when your delta...

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My y-axis is delta e, and my x-axis is delta phi.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If these two variables are in the minimum value,

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When the two are equal, they are actually in their so-called minimum value.

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Laser light is when these two values are equal.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Then it presents such a coherent state.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So what is Squeeze state?

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Squeeze state means that you can...

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That is to say, we don't need to measure all the information of laser light very accurately.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We can say that we just need to measure the phase very accurately.

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Or we can measure our government very accurately.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When you see that your phase is measured very accurately,

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In fact, it still meets its non-coherent principle.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then it will lead to the inaccuracy of your government.

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It will become very large.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then your phase can be measured very accurately.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So a while ago, probably the year before last,

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Isn't there a gravity wave measurement experiment?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It is to use this Squeeze light to throw away your impurities.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will talk about quantum impurities.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because you are in coherent state.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then go to the limits of quantum mechanics.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then push it to compress it so that you can measure the phase very accurately.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then they may have a so-called interferer.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then the interferer can measure the phase of something.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If the gravity wave passes over the earth,

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Then you can measure the phase of this gravity wave.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There will be some changes.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As long as you have a way to enter this Squeeze state,

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can let a certain frequency of the phase be able to measure it very accurately.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because the gravity wave passes through like this,

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So its frequency will be very weak.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you are very weak, your impurities will be very strong.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You need to have a way to get rid of this impurity.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then measure to the phase you want.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But what we did in the experiment,

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We did another one.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We are so-called Two-Mode Squeezing.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Two-Mode Squeezing is to say,

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm producing two intangles of light.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That is to say, I now have some special light and non-linear effects.

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then produce two intangles.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What about these two intangles?

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Some of their signals are exactly the same.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So if I input a light,

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That light is called Probe.

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Then it will produce its oscillation.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It uses a Twin Beam.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
These two lights have each other.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For example, there is quantum co-relative.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That is, quantum co-relative.

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Quantum co-relative.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So when I can put these two lights together,

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can get another one called Intensity Difference.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That is to say, I can let my Intensity Difference,

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to measure the noise of this two-mode intensity is the lowest.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This may be a bit abstract.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll show you some data later.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you don't quite understand, you can ask me again.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The preliminary introduction is,

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I spent 20 minutes to introduce what happened.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I have introduced the background knowledge needed at the beginning.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If no one has any questions, I will continue.

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OK.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How do we make this?

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Excuse me.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You just said that the intangles,

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How is it produced?

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is it also produced by something?

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is it produced by intangles?

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We don't use intangles.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We use Rubidium Vapor.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Rubidium is a 2A group.

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Rubinium Nitrate.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Rubinium Nitrate.

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We will hit a very strong laser beam.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This strong laser beam will have a non-linear interaction with a very weak beam.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Then produce another conjugate,

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
another intangle beam.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How are they produced?

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will introduce a little later.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How do they produce this twin beam?

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to talk about 4-Way Missing.

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
4-Way Missing.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Total is 4 beams.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But we only put 2 beams in.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then 3 beams will be produced.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There will be a more detailed explanation of the pattern later.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
How is this produced?

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can I ask a question?

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What is 4WM?

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
4 is 4.

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
W is 4-Way Missing.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or translated into Chinese,

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
it is 4-Way Missing.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
4-Way Missing.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I should say that it is the abbreviation of this.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My standard abbreviation.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Does it mean that 4 waves are mixed together?

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But you only have 2 beams.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will show you a picture of the conjugate later.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Then everyone will be confused.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you just say that these 2 beams are added or subtracted?

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Added.

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because they are...

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Actually, they said that the intensity of the beam is 1.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then the intensity of the beam will have a magnification ratio.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The magnification ratio is G.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So the light coming out is G.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then the other conjugate beam is G-1.

144
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So they even put that...

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Originally it was Coherent State.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If it has a magnification effect,

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it will become Thermal State.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That is to say, it is no longer the original laser beam.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It is a very messy light.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
After the two conjugates are subtracted,

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you will see the effect of the twin.

152
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They become very messy together.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But when they are subtracted,

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
they will see that they are actually very beautiful and become messy together.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OK, thank you.

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
May I ask a question?

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So what is the power of these laser beams?

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My pump power is about 750mW.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's quite big.

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Of course, it can't be compared to super fast light.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We are continuous wave.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OK, you also answered my second question.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry, let's continue.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The result we did is...

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There is a relatively influential improvement.

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When you want to look at the magnification compression,

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the lower the frequency,

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
the greater the interference in other environments.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
For example, you walk over there.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Or you have a call coming in.

172
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
These may have some interference in your system.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then it will cause you to be unable to see the so-called squeeze light at a very low frequency.

174
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That is, the compression of the magnification.

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Even if there is a car driving on the main road,

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it will have a great impact.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So our lab is doing experiments in such a deep basement.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Our result is...

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Anyway, our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In recent years, we have broken through the following three orders.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
From Kilohertz down to about 1,000 times to a few Hertz.

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can see the effect of the magnification compression.

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Especially like the gravitational wave measurement I introduced at the beginning.

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It must be seen at a very low frequency.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because theoretical mathematicians have calculated the magnitude of the gravitational wave.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So if you can only see the squeeze light of Kilohertz,

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you can't use it to do these gravitational wave measurements.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So in the past ten years,

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,000
this squeeze light has been developed in such a way that it can still have this effect at a very low frequency.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In the future, it will be possible to measure the gravitational wave.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
In the result of our experiment,

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
there will be some applications in image processing.

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because you want to see if you can pass the image through a very weak light.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then maybe you can do some biological experiments.

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
A lot of low light hits your sample.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Then you can get rid of these impurities.

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Then you can see the signal very clearly.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So it has some applications in biology.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then it can even do some correction.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And it's a quantum correction.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then I will continue to introduce it later.

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is our 4-way missing.

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So on the right, we are.

204
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is our wafer cell.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I drew the picture like this.

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The length of this wafer cell is about two centimeters long.

207
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then the diameter is about an inch.

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Anyway, it's a very small cell.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Then you put a very strong pump beam in.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then the strength of this pump beam is about 450 mW.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Then it will interact with the other very weak beam.

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then you look at the link map on the left.

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There are a lot of links in it.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But we only care about the link that we will call.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This lambda type link.

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It should be quite common to do quantum computing.

217
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There may be something very famous in quantum computing.

218
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's called EIT.

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Slow light storage technology.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Basically, it's quite similar to that.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
For example, you hit a very strong pump beam.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Very strong pump beam.

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Then it will interact with your probe beam.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then this very strong pump beam.

225
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It also interacts with the ground state on the other side.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then because of energy conservation.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So it releases the fourth conjugate beam.

228
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So you only hit two beams in.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But in a continuous operation.

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It actually acts like there are four waves interacting with each other.

231
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Two of the four waves are the same pump beam.

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So this pump beam is at the same time as these two ground states.

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What you want to see is that.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In addition to energy conservation.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It actually has to meet the other momentum conservation.

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then we usually don't talk about momentum conservation.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We also talk about phase matching.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In other words, this wave pump beam.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In addition to interacting with the probe beam.

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The momentum inside.

241
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That is to say, the pump beam and the probe beam have a very small angle.

242
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
About 0.3, 0.4 degrees.

243
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then we have four waves.

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So the total momentum of this pump beam.

245
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
There will be two.

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then it will produce another conjugate beam.

247
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So it's in the other direction.

248
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then you see.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When you have any phase fluctuation.

250
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Or any frequency fluctuation.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It has to meet this.

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Momentum energy conservation rate.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So any fluctuation has to make it consistent.

254
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So this is a bit.

255
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This is a more general way to explain.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because they have to be energy conservative.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Momentum conservation.

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So any fluctuation.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The fluctuations must be consistent.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
In order to meet this condition at the same time.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's how it produces the twin beam.

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is some of our experimental conditions.

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then you will see this delta.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Big delta.

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This big delta is about 1.3GHz.

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a pretty far detune.

267
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because of our experiment.

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
In fact, our entire group is called.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Laser cooling and tracking.

270
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Our group is called.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Laser cooling and tracking team.

272
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Research team is like this.

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
One of us.

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Our big boss is.

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We have a big boss.

276
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then there are four teachers below.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then I did this.

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The only thing is to do it with heat source.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This heat source is about 120°C.

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We have to heat it up.

281
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Then let it become a vapor.

282
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So at the beginning, someone just asked.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Are we using crystal or what?

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We are not using crystal.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If you use crystal.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There are other.

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Also doing.

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Or doing that kind of twin beam.

289
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
In fact, they are doing single mode.

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Anyway, crystal can also be used to do that.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Squeeze line.

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But.

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Anyway, some principles are still a bit different.

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We might use.

295
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
K3 is the third stage.

296
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If it is crystal, it may be K2.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There are some differences in nature.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's right.

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Then the next one is.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We are several.

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This one is about ten years ago.

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Experimental results.

303
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You will see that.

305
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Ten years ago.

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We actually used TESAFA laser.

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
To do this experiment.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
TESAFA laser is.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Its feature is that it is very expensive.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's about.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One or two decades ago.

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We.

314
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Buy a TESAFA.

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
About.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
More than 200,000 dollars.

317
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Then now it is more than 200,000.

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Or its.

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Power becomes stronger.

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's right.

321
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You see.

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The company is doing this experiment.

323
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You need to have one.

324
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Very expensive.

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
TESAFA laser.

326
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
More than 200,000 dollars.

327
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This.

328
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is not practical at all.

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So.

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We started to develop.

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Cheaper.

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then again.

333
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It is a dilutable.

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Laser light source.

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's it.

336
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What about the TESAFA laser we used at the beginning?

337
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Go again.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When doing this low-frequency quantization.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There is a.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ah.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Should I talk about this first?

342
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Experimental map.

343
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What does it mean?

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That is.

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Here you will see the blue line here.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The blue line here is the so-called shot noise.

347
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then I just started.

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Not to say.

349
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Laser light.

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It is coherent state.

351
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What about coherent state?

352
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
In fact.

353
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
One of its features is that.

354
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Its impurities.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Will not change.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That is to say.

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You are measuring.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You are now inserting a light.

360
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This.

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This picture has pink.

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This light.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Insert.

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then you use this photodial.

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
To detect this.

366
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Then send it in.

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Spectrum analyzer.

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That is.

369
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Spectrum.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Spectrum analyzer.

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This spectrum analyzer will tell you.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This.

374
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
How much is the impurity of the frequency of this light?

375
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you insert this light.

376
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a laser.

377
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's a coherent state.

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Its impurities.

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Its impurities.

380
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Will not change.

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Just like this blue light.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The blue.

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The curve is like this.

385
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We insert a light.

386
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Then use a beam splitter.

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Divide this light into half.

388
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then divide it into half.

389
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Then subtract these two.

390
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then do the measurement of this impurity.

391
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Then why do these two subtract?

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because.

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You can also.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You can only measure one light.

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That is.

396
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You can also get a similar answer.

397
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's just the impurity power.

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you measure one light.

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The impurity power will be halved.

400
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If you measure two lights.

401
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The impurity power will be doubled.

402
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's it.

403
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There is another one.

404
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The reason we want to divide it into two lights.

405
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That is.

406
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In fact, although the laser light is a coherent state.

407
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But it's in the low frequency.

408
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
There are all kinds of impurities.

409
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Will come in.

410
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If you don't use two lights.

411
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If you don't use two lights.

412
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You can't put those.

413
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The so-called classical impurity.

414
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Or the technical impurity.

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Eliminate it.

416
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So you have to use.

417
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Use one light.

418
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Divide it into two.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then do the subtraction.

420
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Then measure the impurity.

421
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is the so-called.

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I will talk about it later.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It is the so-called shot noise.

424
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's called the mega shot.

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Its frequency.

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It should always be flat.

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is a.

428
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Our field is a very.

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Ah.

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I didn't know this was a common thing before I came in.

431
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Then now.

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay, this is the coherent state.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The impurity must be.

434
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The so-called.

435
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The so-called two-color frequency has changed.

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So it's the so-called shot noise.

437
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What about the red light?

438
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is what I just produced.

439
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Glow beam.

440
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I am not.

441
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I am now.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
To be more specific.

443
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The setting of our experiment is to say.

444
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I hit a pump beam.

445
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Then.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Hit another glow beam.

447
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Then these two.

448
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Intensity.

449
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The pump beam.

450
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Its intensity is about 10,000 times as strong as the glow beam.

451
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes.

452
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Then it goes through this non-linear.

453
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Element.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The element plus.

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
After the effect.

456
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It will produce this glow beam.

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This glow beam is amplified.

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes.

459
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Then it will also produce another one.

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Conjugate beam.

461
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So they are a twin.

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then after these two lights are cut off.

463
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I call it.

464
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Intensity.

465
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Difference.

466
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Squeezing.

467
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Or in other words, it is squeeze.

468
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In other words, it is squeeze light.

469
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Then these two lights.

470
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That is to say.

471
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
We will.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
To control the light of this input.

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Then let the power of the output light.

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
With these two lights.

475
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The power of these two shot noise lights is exactly the same.

476
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then you will see.

477
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
When we.

478
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If I have the so-called.

479
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Squeeze light.

480
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Squeeze light.

481
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My two intensity.

482
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Difference.

483
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is weaker than my shot noise.

484
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Sorry.

485
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let me ask.

486
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So the frequency of your four lights should be.

487
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What is the range?

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Because.

489
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So the frequency below you should be.

490
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The frequency of the big noise.

491
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Right?

492
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Ah.

493
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It should not be called big noise.

494
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because these two.

495
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The frequency of these two lights is different.

496
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes.

497
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You look at the left picture.

498
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Have you seen this cross-section?

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes.

500
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So you have two pink lights.

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is it a wave of visible light?

502
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
He.

503
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
In fact, he is a distant infrared light.

504
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Light of 795nm.

505
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Ah.

506
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

507
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So that.

508
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That is also right.

509
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
A few hundred terahertz.

510
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Right?

511
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes.

512
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So you.

513
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So you just.

514
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The next page.

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That one.

516
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Um.

517
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The following frequency is kilohertz.

518
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Is it the difference between the two?

519
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
My.

520
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The problem is.

521
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Is.

522
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The frequency on both sides.

523
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You.

524
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You want to see.

525
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You.

526
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You have a side wave now.

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Correct.

528
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Then this side wave has a side wave frequency.

529
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Right?

530
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But I.

531
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I am now.

532
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I.

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'm talking about.

534
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
These noise.

535
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
To do.

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Negative analysis.

537
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Of.

538
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Noise frequency.

539
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Not to say.

540
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
My whole side wave.

541
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What is the frequency?

542
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Not this frequency.

543
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But this noise.

544
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He has his own frequency.

545
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He has.

546
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So.

547
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So you just.

548
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Your next page.

549
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The noise.

550
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Your next page.

551
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Spectrum is.

552
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
These noise.

553
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Spectrum.

554
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Not the light itself.

555
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Spectrum.

556
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes.

557
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That is.

558
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
His noise.

559
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Just make sure.

560
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Um.

561
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Good.

562
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Thank you.

563
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Continue.

564
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because like.

565
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Light.

566
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Light has his.

567
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
His distribution.

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So.

569
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Anyway, he.

570
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He actually.

571
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Anyway, he.

572
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He.

573
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
There will be a.

574
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Distribution of noise.

575
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That.

576
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
If it is.

577
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
His distribution of noise.

578
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That is to say.

579
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
His frequency.

580
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The noise.

581
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The power should be the same.

582
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This.

583
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That.

584
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Uh.

585
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Here.

586
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For missing noise.

587
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That is.

588
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I.

589
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I do.

590
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Intensity difference.

591
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
When.

592
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The noise.

593
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That.

594
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Uh.

595
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That red.

596
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This.

597
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
The noise of the customer.

598
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Only left.

599
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The original.

600
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Only 17%.

601
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
His.

602
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
His noise is.

603
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's actually very weak.

604
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
That's right.

605
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The focus here is to say.

606
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You can see.

607
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Hey.

608
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
When it's low.

609
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
There are some small peaks.

610
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
In fact.

611
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
This small peak.

612
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That is.

613
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This.

614
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Very expensive.

615
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There are very stupid.

616
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The disadvantages of TESLA.

617
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Because.

618
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There will be cavities in it.

619
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That.

620
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This.

621
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Cavity will.

622
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Causing him.

623
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Will have these.

624
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The noise.

625
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Run out.

626
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So.

627
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
When you are in low frequency.

628
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Will receive these.

629
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Cavity noise.

630
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Affect.

631
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You can't see it.

632
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Very low frequency.

633
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Mass noise.

634
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Compression.

635
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Right.

636
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That.

637
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Assuming that.

638
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Uh.

639
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We are.

640
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
When doing experiments.

641
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Sometimes put the laser.

642
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Will lock the laser.

643
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What does it mean to lock the laser?

644
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Just let.

645
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Its frequency is fixed.

646
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It won't float around.

647
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Or let.

648
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Its width.

649
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Narrow.

650
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That.

651
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The meaning of the line width narrowing.

652
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
That is to say.

653
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I have a sine now.

654
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That.

655
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Your.

656
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Is your sine a very simple sine?

657
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Or.

658
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Your sine.

659
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Sine.

660
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Or.

661
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There is a plane.

662
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The sine.

663
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That is to say.

664
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This plane.

665
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That is to say.

666
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm talking about.

667
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Right.

668
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This plane.

669
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Right.

670
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That.

671
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay.

672
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's about it.

673
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So.

674
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So.

675
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
There is a picture here.

676
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That is to say.

677
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Let's measure.

678
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
TESLA.

679
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This.

680
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
When we lock the laser.

681
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You will find that.

682
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
This.

683
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
The blue dash 9.

684
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Is.

685
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That is.

686
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
When we do time.

687
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
We just.

688
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Anyway, just hit the light.

689
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Hit in.

690
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Fiber.

691
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Then go.

692
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
To measure its.

693
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Line width.

694
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Right.

695
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You will see that it is probably.

696
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Maybe a few.

697
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
A few hundred.

698
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Or a few dozen.

699
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Kilohertz.

700
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
The blue dash 9.

701
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Its width is probably.

702
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Maybe a few dozen.

703
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Kilohertz.

704
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So.

705
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So.

706
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Narrow.

707
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's pretty beautiful.

708
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But.

709
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's getting worse.

710
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This is.

711
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The disadvantage of TESLA laser.

712
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That is to say.

713
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You lock up.

714
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In fact.

715
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Your frequency is fixed.

716
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But.

717
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The quality of your laser.

718
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It's getting worse.

719
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Right.

720
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Then you have to.

721
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Put it.

722
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Line width becomes narrower.

723
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
In fact.

724
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It will be quite complicated.

725
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then we look at another.

726
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Red curve.

727
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
This red curve.

728
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Is.

729
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
2D laser.

730
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Then.

731
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
When you haven't locked up.

732
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's like this.

733
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's dash 9.

734
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Red dash 9.

735
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's.

736
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
About a few.

737
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Megahertz.

738
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So wide.

739
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But when we lock up.

740
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
After.

741
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This red line.

742
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It becomes very narrow.

743
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's probably a few.

744
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Probably.

745
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Even less than.

746
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
A kilohertz.

747
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So narrow.

748
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Line width.

749
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So.

750
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
For 2D laser.

751
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It may.

752
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Our laser.

753
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
2D laser.

754
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
About.

755
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Only 20,000 to 30,000 dollars.

756
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So.

757
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So it is also.

758
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Relative to.

759
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's a lot cheaper than.

760
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
TESLA.

761
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
About.

762
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
One TESLA.

763
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You can buy.

764
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
About nine.

765
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
2D laser.

766
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Like this.

767
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But.

768
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
2D laser.

769
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's actually.

770
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Its.

771
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Light is weaker.

772
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Correct.

773
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Then this is another team.

774
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
In.

775
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Australian.

776
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Experimental research.

777
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Then he is.

778
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I just forgot.

779
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Who asked.

780
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That is.

781
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
They are using.

782
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Crystal to do.

783
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then their method.

784
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's not called.

785
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
4-way missing.

786
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Then their method.

787
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's called.

788
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What is OPO?

789
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Ah.

790
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Important.

791
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Correct.

792
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This is.

793
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
This is another kind of use.

794
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Ah.

795
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In the way of opening.

796
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
To do.

797
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Squeeze line.

798
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Then they.

799
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
This.

800
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This picture on the left.

801
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You will see this black.

802
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This.

803
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This straight line.

804
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Is the so-called.

805
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Shot noise.

806
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Shot noise.

807
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I just said.

808
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Laser light noise.

809
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Then you will see.

810
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There are other.

811
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Very messy line.

812
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There are red lines.

813
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Blue line.

814
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Red line.

815
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Black line.

816
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Blue line.

817
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then you will see.

818
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There is a power here.

819
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That is to say.

820
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
His power.

821
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
From 6.

822
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
From 6.

823
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Microwave.

824
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Down to.

825
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
0.7.

826
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Microwave.

827
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Down to a few.

828
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Power.

829
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
When.

830
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You will see.

831
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
His.

832
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Miscellaneous.

833
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Low frequency.

834
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
When.

835
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Getting weaker and weaker.

836
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Correct.

837
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That.

838
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
In fact, this piece of paper.

839
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
He.

840
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't know.

841
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Why.

842
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Will be like this.

843
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Anyway, they are.

844
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
They are a record.

845
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That is to say.

846
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's at 280 Hz.

847
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That.

848
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That.

849
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
In fact, we already know.

850
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Why.

851
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That.

852
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
He.

853
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because.

854
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's his own problem.

855
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So there will be some.

856
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Some.

857
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Peak.

858
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Noise.

859
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Is particularly strong.

860
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But.

861
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
These are not important.

862
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The point is.

863
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He can be very low.

864
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Very low frequency.

865
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
More than 200 Hz.

866
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Can still.

867
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
See.

868
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
The effect of the noise reduction.

869
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
As long as it is below zero.

870
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Is.

871
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The effect of the reduction.

872
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That.

873
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Blue line.

874
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
With black line.

875
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, no.

876
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The red line and the black line.

877
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is.

878
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
At low frequency.

879
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There are a lot of.

880
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Classic noise.

881
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Basic noise.

882
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's hard to see.

883
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Noise reduction.

884
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Effect.

885
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Especially when.

886
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's very powerful.

887
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
When.

888
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
That.

889
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
This.

890
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Next.

891
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
These are.

892
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That.

893
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Is.

894
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000

895
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
