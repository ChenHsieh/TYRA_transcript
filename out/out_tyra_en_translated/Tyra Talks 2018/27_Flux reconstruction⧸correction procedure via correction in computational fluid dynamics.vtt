00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hi, I'm Yen-Yung Chang, the host of Tera.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
We are going to have the second lecture of Tera this year.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Today's speaker is...

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Wait a minute, I have to scroll up first.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Today's speaker is Bi-Yao Zhuang.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
She is from DC's George Washington University.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
She is a fourth-year doctor of mechanical engineering.

00:32.000 --> 00:40.000
She specializes in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
She is going to talk about...

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Flux Reconstruction Correlation Procedure via Reconstruction in Computational Fluid Dynamics.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Let's welcome her.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi, I'm Bi-Yao Zhuang.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm a fourth-year doctor of George Washington University.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
I specialize in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
I specialize in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
I specialize in fluid dynamics and numerical simulation.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
I recently learned about a new numerical method called Flux Reconstruction.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Oops, I accidentally typed the wrong title.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Never mind.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It's called...

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
It doesn't have a Chinese name.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
It was first proposed in 2007.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
The second paper was published in 2009.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Other groups joined the field in 2012 and 2013.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
So, it doesn't have a Chinese name.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
It's called Flux Reconstruction.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
As you can see, there is a typo in the title.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
It's a reconstruction.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Some groups thought the name was bad.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
So, they renamed it to Correction Procedure via Reconstruction.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
It's basically the same.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
There are two groups in the UK.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
There are three groups.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
One group is in NASA.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
One group is in Stanford.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
One group is in the UK.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
In the UK and Stanford, they are called FR, Flux Reconstruction.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
In NASA, they are called CPR, Correction Procedure via Reconstruction.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I recently learned about this.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I think it can be used for my doctoral research.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It just started in computational physics.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
There is still a lot of room for development.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
I just finished learning this.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I read a lot of papers and learned a lot.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
So, I have some insights.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm here to make a progress report.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm here to share with you what this numerical method is doing.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
What I'm going to talk about today is...

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
First, let me introduce some basic concepts of numerical methods.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm not sure what your background is.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
So, there will be some basic introduction of numerical methods.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
To avoid some people who are not doing numerical simulation and don't understand.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Next, I will introduce how to introduce Flux Reconstruction.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Basically, the first part is like a math class.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It's a mathematical introduction.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
The last part is how I want to apply it to incompressible flow.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Because my main research is to do incompressible flow.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
The group that proposed Flux Reconstruction, like Stanford or the UK.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
They are all doing compressible flow.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
So, at least so far, if you look for Literature Review.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
I haven't seen any group using this method in incompressible flow.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
So, I plan to do my research in this direction.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So, I will briefly talk about my future plan.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
First, I want to introduce a very important concept in numerical methods.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
It's called the Full-Weight Fragmentation Method.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
It can infer all kinds of different numerical methods.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It's the foundation of the foundation.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
So, I'm going to introduce it.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Today, there is a Full-Weight Fragmentation Method.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
At present, many phenomena in the natural world are unified by the Full-Weight Fragmentation Method.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
We call it the unified method.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
I use a symbol like L to represent the operator of the Full-Weight Fragmentation.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It's the Full-Weight Fragmentation symbol.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
An example of L is the so-called heat expansion method.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
This is the operator of the Full-Weight Fragmentation.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
U is an unknown function that we want to solve.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
In the Full-Weight Fragmentation, it may be a temperature field.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
The temperature field changes with time and space.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
In the fluid, U may be a velocity field.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
F is an unknown function on the right side of the equation.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It may be related to your physical phenomenon.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
For example, in fluid mechanics, F may be a gravity field.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
In the Full-Weight Fragmentation, F may be a heat source.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
It is a thing that generates heat without realizing it.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
If today's Full-Weight Fragmentation is the exact solution,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
The real solution of the real world is called U-exact.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Although we want to know what U-exact is,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Because it is the real solution.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
In fact, in real life, we can't get it at all.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Because in the Full-Weight Fragmentation, I'm not sure what it is.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
But in theory, it should not be guaranteed that there is a real solution.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
So we can't get the real solution today.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Then we think of another way.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Let's assume a solution.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
For example, if today's U represents temperature,

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Let's assume that the temperature in this space may look like what it looks like.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
After we assume what it looks like,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
There will be some unknowns in it.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Let's solve it again.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
For example, today we assume that the temperature field will be a function series.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Like Fourier series or Laplace series.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Then you can write it as a sigma c i phi i.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
c i is an unknown constant.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Then phi i is what we assume it looks like.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
For example, I have a very simple example here.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
If phi i is defined as x i,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
If phi 0 is a constant,

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Then phi 1 is x, phi 2 is x², phi 3 is x³.

06:52.000 --> 07:02.000
Let's assume that the temperature field today is C0 plus C1 times x, plus C2 times x², plus C3 times x³.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Today we have assumed that the temperature field looks like this.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
The rest we need to decide is how much C0, C1, and C2 are.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
So the whole numerical method, numerical simulation, numerical partial differential,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
All these things are actually discussing two questions.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
What is it? What should we assume this U looks like?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
What is this phi i?

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It can be sine or cosine.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
It can also be like the example I just mentioned, x, x², x³.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
So what kind of assumption is the best?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
This is a question.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
The second question is, how do we find out how much C0, C1, and C2 are?

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
So the whole numerical method, numerical analysis,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
In fact, when you take these classes,

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
It's all about these two questions.

07:54.000 --> 08:04.000
When we talk about how to determine C, C0, C1, and C2,

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
We're going to talk about how to determine C.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
We hope that we can find a set of C0, C1, and C2.

08:20.000 --> 08:30.000
We hope that we can find a set of C0, C1, and C2.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
The definition of C0, C1, and C2 is that

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
When you take the assumption back to PDE,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
It's a perfect zero error.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
No matter where you are,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Assume that the function is always perfect.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
There will be no imperfection in it.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
But the problem is, it's impossible.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Because if you bring in the assumption function today,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
It's a perfect zero error.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
It's like you're guessing the function today.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
It's just the exact solution.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Then it's not called the assumption function.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
We don't need to guess.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So it's almost impossible.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Only some toy problems in textbooks.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
You're just guessing a function.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Guess it's C0 plus C1x.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It's just the exact solution.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
But in real life, it's unrealistic.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
So we, for example,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And then the second question is,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
If you use this method today to find C1, C2,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
How many of these are there?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
You'll find that you have several unknowns,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But you only have one square.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
For example, if I guess today,

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
This function is C0 plus C1x plus C2x squared plus C3x squared.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
And then I'm going to solve a Poisson equation today.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Then you put this assumption function

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
After bringing in the original Poisson equation,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
It's a two-step equation.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
The remaining two-step equation of U is 2C2 plus 6C3x.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And then you bring it in.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Your product will look like this.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
What you see on the screen is 2C2 plus 6C3x minus 3pi x.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
You only have one square.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
But you have four unknowns from C0 to C3 today.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
You can't solve it.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
So these questions mean that

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
We can't use this method to find the unknown.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
So today we're going to use the numerical method to

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
To broaden our understanding of the function.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So today we're going to use the numerical method to

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
To broaden our understanding of the function.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
We don't want it to be perfect today.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
We want it to have some flaws.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
But as long as some conditions are met, it's good.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
This is called the weight multiplication.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
You see the first point on this list.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
This point means that

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
R is still the same as the multiplication of any point in space.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
But today I'm going to multiply it by a weight.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
This weight means that

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
This weight means that

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
In space, the value of some places is more important.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
The value of some places is more important.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
For example, x is equal to 2.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
This place is very important.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I want its value to be multiplied by 10.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Then in x is equal to 3,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I don't care so much about its value.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
I don't care if my assumption is correct.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So its weight may only be 0.1.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Then the requirement that I broadened today is that

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Multiplying by the weight of the entire space will be zero.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
multiply by the weight of the entire space will be zero.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
This is good.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
I no longer require that there are all points have negative parts.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So this is a broadened condition.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
So this is a broadened condition.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Then we're looking at this weight...

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Hey

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
This is a little problem.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Your weight is

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
a function of x.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Then in your entire

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
range of interest in x

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Is this w going to be positive?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Because negative will have

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
a strange meaning.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
No, it's negative.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Negative can also

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Even later

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
may be mentioned a little bit.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Even it will have infinite

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Like the delta function at a certain point

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
It will have an infinite weight.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Then all the other places are zero.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Ok

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Then you need to put this whole

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
You are now the first

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
The points above the points

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Remove

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
w itself

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
dx and then the entire range of points

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It's a bit like renormalize.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Is it total probability?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Is it total weight?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Or do you not need it?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You said

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You are now the point

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
This equation

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Its denominator

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Is the same equation

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But there is no r.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
w itself dx

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
No need

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
We didn't do this.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Because theoretically

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
It is

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Theoretically it is zero.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
In fact, if you subtract something else

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
If your method

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
If it's perfect, you subtract something else

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It's still zero.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
We just divide it directly.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Ok, I understand.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Then we today

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Then we continue to talk about this weight.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
You see I have a j here.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
In fact, it means that I am not only a set of weight today.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I just gave an example

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
For example, x1, the weight of this place is 10.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
x3, the weight of the place is negative 0.1.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
0.1

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
This is a set of weight.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
But when I design the method today

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I will not only design a set of weight.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I usually design

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Enough weight to let me

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Solve my unknown number

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
For example, the example I just gave

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
There are four unknowns from c0 to c3.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Then I have to design four groups of different weight today.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Then I will have four groups.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
That linear equation

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I will get that linear equation.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So I can solve four

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
That c0 to c3

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
These four unknowns

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
That constant

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So we are equal to simplify

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
I just said that the numerical method is around two problems.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
One is how we should assume

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
What does it look like?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
The second is how to calculate

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
The constant c0 to c

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
The second question is how to calculate c

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
This constant

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
We can change it

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
In other words, it becomes another question.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
How do we define our weight?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Then

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
This is our question now.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
The question we just asked

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
We will remember to go back to this question later.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Then we just talked about it before.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Is the standard that has been relaxed

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
As long as the weight of the weight

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
After the weight is multiplied by the weight

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
The residual value of the weight is zero.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Then in the numerical method

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We will be further relaxed

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Is that we often hear

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You may hear some elements

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Then grid

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Or some more

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
May be more formal

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Will be called piecewise solution

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
That is to say

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Today this space is interesting

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
I wrote it in the first video called space

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I cut it into a smaller area in space.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
For example

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Subdomain 1, Subdomain 2

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
This kind of subdomain is called element.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Is what you often hear

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
The so-called element in the finite element

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Or you hear that grid

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
A grid inside

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Then I use a 1 today.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
To represent this kind of subdomain

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Then k under the label means different

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Subdomain

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Then let it go today.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Inside each element

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Have their own guesses

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
For example, U0 means the 0th subdomain.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It has its own assumption function

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That U1 inside

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Is the 1st element

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
It also has its own guess function

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Then

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
So the whole global

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The guess function is actually a lot of different

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Small elements are combined

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
If X is in the 0th element today

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Then we use the 0th guess function

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
If X is in the 1st element today

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
We use the 1st guess function

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Why do you say

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
This is a kind of relaxation

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Why is it a kind of relaxation

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Because it means

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Today if the real world

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Exact solution

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Is a very high-level function

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
For example, a high-level polynomial

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Or a sine, sine wave or cosine wave

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Its fluctuation is very large

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
You see, like this example

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
The black line in this example is the exact solution

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It has three fluctuations

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
It is equal to at least three or more

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Its solution is three or more polynomials

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Even sine or cosine

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
But if I take the whole domain today

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Divided into many small elements

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Like this example, I split it into six small elements

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I mean I have each element

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Just use a straight line

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Then add six elements

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I can see my real world

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
So this is a kind of relaxation

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
It means I'm guessing

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
What does this function look like

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I use the simplest straight line

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I can be my assumption

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You can guess what this function looks like

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
So we will say this

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Divide it into subdomain

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Elements or cells

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Is a kind of relaxation

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
A more relaxed condition

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
That's what this video is about

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
This kind of relaxation

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
As I just said, its advantage is

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Even if your real function

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Is a very high-level function

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Or a very vibrant, very fluctuating

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
If it's a big thing

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I can also use a very low-level guess

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
To look at this exact solution

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
This is its advantage

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
The disadvantage is

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
We split this domain today

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Into many small subdomains

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
What is the relationship between the subdomain and the subdomain

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
What is the relationship between the subdomain and the subdomain

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This is a new problem

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
A new problem

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
For example, what is the relationship between element 1 and element 0

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
For example, what is the relationship between element 1 and element 0

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It's impossible to have nothing to do with it

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Because they are all describing

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Different sections of the same real node

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
So they still have a relationship

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So you have to make some assumptions

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
What we use the most in our numerical method today

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
What we use the most in our numerical method today

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
The so-called continuous function we call C0

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
That is to say

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Today, if there are two elements connected together

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Today, if there are two elements connected together

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Like on the picture, if you see this blue element

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
And yellow element

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
C0 is that they just have to

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
The point where the interface is connected

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
The point where the interface is connected

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
It's just continuous

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
That's the easiest

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
So today you can see this blue line

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And the orange line are connected

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And the orange line and the orange line are connected

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
As for the number of points, is it connected

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
In this C0 condition

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
We don't care

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
We don't care

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
So if we talk again

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
So if we talk again

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
To refresh

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Today's modern numerical method

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Today's modern numerical method

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
We just talked about the surrounding two issues

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
We just talked about the surrounding two issues

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
So now you can add one more question

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
So now you can add one more question

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Is to first

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
So first

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
is the assumption function

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What does it look like

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Then the second is what this whole function should look like

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Then the third is when we split the domain into many small elements

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
When we split the domain into many small elements

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
What are the relationships between elements and elements

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
The combination of different answers to these three questions

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Will give you different

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
The so-called numerical method

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
The so-called numerical method

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I have a question

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I have a question

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
My question may be very basic

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
People who understand

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
My question is like this

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
For example, the thing you just described

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
For example, the thing you just described

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Is a coordinate field

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
But if you care about the nature

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But if you care about the nature

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
If it's speed or acceleration

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
But if it's speed or acceleration

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Are you

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Are you

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Right

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Right

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Right

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
So you will know

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So you will know

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Because if your conditions today are very simple

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Because if your conditions today are very simple

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
But if you are

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But if you are

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But if you are

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You can find a number on the right

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
And limit them to be equal

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
You are equal to saying that the conditions

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
It will be tougher and harder to meet

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
But this is every

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
How strong is the boundary condition of the small element

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
How strong is the boundary condition of the small element

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
So the actual operation will be with

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
What kind of problem do you want to solve?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's about your actual problem

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It's about your actual problem

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I see

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
This is why different areas

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Will use different numerical methods

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
So maybe the most common thing we hear is

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Limit difference, limit element, limit volume

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
These are the three most common

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Then you will find out why

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
People who calculate mechanics use limited elements

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Then why

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Fluid mechanics uses limited volume

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Then other people use limited difference

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's because they are likely to be

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
C0 or C1

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
This kind of requirement is different

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Then

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
So back to the three questions here

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Then there are some examples here

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Different answers to these three questions

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
What kind of different

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Numerical methods

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
The first

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Its formal name is pseudospectral

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Or that positive

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I don't know the Chinese name

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Orthogonal collocation

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Then why mention this

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because we hear the most

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Limited difference, finite difference

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Is a special case

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Then this numerical method

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That is to say, its weight is a delta function

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's what I just said

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It will be infinite at this point

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Delta function

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
This thing is very interesting

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
It will become

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I don't know

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
After it is accumulated

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I should be able to go back to that video

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Delta function

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
After the accumulation becomes

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Only this point has value

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
A little slow

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's like this

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Like this point

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
If wj is a delta function

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
That delta function

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
If the point is in xj

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Then this point will become

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
The right-hand side is equal to

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
R of xj

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
That's it

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So this is why you are in a finite difference

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I can't see any weight at all

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I can't see it

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
It is

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
The finite difference is defined at the point

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
If you are

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Then

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
The finite difference is this

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
So-called pseudo-spectral

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
A special case

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Except that the weight is a delta function

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Its

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
The diameter is also very low

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
It is a straight line

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Its so-called phi is a straight line

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Just guess

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
You can see

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
The solution of the assumption

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It only has phi0 and phi1

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Two things

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
So today you are doing

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
When there is a finite difference

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
In fact, you are solving

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
It's just C0 and C1

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Then the finite difference

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The continuous condition of C0

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The finite volume

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
It's like fluid mechanics

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Its weight is

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
As long as it is

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
This one

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I define it in ej today

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Inside this element

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Its weight is all 1

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Outside this element

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Its weight is all 0

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is the definition of its weight

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Then

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The solution of the assumption

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
This is what we guess

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
It's simpler than the finite difference

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It's just a parameter

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Today in an element

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
In a subdomain

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
For example, the temperature field

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
The temperature field in this subdomain

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It's just a parameter

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It won't change anything

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
It will be very complicated

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
It will use the so-called

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Riemann jump condition

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
It's complicated

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I just want to say

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's not a C0 condition

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
What is it

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's beyond today's scope

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So I didn't say

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
It's just an example

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
How do we answer those three questions

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Will define a different value

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
The third is

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
The so-called continuous Galerkin method

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
We often hear that finite elements

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
This is a special case

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
In this case

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Its weight

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Will be equal to

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The function we guess

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Is phi j

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Phi j is what we just guessed

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Assuming that function

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Its weight is this

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
As long as you use this weight

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It's all called Galerkin method

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The finite element

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It's more advanced

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
It also uses C0

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Continuous condition

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But as for this phi i

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
What is it

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Is it sine, cosine, polynomial

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Or exponential

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
In fact, in the traditional Galerkin method

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
It didn't say

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It's just in the finite element

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
The traditional phi i

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Use a straight line to define

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It's a straight line polynomial

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
This video

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Just to introduce to you

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Our numerical method

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
What is it all about

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's the three questions

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I'm going to introduce this today

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
The weighting method

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Because the flux reconstruction

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Will use the weighting method to push down

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I didn't mention it in the video

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
The so-called low-order method

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Or high-order numerical method

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
So I want to be here today

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Also want to introduce

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Not everyone has a numerical method

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Background

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
So I want to introduce this order first

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
What is it

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
We just had a projection

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
There is an example

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
If there is one today

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
The physical field of the real world

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
For example, this black line is its real field

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
We don't know

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
The field we can't guess

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Then we use six elements to define it

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Then in each element

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
We guess it's a straight line distribution

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
That's what it looks like

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
If we want today

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You can clearly see that

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Although at some points

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
The function we guess is very

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Basically close to the physical field of the real world

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But other parts

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
You see, like this blue straight line

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
With that black curve

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
There is a big, obvious error in the middle

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
So if we want to improve this error today

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
What can we do

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
The first thing we can do

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Is to use more elements

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Just make it finer

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
So in each element

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Still use a straight line

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
But the straight line may be because it is smaller

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
It will be closer to the black line

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Is the real physical field

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
The next projection

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
The next projection is an example

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Like this projection

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I added six elements today

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Let the total number of elements become 12

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
But in each element

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Still use a straight line

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
That guess

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Then we will find that I just added six elements

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Now the whole guess

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
The solution will become very close to the real solution

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
This method

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
This is a kind of increase

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Reduce error

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Then increase the accuracy

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
A way

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Why did you mention this?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Because when we define the so-called order

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
It's related to this

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Order means when I add today

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
When the number of my elements

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
How to reduce

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
When we define the speed

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Is defined by the index

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
For example, I

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
The number of my elements has increased by m times

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Then my error

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The speed of the decree

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Is the square of m

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
That square is the so-called order

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Is when we define the numerical method

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
A definition of order

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Then this order

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Or this so-called rate

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
It is also called the convergence rate

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Is the speed of convergence

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Then like some examples

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
For example, today if my

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
The number of elements from n1

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Changes to twice n1

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Then my error from epsilon

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Reduce to one-second epsilon

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Then this method is called first order method

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Because

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I mentioned this m today

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Is 2

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Then my error today becomes one-second

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Then it is the square of 2

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
So it is the first order method

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Then my error from n1

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Increases to twice n1

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But my error from the original epsilon

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Reduce to one-eighth epsilon

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Then this is the third order method

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Because 8 is the square of 2

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
3 times

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Then this is our so-called order

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So the so-called low order

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
We are talking about low order method

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Usually refers to first order or second order method

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
In other words, you double your number of elements

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
As a result, your error value

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Only reduced by half

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Error value becomes one-fourth

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Then high order is usually three steps

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We usually call high order

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Then here is a

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Is

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
High degree expansion

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Is to be distinguished from high order

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
We just assumed

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
The function is the u, there is a hat above

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
We use a sigma

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Then ci times phi i

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
The more i i use today

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
For example, I use from c0 to c10

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
The more we use

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
We will say this is a higher degree

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Expansion

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
For example, c0

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
If your guess today is c0 plus c1 phi 1

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
That's it

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Maybe you can say it is degree of two

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Degree of one

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Then if you use c0 today

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
c1 c2 c3

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Then it is degree of three

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
What a coincidence today

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
If I am building my assumption

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
When that function

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Is also high degree expansion

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Is my

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
There are more in the series

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
If there are more phi

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It will usually be a high order method

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
That is to say, the speed of error collection

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Will be faster

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
For example, if you use

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
There are a total of ten phi

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
You may only multiply the number of elements by two

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Its error may be

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Collection is

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It's just one percent

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
The speed of error reduction is very fast

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
At the same time

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
In addition to the speed of error collection

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
The so-called high degree expansion

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
It can usually give us a more accurate solution

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Like the following picture

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Is an example

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I still use six elements

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
But in each element today

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I no longer assume it is just a straight line

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I assume it is a quadratic equation

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I just added one more

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
x square

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I still use six elements

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
But you can clearly see

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It's very, very close to the real world

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I just made such an assumption

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
So you can see

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
If you are in the element today

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
The higher the degree

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
The accuracy it gives you

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Will be better

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
This is actually

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I want to emphasize a little

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Can't mess up

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The so-called convergence rate

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Is the so-called order

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Can't mix it up with accuracy

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Because order is just a definition

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
It's just how fast it gets smaller

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
But it doesn't mean that the error it gives you is very small

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Accuracy is

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
The error I gave you today is very, very small

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
But it doesn't mean that after I double the number of elements

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Its error

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It really gets smaller

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Even if you have ten elements

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Give you such an error

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
After you double it into twenty elements

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Your error makes it bigger

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So accuracy and the so-called order

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Can't mix

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I have a question

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
My question is

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I'm not sure

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
But I assume your black line

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
When you were writing code

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
You are using a

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Three-time polynomial

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Just c0 plus c1x plus c2

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Plus c3x three times

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
If you want to use

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
This uj

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
You also get its degree

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Is up to 3

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
In fact, you use

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
There will be no more

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Improvement because of its critical

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It has perfectly described

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Is this a problem?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Because all the coefficients after you

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Will be zero

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
But isn't this the case?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Isn't it just case by case?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Yes so

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It's not wrong to say that

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
But

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
We can't know the truth

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Because

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Because

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
This is an example

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
So I use a three-time polynomial

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
To draw it

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
But in the real world, you don't know

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
It's a three-time polynomial

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
So you can only use

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
More and more order

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
To see what it looks like

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
You mean

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
The real signal in the natural world

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Maybe you get five squares

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Can describe some

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Then maybe you get

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
After ten squares, it can start to describe

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
For example, another kind of perturbation

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Then fifteen squares can describe

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Some kind of noise

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
It will keep describing

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Smaller signal

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Not what I'm talking about

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
What I want to say is

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I'm building this uj today

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
What should it be used for

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
When

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It is indeed case by case because

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I don't know the real solution

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
What does it look like

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
So I can't tell

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
What should I use

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
What I can do is

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
For example, the same six elements I just did

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I assume it is c0 plus c1x

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It's just like this

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Then see how much it is

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
When I do the second calculation today

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I add one more

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Plus c2x square

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Then see how much it is

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Then see if it is

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Is the difference getting smaller and smaller

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
For example, if I use three elements today

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Like now

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
If there are three elements in my projection

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
If the error is 10 times 10

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
1 times 10 times 10

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Then today if I add another

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
c3x3 square and calculate it again

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
The result is c3x

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
The assumption of four elements and three assumptions

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
The error is only

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
For example, only 1 times 12

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
That is to say that you are adding another

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
When c3x

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
It doesn't help

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
So that is to say

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
That is to say

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
In fact, we don't know what to do

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
We can only use this method to guess

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
A bit confusing

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
A bit difficult to describe

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I can understand what you want to say

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
But what you are talking about now is basically

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Assuming a perfect

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Mathematical discussion

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
But in fact, when you are writing code

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
If you keep increasing your degree

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
You may keep reducing

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Your

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Uncertainty or inaccuracy

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
But to a certain extent

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
You no longer have so many advantages

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
To reduce the difference between the model and the actual

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
But you start to magnify

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Your own computation

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Will it?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Will

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
So that's probably what you don't want to do

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
More

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
At that time

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
You may not need to

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Put more

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Elements into your uj

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I see

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Thank you

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Then

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The next page

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
So like I just said

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
The previous video

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
In addition to using more

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Elements in your

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Assuming function

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
In addition to giving you

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
A very precise answer

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
At the same time

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Its convergence rate is also very high

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
So it is equivalent to the speed of its chain

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Its error reduction speed is also fast

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
At the same time, the error it gives you is also very small

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Then it is a very

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's a very attractive way

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
In fact

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Starting with a computer

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Starting with a numerical method

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
The so-called high degree

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Everyone wants to use

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
But why is everyone still using

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Limit element and limit volume

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
The bottom line is that it has a lot of

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
The disadvantage is that if I

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Today's physical field is a

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Time dependent

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Unsteady problem

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
There is a countdown for time in the unified square

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
That usually

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
This kind of thing is very unstable

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Because there will be errors in the computer

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
The computer can't use it

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
To show all the numbers

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So it has some numbers

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Can't express

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Errors in the calculation process

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
If today

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
T is equal to 0

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
0.1 seconds

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
A very small error

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
The so-called unstable is that it is very possible

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
At 0.2 seconds

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
The error in the first second

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
In this second

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Let your calculation explode

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
For example, it becomes infinitely large

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Or infinitely small

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
This will happen

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
This situation is called unstable

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
That high degree element

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It is particularly easy to be unstable

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
The reason is obvious

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Like you just saw

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
If we use 10 today

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
There is a c10x10 square

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
If I have a small error today

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
There is a small error in this step

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Is 1

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
1 square

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
1 square

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
You bring this error to x10

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
The whole error becomes

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
1 square

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
This will make your computer

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Let your calculation explode

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
So this kind of thing

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
It becomes so-called very unstable

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
The second is that it is more involved

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
The concept of linear代数

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It is Eocondition

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
If I am today

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
We just said that we must have a linear equation

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
To solve those c, those functions

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
For example, four

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Four linear equations to solve

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
The so-called condition number

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
There is a thing called condition number

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
The higher the condition number

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It means that this linear equation is more difficult to solve

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
The lower the condition number

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It means that this linear equation is easier to solve

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Usually you use the higher

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
The assumption function

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
For example, when using x4 to 8, x5 to 8, x6 to 8

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
We will

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It will become the so-called Eocondition

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
It's a sick

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Its linear equation will be very difficult to solve

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
You may need

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Very, very long time

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Those c0, c1, c2, c3

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
That is

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
The so-called high degree and high order method

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
The second

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Then the third

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
The more you use it, the more complicated it is

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
When you write a computer program

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
The more difficult it is

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Even if it's not easy to write

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
There may be more bugs in it

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It will be more difficult to debug

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Then the fourth is like now

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Everyone's program is parallel

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Run on multiple boxes

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Even our computers are at least four cores

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Then when this high-level method

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
You want to design it

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Can be at the same time on eight cores

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
When you go to solve together

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It will also become very difficult

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
So this is the most obvious high-level method

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Four disadvantages

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
That's why

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
So far everyone is familiar with the numerical method

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It's still the kind of first order

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Or second order

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Limit difference or limit element

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
But everyone is still working hard

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Is the so-called high-level method

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Because he is very appealing

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
He just gives you a very small error

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Then his error is very slow

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
So everyone is still studying

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
So everyone will find a way to say

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
From the three questions we just said

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
The three questions around the numerical method

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
If we can find a combination

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
A combination of three answers

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Can give us a better high-level method

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Everyone has been trying in this area

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
That is indeed possible

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Maybe everyone has heard of

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
The so-called discontinuous Galerkin

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Is a continuous Galerkin method

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
He is probably

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
A major breakthrough after 2000

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Then he can be very high-level

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Then his

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Also relatively stable

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Then his conditions are relatively low

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
So after 2000

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
You will hear very often

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
The so-called discontinuous Galerkin

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Because it becomes very popular

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Then I

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Here is an example

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I just said

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Different answers can give you

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Maybe the same high-level

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
But relatively stable

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Or conditions are relatively low

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
The numerical method

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Like the three lines above me

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Represents three different

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Phi i assumptions

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
The steepest straight line

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Is the so-called

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
He should be the moment expansion

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Is the example I just used

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Is c0 plus c1x

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Plus c2x2 plus c3x3

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
That is to say

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Phi i is equal to x i

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
This is very obvious

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
You can see how many x axes

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I used

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Phi i

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Then y axis is the condition

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
You can see him

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
The more you use, the more conditions

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Increasing faster

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
So it means that you use too much today

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
If you use too much

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
It will be very difficult to solve

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Then the second

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
This is the connection between the two

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
He uses the so-called

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
The so-called

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
The so-called

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
The so-called

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
The so-called

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
The so-called

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The so-called

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
The so-called

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
The so-called

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
The so-called

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
The so-called

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
The so-called

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And even the third triangle

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
This line is a popular one these years

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Which is

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
The so-called

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
The so-called

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The so-called

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Phi 0 is a

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Phi 1 is

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Phi 1 is

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Let's use this method to

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Assume a function

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
You will find that the more you use phi

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Its conditional value does not change

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
That is to say

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
The more phi you use today

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
The so-called EO condition

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
It can be counted as eliminated

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It doesn't exist anymore

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Now show this diagram

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
For everyone to see

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Why different answers

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Can possibly solve

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Those drawbacks of high-level methods

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I have a small question

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
So

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
In fact

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Usually condition number

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Is it about equal to

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Calculation time

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Because you just count a condition number

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Is it a linear equation?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Yes, but I don't really know

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I haven't thought about this question

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's hard to say

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Because you have to see

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
What is the method to solve the equation

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
For example, you can use

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You solve a linear equation

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
You can use

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Is the most basic Gauss elimination

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Then you can also use some

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Is more

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Faster method

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Is like

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Or like you can use some

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
More fancy method

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Is to first solve its eigenvalue

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Then use the eigenvalue

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
To find its characteristic equation

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Then use the characteristic equation to combine

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Its linear equation

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
So

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I don't think

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Different ways to solve

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
The same linear equation

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Condition number

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Is equal to calculation time

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
And it may not be equal

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Because you basically have to put all conditions

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
All together

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
To solve the eigenvalue

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Oh, I see

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
But I'm sure

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
The more conditions, the worse

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
The more it solves, the slower

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
As for the slow ratio

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Is it linear or what?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I haven't studied this

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
So I'm not sure

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
So now

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Enter the main topic

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Weighted residual method

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Is used later

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Flux reconstruction method

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Then just explained

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
That order is just

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Give you a concept

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
What is low order, what is high order

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Why do we use high order

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
What is good to study

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Here is a hint for everyone

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Just give you a concept

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
We just mentioned that there are three ways

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
The answer to three questions

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Can define a new

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
That's why I'm talking now

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Give you a hint

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Flux reconstruction

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
What is the answer to these three questions

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
For the FR method

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Its assumed function

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
This phi i is used

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
You can say it is

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Lagrangian function

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
But you can also say it is Lagrangian

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
That polynomial is

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Lagrangian

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Interval function

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
That's just this interval function

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Interval function needs

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
You need some points

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
To define the interval function

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
In the FR

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
The interval function of phi

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Is defined in

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
The so-called quadrature point

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Everyone knows

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
It is a special point

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It is not randomly distributed

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
It is not evenly distributed

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
The distribution of points must meet certain rules

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
This rule is Lagrangian polynomial

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
It must meet the Lagrangian rule

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
This is its expansion

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Its expansion is phi i

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
What is it?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
What is its weight?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Its weight is Galerkin method

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
So its weight is used

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It's the same as phi i

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
wj is equal to phi j

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
That's the same as Galerkin method

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
But we'll show you later

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Where is it different from Galerkin method

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
It still has some different places

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Then the third question is

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
What is the relationship between different elements

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
What is the relationship between different elements

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
What I wrote here today is

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Orthogonal polynomial based blocks reconstruction

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Orthogonal polynomial based blocks reconstruction

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
In fact, it is the same as

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
The same as the finite element

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
The same as the finite volume

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
The so-called Riemann

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Riemann jump blocks

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
If you have

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
If you have learned

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
The finite volume, you will probably have an impression

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
It doesn't matter

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I will still talk about this

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
What is this

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
What is this

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
This is just a heads up

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
This is just a heads up

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Now let's start the formal introduction

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Now let's start the formal introduction

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Now let's start the formal introduction

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
When this method was proposed in 2007

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
When this method was proposed in 2007

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
It is mainly to solve the so-called

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Hyperbolic conservation law

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
This kind of PDE will look like this

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
This kind of PDE will look like this

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
When there are three or five corners

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
There will be an end mark for y and z

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Today we assume

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
The effective range

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
From xA to xB

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
If we cut it into

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
N1 elements

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
And then we use 1

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
To represent each element

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
And then each element

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Your own effective range

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Let's write it as xk to xk plus 1

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Let's write it as xk to xk plus 1

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Todaywe have two guessed functions

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
The first is the guessing function on u

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
The guessing constructions inside dkget

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And then we write

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
It like this

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Sigma u,k,i,psique

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
u,k,i

48:28.000 --> 48:42.000
U,k,i means the value of dk

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
In fact, only u,k,i is unknown

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Because f,k,i is defined from u,k,i

48:50.000 --> 48:56.000
f,k,i means you bring u,k,i to the f function in your original pd

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You can get u,k,i

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
So although we have two guessed functions

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
But only u,k,i is unknown and needs to be solved

49:04.000 --> 49:12.000
Then we go back to the weighting function

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
The weighting function is applied to dk element

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Only in dk element, we don't care about other elements

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
So its base range is xk to xk plus 1

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Then weight wj

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Then the right side is our original pd value

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
That is r

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
Then the second line below, I just split it into two

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Then we are now for the second item

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
The second item is weight wj

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
F is the derivative of this function to x

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Then we use the distribution points today

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Distribution points in the distribution points

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
We can get the equation on the right

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
This is the value

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
It will become xk plus 1 value

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
Then subtract another base function

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
This function is the so-called weak form

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Weak form of dsk

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I only mention it here

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Because we don't want to do dsk

50:10.000 --> 50:16.000
Then if you want to do dsk today

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
After you get this value

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Your next step will jump directly to

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
How do I define f at xk plus 1

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Or how to define f at xk

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Then we are not going to do this today

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
So skip this step first

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Let's move on to the next step

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
The next step is the one I just

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Wait for the point on the right

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I will go one step further and do it again

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Distribution points

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
After I do the distribution points again

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
I will get the original point function again

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Is the derivative of weight wj

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
But on my left

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I will have two more

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
I will have one more fk at xk plus 1 value

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
This is what I just said to f

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Assuming that the function

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
The derivative function at xk plus 1 value

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Then this fk

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Then xk is the value

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
It means that f is the assumption function

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
The derivative value at xk

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
So the third line is just a reorganization

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
You will get an original distribution function

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Then subtract the following two

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
Weight wj

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
What does wj mean?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
It means

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
A jump

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I hope xk this place

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
The first f

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
If you can see my mouse

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
The first f means

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
I hope xk this place

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
What is its value

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Then the second f

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
Is the f obtained by the inner product function

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
It means that I actually calculate the inner product function today

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
At this point

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
How much is this point at xk?

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
So it's called jump

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Is the value I hope

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
The difference between the actual inner product value

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
This is called jump

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
This kind of thing is in that document

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
They will be called strong form of discontinuous skeleton

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
That's just

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
No one is trying to solve this equation

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Then

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
The last point is to remind everyone

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Pay attention to the definition of two different f

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
One is how much I hope it is

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Then one is the inner product function

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
The actual value of the inner product

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Then the next page

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
A little slow

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Then I am today

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
This page is just about

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
The so-called strong form

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Of discontinuous skeleton

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Back to the original

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
The points of the entire product function

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Then it will look like this

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
You will find that the first one is still the original

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
The points of the entire product function

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Then there are two more things related to jump

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Then today

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
In Flux Reconstruction

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
The so-called strong form

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Of discontinuous skeleton is different

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
He used a trick at this time

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
He assumed

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I have a place in front

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
There is xwjxk

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
This one

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
If I can write it in the same way

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
A formula

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Then find a so-called gl function

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Let him say wj

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
The value of the entire product function at xk

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
Will be equal to

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
This point

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Then wj at xk

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
The value of this point

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Will be equal to the point defined by gr

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Then I put these two definitions

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Take it back to the original

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
The points of the entire product function

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I can write it as a whole

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Everything

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Stuffed into my points

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
It will be like this

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Everything will become a point

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Then the entire weight multiplied by everything else

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Why do this

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Because if you do this, you can put

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
If you delete the whole weight, you can delete the points

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Becomes a pure polynomial

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
So this is

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Flux Reconstruction

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Is me

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Assuming that wj can become a point

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Then take it back

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I can delete the points and the weight

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Back to restore

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
A primitive polynomial

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
This page is just

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Just rewrite it

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I have a small question

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
So you

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
You this method

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Basically rely on

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Is grgl

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Exist

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
That's right

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Will this be a problem

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
It is the focus

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
It is a focus of fr

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Is

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Its focus is

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
What is grl and gr

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Because we assumed first

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
The same grl and gr

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But we didn't mention

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Did you really find it

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
So wait

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
I may not talk about that today

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Because that will become more

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
But I will directly

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
One or two

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Already found function

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Then

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
This page is rewritten

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Flux Reconstruction

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Is what we are looking for

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
This method is looking for

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So you can see

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
The biggest difference between fr and grl

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Is

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Its weight

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
wj this function will disappear in the end

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
But

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
What to pay attention to is that it is not

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
No weight, it's just weight

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Will disappear

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Then

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Then

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
In the end

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
How to use that primitive polynomial

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
To find the real u

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Then we have to go back

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Involve in the so-called

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Time point

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Time point is the simplest

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Euler

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Is a finite polynomial

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Euler's temporal time margin

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Is

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Is the simplest point

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Is equal to

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
t plus delta t

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
minus t

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
The value of this time point

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Is your delta t

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
We put it as partial u partial t

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Is an Euler method

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Then we put it

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Just that

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
The primitive polynomial of fr

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Bring back

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
We can get this

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
A finite polynomial

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Then

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
We use t plus delta t

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
And t to represent

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
The solution of different time points

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Is

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Is

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Is it missing a page or two?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Let me see what the next page is

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
it is good

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Then

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
In this function

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
We have seen a lot now

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
That variable u

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Then t plus delta t

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Then we have to know

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Which is unknown

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
To know how to solve

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
So we have to review

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Is that we just didn't

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Although I didn't mention how to calculate

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I want to be in xk

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
How much is xk plus 1

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
But we are here first

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Assuming we already have a way to

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Calculate how much we want

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Then the second is that we also assume

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
We have found the right

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
gl and gr

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
That

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
And what we use is

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Our phi is the so-called Lagrange

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Input function

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
If my uki is defined in xk

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Then my uk this

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Assuming the function

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
When I put xk in

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
I can get uki again

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Then the second point is the so-called

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
F to f this assumption function

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
It's actually still a

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
That one

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Polynomial series

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It's just that

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Its division will be transferred to

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
The division of phi

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Because fki is a constant

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So you can't divide it

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
So this is f

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Then fki will remind you again

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
It's just f this function

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Then bring uki in

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So it's not an independent variable

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Then phi

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Or how much gr

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
These are actually you can assume

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
It is unknown because these are

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Polynomials defined by yourself

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
So of course you define it yourself

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Of course you can get its derivative

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
So back to this

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Square

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
We put it all in

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
You will find that everything is unknown

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
You are at t this time

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
U and then f

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And then phi

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
These are all unknown

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
The only unknown thing is t plus delta t

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So today in this method

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It's actually like this

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
You use this method to calculate

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
How much is t plus delta t

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
So today you divide the square

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
There will be a initial value

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
It's the value of t equals 0

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
That means you have the value of t equals 0 today

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Then your uki is 0

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
So f at 0

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
t equals 0

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Then you can use this formula to calculate

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
How much is 0 plus delta t

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Then you have you know

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
How much is 0 plus delta t

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Then you bring 0 plus delta t to the right

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Then you can get

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
How much is 2 delta t

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Then you step by step like this

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
In the end you can get

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
This u function

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
What is the change in time

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That's a simple summary

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
t equals 0 we have

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So we know uki 0 and f 0

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
How much

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Then we use that method

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Use some of the methods we haven't mentioned

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Calculate f at

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The interface of each element is xk

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
How much is it

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Then the third step is

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
You can use the formula from the last page

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Calculate the value of u at t plus delta t

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So you can go back

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Step 1 and Step 2

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Then keep repeating

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
This is what I just mentioned

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
The algorithm

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It's very simple

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So now it's time to say

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
We just kept saying

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
We assume that we already have a way

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
To calculate

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
We want f at xk

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
How much

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That's why I mentioned

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
What the hell is this thing

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
That's what we want

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
We call it numerical flux

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Then we just follow

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
This kind of thing is in the limited

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The limited volume and the Galerkin method

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Is a very common concept

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Calculate fluid mechanics

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
The most simple way we use

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Calculate numerical flux

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Is the so-called rose flux

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
ROE rose flux

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
It involves a lot of

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's just some physics

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Physics of flow

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
It's going to get complicated

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So I just gave it a formula

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Prove that we really have a way

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
How much is this f

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
If you are interested in this

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You can actually go back and look at some

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Some volume has been developed for 30 or 40 years

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So how to calculate this

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Numerical flux will become

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
It's actually very, very easy to find

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Then we solve f

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Then there is f

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The most important thing in the method is

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
How to find gl and gr

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Then we mentioned that gl and gr

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
These two functions must match

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
These two points

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Then the second one is

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
In fact, gl and gr

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Its meaning is

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Point to the boundary

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
We just said that there is a boundary in the formula

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Jump

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It's equal to

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The value we want on the boundary

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The difference in value

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
So this function is theoretically

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Only for the boundary

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Then it's inside the element

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It must be almost non-correct

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So we hope this function

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's on the boundary

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
For example, glx

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Its value will be very large

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
For example, 1

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Inside the element

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Then

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It must be higher than

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Its degree must be higher than

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The function we assume

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Because after you do this

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Its degree will be the same

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So the first thing I found today

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Is the so-called rado polynomial

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It looks like this

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You put it into this formula

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
This is the most primitive

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
gl and gr

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
There are a lot of gl and gr

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
You can find it in paper

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
But I didn't mention it

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Because it becomes very mathematical

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I just want to tell you

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I really found this gl and gr

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
This is an example

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
When using different gl and gr

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
You can see it

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
The change of the numerical method

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Like I said just now

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Same

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
The same linear equation

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You use different gl and gr

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Will get a completely different accuracy

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
If you are interested, you can go to paper

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Just play

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Because this is very mathematical

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Just show it to everyone

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Let everyone know that this thing exists

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I just talked about

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
There is only one dimension in space

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
If there are two dimensions in space

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
If you want to use fr

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
The current method can only

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Divide the two dimensions into two dimensions

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
The function

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Then apply fr

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Like I said just now

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But this thing is still under study

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So you probably only have one or two papers

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Have seen

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Let me mention it to everyone

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
This is a difference

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Maybe the time is a bit limited

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I have talked about it before

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
The difference is that it is one

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
One is the default form

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
One is the strong form

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
One is the weak form

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
The time is limited

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So let's skip it first

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Now let's talk about how to use it

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
In computational fluid mechanics

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
If I do it today

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
If it is compressible flow

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
In fact, the same method of compressible flow

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It is a conservation law

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
If you apply fr today

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
There is no problem at all

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
There will be no contradiction

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But if I am incompressible today

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Incompressible flow

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You will find that the same equation is inside

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
One of the equations

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
It lacks the division of time

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
So it is no longer a conservation law

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
If you want to use fr today

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It will be very difficult

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You don't know how to apply

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The fr method we just mentioned

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Then

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Of course, some people today

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
There will be a way to use

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Assuming this incompressible flow

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
There is a false compressibility

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Then we assume that there is a false compressibility

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
We can use it as a compressible flow

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
But the question is

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
What is this false compressibility

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's hard to define

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It's very unreasonable

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So I don't want to use this method

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Now the mainstream incompressible flow

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
All use the so-called

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
ProjectionStype method

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Use this very complicated

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
To solve

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So how should I do today

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Bring fr to this

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The most popular projectionStype

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
To solve

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
It will become a very challenging problem

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That's why

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I want to do

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Is to do

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Because

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
There is no one doing this

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Then I want to use fr today

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
In incompressible flow

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
The two basic elements I need

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I have to solve this

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Poisson equation

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
So it becomes

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You have to use implicit method

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You have to solve a very big equation

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You can't be like just now

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
t plus delta t

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Then step by step

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
You can't

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You can only solve it once

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And now a lot of people

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
They will assume the same

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
This thing is a state

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
This Poisson equation is a state

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Then step by step

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
After the value of t goes to infinity

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Assume it as

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Stable solution

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
This thing is very inefficient

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Because you have a stable solution

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
You have to go from t equals 0 to t equals infinity

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
I want you to know that it is very inefficient

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So my

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
For my own plan

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I hope I can find a way

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
To be able to solve

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Poisson equation without time

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
This thing is very simple

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
You just have to do it

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
But the problem is

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Different gl and different gr

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
There will be different values

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
No one studies

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
How should I choose gl and gr

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
If you want to solve today

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Poisson equation without time

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Then there is the second

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I hope to be able to

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Develop a projection style

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
That can't be compressed

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Solver

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The third is that I hope

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I can put the solver with

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
The so-called Immersed Boundary Method

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Coupled together

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
This is my current plan

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
My research goal

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Talk a little bit

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Just time

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Thank you all

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Good

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I think it's very good

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
At least for me

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's a field

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I think it's very clear

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I think it's too much

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
And I think the time is very good

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
It's 17 minutes now

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Then

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So the other one is your friend

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Right

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So we're the only ones here

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Then I just asked a lot of questions

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
That's it for today's speech

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
If you have any questions

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You can find it on our website

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Announcement of today's speech

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Then we will be late

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Upload the recording of today's speech

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
If you have any questions

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Just click on the speaker's name

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Will connect to his

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Self-introduction page on our website

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Then there will be his contact information

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Email or I don't know what you left

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Then you can discuss it directly with the speaker

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Then we will thank our speaker again

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Thank you all

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
If you have a look on the Internet

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
That's it for today

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I'm going to stop recording
