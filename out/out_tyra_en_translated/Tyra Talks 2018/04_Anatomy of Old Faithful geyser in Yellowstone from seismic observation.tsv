0	13000	Q&A
13000	25000	Today's speaker is Dr. Wu Xinmei, a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, majoring in geoscience.
25000	31000	Before coming to the U.S., she was a graduate student of the Department of Geosciences at NTU.
31000	40000	Xinmei and I have met in many areas that are not overlapping.
40000	45000	I met Xinmei when she was a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah.
45000	52000	My wife and Xinmei were classmates in college.
52000	64000	After coming to Caltech, she met another Taiwanese friend in the Department of Physics, and turned out to be Xinmei's classmate.
64000	71000	She will be talking about Anatomy of Ophethal in Yellowstone from Seismic Observation.
71000	74000	Let's give her a round of applause.
74000	79000	Oh, by the way, you have to turn on the microphone to hear the applause.
80000	83000	Thank you for the introduction.
83000	88000	Today's presentation is a relatively easy one.
88000	91000	There won't be a lot of formalities.
91000	94000	I will focus on the concepts.
94000	100000	Because people are not familiar with geoscience or geophysics,
100000	108000	I will focus on the concepts and focus on Ophethal Geyser.
108000	117000	Ophethal is a very famous geyser in the U.S.
117000	126000	If you go sightseeing in Yellowstone Park, you will definitely go to Ophethal.
126000	131000	I hope you will find this topic more interesting.
131000	138000	First, let's talk about Yellowstone.
138000	154000	Yellowstone is on the left of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.
154000	156000	This is the intersection of the three states.
156000	159000	This is the area of the National Park.
159000	162000	Ophethal is on the right of Wyoming.
162000	164000	Let me introduce Ophethal first.
164000	171000	Ophethal is a place where people rarely go to sightseeing.
171000	174000	People usually go sightseeing to Ophethal.
174000	178000	Because it takes about five hours to get to many national parks.
178000	182000	So if you drive from Ophethal to Yellowstone, it will take about five hours.
182000	186000	If you have a chance to visit, you can come and visit.
187000	191000	Yellowstone is famous for its volcanic activity.
191000	193000	People have heard of Ophethal.
193000	195000	But if you come to the National Park to sightsee,
195000	198000	what you see is not volcanic activity.
198000	206000	It's more like a geyser, a hot spring, or a hydrothermal feature.
206000	211000	I'll go into more detail later.
211000	216000	If you drive from West Yellowstone to Ophethal,
216000	221000	it will take about 30 to 40 minutes to get to Ophethal.
221000	226000	So, after you drive in,
226000	231000	you will see the National Park,
231000	236000	and then you will see Ophethal.
236000	241000	So, after you drive in,
241000	246000	you will see parking lots,
246000	251000	and then you will see the Visitor Center.
251000	256000	And then you will see Ophethal.
256000	261000	And then you will see Ophethal.
261000	265000	And then you will see Ophethal.
265000	268000	You can sit here and wait for it to erupt.
268000	272000	You can find the pathway up here,
272000	275000	and the upper part is called the Geyser Hill.
275000	278000	It's called the Geyser Hill because this is the place
278000	281000	with the highest density in the world,
281000	284000	and it has the hydrothermal feature.
284000	289000	So, you can see a lot of things smoked or hot water,
289000	292000	hot springs, and some geysers.
292000	295000	So, if you come to Yellowstone,
295000	298000	you will definitely come here for a walk.
298000	301000	So, you can see things like this.
301000	304000	It's very colorful.
304000	307000	A lot of colors.
307000	310000	These colors are usually some biological,
310000	313000	microorganisms here.
313000	316000	There are a lot of microorganisms here,
316000	319000	so the colors you see are mainly caused by
320000	323000	the impact of the geysers.
323000	326000	So, this is the map from the north to the south.
326000	329000	This is the Geyser Hill,
329000	332000	and there are a lot of hydrothermal features
332000	335000	around it.
335000	338000	This is Old Faithful,
338000	341000	and it's just over there.
341000	344000	There's a video on the right,
344000	347000	because we go out there every year.
347000	350000	So, this is the video.
362000	365000	So, I thought Americans knew,
365000	368000	but a lot of Americans have never been here,
368000	371000	so they wouldn't be surprised.
371000	374000	Old Faithful has a lot of features.
374000	377000	First of all, it's spectacular when it erupts.
377000	380000	Second, it can be predicted.
380000	383000	It can predict when it will erupt next time.
383000	386000	And if you go to the tourist center,
386000	389000	they will put up a sign
389000	392000	to tell you when it will erupt next time,
392000	395000	so you can sit there and wait.
395000	398000	But there's usually a 10-minute error.
398000	401000	If you Google Old Faithful Webcam,
401000	404000	you can see that there's a real-time camera
404000	407000	looking at Old Faithful.
407000	410000	I heard that a lot of people who like geysers
410000	413000	watch Old Faithful Webcam every day.
413000	416000	If you're interested, you can Google it.
416000	419000	Old Faithful can predict,
419000	422000	which means that the eruption
422000	425000	from this time to the next time
425000	428000	is very stable.
428000	431000	So the graph on the right
431000	434000	shows all the statistics
434000	437000	from 2000 to 2011.
437000	440000	This is the probability.
440000	443000	The horizontal axis is the eruption interval,
443000	446000	which is how long it takes
446000	449000	from the first eruption to the next eruption.
449000	452000	And it has a peak value of about 92 minutes.
452000	455000	So this is the prediction
455000	458000	for the last 10 to 20 years.
458000	461000	But if we look at the longer period,
461000	464000	from 1878 to now,
464000	467000	the eruption cycle is about 60 minutes
467000	470000	to the present 90 minutes.
470000	473000	And then there's another one.
473000	476000	You can see there's a little peak here.
476000	479000	It's not very obvious.
479000	482000	It's divided into long eruption intervals
482000	485000	and short eruption intervals.
485000	488000	The short one is about 60 to 65 minutes.
488000	491000	And then the long one and the short one,
491000	494000	you can...
494000	497000	I don't know what it's called in Chinese.
497000	500000	Anyway, a lot of park rangers
500000	503000	will do all kinds of things
503000	506000	in the National Park,
506000	509000	or they'll do a lot of things.
509000	512000	For example, look at the length of the eruption.
512000	515000	The eruption time is about 2 to 5 minutes.
515000	518000	If it's a long eruption,
518000	521000	the next eruption will be 90 minutes later.
521000	524000	But if it's an eruption
524000	527000	that feels like it's going to be gone in two minutes,
527000	530000	the next one will be about 60 minutes later.
530000	533000	So all the predictions
533000	536000	for the Old Faithful eruption
536000	539000	are based on what you can see on the surface.
539000	542000	But the National Park
542000	545000	is a very protected environment.
545000	548000	So even if there are a lot of geologists
548000	551000	and geophysicists
551000	554000	and geophysicists
554000	557000	doing research here,
557000	560000	they can't do research for a long time.
560000	563000	They might come for a few hours
563000	566000	or a few days.
566000	569000	Although the Old Faithful eruption
569000	572000	has been recorded
572000	575000	about 100 years ago,
575000	578000	it is still possible
578000	581000	to make the next prediction
581000	584000	based on the data from the eruption.
584000	587000	So why is there a long-term change
587000	590000	or why is there a short-term change
590000	593000	or why is there a short-term change
593000	596000	or why is there a long-term change?
596000	599000	The real mechanism is still unclear.
599000	602000	If you have any questions,
602000	605000	you can ask at any time.
605000	608000	Let me talk about
608000	611000	how we use geophysics
611000	614000	or geophysics
614000	617000	to study the structure of the fountain.
617000	620000	People are usually unfamiliar
620000	623000	with seismology.
623000	626000	Although seismology is traditionally
626000	629000	known as earthquake science,
629000	632000	it mainly uses some relatively large energy,
632000	635000	such as very large earthquake energy,
635000	638000	to understand the information
638000	641000	from the source
641000	644000	to the process in which you receive it.
644000	647000	So why do we want to study the fountain
647000	650000	or the interstitial fountain?
650000	653000	First of all,
653000	656000	it has a very important indicator.
656000	659000	In fact, all the structures
659000	662000	under the ground
662000	665000	or some physical mechanisms
665000	668000	are quite similar to volcanoes.
668000	671000	So you need a lot of water
671000	674000	to get to the bottom of the fountain.
674000	677000	There is a narrow channel
677000	680000	called the conduit,
680000	683000	and there is a reservoir
683000	686000	below it.
686000	689000	There is also a volcano,
689000	692000	which you may have heard of.
692000	695000	In the process of temperature pressure
695000	698000	or building,
698000	701000	they move forward.
701000	704000	You can see the animation here.
704000	707000	These are the lava,
707000	710000	because of the temperature
710000	713000	and pressure below,
713000	716000	and some mass.
716000	719000	The lava is mass,
719000	722000	and then it moves forward
722000	725000	to a critical value,
725000	728000	and then it moves back.
728000	731000	The lava is a mass,
731000	734000	and it moves forward to a critical value,
734000	737000	and then it moves back.
737000	740000	Most of the volcanic prediction
740000	743000	is to use the mass movement
743000	746000	to generate signals
746000	749000	and contact delays.
749000	752000	If you have an earthquake
752000	755000	near the volcano,
755000	758000	you can get some earthquake signals.
758000	761000	So geysers have similar principles.
761000	764000	But when it comes to studying volcanoes,
764000	767000	a lot of them erupt every few million years
767000	770000	or every volcano grows differently.
770000	773000	And it's dangerous to study volcanoes.
773000	776000	A lot of people don't want to die
776000	779000	because of studying volcanoes.
779000	782000	So if we can find a way
782000	785000	to understand the mechanism
785000	788000	of geysers,
788000	791000	we might be able to
791000	794000	apply our understanding
794000	797000	of volcanoes in the future
797000	800000	and do some analysis of volcanic disasters.
800000	803000	Hello.
803000	806000	Before you move on to the next page,
806000	809000	I'd like to ask a question.
809000	812000	Someone has a question.
812000	815000	Wu Mengchang has a question.
815000	818000	Do you want to ask it yourself?
818000	821000	You can turn on the microphone.
821000	824000	Can you use artificial geysers
824000	827000	and your internal structure
827000	830000	to create animations?
830000	833000	Animation?
833000	836000	Do you mean volcanoes or geysers?
836000	839000	I mean your animation.
839000	842000	There are a lot of studies
842000	845000	on volcanoes.
845000	848000	It's not just one or two studies.
848000	851000	If you go to IRIS,
851000	854000	you can find a lot of
854000	857000	visual education content.
857000	860000	Most of the research on volcanoes
860000	863000	is very complicated.
863000	866000	If it's an earthquake signal,
866000	869000	it's coming from a very deep
869000	872000	or shallow place.
872000	875000	There are a lot of ways
875000	878000	to analyze it.
878000	881000	The geyser I'm going to talk about
881000	884000	is a bit applicable.
884000	887000	If you have any questions,
887000	890000	please feel free to ask.
896000	899000	I'll talk about
899000	902000	traditional geyser theory.
902000	905000	It's what I use.
905000	908000	If there's an earthquake,
908000	911000	the geyser energy is very strong.
911000	914000	It will pass through
914000	917000	different waves.
917000	920000	For example,
920000	923000	if you put a station here,
923000	926000	you can receive the geyser signal
926000	929000	from that station.
929000	932000	Geyser theory uses
932000	935000	such a geyser signal
935000	938000	to analyze the source of the earthquake
938000	941000	or what effect it has
941000	944000	on the path of the geyser.
944000	947000	This is the most traditional geyser theory.
947000	950000	In other words,
950000	953000	if you have a geyser,
953000	956000	you can use this energy
956000	959000	to study the structure
959000	962000	between the source and the receiver.
962000	965000	If you know the source,
965000	968000	you can use it to study the path.
968000	971000	This is a bit of a trade-off,
971000	974000	but there are many different kinds of research.
974000	977000	It's scientific.
977000	980000	We can verify each other
980000	983000	and it will become believable.
983000	986000	I think this is the only way
986000	989000	to look at the internal structure of the earth.
989000	992000	NASA is now putting a geyser on Mars,
992000	995000	so it's very difficult
995000	998000	to predict the structure of Mars.
998000	1001000	This is a bit of a trade-off.
1001000	1004000	Now I'm going to talk about
1004000	1007000	my own research.
1007000	1010000	I'm going to talk from the biggest structure
1010000	1013000	to the smallest structure.
1013000	1016000	This is our yellow picture.
1016000	1019000	This is a picture of Mars.
1019000	1022000	This is a picture of Mars.
1022000	1025000	This is our yellow picture.
1025000	1028000	This is a picture of Mars.
1028000	1031000	This is the Geyser Hill.
1031000	1034000	This is the Geyser Hill.
1034000	1037000	This is the Geyser Hill.
1037000	1040000	The red circle is the path.
1040000	1043000	The red circle is the path.
1043000	1046000	Each red circle is our instrument.
1046000	1049000	We don't know what to look at
1049000	1052000	We don't know what to look at
1052000	1055000	We try to spread it evenly.
1055000	1058000	We try to spread it evenly.
1058000	1061000	Let's see what we can get
1061000	1064000	Let's see what we can get
1064000	1067000	It's about this big
1067000	1070000	It's about this big
1070000	1073000	You can go and dig a lot in a short time
1073000	1076000	You can go and dig a lot in a short time
1076000	1079000	There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.
1079000	1082000	There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.
1082000	1085000	If an earthquake may impact an environment or human activity,
1085000	1088000	If an earthquake may impact an environment or human activity,
1088000	1091000	There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.
1091000	1094000	There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.
1094000	1097000	As fast as you can imagine,
1097000	1100000	it's a long forest.
1100000	1103000	As fast as you can imagine,
1104000	1107000	this type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future
1107000	1110000	This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future
1110000	1113000	this type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future
1113000	1116000	This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future
1116000	1119000	This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future
1119000	1122000	This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

1597160	1599160	But when it's high frequency
1599160	1601160	You can see I drew a box here
1601160	1603160	Blue area
1603160	1605160	High frequency when it passes through the blue area
1605160	1607160	You can see its waveform
1607160	1609160	The first waveform is late, very obvious
1609160	1611160	The second is that it has a lot
1611160	1613160	Smaller and higher frequency
1613160	1615160	Wiggle is
1615160	1617160	One by one we call coda
1617160	1619160	What does this mean
1619160	1621160	This means that the high frequency
1621160	1623160	Small wave
1623160	1625160	Relatively small wavelength
1625160	1627160	In a shallow place
1627160	1629160	When it passes through this area
1629160	1631160	Obstructions
1631160	1633160	Here are some
1633160	1635160	Objectivity
1635160	1637160	Of course, you can use some
1637160	1639160	Earthquake learning methods to guess
1639160	1641160	What is the situation
1641160	1643160	You can also be a model
1643160	1645160	I won't talk too much
1645160	1647160	Because of this
1647160	1649160	Observation results
1649160	1651160	Find out
1651160	1653160	There is a relatively large
1653160	1655160	Hello
1655160	1657160	I have a problem with the front page
1657160	1659160	it is good
1659160	1661160	My question is
1661160	1663160	Did you frame the blue box
1663160	1665160	It's obvious when you frame it
1665160	1667160	There is clustering
1667160	1669160	This is different from the other set of data
1669160	1671160	But if you don't frame the blue box
1671160	1673160	I slipped when I looked at my eyes
1673160	1675160	Really
1675160	1677160	I mean
1677160	1679160	Very difficult
1679160	1681160	Can be seen at a glance
1681160	1683160	If your test today
1683160	1685160	Ten more times
1685160	1687160	Isn't it more difficult
1687160	1689160	I'm curious
1689160	1691160	Technically
1691160	1693160	Try to adapt
1693160	1695160	For example
1695160	1697160	Machine learning
1697160	1699160	Autoprocessing
1699160	1701160	Pre-selection
1701160	1703160	Interpret
1703160	1705160	Or you can see it
1705160	1707160	This
1707160	1709160	This picture is for us
1709160	1711160	Very obvious
1711160	1713160	Can be seen
1713160	1715160	So
1715160	1717160	I think machine learning is definitely the future trend
1717160	1719160	My boss is still working with
1719160	1721160	Computer science
1721160	1723160	Want to do real-time
1723160	1725160	Real-time
1725160	1727160	To see the changes
1727160	1729160	But these are more
1729160	1731160	And especially machine learning
1731160	1733160	You need some training data
1733160	1735160	You have to have some
1735160	1737160	Know some
1737160	1739160	Knowledge
1739160	1741160	You can apply it to the future
1741160	1743160	Prediction
1743160	1745160	But machine learning is definitely
1745160	1747160	Must do
1747160	1749160	I didn't talk about this bar
1749160	1751160	This bar is
1751160	1753160	We predict
1753160	1755160	This distance
1755160	1757160	If I predict the same speed
1757160	1759160	Where will they be
1759160	1761160	So it will be obvious
1761160	1763160	You see them
1763160	1765160	1 km
1765160	1767160	But this area
1767160	1769160	They become
1769160	1771160	0.5
1771160	1773160	I think
1773160	1775160	It must be good
1775160	1777160	You have to see
1777160	1779160	Very small
1779160	1781160	But this is very obvious
1781160	1783160	We have to
1783160	1785160	To see
1785160	1787160	I think
1787160	1789160	The answer is good
1789160	1791160	So we can
1791160	1793160	Different frequency
1793160	1795160	Different sensitivity
1795160	1797160	So we can
1797160	1799160	Sensitivity and range
1799160	1801160	To estimate
1801160	1803160	This thing
1803160	1805160	How big
1805160	1807160	This thing
1807160	1809160	Relatively deep storage
1809160	1811160	Water
1811160	1813160	All to
1813160	1815160	The system
1815160	1817160	Water
1817160	1819160	Water
1819160	1821160	If it's a volcano
1821160	1823160	It may be a lava pool
1823160	1825160	I forgot to say
1825160	1827160	The slope is from A to A
1827160	1829160	So it's just a slope
1829160	1831160	The low frequency I just talked about
1831160	1833160	Southwest
1833160	1835160	Ice Age
1835160	1837160	Northeast
1837160	1839160	Lava
1839160	1841160	The purpose is
1841160	1843160	Because
1843160	1845160	We have a lot of volcanoes
1845160	1847160	Taiwan also has a volcano
1847160	1849160	But geyser
1849160	1851160	Feature
1851160	1853160	Very rare
1853160	1855160	Why is it rare
1855160	1857160	You have so many hot springs
1857160	1859160	It actually needs a specific geological structure
1859160	1861160	To be able to
1861160	1863160	Such a condition
1863160	1865160	For O-Facebook
1865160	1867160	The first one you can see
1867160	1869160	This
1869160	1871160	Reservoir
1871160	1873160	Like a reservoir
1873160	1875160	It's not directly
1875160	1877160	At the bottom of O-Facebook
1877160	1879160	It's in the southwest
1879160	1881160	Why
1881160	1883160	Because
1883160	1885160	Relative to this
1885160	1887160	Geyser
1887160	1889160	It's easier to break
1889160	1891160	If you have temperature or pressure
1891160	1893160	Give it a lot of temperature or pressure
1893160	1895160	It's easier to fracture
1895160	1897160	So when you have water
1897160	1899160	From below
1899160	1901160	They prefer
1901160	1903160	It's easier to break
1903160	1905160	This is another
1907160	1909160	Result
1909160	1911160	Then I just said it was big
1911160	1913160	I'm going to talk about it now
1913160	1915160	It's not me
1915160	1917160	Let's talk about this little one
1917160	1919160	Smaller
1919160	1921160	What I'm talking about now
1921160	1923160	Bubble trap is this one
1923160	1925160	It's probably in this
1925160	1927160	It's about 300 meters deep
1927160	1929160	Then
1929160	1931160	The depth is about
1931160	1933160	20 to 60, but this is much smaller
1933160	1935160	This is probably
1935160	1937160	20 meters deep
1937160	1939160	Then the width
1941160	1943160	Then they said
1943160	1945160	This is another way
1945160	1947160	They set up a lot of stations
1947160	1949160	It's on O-Facebook
1949160	1951160	You can see this
1951160	1953160	It's completely different from our first station
1953160	1955160	This is a little bit denser
1955160	1957160	Then it's more focused
1957160	1959160	They don't use
1959160	1961160	The source
1961160	1963160	They use O-Facebook
1963160	1965160	Their own source
1965160	1967160	Then go and see
1967160	1969160	For example, I have an energy here
1969160	1971160	Then I have a very dense array above
1971160	1973160	My energy to this station
1973160	1975160	They will have a time difference
1975160	1977160	So they use
1977160	1979160	Array
1979160	1981160	Very dense array
1981160	1983160	All the energy
1983160	1985160	Where did it come from
1985160	1987160	I'll talk more about it later
1987160	1989160	This energy
1989160	1991160	Now
1991160	1993160	It's part of the structure
1993160	1995160	They found
1995160	1997160	For example, from the last station
1997160	1999160	Between
1999160	2001160	The energy is divided into two areas
2001160	2003160	The first area is almost vertical
2003160	2005160	Under O-Facebook
2005160	2007160	The second area is the red area
2007160	2009160	Is more to the south
2009160	2011160	A little bit
2011160	2013160	Because of this discovery
2013160	2015160	I think
2015160	2017160	O-Facebook structure
2017160	2019160	It may not be
2019160	2021160	Just a channel
2021160	2023160	There will be other
2023160	2025160	This is called
2025160	2027160	Cavity or bubble trap feature
2027160	2029160	It has an offset structure
2029160	2031160	The constraint here
2031160	2033160	Not very good
2033160	2035160	But after all, the energy still comes from here
2035160	2037160	It means that there is actually
2037160	2039160	There is a structure here
2039160	2041160	This discovery
2041160	2043160	Very important
2043160	2045160	Because you said
2045160	2047160	A lot of modeling
2047160	2049160	Geyser modeling
2049160	2051160	Research
2051160	2053160	It actually needs very
2053160	2055160	Determine
2055160	2057160	What does it look like
2057160	2059160	Do you have one
2059160	2061160	Involved in this
2061160	2063160	It's very different
2063160	2065160	So
2065160	2067160	This discovery is actually quite a lot
2067160	2069160	More surprised
2069160	2071160	Then
2071160	2073160	Conjured
2073160	2075160	This structure is too small
2075160	2077160	All
2077160	2079160	Referred
2079160	2081160	Conjured
2081160	2083160	From this reference
2083160	2085160	This is about 20 years ago
2085160	2087160	Whether it's Caltech or Berkeley
2087160	2089160	Then they just put it directly
2089160	2091160	Camera
2091160	2093160	Put the camera down
2093160	2095160	From O-Facebook
2095160	2097160	Put it down
2097160	2099160	What does it look like
2099160	2101160	What does it look like
2101160	2103160	If you are interested, you can watch YouTube
2103160	2105160	That feels like
2105160	2107160	Explore outer space
2107160	2109160	Satellite environment
2109160	2111160	Anyway, it looks like this
2111160	2113160	Then there will be a lot of explanations
2113160	2115160	Why do they do this
2115160	2117160	What did you find
2117160	2119160	The interesting thing is that they
2119160	2121160	In the past
2121160	2123160	Maybe the instrument or something
2123160	2125160	Will not receive more restrictions
2125160	2127160	You can't be there when it erupts
2127160	2129160	So they are
2129160	2131160	This observation
2131160	2133160	Actually did it for two or three years
2133160	2135160	Then what did you say in the first year
2135160	2137160	It's a big bubble
2137160	2139160	In the water of Bolin
2139160	2141160	Then go down
2141160	2143160	Then go again in the second year
2143160	2145160	Then the main thing is
2145160	2147160	About 20
2147160	2149160	He can
2149160	2151160	The camera can reach about 20 meters
2151160	2153160	20 meters deep
2153160	2155160	I'm not sure
2155160	2157160	If this restriction is also
2157160	2159160	If you have a feature next to you
2159160	2161160	Then its pipe is very narrow
2161160	2163160	Then you may not be able to get out of the video
2163160	2165160	Can be seen
2165160	2167160	But this kind of observation
2167160	2169160	Is very reliable
2169160	2171160	What you see is what
2171160	2173160	If it is an earthquake signal
2173160	2175160	Or some signals
2175160	2177160	He actually
2177160	2179160	There is an error
2179160	2181160	You have to measure
2181160	2183160	How much
2185160	2187160	Ok
2187160	2189160	The first half of the structure is like that
2189160	2191160	If you have any questions, you can ask now
2191160	2193160	How much time
2193160	2195160	If not, I have to continue
2195160	2197160	What I'm talking about now
2197160	2199160	Old Facebook
2199160	2201160	Your own
2201160	2203160	What is the signal
2203160	2205160	That is
2205160	2207160	This paper
2207160	2209160	He is mainly using signals
2209160	2211160	I think this will be more interesting
2211160	2213160	Ok
2213160	2215160	So if you have a station
2215160	2217160	Put it in
2217160	2219160	It should be super close
2219160	2221160	Maybe put it next to it
2221160	2223160	Then this will be
2223160	2225160	If that station is on the ground
2225160	2227160	This is the signal we received
2227160	2229160	This is a whole day
2229160	2231160	This is a 24-hour signal
2231160	2233160	So you see he is 90
2233160	2235160	About 90 minutes
2235160	2237160	Every 90 minutes
2237160	2239160	Related cycle
2239160	2241160	Then
2241160	2243160	If we only look at one
2243160	2245160	If we only look at one
2245160	2247160	This is about 100 minutes
2247160	2249160	So there is a burst
2249160	2251160	If you look at it
2251160	2253160	Where do you think it will be
2253160	2255160	Where
2255160	2257160	I probably won't
2257160	2259160	This red curve
2259160	2261160	It is the real record
2261160	2263160	To the time of the burst
2263160	2265160	So you see before he
2265160	2267160	We think
2267160	2269160	More than 10 hertz
2269160	2271160	More than 10 hertz
2271160	2273160	The signal
2273160	2275160	Even stronger than
2275160	2277160	The signal when you burst
2277160	2279160	This signal
2279160	2281160	If we zoom in
2281160	2283160	You can see a very obvious
2283160	2285160	Event
2285160	2287160	This kind of signal
2287160	2289160	From
2289160	2291160	We are talking about
2291160	2293160	Bubble collapse
2293160	2295160	For example, you cook
2295160	2297160	You cook a pot of soup
2297160	2299160	There will be a lot of small bubbles
2299160	2301160	Then slowly float to the front
2301160	2303160	Colder water
2303160	2305160	Then they will
2305160	2307160	Break off
2307160	2309160	Break off
2309160	2311160	Every event
2311160	2313160	Relative
2313160	2315160	Relative to
2315160	2317160	You can see a lot here
2317160	2319160	Recorded
2319160	2321160	Then this picture
2321160	2323160	This is the signal
2323160	2325160	You see the water coming out
2325160	2327160	The first one
2327160	2329160	Before the burst
2329160	2331160	The energy is much smaller
2331160	2333160	Then he grew up
2333160	2335160	It's completely different from them
2335160	2337160	Then
2337160	2339160	We won't talk about it today
2339160	2341160	The signal of the burst
2341160	2343160	Before the burst
2343160	2345160	Like these signals
2345160	2347160	Can bring us
2347160	2349160	How can we do research
2349160	2351160	How can we use these signals
2351160	2353160	To understand
2353160	2355160	What is it
2355160	2357160	So
2357160	2359160	There are a lot of
2359160	2361160	The first
2361160	2363160	Burst every 90 minutes
2363160	2365160	Why
2365160	2367160	So
2367160	2369160	This kind of thing
2369160	2371160	There is a fixed pattern
2371160	2373160	There will be a certain pattern
2373160	2375160	There will be a certain pattern
2375160	2377160	For example, here
2377160	2379160	There is no event
2379160	2381160	Then there will be more
2381160	2383160	So the first one
2383160	2385160	Let's calculate
2385160	2387160	How many
2387160	2389160	Along the time
2389160	2391160	How many
2391160	2393160	This event
2393160	2395160	Then do the statistics
2395160	2397160	30
2397160	2399160	A total of 30
2399160	2401160	Is
2401160	2403160	One
2403160	2405160	A total of 30
2405160	2407160	Then
2407160	2409160	Use eruption time
2409160	2411160	As a reference
2411160	2413160	Then all the time
2413160	2415160	Relative to the time of the burst
2415160	2417160	20
2417160	2419160	20 minutes before the burst
2419160	2421160	20 minutes before the burst
2421160	2423160	40
2423160	2425160	40 minutes before the burst
2425160	2427160	60 minutes before the burst
2427160	2429160	Then hope that if we
2429160	2431160	Collected a lot of eruption cycles
2431160	2433160	See if there is a fixed pattern
2433160	2435160	This is the number
2435160	2437160	Gray is the number
2437160	2439160	Gray is the number
2439160	2441160	So it has a very
2441160	2443160	The fixed pattern is
2443160	2445160	It will have a number
2445160	2447160	Peak
2447160	2449160	20 minutes before
2449160	2451160	20 minutes before the burst
2451160	2453160	Then there will be a decrease
2453160	2455160	Then there will be an increase
2455160	2457160	Then the red is
2457160	2459160	If you consider not only the number
2459160	2461160	You consider the size of each event
2461160	2463160	Then the pattern will look like this
2465160	2467160	In addition to the number
2467160	2469160	What else can be done
2469160	2471160	You can see
2471160	2473160	Each of these events
2473160	2475160	You can see
2475160	2477160	Is there a number
2477160	2479160	Or they all look different
2479160	2481160	Or they actually have a set model
2481160	2483160	So what you can do is
2483160	2485160	I don't know if you know
2485160	2487160	Cluster analysis
2487160	2489160	Use it
2489160	2491160	For example, you have
2491160	2493160	You have a box of blocks
2493160	2495160	It may have different shapes
2495160	2497160	Different colors
2497160	2499160	Then you can sort by color
2499160	2501160	You can also sort by shape
2501160	2503160	You can also sort by whatever you want
2503160	2505160	Then our sorting method is
2505160	2507160	The similarity of the waveform
2507160	2509160	For example, this looks like this
2509160	2511160	Or this looks like this
2511160	2513160	Use this to sort
2513160	2515160	Then the sorting method is
2515160	2517160	The same is the cross-section coefficient
2517160	2519160	This is not a function
2519160	2521160	We just use it
2521160	2523160	When they are the most similar
2523160	2525160	What is the coefficient
2525160	2527160	So the coefficient will be between 0 and 1
2527160	2529160	0 is the least similar
2529160	2531160	1 is exactly the same
2531160	2533160	Then this
2533160	2535160	Same
2535160	2537160	This is the time series
2537160	2539160	You can compare it
2539160	2541160	Eruption time
2541160	2543160	Then
2543160	2545160	20 minutes
2545160	2547160	To do cluster analysis
2547160	2549160	Every blue dot is every event
2549160	2551160	If this is a cluster ID
2551160	2553160	If the ID is very close
2553160	2555160	If they are nearby
2555160	2557160	It means they are more similar
2557160	2559160	If it's the same ID
2559160	2561160	That means between them
2561160	2563160	At least 0.8
2563160	2565160	The coefficient is at least 0.8
2565160	2567160	So it's from 0 to 1
2567160	2569160	If it's the same ID, it's probably 0.8
2569160	2571160	0.8 will be
2571160	2573160	The number is very similar
2573160	2575160	So the first thing to pay attention to
2575160	2577160	You can see
2577160	2579160	For example, there is a cluster here
2579160	2581160	Is it closer to the ID?
2581160	2583160	Then there is another one here
2583160	2585160	Then there is another one here
2585160	2587160	There is another one here
2587160	2589160	Another thing to pay attention to
2589160	2591160	You can find different clusters
2591160	2593160	They are relative
2593160	2595160	Relative to the time of eruption
2595160	2597160	It's different
2597160	2599160	Like this cluster
2599160	2601160	It's more likely to be 40 minutes to 80 minutes
2601160	2603160	Then this cluster
2603160	2605160	It's about 30 to 60 minutes
2605160	2607160	36 to 60 minutes before the eruption
2607160	2609160	Before the eruption
2609160	2611160	Actually nothing
2611160	2613160	Fewer events
2613160	2615160	Like this cluster
2615160	2617160	It's more like late
2617160	2619160	You
2619160	2621160	Did you spray all the water this time?
2621160	2623160	Is it before the next eruption?
2623160	2625160	It's slowly accumulating
2625160	2627160	Maybe there will be water
2627160	2629160	Fill in
2629160	2631160	Fill in the hot water
2631160	2633160	Or fill in the underground water nearby
2633160	2635160	Or it's building
2635160	2637160	Its pressure and temperature
2637160	2639160	Then it will erupt until it reaches a critical value
2639160	2641160	Then in the front
2641160	2643160	We say this is called recharge
2643160	2645160	It's a bit like recharge
2645160	2647160	I don't know how
2647160	2649160	Then the early recharge
2649160	2651160	It's more likely to have this kind of wave
2651160	2653160	That mid-range recharge
2653160	2655160	There will be a wave like this
2655160	2657160	There will be a wave like this
2657160	2659160	This is actually good news
2659160	2661160	Because you have this pattern
2661160	2663160	If it is fixed
2663160	2665160	If it is every eruption
2665160	2667160	If it has this pattern
2667160	2669160	We can use it to study a lot of things
2669160	2671160	We can study
2671160	2673160	Where did this wave come from?
2673160	2675160	What is its source?
2675160	2677160	Is the location different?
2677160	2679160	Is the shape of its source different?
2679160	2681160	There are still many possibilities
2683160	2685160	Or you can use this pattern
2685160	2687160	There are many eruption cycles
2687160	2689160	If they are all the same
2689160	2691160	We can use this pattern
2691160	2693160	To do prediction
2693160	2695160	Especially machine learning
2695160	2697160	If this pattern is
2697160	2699160	Between certain error ranges
2699160	2701160	Then you can use
2701160	2703160	Such data as knowledge
2703160	2705160	You already know the knowledge
2705160	2707160	Then as training data
2707160	2709160	If you can have more data in the future
2709160	2711160	Or you can
2711160	2713160	For technological progress
2713160	2715160	You can use this information
2715160	2717160	To do machine learning
2721160	2723160	These are the four clusters I chose
2723160	2725160	Let's see what they look like
2725160	2727160	You can find an average
2727160	2729160	Let's see what this group looks like
2729160	2731160	Let's see what this group looks like
2731160	2733160	Let's see what this group looks like
2733160	2735160	Let's see what this group looks like
2735160	2737160	This is the first cluster
2737160	2739160	This is the first row
2739160	2741160	The second cluster is the second row
2741160	2743160	The third cluster is the third row
2743160	2745160	The fourth cluster is the fourth row
2745160	2747160	The red one is for time series waveform
2747160	2749160	The blue one is for frequency
2751160	2753160	The blue one is for frequency
2753160	2755160	The units are hertz
2755160	2757160	So it's 0 to 100 hertz
2757160	2759160	So it's 0 to 100 hertz
2759160	2761160	So it's 0 to 100 hertz
2761160	2763160	The good news is that these four waveforms
2763160	2765160	The good news is that these four waveforms
2765160	2767160	If we do not see the EU flu
2767160	2769160	They will be very similar
2769160	2771160	If we do not see the EU flu
2771160	2773160	They will be very similar
2773160	2775160	we can see that the frequency ratio
2775160	2777160	we can see that the frequency ratio
2777160	2779160	The low frequency waveform
2779160	2781160	The low frequency waveform
2781160	2783160	is likely to be 10 Hz
2783160	2785160	like this
2785160	2787160	is like this
2787160	2789160	There's only one eruption cycle
2789160	2791160	There's only one eruption cycle
2791160	2793160	If we use the same method
2793160	2795160	If we use the same method
2795160	2797160	If we use the same method
2797160	2799160	We can see that the other eruption cycle
2799160	2801160	We can see that the other eruption cycle
2801160	2803160	Is it the same?
2803160	2805160	Or is it different?
2805160	2807160	You will find that
2807160	2809160	These two look very similar
2809160	2811160	These two look very similar
2811160	2813160	These two look very similar
2813160	2815160	These two are a little different
2815160	2817160	But the low frequency part is very close
2817160	2819160	But the low frequency part is very close
2819160	2821160	This is also good news
2821160	2823160	This is also good news
2823160	2825160	It's not just the eruption time
2825160	2827160	It's not just eruption time
2827160	2829160	Even the inner process
2829160	2831160	Even the inner process
2831160	2833160	Is very close
2833160	2835160	Is very close
2835160	2837160	At least 10 years
2837160	2839160	At least 10 years
2839160	2841160	So
2841160	2843160	What can you do
2843160	2845160	I just mentioned
2845160	2847160	I just mentioned
2847160	2849160	I am planning to do a more detailed prediction
2849160	2851160	I am planning to do a more detailed prediction
2851160	2855160	Not just the pulses, but ability to combine the numbers
2855160	2859160	Or, you could even set the times and odds
2859160	2861160	Add lots of videos
2861160	2863160	Add lots of videos
2863160	2865160	Like deep learning machine learning
2865160	2867160	Do prediction
2867160	2869160	And if the country really gives them the green light
2869160	2871160	And if the country really gives them the green light
2871160	2873160	And if the country really gives them the green light
2873160	2875160	If the terrain is great
2875160	2877160	You could do monitoring
2877160	2879160	And make sure this works
2879160	2881160	To be more scientific
2881160	2883160	I'm curious about the bimodal eruption
2883160	2885160	I'm curious about the bimodal eruption
2885160	2887160	Why sometimes it's 90 minutes
2887160	2889160	Why sometimes it's 60 minutes
2889160	2891160	If you have a complete data set
2891160	2893160	You can use a lot of data to do statistics
2893160	2895160	You can use a lot of data to do statistics
2895160	2897160	Why sometimes it's 60 minutes
2897160	2899160	This is important
2899160	2901160	Like when we talk about volcanoes
2901160	2903160	How do we predict the next eruption
2903160	2905160	Last time it was 60 million years
2905160	2907160	Last time it was 10 million years
2967160	2969160	And the last picture is also outdoors
2969160	2971160	And the last picture is also outdoors
2971160	2973160	Outdoors is beautiful
2973160	2975160	But it's cold
2975160	2977160	Not fun
2977160	2979160	It's open in winter
2979160	2981160	We went there in November
2981160	2983160	We went there in November
2983160	2985160	Because it's easy to get super cold
2985160	2987160	Because it's easy to get super cold
2987160	2989160	And it's open in December
2989160	2991160	But only for snowmobiles
2991160	2993160	If you want to see what winter looks like
2993160	2995160	If you want to see what winter looks like
2995160	2997160	You can rent a snowmobile in December
2997160	2999160	You can rent a snowmobile in December
2999160	3001160	But it will be cold
3001160	3003160	But it will be cold
3003160	3005160	Thank you
3026160	3028160	Please go ahead
3028160	3030160	It's hard to understand
3030160	3032160	What am I saying?
3032160	3034160	I said if it's hard to understand, you can say it
3034160	3036160	Because I will adjust it next time
3036160	3038160	Because I don't know how to do it
3038160	3040160	No, I think you said it very well, very clearly
3040160	3042160	Oh, really? Thank you
3042160	3044160	She kept nodding her head, she said it very clearly
3044160	3046160	Okay, Meng Chang has a question
3046160	3048160	You can just ask
3048160	3050160	Turn on the microphone
3050160	3052160	Okay, I want to ask
3052160	3058160	They can't see the changes directly?
3061160	3063160	So in our field
3063160	3065160	First, you have to have a source
3065160	3067160	For example, you do X-ray
3067160	3069160	X-ray or something, you have to have an energy
3069160	3071160	Or radar, you have to have an energy
3071160	3073160	To hit it
3073160	3075160	But if your energy is not strong enough
3075160	3077160	Or the frequency is not right
3077160	3079160	You won't be able to see the scale you want
3079160	3081160	The scale or the depth
3082160	3084160	So if we want to look at the ground
3084160	3086160	It usually requires relatively strong energy
3086160	3088160	You have to be
3088160	3090160	For example, have you heard of
3090160	3092160	Oil companies will use a big car
3092160	3094160	To fix it
3094160	3096160	But this kind of energy is very
3096160	3098160	It will destroy the environment
3098160	3100160	If you have been there
3100160	3102160	There will be a lot of warnings
3102160	3104160	You can't jump
3104160	3106160	Or you can't go to certain places
3106160	3108160	Some people will go crazy
3108160	3110160	Because these
3111160	3113160	They need a very special environment
3113160	3115160	This environment is relatively fragile
3115160	3117160	You can't let that water
3117160	3119160	Release pressure to the surface
3119160	3121160	So we are now
3121160	3123160	If you want to look at the underground environment
3123160	3125160	Then you have to go through
3125160	3127160	A more indirect method like us
3127160	3129160	You have to use some natural energy
3129160	3131160	Or something
3131160	3133160	But there is a limit to this
3133160	3135160	Because the source of these energies
3135160	3137160	You can't control
3137160	3139160	You have to find the right source
3140160	3142160	Find the right thing
3142160	3144160	You can use it to see
3144160	3146160	What you want to see
3146160	3148160	But my impression is
3148160	3150160	Like oil companies
3150160	3152160	They look at
3152160	3154160	They also have
3154160	3156160	I have heard that they may also use
3156160	3158160	The so-called atomic clock
3158160	3160160	Because the atomic clock
3160160	3162160	The density of the surface changes
3162160	3164160	The change of gravity
3164160	3166160	There will be a change in the structure
3166160	3168160	Very sensitive
3169160	3171160	So he can use the atomic clock
3171160	3173160	To measure
3173160	3175160	This place
3175160	3177160	What is its composition
3177160	3179160	Correct
3179160	3181160	No need for destructive things
3181160	3183160	I am not
3183160	3185160	I don't know much about the atomic clock
3185160	3187160	But I think if
3187160	3189160	If there is such a way
3189160	3191160	If you can see
3191160	3193160	Everyone should have used it long ago
3193160	3195160	So I think he should have his limits
3195160	3197160	Because there are actually a lot of
3197160	3199160	Battery
3199160	3201160	Battery
3201160	3203160	I forgot how to say
3203160	3205160	Some ways to use batteries
3205160	3207160	Very local
3207160	3209160	But it is very limited
3209160	3211160	It is limited to
3211160	3213160	The range of your ears
3213160	3215160	If your ears are small
3215160	3217160	You want to see such a small structure
3217160	3219160	But you can only see about 1-2 meters deep
3219160	3221160	But if you want to see
3221160	3223160	Big structure
3223160	3225160	If you want to look deeper
3225160	3227160	Left and right
3227160	3229160	Lateral extension
3229160	3231160	Can't see a few meters
3231160	3233160	This kind of thing
3233160	3235160	So I think every one
3235160	3237160	We all use this kind of indirect
3237160	3239160	More indirect method
3239160	3241160	This method has its own limits
3241160	3243160	So I don't know the atomic clock
3243160	3245160	But I think he must use his limits
3245160	3247160	Otherwise, everyone has used it long ago
3247160	3249160	Because the atomic clock is still
3249160	3251160	A very big country
3251160	3253160	A plan to find a way to build
3253160	3255160	Because he is
3255160	3257160	Probably only the United States, Japan
3257160	3259160	France
3259160	3261160	I'm doing these things
3261160	3263160	So I don't know
3263160	3265160	Maybe it's very expensive
3265160	3267160	But I heard before
3267160	3269160	I heard before
3269160	3271160	There is a private company
3271160	3273160	Sponsor a laboratory
3273160	3275160	Their publication
3275160	3277160	Will not be put on the table
3277160	3279160	But there is a private company
3279160	3281160	To pay for their research
3281160	3283160	So I guess the cost
3283160	3285160	May be a lot
3285160	3287160	That's about it
3287160	3289160	But the oil industry is super poor now
3289160	3291160	We are almost out of work now
3291160	3293160	So I don't know
3293160	3295160	Maybe it's hard to pay
3295160	3297160	Now the oil is super cheap
3299160	3301160	Thank you
3301160	3303160	But it's a very good proposal
3303160	3305160	Actually, I don't know much about it
3311160	3313160	Does anyone else have any questions?
3319160	3321160	Let me ask a question
3321160	3323160	Just
3323160	3325160	Because we just saw all the data
3325160	3327160	It's all in the real world
3327160	3329160	The horizontal axis is the real time
3329160	3331160	Then the vertical axis is your
3331160	3333160	But you are
3333160	3335160	Under such data
3335160	3337160	You just actually emphasized
3337160	3339160	Most of the time
3339160	3341160	The time to trigger
3341160	3343160	No matter when you assume
3343160	3345160	Or the real time
3345160	3347160	Then you calculate the time
3347160	3349160	My first question is
3349160	3351160	Then you said cross correlation
3351160	3353160	Can remove a lot of
3353160	3355160	Uncorrelated background
3355160	3357160	If you look at
3357160	3359160	Amplitude, will there be any new
3359160	3361160	Information or better resolution
3361160	3363160	This is the first
3363160	3365160	The second is that since you want to do
3365160	3367160	Cross correlation
3367160	3369160	You plug that
3369160	3371160	The position of the measuring instrument
3371160	3373160	Shouldn't it be
3373160	3375160	Very strict and uniform
3375160	3377160	But I think you seem to be
3377160	3379160	A little bit along the way
3379160	3381160	Is it okay?
3385160	3387160	Let's talk about the first government
3387160	3389160	Government
3389160	3391160	This is a very good
3391160	3393160	Good question
3393160	3395160	Generally speaking, we are
3395160	3397160	It's easy to come up with
3397160	3399160	Is the time difference
3399160	3401160	This message
3401160	3403160	In the most traditional earthquake
3403160	3405160	Because of the relationship
3405160	3407160	Or because of a lot of uncertainty
3407160	3409160	For example, your earthquake
3409160	3411160	For example, you have a small one here
3411160	3413160	Earthquake, it will decline
3413160	3415160	But not just because of the distance
3415160	3417160	It's because of what you've been through
3417160	3419160	Or is there anything next to you
3419160	3421160	Influence its transmission
3421160	3423160	These will affect the government
3423160	3425160	So the first one is traditional
3425160	3427160	Or what I'm talking about now
3427160	3429160	I'm talking about this result today
3429160	3431160	It doesn't include government information
3431160	3433160	Second, if the government
3433160	3435160	The message is to be applied here
3435160	3437160	It will be relatively difficult
3437160	3439160	But we're doing it now
3439160	3441160	Because it's not just one
3441160	3443160	There are a lot of features here
3443160	3445160	That every feature
3445160	3447160	For example, like this station
3447160	3449160	There is a very strong pool nearby
3449160	3451160	It gives it a lot of energy
3451160	3453160	For government information
3453160	3455160	If you look at the whole area
3455160	3457160	Then it will be a lot of
3457160	3459160	Localized government
3459160	3461160	But for cross-referencing
3461160	3463160	We're promoting now
3463160	3465160	There are a lot of people
3465160	3467160	Trying to include
3467160	3469160	The so-called government
3469160	3471160	But you have to be sure
3471160	3473160	It's a real signal
3473160	3475160	It's not a lot of
3475160	3477160	Localized artifacts
3477160	3479160	Then
3479160	3481160	We're going to do it again
3483160	3485160	What's the second question
3485160	3487160	My second question is
3487160	3489160	You're in this station
3489160	3491160	It's basically saying
3491160	3493160	Is there any limit
3493160	3495160	Because I think this position
3495160	3497160	Is there an average
3497160	3499160	It should affect you
3499160	3501160	Cross-correlation structure
3501160	3503160	You're talking about
3503160	3505160	You said
3505160	3507160	The address conditions below
3507160	3509160	It's just that
3509160	3511160	The distance between the station and the station
3511160	3513160	Need to be even
3513160	3515160	My idea is
3515160	3517160	Between your station and station
3517160	3519160	To be on this projection
3519160	3521160	It should be very even
3521160	3523160	Then you will
3523160	3525160	You're going to be
3525160	3527160	The result of your cross-correlation
3527160	3529160	You can make it lower
3529160	3531160	I think I don't know
3533160	3535160	That if you want
3535160	3537160	If you want to do
3537160	3539160	If you want to do
3539160	3541160	If you want to do
3541160	3543160	Of course it's very
3543160	3545160	Very very complete
3545160	3547160	But if you're really going to
3547160	3549160	It's almost impossible
3549160	3551160	It's almost impossible
3551160	3553160	But of course it's more
3553160	3555160	The more complete the better
3555160	3557160	I think we've done our best
3557160	3559160	And he doesn't allow us to go
3559160	3561160	He doesn't allow us to go
3561160	3563160	We can't leave this path
3563160	3565160	You can only be next to the path
3565160	3567160	So this is already the best
3567160	3569160	And then
3569160	3571160	Will there be a systematic effect
3571160	3573160	I think it will
3573160	3575160	But if
3575160	3577160	It depends on your size
3577160	3579160	For example, we want to look at
3579160	3581160	A relatively large structure
3581160	3583160	Our structure is here
3583160	3585160	Between your station and station
3585160	3587160	These are a little uneven
3587160	3589160	The relative error is actually for this structure
3589160	3591160	It's more minor
3591160	3593160	So when we're doing
3593160	3595160	Any research
3595160	3597160	We have to think about the first
3597160	3599160	The second one is between our station and station
3599160	3601160	Is the distance suitable
3601160	3603160	To explain something like that
3603160	3605160	So
3605160	3607160	That's about it
3607160	3609160	And then the government
3609160	3611160	This question is very good
3611160	3613160	But I'm still doing it
3613160	3615160	But of course I want to have government information
3615160	3617160	But because it's going to be too much
