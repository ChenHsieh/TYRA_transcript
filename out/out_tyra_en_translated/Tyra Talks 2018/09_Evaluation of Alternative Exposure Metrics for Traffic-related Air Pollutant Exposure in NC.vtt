00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Hi everyone, welcome to this week's TARA Talk.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
The title of today's talk is

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
The Evaluation of Alternative Exposure Metrics

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
for Traffic-Related Air Pollutant Exposure

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
in North Carolina.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Let's welcome our speaker today,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Zhang Shiying, or you can call her Zhang-C.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Let's briefly introduce the speaker's information.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
She's currently working at Sonoma Technology,

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
a company that specializes in this area.

00:34.000 --> 00:41.000
She did her Ph.D. at UNC-North Carolina-Champaign Hill.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Before coming to the United States,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
she was a master's student at the University of Texas,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
then a master's student at the University of Texas,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
then a master's student at the University of Texas.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
She's currently working on a topic that's closely related to her research.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Let's welcome our speaker, Zhang Shiying.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Hi everyone.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Before I start, I want to show you my T-shirt.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I won last year.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
My name is Zhang Shiying.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You can call me Zhang-C.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Today's topic is

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
how to use air quality models or model-based methods

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
to assess human exposure to air pollution.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm going to focus on the traffic pollutants.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
A few days ago, the host asked me to talk about

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
the related issues of air pollution.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
But because our company has a strict process

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
of reviewing things and publications,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I didn't have time to make a new video.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
So I'm going to talk about my last year's video.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
This photo was taken in the United States in 1948.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Why is air pollution important?

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
This photo was taken in a small town in Pennsylvania in 1948

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
called Donora.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
The photo on the right was taken at noon.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
You can see that it wasn't bad weather or raining that day.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
No, it was a normal noon.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
The streetlights were all on and the sky looked dark.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Air pollution was very serious at that time.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
After that incident,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
40 people died in the town.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
50% of the residents suffered from

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
People said that it was very difficult to breathe at that time.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
This incident caused a lot of resonance in the United States.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
People said that air pollution was very serious.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
After that incident,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
there were a lot of social movements,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
protests, and government measures.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Finally, in 1967,

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
the United States passed the Clean Air Act,

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
which is the most important law in the United States.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
The Clean Air Act was finally passed,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
and control began.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Was it useful?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
The answer is yes.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Let's take a look at this picture.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
The word may be too small to see clearly,

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
but it doesn't matter.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
This is basically the annual air pollution concentration.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
This is a measured situation.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I remember I took this.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It should be LA.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
Each line represents a different city or county.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
You can see this trend.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Every year, air pollution is decreasing.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
So it's actually useful.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Since air pollution has decreased,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
what are we doing to study air pollution?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
It's already so low.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
What are we doing here?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
The two most important things now

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
are not only in the United States,

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
but also in the world.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
The two most important air pollutants are

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
1. Smelly sheep

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
2. PM2.5

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
PM2.5 is called a particulate matter

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I won't go into detail.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
But basically,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
smelly sheep is not directly released.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
You won't have something that says it's smelly sheep.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
It won't be like that.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
The formation of smelly sheep is secondary.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
In other words, it's not a smelly sheep gas.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
These gases become smelly sheep

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
after chemical reactions in the air.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
These gases that are released

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
may not be so harmful to the human body.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
But after it's released,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
it becomes smelly sheep

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and is very harmful to the human body.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
PM2.5 is simply a very, very small particle.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
This is a strand of hair.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
We all love to use this picture.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
This is a strand of hair.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
PM10 is a diameter smaller than 10 micrograms.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
It's about this big.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
It's a blue circle.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
PM2.5 is this small.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
What does being small have to do with it?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Being small means that it's easy to pass through your respiratory tract.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It can go deeper.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It can go into the lungs.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
It will cause respiratory diseases

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
and even cardiovascular diseases.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Let's skip this one first.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
This is a study

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
that has been very active in recent years

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
called Global Burden of Disease.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
They publish every year

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
the current ranking of causes of death

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
and how many people die.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Why is air pollution important?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
After the Clean Air Act,

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
the concentration of pollutants decreased every year.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But if you look at the whole world,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
the cause of death from air pollution

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
is ranked fourth in the world.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
Air pollution is very, very, very important.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
This is a paper from Nature in 2015.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
They divided the world into countries

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
and gave the most serious air pollution

06:21.000 --> 06:29.000
emission sector.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
They predicted how many emission sectors

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
would cause death.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So if you look at this table,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
there are different pollutants in the horizontal axis.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
For example, we have residential energy.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Air pollution caused by using energy.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Agriculture causes air pollution.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Land traffic causes air pollution.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
You can see the two red boxes,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
USA and Germany.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
These two countries

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
cause the most death

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
in the traffic sector.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
These are some introductions.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
What am I going to talk about today?

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
This paper was published in 2015.

07:18.000 --> 07:31.000
In terms of environmental epidemiology,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
it is important to look at the relationship

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
between diseases and air pollution.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
You want to use air pollution variability

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
to explain whether there is a disease

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
or whether there is a disease.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
In this case,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
if there are 10 people today,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
5 people have respiratory diseases,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
5 people do not.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I wonder if this is related to air pollution.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
When I was doing this statistical model,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I found that these 10 people

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
were exposed to the same amount of air pollution.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
For example, they were all exposed to

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
At this time,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
the model can't see anything.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
5 people are sick, 5 people are not sick,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
but everyone is exposed to the same amount of air pollution.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
This means that you can't do anything.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
This paper talks about

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
the past epidemiological studies,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
the past studies that link diseases

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
and air pollution.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
What can be improved?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
This slide has a lot of words.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Basically, the most important thing is

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
the Health Effect Institute.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
This is a 2009 paper.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
The Health Effect Institute

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
is a very famous institution

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
that studies health effects.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
They use data from the American Cancer Society

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
to re-analyze and link

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
the relationship between air pollution and death.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
As I said before,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
when you do this,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
you need to have all the information

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
about whether you are sick or not.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Secondly, you need to have data

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
about the exposure of air pollution.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
How do they do the air pollution exposure data?

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
Basically, they do it in this area.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Let me translate it for you.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
They have a monitoring station

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
set up by the U.S. Department of Environment

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
in the United States.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
They have a station on both sides,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
an air pollution station.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Their approach is

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
for example,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
in San Francisco,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I have 10 stations.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I collect the data of these 10 stations

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
and calculate the average.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
I say that everyone living in San Francisco

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
has the same air pollution exposure.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
That is to say,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
everyone living in San Francisco

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
has the same air pollution exposure.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
This is the same as what I just said.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
For example,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
everyone lives in San Francisco.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Some people are sick.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Some people are not sick.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
When I do this epidemiological analysis,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I tell my models that

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
whether they are sick or not,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
as long as they live in San Francisco,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
their exposure is this high.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
At this time,

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
you can see that

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
there seems to be a problem.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Another question is

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
that the U.S. Department of Environment

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
set up these stations in the United States

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
to measure air pollution.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
However,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
many air pollution is not regional.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It does not mean that

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
a station can represent

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
the concentration of pollutants in the entire area.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
The table I listed here

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
is the distance from the road.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
The unit is meters.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
The axis is normalized to roadside.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
That is to say,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
the concentration of air pollution

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
is standardized,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
which is the concentration of two roads on the roadside.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
On the left side of the table,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
you can see that

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
so many pollutants

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
actually have a very steep gradient.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
That is to say,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
between 100 and 150 meters,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
the concentration has dropped by almost 60%.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
That is to say,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
the road distance is only a few meters.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
There is such a difference in concentration

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
within 100 meters.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Can you see such a difference

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
in concentration

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
in a station

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
in a certain corner of the city?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
You can't see it.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
The first one,

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
you use that kind of station

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
to represent exposure,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
the exposure of human body to pollution.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
You may not be able to catch

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
the hot spot in the urban.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Hello, I have a question.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Please go ahead.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
The first one,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
the horizontal axis is the distance,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
and the vertical axis is the concentration.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
In the first few meters,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
their gradient looks almost the same.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
But you have,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
for example, CO, CON,

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
and NO, NO, and N.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Don't they have a lot of difference in their atomic mass?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
If I take one,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I think it's just an expansion.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Shouldn't the gradient be a lot different?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Because there is still a chemical reaction.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
CO may not have much reaction.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
NO and NOX may have chemical reactions.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
It will generate other things.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
So it may laugh faster,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
laugh slower, not necessarily.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
OK, OK.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Maybe it's all gas.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Even particles are different.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Particles may have

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
some different characteristics.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
I want to add that

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
you have to consider the gradient.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
So,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
there is a physical problem.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
So there is a chemical process.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
That's right.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
OK.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
OK.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
We just talked about outdoor.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
For example,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
you use outdoor,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
you use the concentration of the side station beam

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
to represent the pollution source.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
First, you can't catch the hot spot.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Like this kind of traffic pollution source.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
If someone lives,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
if someone's house is close to the road,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
you can't catch it.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
But if it's far away,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
you can't catch it.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Second,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
in fact,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
most people

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
spend more time indoors

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
than they spend outdoors.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
This is a...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It should be a Canadian study.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
They looked at

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
how much time

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
children spend

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
indoors or outdoors.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I used the two red boxes.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
You can see

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
one is in winter,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
one is in summer.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
In indoor time,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
67% in winter,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
72% in summer.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
It means that

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
most people

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
spend more time indoors

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
than they spend outdoors.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
At this time,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
you use outdoor pollutants

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
to represent...

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
The concentration of the beam

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
to represent human exposure

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
may also be a problem

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
because everyone is indoors.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Right?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
So that's why

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
there is this paper.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
The first one is

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Central Sites.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Central Sites

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
means

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
those

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
U.S. environmental protection agencies.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
They can't catch

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
these local sources.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Local sources can be

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
traffic

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
or any

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
small sources

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
next to your house.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
They may not be able to...

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
The second one is

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
using outdoor air pollution

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
to represent exposure

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
may not be very representative

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
because most people are indoors.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
In theory,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
you should use indoor air pollution

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
to represent exposure.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
The goal of this paper

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
is to use model-based...

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
That is to say,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
use model-based methods

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
to predict...

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
to estimate

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
the intensity of indoor and outdoor

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
and use them

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
to represent human exposure

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
to see

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
how different they are.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
We can quantify

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
these potential exposure errors

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
This is the model I used.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
The three yellow boxes

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
are STOKE, STOK, R-Line,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
and LBL AR models.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
These three are models.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
STOKE stands for

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Spacetime Ordinary Crating.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
It represents...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
It's actually

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
an internal and external

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
technology.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
That technology

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
uses...

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Its input data

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
is the data

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
from these environmental protection agencies.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
We use that data

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
to push it inwards and outwards

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
to the census block level.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Census block is...

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Imagine...

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
It's a block.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
When you're walking,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
there's a block on the road.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
It could be a block.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So we push those intensities

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
inwards and outwards

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
to these block levels.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
This represents

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
a background level.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
I use the data

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
from the Central Monitoring Site

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
to push it inwards and outwards

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
to these places.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
But it could miss

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
these local sources,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
such as traffic.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
R-Line is a line source

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
dispersion model.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
It's used to predict

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
traffic-related pollution.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
It basically

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
takes all roads

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
as a line.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
It uses

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
a simple

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
high-definition

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
method

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
to model

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
traffic pollution.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It represents local source.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
We define local source

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
as traffic pollution.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
The last LVL-AR model

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
is Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Air Exchange Rate Model.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
It's used to

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
predict air exchange rate,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
which is the air exchange rate

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
for each household.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
For example,

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
how long

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
will the air

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
in your house

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
be exchanged

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
with the air outside?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Using these three models

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
and combining them,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
we can calculate

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
the six blue boxes.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
These six boxes

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
represent

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
exposure.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
We call it

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
exposure metric.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
We use these six boxes

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
to represent

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
air exposure.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
What are they?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
The first one is

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
outdoor stoke,

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
which is

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
outdoor air exposure.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's called stoke.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
It represents background.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Remember,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
the source of this thing

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
is Central Monitoring Site,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
which is

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
the U.S. Department of Environment.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
The second one is

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
outdoor on-road.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
It represents

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
air pollution

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
caused by

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
traffic.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
It's modeled

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
by R-Line.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Combining these two things,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
outdoor stoke

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
represents background

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
because it can't

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
capture local source.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
If you add these two things,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
you get total exposure.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
We call it

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
outdoor hybrid,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
which is hybrid between

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
R-Line and stoke.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
These three things

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
represent

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
outdoor concentration.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Using these three

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
outdoor concentrations

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
as a base,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
we can combine

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
the air exchange rate.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
The air exchange rate

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
from the LBL

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
air exchange rate model

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
on the left

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
can be used

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
to calculate

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
the corresponding

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
indoor concentration.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
We use outdoor concentration

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
to calculate

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
indoor concentration.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
We have

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
three other metrics,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
indoor on-road,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
indoor stoke,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
and indoor hybrid.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
There are six metrics in total.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I have a question.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Go ahead.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Do you consider

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
opening and closing

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
the window

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
or just

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
looking at

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
the exchange rate

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
under the air condition?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
You'll see it later.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
We'll talk about it later.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
We'll talk about it later.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
This slide

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
is about R-Line.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
R-Line is a dispersion model.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You have to use R-Line.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
In any air pollution model,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
the most important thing

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
is emission.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
This slide talks about

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
how emission is calculated

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and where the data comes from.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
This is not

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
too important

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
to everyone.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Let's not talk about it.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
This is stoke.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's the same as what I just said.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
It is an

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
internal and external

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
critting technology.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
It uses

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
the U.S. Environmental Protection

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Air Quality System,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
or AQS,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
which is

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
the big test stations.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Finally,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
these two things are added up.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
This is

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
how to calculate

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
the corresponding

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
indoor concentration

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
of the outdoor concentration.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
This is a very simple

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
mass balance model.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
The internal

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
concentration

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
and time change

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
are determined by these terms.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The first is

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
the outdoor concentration

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
brought in by the

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
air exchange

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and the

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
internal concentration

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
of the outdoor pollution.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
This includes

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
deposition,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
which is the rate

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
of indoor air

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
being excreted.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Here are some factors.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
The penetration factor

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
is the rate of

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
incoming air.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
The deposition rate

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
is the rate of

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
incoming air.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The penetration rate

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
is 1.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
The deposition rate

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
is 0.5 per hour.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
The PEM

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
is the rate

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
of incoming air.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The particle

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
is lower

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and the deposition rate

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
is lower.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
This is

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
the question

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
from the instructor.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
AER model

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
is to calculate

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
the window.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
The answer is no.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
This study

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
is at the census block level.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I remember

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
there are

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
330,000 houses

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
in this area.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
In theory,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
if you want to use

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
the model,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
including the window

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
and air conditioning,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
you won't have the data.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Because I can't go to

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
330,000 houses

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
one by one

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
without the data.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
So we need the simplest

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
model.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
We don't even consider

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
where the house is.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
What is the air exchange rate?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I won't

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
explain the model

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
in detail.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
All the parameters,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
such as how many years

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
the house has been built,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
how big the floor area is,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
you need this model.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
In the past,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
this model was used

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
to look at 10 or 15 houses.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
But now

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I need to look at 330,000 houses.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I can't do that.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
So I need to look for the data.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I use the County Property Assessment Record.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I can have

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
the data

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
for each house.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
This is free

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
in North Carolina.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
It's expensive in California.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I'll give you $100.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I won't explain

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
the rest of the data.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
It's basically public available data.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
There's one thing here.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
For each census block,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I sample

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
about 10 houses.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I use the 10 houses

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
to represent the census block.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I don't just make 330,000 houses

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
and make them all.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
This is my modeling domain.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
These three counties

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
in North Carolina.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Orange County is where UNC is.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I used to live here.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Durham is where

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Duke University is.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Don't go there.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
This is

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
a snapshot.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I use

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
the six exposure metrics

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I mentioned earlier.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
This is the map.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
It's shown here.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
A is the Outdoor Stoke.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It uses

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
the data from the station.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
B is Outdoor Hybrid.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It uses R-Line,

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
the traffic source,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
and the background,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
the interpolation

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
data.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
The two below

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
represent

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
the air quality field

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
in the simple

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
indoor mass balance model.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Let's look at the Outdoor Stoke

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
in the upper left corner.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Most of the concentration

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
is between

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
24 and 27.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
There's no spatial

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
variation.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
That's it.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I remember

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
there are only

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
two or three stations

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
in this area.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
If you have two or three stations

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
with interpolation data,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
you can only achieve

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
this much.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Let's look at the Outdoor Hybrid.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
If you add the local source

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
data,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
you can see

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
the map

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
of air pollution.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
You can tell

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
the difference.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Let's look at

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
C, the Indoor Stoke.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
The station

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
is a transportation source.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
There are different types of stations.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Some are in the background,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
such as National Park.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Some are near the traffic.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
That's right.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
We chose the background station

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
for this study.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
We didn't use urban stations

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
for this study.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Did you use

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
the transportation model

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
of R-Line?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Yes, I did.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I gave the model evaluation

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
in my last talk.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Thank you.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Let's look at

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Indoor Stoke.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
A is the input of C.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
C and A

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
are compared.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
First,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
the color scale is lower.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Second,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
there are more spatial variations.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
The concentration

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
of C is between

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
7 and 14.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Compared to

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
the Outdoor Stoke,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
it's between 24 and 27.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Where do these spatial variations

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
come from?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
They come from

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
the air exchange rate

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
of different stations.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
What does this mean?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It means that

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
if you only use the Outdoor Stoke,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
which is what they did,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
they used that method

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
to predict

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
the exposure.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
They used that method

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
to estimate the exposure.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
On the right,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
you can see

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
the concentration of local source.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
On the bottom,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
you can see the map

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
of the Indoor Stoke.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You can tell the difference

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
just by looking at the map.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
The last one,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
D, is the Indoor Stoke.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
The input source is B.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
B to D.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
You can see

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
the variations are the same.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
High concentration

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
near the road,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
low concentration far from the road.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
However, the concentration

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
on the top

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
is between 90 and 100.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
On the bottom,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
it's less than that.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
When you go to the Indoor Stoke,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
the absolute concentration

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
will decrease.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Here,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I'm looking at...

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Hello.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I have a small question

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
about the front page.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
This is basically a 2D model,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
right?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
You can also

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
make it vertical.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
You can have different heights.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Mine is 2 meters

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
away from the ground.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
2 meters away from the ground.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I'm just curious.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Is the terrain near here flat?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Or is there a hill?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
This area is quite flat.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
This area is quite flat.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It's a hill to the west.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It's quite flat here.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Here,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I'm using a box plot

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
to show

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
the average concentration.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
The concentration distribution

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
by pollutant.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I forgot

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
what I was going to say.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Let's start with CO.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Let's start with A.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
If we only look at...

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Let's compare

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
the black and white boxes.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
The black represents

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
the outdoor concentration.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
The white represents

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
the indoor concentration.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
You can see that

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
CO is about the same.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Look at Stokes.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Outdoor and indoor

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
have similar distribution.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Why is it similar?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It's because

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
the penetration factor

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
and deposition factor

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
of CO is 1.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
The deposition rate

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
of CO is 0.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
That's why the indoor and outdoor

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
have similar distribution.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Look at Knox.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
The penetration factor is 1,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
but the deposition rate is 0.5.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
You can see that

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
the indoor concentration is lower

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
than the outdoor concentration.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It's about half.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
In the same situation,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
PM and EC

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
have similar distribution.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
The indoor concentration is half

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
If the outdoor concentration

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
represents the deposition rate,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
the PM will stay in the indoor

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
for longer than the deposition rate.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
After comparing the black and white boxes,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
let's compare

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Stokes and Unrow.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Stokes and Unrow.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
The two black and white boxes

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
on the left

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and the two black and white boxes

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
on the middle.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
First, look at

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
CO and Knox.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
CO and Knox.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
You can see that

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Stokes is much higher than Unrow

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
in terms of CO.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Knox is closer.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Why?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Because of traffic pollution,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
the deposition rate of

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
gas cars is very high.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I don't have the table here,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
but I remember

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
that in some places,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
the deposition rate of gas cars

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
may be up to 40%,

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
which means

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
because gas cars

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
deposit a lot of pollutants,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
the deposition rate of gas cars

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
is relatively high.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
In particular,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
the deposition rate of Stokes and Unrow

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
is actually very low,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
because the deposition rate

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
of primary PM2

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
is only up to 5%.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
is only up to 5%.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
However,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
the deposition rate of EC

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
is smaller.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
This is the consequence of

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
the combustion of PM2.5.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Because of the combustion of engines,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
it will burn slightly higher.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Here I am looking at

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
the spatial variation

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
after talking about density.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I have calculated

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
a value of

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
spatial coefficient

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
of variation.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
The higher the value

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
of spatial coefficient,

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
the higher the value of

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
spatial variation.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
What we want to see

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
is whether these things

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
represent exposure.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Most people

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
use Stoke's

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
outdoor concentration

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
to represent

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
exposure.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
The black box

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
on the far left

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
is Stoke's

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
indoor concentration.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
For example,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Stoke's

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
spatial variation

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
is very low.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
The white box

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
on the far right

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
is Stoke's

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
indoor spatial variation.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Why?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Because I have added

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
the air exchange rate

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
spatial variation.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
If you replace

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
the air with air,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
you get

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
spatial variation.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
There is a

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
method to

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
classify

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
exposure in

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
epidemiology.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Sometimes we do not

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
use absolute density

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
such as 50mcg per cubic meter

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
to represent exposure.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Sometimes we just

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
classify it.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
For example,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
the low-middle-high

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
group may only expose

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
0-2mcg.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
The middle group

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
may expose 2-4mcg.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
The high-middle-high

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
group may expose 4-8mcg.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
I do the same thing here.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I divide the six

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
exposure metrics

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
into five groups,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
0-20%,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
20-40,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
and 50-60.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
The first group

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
is the indoor

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
hybrid-based exposure.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
The second group

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
is the

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
indoor hybrid-based

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
exposure.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
The first group

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
is the

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
indoor hybrid-based

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
exposure.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
The second group

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
is the

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
indoor hybrid-based

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
exposure.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Let's compare

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
the outdoor hybrid-based

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
and the indoor hybrid-based.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The red line

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
represents

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
the

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
agreement

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
between

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
the two groups.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
The higher the number,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
the more agreeable

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
the agreement is.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
For example,

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
the 0-20% group

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
is the hybrid-based

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
indoor group.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
The outdoor hybrid-based

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
group

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
represents

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
50%,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
49.22% of the

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
exposure.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
The hybrid-based

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
group

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
represents

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
50% of the

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
exposure.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
The highest group

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
represents

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
73%,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
which is

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
the NOx group.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The NOx group

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
is the

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
on-road source.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
The NOx group

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
is the

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
on-road source.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Your analysis unit

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
is the sensor's track.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
No, the sensor's block.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
What about your spatial resolution?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Your model could be run hourly.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I mean

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
you have

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
a sensor track

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
with hourly data.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Did your contingency

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
match the group?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Is the sensor's track

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
hourly data?

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
No, I remember

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I used annual average.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
This should be only annual average.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
This is not hourly data.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
I used sensor's block,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
not sensor's track.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Sensor's track has a lot of blocks.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Let's take a look

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
at the worst case.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I remember

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
outdoor stock

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
is widely used

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
in popular

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
epidemiological research.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Compare to

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
hybrid-based indoor,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
the red line

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
is

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
25.54%.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
It means

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
you could have

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
such a big exposure error.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Why?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
First, you didn't consider local source.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Second, you didn't consider

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
indoor concentration.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
We talked about this.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
The surprising thing

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
about this analysis unit

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
is that when you use

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
indoor on-road concentration,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
the performance is good.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Remember that

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
indoor on-road concentration

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
is only for on-road.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
It doesn't consider background level.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Why?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Because

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
a large part of NOx

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
comes from gas engine.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
It also controls

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
spatially.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
When you only use this unit,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
you can see

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
the high concentration of on-road

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
and the low concentration of off-road.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
As long as you can capture this,

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
you can capture

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
most of

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
the high concentration.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
It also considers

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
indoor concentration.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It uses air exchange rate

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
to reflect

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
the air exchange rate

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
between each house.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
The performance is good.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
The highest group can reach 89%.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Here, I'm showing

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
a similar situation.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I use hybrid.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
You can see

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
the area is blank.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Because this is

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
the answer.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Other things

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
cut out the answer.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
It becomes a box.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Each box

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
represents

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
when you use

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
a specific exposure metric

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
to represent exposure,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
what is the error?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Let's see

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
the most widely used

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
exposure metric,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Stoke Outdoor Concentration.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
You can see

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
the normalized difference

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
is very high.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
The average of NOx

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
is about 80-90%.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
The conclusion is

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
that

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
it's complicated.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
There are many

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
different analysis and pollution.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
The pollution

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
and traffic

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
are different.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Bear with me.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Basically,

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
CO and PN2.5

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
traffic

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
is lower.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
14% and 6%.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
NOx and ECO

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
are higher.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
40% and 44%.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
When you use

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
the indoor infiltration model,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
the indoor concentration

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
is about 60% of

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
the outdoor concentration.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It will be reduced by 40%.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
When you use the outdoor concentration

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
to represent the exposure,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
it's not right.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
The concentration is not that high.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
The exposure is not that high.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Okay.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It's too complicated.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
This is my

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
acknowledgment.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I used to work at UNC.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
The funding source is

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
EPA's contract.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
EPA provides emissions

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
and meteorological data.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It's not on the slide.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
This is a reference.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
That's it.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Thank you.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Thank you.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Do you have

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
any questions?

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I don't think so.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Yay!

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
On Saturday afternoon,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
stay healthy.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Don't be so academic.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
This is interesting.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
You can see it with R-Line.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
For example,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
why is there a basketball court?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
When I started

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
doing this,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
especially after I moved here,

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
the Golden Gate Bridge

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
next to San Francisco

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
is a place

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
for jogging and cycling.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
There are six lanes.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
There are three lanes

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
on each side.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Normally, cars drive very slowly.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
In terms of emissions,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
the slower the car drives,

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
the higher the emissions.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
People jogging and cycling

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
are enjoying

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
the air pollution.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
My idea is

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
if you move

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
the basketball court

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
to the middle,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
you can save

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
a lot of energy.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
That's it.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Is there a way

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
to do it in Taiwan?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I have a question.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Please go ahead.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
The question is

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
if you look at

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
the road emission data,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
you won't stand

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
next to the road

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
and check

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
if every car

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
is a Tesla

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
or a diesel car.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
However,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
there is a free parameter.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
If all the cars

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
are Tesla,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
half Tesla, half pickup,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
and all are big trucks,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
how much improvement

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
can be made?

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Is there a way

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
to justify

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
how much

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
public sector resources

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
are needed

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
to change the air quality

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
in a static way?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
That's a very important point.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
It's called fleet distribution.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
When we talk about

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
traffic pollution,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
a very important parameter

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
is fleet distribution.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Is there a difference

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
between fleet distribution

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
and model distribution?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
The difference is

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
that we use

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
MOOVS,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
In terms of models,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
we use MOOVS.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
In terms of models,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
you can tell MOOVS

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
that if half of

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
the fleet distribution

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
is electric vehicles

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
and half is diesel cars,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
you can do it

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
in terms of models.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
But if you want

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
to block a street

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and make the entire fleet

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
50% Tesla,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
it's a bit difficult.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
You made a very good point.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I don't remember

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
having seen

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
a similar study

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
in fleet distribution.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Have you seen a similar study,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
coach?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
He's probably taking care of the kids.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I don't remember

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
having seen a similar study

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
where we changed the fleet distribution

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and changed it to electric vehicles.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I haven't seen such a study.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Thank you.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I have a question.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I'm a bit curious.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
When I first saw this topic,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I thought it was very interesting.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Why did you choose that place?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I looked it up on the Internet.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
North Carolina

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
seems to have more

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
air pollution.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
This area is

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
the NC Piedmont region.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
There are four areas in North Carolina.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Coastline,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Piedmont, Mountain,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and I forgot the other one.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Piedmont is like a triangle.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
This area is an RTP area,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
so the air pollution

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
is a bit more severe.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Another reason

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
why I chose these three counties

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
is because we had a project

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
with the EPA.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
They wanted to use

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
the metrics I just mentioned

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
to do their epidemiological research.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
They did a study

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
on heart disease

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
and wanted to use

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
air pollution data.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
We had a contract

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
with the EPA

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
to do this research.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
When I talked to them last time,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
they said they were already

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
writing a paper.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
I don't know where it went.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So the research you did

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
in this area

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
is quite valuable, right?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Because the EPA

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
is located there.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
The EPA's R&D office

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
is located there.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
A lot of research

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
is done there.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Yesterday,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
a few people from UNC

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
came to the lab.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I asked them,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I heard the air pollution

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
in UNC is quite severe.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
They were surprised.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I said, really?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
The air there is much better than California.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I said it's severe

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
compared to

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
North Carolina.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Even in Piedmont,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
although it's a severe area,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
it's still very low.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Okay.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
North Carolina is a very clean area.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
The population of North Carolina

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
is only 9 million,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
which is four times the population of Taiwan.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
In South California,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
the population of

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
one county is 20 million.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Yes.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
So I believe

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
air pollution is more severe.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Yes.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
In California,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
there are a lot of

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
near-road studies

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
and children's health studies.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
A lot of those papers

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
are done by our company's

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
senior scientists.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
They do a lot of research

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
in LA.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
The first project

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I joined our company on

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
was to use R-Line

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
to predict the air flow

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
of children

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
because of air pollution.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
The system

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
is also

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
targeted at

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
the entire South Coast

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
area.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
The entire South Coast area.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
That area is

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
well-known

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
for air pollution.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
Actually,

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
in Joe's

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
presentation,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
I think

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
this is

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
a newspaper

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
from the 1970s.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
This is

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
the Los Angeles Times.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
It's an LA newspaper

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
from that time.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
At that time,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
they talked about

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
the problem of

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
bad oxygen.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I remember

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
they said

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
bad oxygen can reach

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
70 ppb.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
That's high.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It can reach 700 ppb

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
at that time.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Some of our senior scientists

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
lived in LA when they were young

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
and they said

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
standing outside

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
can make you cry.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
That's an older magnitude difference.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
It's very exaggerated.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
LA is a basin.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
It's an air basin.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The air quality

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
is relatively stable.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Air pollution can't escape.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Thank you for your answer.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I want to ask

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
if there are any other questions.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
If not,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
let me promote Taira.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Got it?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I want to

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
simply say

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
that

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Do you have a question?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
No.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
OK.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You know what I'm doing.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Let me...

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Right.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Let me talk about it.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Basically,

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
many epidemiologists

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and epidemiologists

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
make

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
underestimated responses.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
The main reason is

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
from an economic point of view,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
when you know

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
the air quality is bad,

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
you optimize your behavior.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
So,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
acute hospital admission

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
or all the endpoints

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
are the results

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
after people optimize their behavior.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
So,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
for example, ozone,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
CO,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
you may not see anything

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
in low concentration.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
But in fact,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
it's gone.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
So,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
from an economic

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
and epidemiological

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
point of view,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
it's a big difference.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
When the air quality is bad,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
you can choose

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
a different transportation mode.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
For example,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
in Taiwan,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
you ride a scooter,

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
but if the air quality is bad,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
you ride a bus.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
So,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
it has nothing to do

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
with today's topic.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Interesting.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
So, what's your name?

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Yi.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Yi Xu.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I'd like to ask

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
if you work on energy policy.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Yes, I do.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I have an article

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
about Taipei Metro

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
and air pollution.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
In the U.S.,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
for example,

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
when the Energy Bureau

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
wants to change

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
their policy,

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
do they refer to

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
researchers or companies?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Or do they take an average?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
No,

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
policy set up is basically

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
a political negotiation process.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
For example,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
in California,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
renewable energy

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
will be 50% in 2030.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
So,

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
the government's policy

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
will be like this.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
The next step is

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
to hand it over to California

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Air Resources Board

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
or other government agencies

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
to implement.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
under my overall policy

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
target,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
how do I use

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
economic instruments?

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
For example,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I can force companies

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
to use renewable energy.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
So,

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
our target is to

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
come up with a way

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
to use market instruments.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
For example,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I can close subsidy

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
renewable energy

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
from the fossil fuel

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
or dirty energy.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
In this way,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
those firms

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
will endogenous

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
and use market

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
to achieve the result.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I think policy is important

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
for researchers.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
For example,

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
I'm doing CO2 reduction here.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
So,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
our institute's funding source

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
is based on the government's policy.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
For example,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
if Trump doesn't support

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
energy,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
we will be worried.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Will you be fired?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I don't think so.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
But others are worried

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
about our institute.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
Our institute is not only in Caltech,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
but also in Stanford and Berkeley.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
So,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
everyone is worried about it.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
But now,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
it seems to be guaranteed

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
to be implemented in 2020.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
So,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
except Trump,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
everyone else is supportive.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I think it's impossible in California.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
Our institute is a pioneer

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
in environmental policy.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
So,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
even if the government's funding

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
is not enough,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
we have a lot of state funding.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Thank you for your comment.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
I think it's interesting.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
I'll send you an email later.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I think we can work together.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Let me interrupt.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
As I mentioned,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I'm a policy designer.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
If I'm not mistaken,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
next week's talk

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
is about economics.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
The speaker will talk about

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
mechanical design.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
It's not specific

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
about energy

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
or energy policy design.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
But it's about

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
mechanical design itself

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
from an economic perspective.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I just realized it's related to

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
what you just discussed.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Yixu,

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
we can keep in touch.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
You should have it.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
I'm in control of everything.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Okay.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
I'm just cyber-stalking you

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
right now.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Please.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I already have Zhang Xi.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I can stalk others.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Keep tracking.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Okay.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I don't know

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
if Jiao Yan has joined

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Tyra's members.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
If you're interested in joining Tyra...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
She gave a talk last year.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Okay.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Yixu,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
are you in Tyra?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
You're a passerby.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
I'm a passerby.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
You can join us next time.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Okay.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I'll send you the membership form

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
right away.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
If you're interested,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
you're welcome to join Tyra.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
There's a lot of people.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Okay.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
The biggest problem is

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
you can't find students

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
even if you want to.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
What kind of students?

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
PhD students.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
You mean me?

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I mean me.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I can't find students

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
if I want to.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Not necessarily.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
We'll have students

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
after the promotion.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
We'll have students after the promotion.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Thank you.
