00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello everyone, welcome to this week's Terra Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. I am currently studying high-energy physics experiments at the University of California.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Before we officially start, let's first introduce what kind of organization Project Terra is.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
In fact, as we wrote on the website, our goal is to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world, exchange results and trends in Taiwan's academic circles overseas,

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
and provide each other with a platform for effective communication.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
To put it simply, we hope to establish a platform that helps Taiwanese from all over the world engage in research and work to communicate with each other quickly and timely.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
We will hold a webcast like today every week.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
The speakers are basically our members, and the audience can sign up online.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
The topic of the speech is based on the results of the speaker's research, review his current development in his special field,

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
and share new ideas, plans, or opportunities for cooperation.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
Project Terra is currently a fully self-funded, fully volunteer organization.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Our staff are basically all doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
You can see the About page on our website.

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
I want to add that we recently added a lot of staff who may not have been updated to the website.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
The most important purpose of a project like this is to fully open up, share and cooperate.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
The more friends who are willing to join us, share and help each other,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
we can move towards the goals we all want.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
I also hope that it will be helpful to Taiwan's academic circle and everyone's research career, or to transfer jobs in the future.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
If you feel that you support our ideas, or are passionate about sharing your very passionate research,

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
you can consider joining our members, and you will continue to receive our speech and activity information.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Of course, you can also go to our Facebook fan page and continue to follow our news.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
We also want to emphasize that we have no profit at all.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
If you are willing to share with other Taiwanese, it will be the biggest reward for us.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
It is also the biggest help to other friends who work in the academic circle.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
This is the introduction of TARA.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Next, I want to introduce our speaker.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
We are honored to invite Zheng Yunting today.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Zheng Yunting is currently studying physics at the California Institute of Technology.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
He is currently a doctoral candidate.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Yunting graduated from the Department of Physics in 2014 and joined the Caltech Research Institute.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
He is currently studying his doctorate.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
His special field is observational cosmology.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
He will introduce to us today that he is doing a data analysis project.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
It is a rocket project.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
There is one more thing to remind everyone.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
In order to let the speaker feel our enthusiasm,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
the microphone must be turned on when applauding, so that he can hear the voice.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Let's applaud and welcome Yunting to give us this speech.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Thank you everyone.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
I am Zheng Yunting. I am studying my PhD at Caltech.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Thank you to my office mate, Zhang Yanyong, for the introduction.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
The topic I am going to talk about today is

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Measuring Extragalactic Background Light at Optical and Near-Infrared.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
This is a project I am doing.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
I am doing its data analysis.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
What I am going to talk about today is more focused on

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
the background in this field.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
What do we want to measure?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
What do we want to understand?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What is a signal?

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
Let me start by introducing the history of our universe.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
This is the universe we know so far.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
We can start from the left.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
The left is the earliest period.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
We have inflation and Big Bang.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Inflation is the theory of explosion in Chinese.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
Big Bang is the beginning of the universe.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
In the very early period,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
the universe is very small and hot.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Everything inside is very hot and oily.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
As the universe expands,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
the gas will expand.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
At a certain point in time,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
the temperature in the universe is low enough.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
The electrons and protons in the gas

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
will combine to form hydrogen.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
This process is called recombination.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
After recombination,

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
there are a lot of photons in the universe.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Photons are easily scattered with free electrons.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
After recombination,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
there are almost no free electrons in the universe.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
These photons will not become long.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
We can see the photons emitted at that time.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
This is called a cosmic microwave background or CMB.

06:12.000 --> 06:22.000
This is the earliest signal we can measure in cosmology.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
After recombination and CMB,

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
a lot of protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
During this period,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
the universe is full of neutral hydrogen and hydrogen.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
This period is called the Dark Age.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Because it is very dark,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
there are no photons like the CMB at that time.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
However, there are no stars and galaxies yet.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
The universe during this period is completely black.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
During this period,

07:06.000 --> 07:16.000
there will be some density fluctuations in the universe.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
These density fluctuations are because of gravity.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
As time goes by,

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
there will be more matter coming in.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
The main component is dark matter.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
These dark matter may form heavier and condensed structures.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
We call this dark matter halo.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Because there is a strong gravitational potential in the halo,

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
the background gases such as hydrogen will also gather here.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
When the gathering becomes compact,

08:01.000 --> 08:12.000
it will cause a fusion reaction and form the first star or galaxy.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
After a period of time,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
the universe begins to form stars and galaxies.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
After these stars and galaxies form,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
they will release a lot of photons.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
If the energy of the photons is strong enough,

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
the energy gap between the hydrogen and the gas will be strong enough.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
The gas will separate the hydrogen nearby.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
You can see that there are some separated areas on this map.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
We call this ionizing bubble.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
This process is called reionization.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
As time goes by,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
there will be more and more stars and galaxies in the universe.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
It will ionize the hydrogen nearby.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
At the end,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
if you have enough galaxies,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
you will separate all the hydrogen in the universe.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
The gases outside the galaxy are all ionized.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
This is our current universe.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
This is the history of the development of the universe.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
What I'm going to study now is called an extra-galactic background light.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
I have a question.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
What if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, okay.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
I see.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I see.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
I see.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Can you see it clearly like this?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Actually, I think it's pretty clear.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Okay, then I'll do it like this.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I also think traffic lights are more convenient.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
So, what I'm going to measure is the extra-galactic background light,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
or EVL.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
In the universe, the word galaxy is used to refer to our own galaxy.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
In the universe, the word galaxy is used to refer to our own galaxy.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
So, extra-galactic is outside our own galaxy.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
Background light means everything outside the galaxy is called background.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
So, the EVL we measure is the time and space that happened in the universe.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
The frequency along which posters were laid out is locked on through that spectrum.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
We call this spectrum the EDL.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
We call this spectrum the EDL.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Specture on different wavelengths or language.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
These data are gathered so far.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
You can see that different wavelengths have different EDL measurements.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Let's talk about what each wavelength does.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
We can look at the highest and lowest energy.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
The highest energy is gamma ray and X-ray.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
The main source of these high-energy photons are

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
active galactic nuclei.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
These nuclei have a large black hole

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
in the center of each galaxy.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Sometimes these black holes may suck in

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
all kinds of messy gas and then

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
heat them up and release some radiation.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
These radiations will have very strong energy.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
These high-energy photons are called

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
active galactic nuclei.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
The main source is from the galaxy cluster.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
The center of the cluster has a large black hole.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
The cluster itself has some very hot gas.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
It has a very strong gravitational potential.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
This is the main source of gamma ray and X-ray.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
The main source of X-ray is gamma ray.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
The main source of X-ray is gamma ray.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
At the same time, the source of very low-energy radio

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
is also from something like AGN.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
is also from something like AGN.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
I don't know if you've heard of synchrotron radiation.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I don't know if you've heard of synchrotron radiation.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
This is also when gas is heated

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
or accelerated to a very high speed.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
This is also when gas is heated or accelerated to a very high speed.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Next is UV.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
We didn't measure a lot of data for UV.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
We didn't measure a lot of data for UV.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
It's hard to see UV data

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
because it's a higher-energy photon

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
than 912 Armstrong.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
because it's a higher-energy photon

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
than 912 Armstrong.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
In our own galaxy,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
it's easy to absorb

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
the UV photons.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
So it's hard to see the background

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
of the UV astro-galaxy.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
So it's hard to see the background

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
of the UV astro-galaxy.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
The strongest peak is in the microwave.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
The strongest peak is in the microwave.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
The source of the microwave is from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
The source of the microwave is from the cosmic microwave

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
bakick-de normando radiation.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
The source is from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
One is in the optical and the other in infrared.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
These two are mostly stars pieces

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
emitted in different galaxies.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Star emission is in optical.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
In infrared,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
There's dust emission in the galaxy.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
There's dust emission in the galaxy.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
These dusts will suck

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
stellar lights

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
They will emit thermal radiation

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
They will emit thermal radiation

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
and it's in the infrared

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
You can see

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
This star's light

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
is emitted from as equal from the opposition

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
of the star to the star.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
The wavelengths I will talk about today

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
are in the optical area.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
are in the optical area.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
If we zoom in

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
we can see a lot of different data

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
This is the far-infrared

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
This is the far-infrared

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
This is the far-infrared

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
This is the far-infrared

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
You can see a lot of different data

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I will focus on this area

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
I will focus on this area

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
You can see a lot different data

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
and these data change

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
up to different values

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
up to different values

16:00.000 --> 16:02.900
You can see data changing

16:02.900 --> 16:05.900
These data are inconsistent

16:05.900 --> 16:08.900
because they are used in different ways

16:08.900 --> 16:11.900
because they are used in different ways

16:11.900 --> 16:14.900
in Constraint EDL

16:14.900 --> 16:17.900
There are 4 ways

16:17.900 --> 16:20.900
I will introduce them

16:20.900 --> 16:23.900
The first method is called Galaxy Counts

16:23.900 --> 16:26.900
These data are from Galaxy Counts

16:26.900 --> 16:29.900
Galaxy Counts means

16:29.900 --> 16:32.900
I want to measure

16:32.900 --> 16:35.900
in the near-infrared or optical background

16:35.900 --> 16:38.900
I will use a telescope

16:38.900 --> 16:41.900
to look at a field

16:41.900 --> 16:44.900
I can measure many galaxies in this field

16:44.900 --> 16:47.900
I will add the light from the near-infrared

16:47.900 --> 16:50.900
I will add the light from the near-infrared

16:50.900 --> 16:53.900
I will say these are the extra-galactic backgrounds I measured

16:53.900 --> 16:56.900
I will say these are the extra-galactic backgrounds I measured

16:57.900 --> 17:00.900
You can only contain low-LE in EBL

17:00.900 --> 17:03.900
You can only contain low-LE in EBL

17:05.900 --> 17:08.900
You will only get the brightest galaxies

17:08.900 --> 17:11.900
You will only get the brightest galaxies

17:11.900 --> 17:14.900
You can only get a few of them

17:14.900 --> 17:17.900
You will only get a few of them

17:17.900 --> 17:21.800
I also place multiple

17:21.840 --> 17:24.900
You will only get a feliz

17:24.900 --> 17:27.900
You will only get a few of them

17:33.240 --> 17:36.240
I also explained the number of colors

17:36.240 --> 17:39.240
I also explained the number of colors

17:39.240 --> 17:42.240
I also explained the number of colors

17:42.240 --> 17:45.240
I also explained the name

17:45.240 --> 17:48.200
I also explained the name

17:48.200 --> 17:51.200
I also explained the name

17:51.240 --> 17:54.240
the second method is Absolute Photometry
