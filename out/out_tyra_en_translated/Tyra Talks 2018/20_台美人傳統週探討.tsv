0	24000	Welcome everyone to today's Taira speech, and I am the host today, Bo Xuan, and I am very happy that this is the first Taira history speech today, and the speaker today is Hong Qi Ting, who is currently a doctoral candidate for the history of Santa Barbara.
24000	33000	And now the main focus is American history, Asian American research, as well as the Cold War and Taiwan-US relations. I think these studies are quite important.
33000	42000	And today Qiqi is going to talk about the traditional Taira people, so let's not talk too much and let Qiqi start the speech.
43000	54000	Hello everyone, it's an honor to be here for the first time, and I feel a little sorry for everyone, because I didn't do much.
54000	61000	And my position today is that I personally hope that everyone can give me some feedback.
61000	75000	In fact, the topic I am going to talk about today is a part of my paper, because my paper mainly wants to study the role and importance of Taiwanese Americans in Taiwan's democratization and current Taiwan-US relations.
76000	82000	This topic is about the traditional Taira people, and I think it is a very important part of my paper.
82000	94000	The reason is that the traditional Taira people are in May, the whole month is a day to commemorate the multi-ethnicity of the United States.
94000	111000	And every May, it seems that the Jews and the Asians are all in May, and there will be a lot of commemorative activities related to the culture of the Taira people throughout the month.
111000	119000	This event can be said to be the most important event in the year of the Taira community, so I think this topic is very important to my paper.
119000	131000	It can be seen as a small fragment of how the Taira community mobilizes, organizes, and designs such activities to promote themselves internally and externally.
131000	139000	From this process, we can understand how the community of Taira people is formed, so it is a very important part of my paper.
139000	154000	Before I get to that point, I would like to mention that there is a national newspaper in the United States called the Pacific Times, which has a history of about 30 years.
154000	163000	It is the most influential Chinese newspaper in the United States or the entire North American region.
163000	169000	Their editor-in-chief asked me to write a topic like this, so I think this opportunity is very rare.
169000	177000	After I finish sorting out the information, I will publish it in the Pacific Times.
177000	183000	If I have time, I might turn it into English and see if I can post it in other newspapers.
183000	201000	For example, in May, when many Taira people started to promote traditional Chinese activities, they could take this information and introduce it to members of Congress in the United States or local communities, such as high school students.
201000	209000	If the audience of the article is different, the angle of discussion will be different.
209000	235000	So my current position is that how can I get the Taira people who are organizing this event and the Taiwan Committee to review the history and think about how we can improve in the future.
235000	255000	I have participated in two presentations as an audience, and the speaker has been talking about a very complete topic, which is his own research.
255000	271000	I'm not sure what my argument is, so I hope that if you have any questions, you can always ask me.
271000	279000	Because I think that way I can make my own thoughts clearer and I will know what is important and what is interesting.
279000	291000	This way, my article will be better written, so I hope to interact more and I hope to have a lot of questions, which can be a variety of questions.
291000	293000	Hello, I have a question.
293000	294000	Zhang Yan has a question.
294000	295000	Okay, go ahead.
295000	304000	So about this, I will ask a very basic question. What is the definition of Taipei people?
305000	308000	That's a very good question.
308000	328000	The definition of Taipei people is that you are a descendant of Taiwan, your parents are Taiwanese, or you are a Taiwanese immigrant.
328000	342000	Then you have an American nationality, and your wife is American, and she marries you, and she becomes half Taiwanese American.
342000	350000	Or you are the fourth generation, and your grandfather is Taiwanese.
350000	352000	They are all considered Taiwanese American.
352000	356000	Anyway, you are the same as the black man, as long as you have a drop of blood, you are Taiwanese.
356000	357000	They all count.
357000	362000	Then you have the right to be an American citizen, and you can be praised as a Taiwanese American.
362000	370000	But there is one thing that I think must be included in it, which is your own identity.
370000	373000	Because this thing is also related to Taiwan's history.
373000	381000	Although Taiwan is not mainstream, but some people think it is Chinese, it is not Taiwanese.
381000	386000	And I'm talking about the Chinese, it's not that I'm Chinese, I'm Taiwanese.
386000	389000	Some people think he is a member of the People's Republic of China.
389000	396000	I will not draw that kind of person in the range of Taiwanese American.
397000	400000	And the other thing I want to talk about is this holiday.
400000	407000	In fact, he has, I think, behind my own research, more and more, I found that he was behind the politics with the Taiwan government.
407000	415000	The political component of the US government-Taiwan-US relationship is actually there.
415000	424000	For example, in the eight years of Ma Ying-jeou's administration, the Taiwanese American society in the United States.
424000	427000	Basically, they hold a traditional week every year.
427000	431000	But they didn't take money from the Taiwanese government, and they didn't ask the Standing Committee for help.
431000	437000	Many of the elders I'm visiting now, they just say that we don't need to take the money from the Kuomintang.
437000	447000	Yes, and now that Tsai Ing-wen is in power, some people think, ah, forget it, we can still work with the government.
447000	453000	So I think behind this, he's actually not just a very pure cultural thing.
453000	456000	He also has some political identity of Taiwanese people.
456000	459000	And the Taiwanese American as a very special group of people.
459000	465000	When I talk about Taiwanese American, I think of Taiwanese American.
465000	475000	Because from my research, from 1950 to 19, there are a lot of people coming from Taiwan to the United States.
475000	478000	But not everyone thinks they are Taiwanese American.
478000	482000	About half of the people think they are Chinese American.
482000	486000	So this thing is a very important difference.
486000	494000	So to answer your question, I would say that the first thing is related to blood.
494000	504000	Your family, your gene, there is such a link between Taiwanese people.
504000	507000	Then you are now an American citizen.
507000	510000	Then another thing is identity.
510000	513000	I think it must also be considered.
513000	521000	So in other words, if you are actually in the Taiwanese American, identity can also be allowed in many ways, right?
521000	527000	Because it is possible that Lin Shuhao, although he is related to Taiwan,
527000	531000	but he does not necessarily feel that Taiwan is his home or something like that.
531000	534000	If this is also considered Taiwanese American?
534000	540000	This question depends on which context you are discussing.
540000	545000	For example, Lin Shuhao, his parents, his great-grandparents seem to still be in Taiwan, right?
546000	548000	So he will travel to Taiwan.
548000	550000	Then he will go fishing in Taiwan.
550000	553000	He will go to Taiwan to eat dumplings.
553000	556000	Fishing is a very open event.
556000	562000	He was not asked if he was Chinese or Taiwanese.
562000	564000	He just came to that place because of his great-grandparents.
564000	568000	So when he has a vacation, he will want to go to that place.
568000	573000	I think in that context, he is Taiwanese, there is no problem.
573000	576000	But if today is a very special occasion.
576000	580000	For example, he was asked if he was going to play in China.
580000	584000	Then you have to admit that you are Chinese American and he is Taiwanese American.
584000	587000	At that time, I think it is a totally different story.
587000	592000	And this kind of contradiction, this kind of entanglement is actually not just Taiwanese Americans.
592000	594000	Taiwanese people will also face this kind of problem.
594000	596000	Now there are 31 meetings in Taiwan.
596000	605000	I don't want to make any judgment.
605000	608000	Everyone has their own way to survive, right?
608000	613000	It's just that when he's on that occasion, he's bound to change his identity.
613000	616000	Then it won't be a topic for me to discuss.
616000	621000	Because when I say that Taipei people are a highly political issue.
621000	624000	It's because in my paper, I want to make an argument.
624000	629000	That is to say, my question, my paper has a very big problem.
629000	639000	Taiwanese Americans as a person who immigrated to the United States under a very special Taiwan-US relationship during the Cold War.
639000	644000	Their experience is very different from Chinese Americans.
644000	647000	If you have read the book Asian American History.
648000	655000	If you read Chinese American, his story, his argument is all the way from this 19th century.
655000	662000	Chinese workers came to the United States to help the plantation workers.
662000	664000	Then help to build the railway.
664000	667000	Then in the 20th century, it was a slum movement.
667000	669000	Then everyone is hiding in Chinatown.
669000	672000	Then they all have long braids and then they eat rat meat.
672000	674000	Very, very different image.
674000	684000	Then after the 1950s, the Chinese American image is that they are a group of refugees from the Communist Party of China to the free world.
684000	686000	Then I got to Taiwan.
686000	688000	Then I got to Hong Kong.
688000	693000	In that sense, Taiwanese immigrants were placed in this whole line from the 19th century.
693000	698000	Chinese workers, then the slum movement, then the refugees.
698000	701000	To understand Taiwan in this context.
701000	703000	I think it's very problematic.
703000	708000	Because the first thing is that in the 19th century, we didn't have anyone.
708000	712000	At that time, we were still in the Qing Dynasty.
712000	716000	We moved from China to Taiwan for the second time.
716000	720000	We are not discussing the context of Chinese Americans.
720000	725000	Then in the second to 20th century, the group of people who lived in Chinatown because of the Paihua Act.
725000	728000	Also with our impression, our memory is different.
728000	730000	Because in the 20th century, Taiwan was ruled by Japan at that time.
730000	732000	Most people want to immigrate.
732000	736000	For example, my grandfather went to Japan to study, not to the United States.
736000	738000	The United States is not the main immigration place in Taiwan.
738000	743000	The United States has become the most important place for Taiwanese immigrants.
743000	749000	And even in the 1960s, the most important immigration country.
749000	753000	It started after the Cold War.
753000	760000	So Taiwan's immigration to the United States is actually a very modern, very cold war story.
760000	765000	If you don't emphasize this, you will become a Taiwanese-American, Chinese-American.
765000	770000	I think a lot of people think that if you read the textbooks, or you read the textbooks.
770000	774000	A paradigm that has been established seems to be unbreakable.
774000	776000	You will take it for granted.
776000	778000	Yes, we are Chinese-Americans.
778000	779000	We are like that.
779000	781000	But I think this is the first thing.
781000	784000	The first thing is that he simplifies the story.
784000	786000	The story is not that simple.
786000	795000	Second, identity in American society is a self-claim.
795000	797000	You can say what you are not.
797000	798000	You can say what you are.
798000	802000	No one can force you to say who you are.
802000	805000	This is the case in American society.
805000	810000	So I think because we have this space, we should go even better.
810000	815000	Even if Taiwan and China are in a very complicated situation in Asia,
815000	817000	it doesn't mean that you are already in the United States.
817000	820000	You have become a Taiwanese-American citizen in the United States.
820000	824000	You have no right to say that you are a Taiwanese-American, not a Chinese-American.
824000	828000	So I think behind this, this Taiwanese-American,
828000	830000	he is what I want to use, my argument.
830000	832000	There is a very important argument in my paper.
832000	836000	I want to bring up the Taiwanese-American, independent of the Chinese-American.
836000	842000	And why can this Taiwanese-American be independent of the Chinese-American story or argument?
842000	848000	In fact, it is a very special experience of Taiwanese-Americans immigrating to the United States during the Cold War.
848000	850000	And what is that very special experience?
850000	857000	That is, under the martial law of Taiwan, many people came to the United States in order to oppose the Kuomintang.
857000	863000	Then, oh, no, it should be said that they came to the United States under the martial law of the Kuomintang.
863000	868000	After they accepted a lot of liberal ideas, progressive ideas,
868000	874000	they began to oppose that authoritarian rule and then to promote Taiwan's democracy.
874000	876000	The most obvious example is the Paris era.
876000	879000	After the Melita incident in 1979,
879000	884000	where can those refugees like Xu Xinliang be accommodated?
884000	886000	Most of them came to the United States.
886000	890000	Then you can also know that every time something happens,
890000	895000	money and international aid are mainly provided in the United States and Canada.
895000	903000	One argument is that because of the experience of Taiwanese-Americans immigrating to the United States,
903000	906000	there is a connection with the opposition to authoritarian rule.
906000	911000	After you connect them together, you will find that this is very different from the Chinese-American context.
911000	914000	You should not mix them together and say that they are all Chinese-American.
914000	918000	Then the second one is that when studying the democratization movement in Taiwan,
918000	924000	in fact, the role of overseas Taiwanese is not given enough attention.
924000	927000	It seems to be just a side story.
927000	930000	But I don't think so. I think it is actually very important.
930000	934000	And this importance, especially after the Democratic Progressive Party came to power,
934000	938000	I think it should be emphasized more.
938000	942000	Yes, I'm a little far away now.
942000	946000	OK. Hello, is everyone still there?
946000	948000	We are all still there.
948000	949000	OK, OK, OK.
949000	951000	Are there any more questions?
951000	955000	I would like to ask if you are sharing the screen now or have not started yet?
955000	957000	I haven't started yet.
957000	959000	OK.
959000	962000	If you want to share the screen, you can confirm it.
962000	965000	Because I'm afraid you won't be able to share it.
965000	973000	OK, I'll press share first and then press my screen.
975000	977000	Can you see it like this?
977000	979000	Not yet.
979000	981000	But I'm already on my screen.
981000	984000	Now you...
984000	986000	Let me think.
986000	991000	My computer is now on my screen.
991000	997000	Then you jump back to BlueJeans.
997000	1002000	Then BlueJeans, you slide down from the middle.
1002000	1005000	You should see a share screen at the bottom.
1005000	1008000	A rectangular blue button.
1008000	1009000	Yes.
1009000	1010000	OK.
1010000	1012000	Then...
1012000	1014000	You should be able to choose after you press it.
1014000	1015000	Yes.
1015000	1017000	1 or 2?
1017000	1019000	Now we can see it.
1019000	1021000	Then you can press play.
1021000	1022000	OK.
1022000	1023000	OK.
1023000	1024000	I'm recording.
1024000	1025000	Is it recording now?
1025000	1026000	Yes, yes, yes.
1026000	1027000	OK.
1027000	1032000	So the topic I'm going to talk about today is Taiwanese traditional porridge.
1032000	1034000	My PowerPoint is actually very simple.
1034000	1036000	Just four pages.
1036000	1040000	So you're welcome to ask any questions you have.
1040000	1042000	My structure is also very simple.
1042000	1045000	What I'm going to talk about is...
1045000	1050000	What is Taiwanese traditional porridge?
1050000	1053000	And why is it important?
1053000	1061000	Before we start, I'd like to ask if anyone has participated in a traditional porridge event in the U.S.?
1062000	1066000	We have three people here.
1066000	1068000	Hello?
1068000	1071000	I'm going to help with the traditional porridge next week.
1071000	1073000	Where are you going to help?
1073000	1077000	There's a circus troupe coming from Ann Arbor.
1077000	1083000	Are you going to Chicago or Michigan?
1083000	1086000	They're probably going to perform in Chicago.
1086000	1094000	But the elders have brought them to Ann Arbor for a one-night show.
1094000	1097000	So there's a show in your city, too?
1097000	1101000	Yes, there's a vacancy here.
1101000	1108000	So you're going to see it and help with the venue?
1108000	1112000	I'm going to help with the venue.
1112000	1114000	Oh, OK.
1114000	1121000	I interviewed Professor Li Xianglan from your city.
1121000	1126000	I think he's in charge of the committee in Chicago.
1126000	1130000	He told me about the event in your city.
1130000	1133000	I haven't participated in it myself.
1133000	1135000	I'm going to participate this year.
1135000	1140000	I'll post a link to the event in LA.
1140000	1145000	Let's take a look at the event.
1148000	1150000	This is the LA schedule.
1150000	1155000	You can see from April 21st to June 16th.
1155000	1158000	It's been over a month.
1158000	1163000	LA is special because it has the most Taiwanese in the U.S.
1163000	1166000	So there are a lot of circus troupes here.
1166000	1169000	If there are a lot of circus troupes, there will be a lot of shows.
1169000	1173000	So you can compare it to Chicago.
1173000	1176000	There are a lot of Taiwanese, but not as many as there are here.
1176000	1182000	So what I know now is that there's an event in Chicago.
1182000	1190000	There's a local singer from Taiwan.
1190000	1192000	There's a show from the committee.
1192000	1198000	There's a teacher from the Taiwan Food Association.
1198000	1202000	He's in charge of a food event.
1202000	1205000	There are a lot of circus troupes in LA.
1205000	1207000	So there are a lot of activities.
1207000	1214000	If you look at the schedule, you can see there are a few types of activities.
1215000	1221000	The most popular one is the food tour.
1221000	1225000	It's on May 20th in LA.
1225000	1231000	It's in a park in Montreal Park.
1231000	1233000	It's a whole day's event.
1233000	1238000	In addition to the food tour, there are also live performances.
1239000	1256000	In the major cities I know, including LA, San Diego, Chicago, and DC,
1256000	1258000	there are also food tours.
1258000	1261000	In addition to food, you can also see in LA.
1261000	1263000	I think it's a special event.
1263000	1267000	It's not just about performing, eating, and playing.
1267000	1269000	There are also community service events.
1269000	1275000	For example, today in LA, there's an event to clean up the LA River.
1275000	1282000	It's to contribute to the local community.
1282000	1287000	I also know that there's a dentist in Taiwan.
1287000	1293000	Some doctors provide free dental services.
1293000	1298000	I also know that there's another thing to do with the local community.
1298000	1303000	In many places, other than LA, there's also one in San Diego.
1303000	1305000	When there's a bridge, they'll donate money.
1305000	1311000	At the opening of the traditional week, there's a high school scholarship.
1311000	1315000	It's not limited to Taiwanese children.
1315000	1318000	It also includes people of other ethnicities.
1318000	1322000	For example, in San Diego, they give six places every year.
1322000	1327000	It's stipulated that four of them must be foreigners.
1327000	1329000	Last year, they gave an Arab.
1329000	1331000	It seems to be a refugee.
1331000	1340000	He came to the United States and applied for a scholarship to support his financial needs.
1341000	1344000	I also know that there's another one in San Diego.
1344000	1347000	It seems to be from Syria.
1347000	1350000	When you look at the traditional week in Taipei,
1350000	1355000	you'll see that it's not just about promoting Taiwanese culture.
1355000	1359000	This is a very important goal.
1359000	1363000	At the same time, there's also outreach.
1363000	1365000	It's connected to the local community.
1365000	1369000	It allows the local community to know more about Taiwan.
1369000	1379000	There are three different activities in the traditional week.
1379000	1382000	I'll talk about this later.
1382000	1388000	Let's take a look at what the activities are about.
1388000	1395000	Why is there a traditional week?
1396000	1407000	In 1992, President Bush announced that May was the traditional month of the Asian-Taiwanese in the United States.
1407000	1414000	In fact, the traditional week in Taipei is put in the context of the Asian-Taiwanese traditional month.
1414000	1423000	The main purpose is for the U.S. government to praise the Taiwanese and Asians for their contributions to American society.
1423000	1425000	Why is it chosen in May?
1425000	1430000	May has a very important relationship with the history of the Asian-Taiwanese in the United States.
1430000	1433000	There are two reasons for choosing May.
1433000	1442000	The first reason is that the first wave of Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States in May 1843.
1442000	1451000	The second reason for choosing May is that the cross-strait railway was completed in 1869.
1451000	1468000	More and more people believe that the cross-strait railway in the United States was built by Chinese laborers.
1468000	1473000	For example, the 101 in Taiwan was built by Taiwanese laborers.
1473000	1478000	The 101 is our icon, but it was built by foreign laborers.
1478000	1482000	Sorry, I have a question from the audience.
1482000	1489000	I want to ask how you define culture and what is Taiwan culture?
1489000	1493000	My paper also discusses relevant issues, so I want to discuss it.
1493000	1495000	This is a question from Annie.
1495000	1497000	This is a very good question.
1497000	1500000	This is a very good question.
1500000	1504000	Because I actually have a question mark where I look at the end.
1504000	1510000	So, when we get to the end, when I talk about the wrap-up,
1510000	1519000	I will discuss my own observations of the activities of traditional music.
1521000	1523000	Actually, it will be there soon.
1523000	1525000	Because I only have four PowerPoint slides.
1525000	1528000	So, I will write down my question.
1528000	1532000	I will answer it together at the end.
1532000	1546000	So, this event was chosen in May because of its contribution to American history with two Asian ethnic groups.
1546000	1556000	Because of the history of Japanese and Chinese, it was decided to be held in May.
1557000	1563000	In 1992, Asian traditional music began to be played.
1563000	1573000	In 1999, during the Clinton administration, the US Congress, in order to praise Taiwanese for their contributions to the United States,
1573000	1577000	decided to separate Taiwanese from the United States.
1577000	1582000	So, in May, you can choose a specific state.
1583000	1591000	Now I know that a lot of people will choose the state of Mother's Day as Taiwanese American Heritage Week.
1591000	1595000	This has become a trademark.
1595000	1600000	It is Taiwanese American Heritage Week, not Chinese American, not Asian American.
1600000	1602000	It has its own independence.
1602000	1613000	This is very important because it is related to the organizer's outreach to the local community.
1613000	1622000	When there is a Taiwanese American trademark, it can promote Taiwan and China in private.
1622000	1626000	So, there is a diplomatic connection behind it.
1626000	1629000	I will talk about this later.
1629000	1634000	So, this is Taiwanese American Heritage Week.
1634000	1636000	But there is an exception.
1636000	1640000	I know that there are a lot of Taiwanese in D.C.
1640000	1644000	But they did not come out of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States independently.
1644000	1649000	Instead, they celebrated the Asian American Heritage Month together.
1649000	1653000	I think this is an exception.
1653000	1658000	I don't know why they don't particularly emphasize Taiwanese American Heritage Week.
1658000	1660000	Maybe because it's in D.C.
1660000	1662000	It's more political sensitive.
1662000	1664000	So, they don't want to cause trouble.
1664000	1670000	So, they put it in the context of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States.
1670000	1674000	It can avoid some tensions.
1674000	1676000	But other places, other than D.C.,
1676000	1680000	Taiwanese communities in other places, when they celebrate May,
1680000	1689000	they put the Taiwanese American Heritage Month in the context of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States.
1689000	1694000	So, why is this important?
1694000	1696000	There are three levels.
1696000	1698000	For the American society,
1698000	1703000	the reason why they set up this month to commemorate
1704000	1711000	is to praise the contribution of American minorities to American society.
1711000	1714000	In addition, they want to promote multiculturalism.
1714000	1716000	So, for the American society,
1716000	1721000	this is their main position on this event.
1721000	1723000	For the Taipei community,
1723000	1725000	it is an important event to establish,
1725000	1731000	gather, and strengthen ethnic identity.
1731000	1733000	I want to share this.
1733000	1737000	When I was writing this article,
1737000	1742000	I wanted to understand the different dynamics in different places.
1742000	1748000	So, I visited different areas, different generations, and different positions.
1748000	1750000	Some people are just participants.
1750000	1752000	Some people have participated in many events,
1752000	1754000	and they are the main organizers.
1754000	1758000	From the perspective of different people,
1758000	1766000	I wanted to understand the different meanings of this event for different people.
1766000	1768000	I found it very interesting.
1768000	1770000	Older people,
1770000	1774000	people who came to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s,
1774000	1776000	the first generation,
1776000	1778000	when the traditional state began,
1778000	1780000	they were the founding fathers.
1780000	1782000	For them, this month,
1782000	1784000	this kind of commemorative event,
1785000	1789000	of course, it is important to let the mainstream society know them.
1789000	1792000	However, because their English is not good enough,
1792000	1796000	it seems that the younger generation of Compare
1796000	1799000	is not able to fit into the mainstream society.
1799000	1802000	How can we use the language that is familiar to the mainstream society
1802000	1804000	to talk about this culture,
1804000	1806000	to talk about this tradition?
1806000	1808000	Their ability is relatively lacking.
1808000	1810000	So, when they organize this event,
1810000	1817000	they tend to serve the people in their own community.
1817000	1819000	For example,
1819000	1823000	when I visited the organizer in the Bay Area,
1823000	1825000	he said,
1825000	1828000	his name is Cai Hejie.
1828000	1830000	He is a second-generation American.
1830000	1836000	He grew up in Illinois in the Midwest.
1836000	1838000	He is very special.
1838000	1840000	He does not speak Chinese at all.
1840000	1842000	He often goes to Taiwan.
1842000	1844000	He is an American,
1844000	1846000	and he is not studying Humanities.
1846000	1848000	He studied Engineering in college,
1848000	1850000	and now he is a physician.
1850000	1856000	He is a second-generation American.
1856000	1860000	Anyway, he is such a person.
1860000	1862000	I asked him,
1862000	1866000	why do you want to participate in this event?
1866000	1868000	What is the significance of this event to you?
1868000	1870000	He said,
1870000	1872000	he used to be a white person in the Central Department.
1872000	1874000	So, he had an identity crisis when he was young.
1874000	1876000	He felt that
1876000	1878000	in American society,
1878000	1880000	either you are a white person,
1880000	1882000	or you are not a white person.
1882000	1884000	What kind of person is not a white person?
1884000	1888000	He was born in the 1970s.
1888000	1890000	He said that
1890000	1892000	when he was a teenager,
1892000	1894000	the mainstream American society
1894000	1896000	did not have enough nutrients
1896000	1898000	to tell him what kind of person is not a white person.
1898000	1900000	He was confused.
1900000	1902000	I asked him this question
1902000	1904000	because I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.
1904000	1908000	I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.
1908000	1910000	Although their parents are Taiwanese,
1910000	1912000	their grandparents are in Taiwan,
1912000	1914000	but their interest in Taiwan
1914000	1916000	is very superficial.
1916000	1918000	They say,
1918000	1920000	I will go back to Taiwan to see my grandpa.
1920000	1922000	Taiwan has pearl milk tea.
1922000	1924000	Pearl milk tea and stinky tofu are delicious in Taiwan.
1924000	1926000	Other than pearl milk tea and stinky tofu,
1926000	1928000	he has zero understanding of Taiwan.
1928000	1930000	Many people do not speak Chinese.
1930000	1932000	I know a lot of people
1932000	1934000	who are more concerned about Taiwan.
1934000	1936000	I know a lot of people
1936000	1938000	who are more concerned about Taiwan.
1938000	1940000	The United States is the place
1940000	1942000	where they choose to settle down.
1942000	1944000	The United States is the place
1944000	1946000	where they choose to settle down.
1946000	1948000	Although Taiwan has a Taiwanese
1948000	1950000	ethnic concept,
1950000	1952000	Taiwan is a foreign country
1952000	1954000	and is not important.
1954000	1956000	Taiwan is a foreign country
1956000	1958000	and is not important.
1958000	1960000	I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.
1960000	1962000	I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.
1962000	1964000	Many people are white-washed.
1964000	1966000	Many people are white-washed.
1966000	1968000	Many people are white-washed.
1968000	1970000	When they look at the identity,
1970000	1972000	they are more concerned about
1972000	1974000	their professional career.
1974000	1976000	For example,
1976000	1978000	I am a doctor.
1978000	1980000	I have a lot to do with my community.
1980000	1982000	I have a lot to do with my community.
1982000	1984000	I don't care if I am Asian
1984000	1986000	I don't care if I am Asian
1986000	1988000	or if I am white.
1988000	1990000	or if I am white.
1990000	1992000	Ethnicity is not something they care about.
1992000	1994000	Ethnicity is not something they care about.
1994000	1996000	There are a lot of people
1996000	1998000	who choose this option
1998000	2000000	who choose this option
2000000	2002000	in the Taiwanese community.
2002000	2004000	in the Taiwanese community.
2004000	2006000	Cai Hejie is very special.
2006000	2008000	Cai Hejie is very special.
2008000	2010000	He made me feel that
2010000	2012000	he made me feel that
2012000	2014000	he understands Taiwanese people.
2014000	2016000	He doesn't blame them.
2016000	2018000	He doesn't blame them.
2018000	2020000	He doesn't blame them.
2020000	2022000	He doesn't blame them.
2022000	2024000	He thinks that
2024000	2026000	Taiwanese American identity
2026000	2028000	Taiwanese American identity
2028000	2030000	is important
2030000	2032000	and he is willing to spend a lot of time

2176000	2178000	Now these young people
2178000	2180000	generation after
2180000	2182000	there is a big change like me
2182000	2184000	For example, I went to visit the organizer
2184000	2186000	in Portland. He said
2186000	2188000	that his previous activities were
2188000	2190000	usually held in a high school
2190000	2192000	and then in the auditorium of the high school
2192000	2194000	he felt like that
2194000	2196000	he was not so satisfied he felt
2196000	2198000	he could do better
2198000	2200000	so he last year and the year before
2200000	2202000	when the general recruitment
2202000	2204000	he rented a venue in the city of Portland
2204000	2206000	Yes, but he is very advanced
2206000	2208000	and that venue because he is a
2208000	2210000	mainstream society everyone wants to go
2210000	2212000	to see the show to listen to the concert will go to that place
2212000	2214000	so you are holding an event in that place
2214000	2216000	you can use his platform to promote
2216000	2218000	to do a lot of promotion
2218000	2220000	and outreach work
2220000	2222000	so his visibility
2222000	2224000	suddenly increased
2224000	2226000	from this example you can reflect
2226000	2228000	for the older generation
2228000	2230000	of course, on the one hand, they have their own
2230000	2232000	limitation and then on the other hand
2232000	2234000	because
2234000	2236000	they are not fit in
2236000	2238000	so it seems that one of the purposes of this event
2238000	2240000	is to serve their own community
2240000	2242000	so in the end
2242000	2244000	it becomes a community
2244000	2246000	but the new generation
2246000	2248000	of the younger generation
2248000	2250000	because of their ability to adapt to culture
2250000	2252000	or the ability to interact
2252000	2254000	with different cultures
2254000	2256000	so in addition to being able to
2256000	2258000	internalize
2258000	2260000	and also to build
2260000	2262000	this Taiwanese American identity
2262000	2264000	to do such a
2264000	2266000	cultural construction
2266000	2268000	it can actually outreach to the
2268000	2270000	mainstream society of the United States
2270000	2272000	so that the mainstream society of the United States can understand
2272000	2274000	what is the Taiwanese American Heritage Week
2274000	2276000	so I think
2276000	2278000	this is a different generation
2278000	2280000	they are organizing
2280000	2282000	such an event
2282000	2284000	they have a lot of different ideas
2284000	2286000	this is different
2286000	2288000	at the same time the reason is
2288000	2290000	different generations
2290000	2292000	have the ability to interpret
2292000	2294000	culture and have the ability to
2294000	2296000	interact with different cultures
2296000	2298000	and then it also reflects
2298000	2300000	different generations
2300000	2302000	what is the positioning of this event
2302000	2304000	my own observation is
2304000	2306000	now the young generation
2306000	2308000	in fact, their main ideas are
2308000	2310000	hoping to make the mainstream society
2310000	2312000	of course, because I am more leftist
2312000	2314000	so what is this mainstream
2314000	2316000	I will criticize a little later
2316000	2318000	this is also a question mark
2318000	2320000	but their idea is
2320000	2322000	we are going to the White House
2322000	2324000	we are going to Union Square
2324000	2326000	we can let the mainstream society
2326000	2328000	know what we are doing
2328000	2330000	what is Taiwan
2330000	2332000	what is Taiwanese American culture
2332000	2334000	so there are different generations
2334000	2336000	will reflect a different
2336000	2338000	way of thinking
2338000	2340000	and this reflects
2340000	2342000	when they are organizing
2342000	2344000	there will be a lot of differences
2344000	2346000	for example, in San Diego
2346000	2348000	it is mainly the older generation
2348000	2350000	who are organizing
2350000	2352000	the most important thing is
2352000	2354000	there will be delicious Taiwanese food
2354000	2356000	and I heard that
2356000	2358000	there is a mom in San Diego
2358000	2360000	who is very good at making zongzi
2360000	2362000	the zongzi will disappear
2362000	2364000	so she started making zongzi
2364000	2366000	about 3 weeks ago
2366000	2368000	she can make more than 1000 zongzi
2368000	2370000	and it seems like
2370000	2372000	it will be sold out in half a day
2372000	2374000	so the traditional week
2374000	2376000	they want to participate
2376000	2378000	because they want to visit
2378000	2380000	their hometown
2380000	2382000	to see
2382000	2384000	where they grew up
2384000	2386000	so for us
2386000	2388000	it is a group of Taiwanese
2388000	2390000	they will feel
2390000	2392000	so nostalgic
2392000	2394000	I will go there
2394000	2396000	and share with other Taiwanese
2396000	2398000	how to cook
2398000	2400000	so for us
2400000	2402000	how to strengthen
2402000	2404000	their feelings
2404000	2406000	for Taiwan
2406000	2408000	but for the younger generation
2408000	2410000	of course there is
2410000	2412000	I will go there
2412000	2414000	because I want to eat Taiwanese food
2414000	2416000	I think there is a reason
2416000	2418000	but for the young Taiwanese
2418000	2420000	organizers
2420000	2422000	this event will be
2422000	2424000	how we use this occasion
2424000	2426000	to talk to the mainstream society
2426000	2428000	to discuss
2428000	2430000	or to promote
2430000	2432000	what Taiwan is
2432000	2434000	and the importance of Taiwan
2434000	2436000	so I think
2436000	2438000	I see a
2438000	2440000	very different place
2440000	2442000	and the third
2442000	2444000	I think is very important
2444000	2446000	this event is very important
2446000	2448000	I interviewed
2448000	2450000	the director of
2450000	2452000	L.A.'s church
2452000	2454000	and I talked to him
2454000	2456000	about the role of the church
2456000	2458000	and I found
2458000	2460000	for example
2460000	2462000	in Chicago
2462000	2464000	every year
2464000	2466000	the church
2466000	2468000	will have two groups
2468000	2470000	to the U.S.
2470000	2472000	East Coast and West Coast
2472000	2474000	East Coast will go to
2474000	2476000	10 different cities
2476000	2478000	to perform
2478000	2480000	West Coast
2480000	2482000	will perform
2482000	2484000	in different cities
2484000	2486000	this is the work of the church
2486000	2488000	and they will pay
2488000	2490000	to invite these groups
2490000	2492000	and the food and accommodation
2492000	2494000	of these groups
2494000	2496000	will be paid by the church
2496000	2498000	but the church
2498000	2500000	has a very limited budget
2500000	2502000	so it is impossible
2502000	2504000	to invite
2504000	2506000	for example
2506000	2508000	Yunmeng Wuji
2508000	2510000	and secondly
2510000	2512000	they can't
2512000	2514000	go to too many cities
2514000	2516000	for example
2516000	2518000	more than 15 or 20 cities
2518000	2520000	because they can't afford
2520000	2522000	and when it comes to local
2522000	2524000	they don't really
2524000	2526000	have the human resources
2526000	2528000	to support
2528000	2530000	local performances
2530000	2532000	so the director
2532000	2534000	told me
2534000	2536000	a very important concept
2536000	2538000	which is the diplomatic issue
2538000	2540000	he told me
2540000	2542000	in the U.S.
2542000	2544000	the church
2544000	2546000	is just an auxiliary
2546000	2548000	they are very grateful
2548000	2550000	to the U.S.
2550000	2552000	Taiwan Bridge
2552000	2554000	because the Taiwan Bridge
2554000	2556000	these groups
2556000	2558000	when they go to the local
2558000	2560000	although the church
2560000	2562000	will pay for the food
2562000	2564000	but the local
2564000	2566000	for example
2566000	2568000	celebration
2568000	2570000	these groups
2570000	2572000	are not hosted
2572000	2574000	because the U.S.
2574000	2576000	network
2576000	2578000	is not enough
2578000	2580000	so you can see
2580000	2582000	this is not
2582000	2584000	like we are
2584000	2586000	helping the Taiwan Bridge
2586000	2588000	like we are
2588000	2590000	assisting
2590000	2592000	the Taiwan Bridge
2592000	2594000	I think it is the opposite
2594000	2596000	the Taiwan Bridge
2596000	2598000	the Taiwan Bridge
2598000	2600000	is very important
2600000	2602000	for Taiwan
2602000	2604000	but the church
2604000	2606000	is not enough
2606000	2608000	and they can't
2608000	2610000	do it well
2610000	2612000	so we need to rely on
2612000	2614000	the Taiwan Bridge
2614000	2616000	like I interviewed
2616000	2618000	a person
2618000	2620000	he said
2620000	2622000	the church
2622000	2624000	pays for the local
2624000	2626000	the local
2626000	2628000	they pay for the local
2628000	2630000	he said
2630000	2632000	they don't ask for money
2632000	2634000	from the government
2634000	2636000	they pay for the local
2636000	2638000	for example
2638000	2640000	this year
2640000	2642000	there is a cooperation
2642000	2644000	with the Taiwan Bridge Committee
2644000	2646000	but I know
2646000	2648000	the main
2648000	2650000	teacher
2650000	2652000	he is not
2652000	2654000	from the Taiwan Bridge Committee
2654000	2656000	he is a Taiwanese
2656000	2658000	living in the U.S.
2658000	2660000	he likes Taiwan
2660000	2662000	he wants to help
2662000	2664000	the U.S.
2664000	2666000	so he used
2666000	2668000	his own money
2668000	2670000	to pay for the local
2670000	2672000	everything is his own
2672000	2674000	so I think
2674000	2676000	this is what I want to
2676000	2678000	develop
2678000	2680000	in Taiwan
2680000	2682000	like my friend
2682000	2684000	in Portland
2684000	2686000	every year
2686000	2688000	there is a committee
2688000	2690000	to discuss
2690000	2692000	to raise funds
2692000	2694000	in May
2694000	2696000	they bought the tickets
2696000	2698000	for 5 months
2698000	2700000	but usually
2700000	2702000	they need to pay
2702000	2704000	for the tickets
2704000	2706000	they usually
2706000	2708000	buy the most expensive
2708000	2710000	tickets
2710000	2712000	they didn't go in
2712000	2714000	so a group of Taiwanese
2714000	2716000	because it's
2716000	2718000	12.52pm
2718000	2720000	there is still
2720000	2722000	10-15 minutes
2722000	2724000	so let me remind you
2724000	2726000	sorry
2726000	2728000	I can't finish
2728000	2730000	so I think
2730000	2732000	I want to develop
2732000	2734000	but I don't know
2734000	2736000	where to go
2736000	2738000	so I want to emphasize
2738000	2740000	Taiwan's government
2740000	2742000	is in a difficult situation
2742000	2744000	and needs Taiwan's help
2744000	2746000	I want to emphasize
2746000	2748000	Taiwan's organization
2748000	2750000	is very strong
2750000	2752000	so I want to
2752000	2754000	answer the question
2754000	2756000	what is the problem of culture
2756000	2758000	I observed
2758000	2760000	so many different places
2760000	2762000	doing this
2762000	2764000	I found a few problems
2764000	2766000	these three questions
2766000	2768000	I think they all answer
2768000	2770000	what is culture
2770000	2772000	how do you define it
2772000	2774000	and what is Taiwan culture
2774000	2776000	the second question
2776000	2778000	I found it very interesting
2778000	2780000	I read the Taiwan public opinion
2780000	2782000	in the Taiwan-US traditional week
2782000	2784000	just started
2784000	2786000	not long
2786000	2788000	there was a discussion
2788000	2790000	the Taiwan-US traditional week
2790000	2792000	the American people want to promote Taiwan culture
2792000	2794000	and write books
2794000	2796000	and cut paper
2796000	2798000	what is the difference
2798000	2800000	this is a very interesting question
2800000	2802000	this problem still exists in Taiwan
2802000	2804000	so we say Taiwan culture
2804000	2806000	Taiwan is different from China
2806000	2808000	but where is the boundary
2808000	2810000	where is the boundary
2810000	2812000	if we are in the US
2812000	2814000	we want to promote Taiwan culture
2814000	2816000	if our agenda
2816000	2818000	is to distinguish Taiwan from China
2818000	2820000	how should we navigate
2820000	2822000	how should we navigate
2822000	2824000	to make the boundary
2824000	2826000	very obvious
2826000	2828000	so people know
2828000	2830000	this is different
2830000	2832000	my observation
2832000	2834000	I don't think this is a good way
2834000	2836000	but I found
2836000	2838000	we don't do it
2838000	2840000	we don't do it
2840000	2842000	we don't do it
2842000	2844000	we don't do it
2844000	2846000	we don't do it
2846000	2848000	we don't do it
2878000	2880000	what is left of Taiwan culture
2880000	2882000	isn't Chinese culture
2882000	2884000	a part of Taiwan culture
2884000	2886000	I think this is a problem
2886000	2888000	even in Taiwan
2888000	2890000	you can't make it clear
2890000	2892000	this continues to the US
2892000	2894000	I saw some people
2894000	2896000	for example
2896000	2898000	they invited Taiwanese aboriginals
2898000	2900000	this is different from Chinese culture
2900000	2902000	these kinds of attempts
2902000	2904000	are to make the boundary
2904000	2906000	but my question is
2906000	2908000	what is the higher priority
2908000	2910000	what is the main agenda
2910000	2912000	to make the boundary
2912000	2914000	first
2914000	2916000	to make the boundary
2916000	2918000	is the solution the best
2918000	2920000	second
2920000	2922000	is the boundary
2922000	2924000	that important
2924000	2926000	isn't Chinese culture a part of Taiwan culture
2926000	2928000	second
2928000	2930000	this is related to culture
2930000	2932000	I myself
2932000	2934000	I saw a lot of
2934000	2936000	photos of the traditional week
2936000	2938000	and their annual activities
2938000	2940000	a lot of people would record
2940000	2942000	a lot of times
2942000	2944000	I would find it funny
2944000	2946000	I had a discussion with a friend last year
2946000	2948000	he was in San Francisco
2948000	2950000	he was in Union Square
2950000	2952000	he was passing by
2952000	2954000	he wanted to see
2954000	2956000	because I'm Taiwanese
2956000	2958000	he saw a big
2958000	2960000	dragon
2960000	2962000	with three dragons on top
2962000	2964000	his face was shaking
2964000	2966000	and he left
2966000	2968000	he was like what is this
2968000	2970000	Taiwanese culture
2970000	2972000	my second question mark
2972000	2974000	to promote
2974000	2976000	Taiwanese culture
2976000	2978000	this kind of festival
2978000	2980000	you will find a lot of times
2980000	2982000	if the organizer is not self-aware
2982000	2984000	he will end up
2984000	2986000	repeating
2986000	2988000	the American
2988000	2990000	mainstream society
2990000	2992000	and the superficial
2992000	2994000	image of Taiwan
2994000	2996000	the patriotic
2996000	2998000	image
2998000	3000000	Taiwan is bubble tea
3000000	3002000	Taiwan is stinky tofu
3002000	3004000	Taiwan is inviting aboriginals to perform
3004000	3006000	and inviting
3006000	3008000	Taiwanese to sing
3008000	3010000	Taiwanese songs
3010000	3012000	this is Taiwan
3012000	3014000	but if an organizer
3014000	3016000	is organizing a cultural event
3016000	3018000	his imagination
3018000	3020000	I would
3020000	3022000	I would feel
3022000	3024000	scary
3024000	3026000	because
3026000	3028000	you are
3028000	3030000	inside
3030000	3032000	what is this
3032000	3034000	what is his influence
3034000	3036000	what is he
3036000	3038000	when you are doing this
3038000	3040000	when you are organizing
3040000	3042000	does he make you know yourself better
3042000	3044000	or does he
3044000	3046000	just
3046000	3048000	restrict
3048000	3050000	your imagination
3050000	3052000	I think this question
3052000	3054000	is important
3054000	3056000	I am not
3056000	3058000	from
3058000	3060000	many events
3060000	3062000	I can see
3062000	3064000	some hope
3064000	3066000	some people
3066000	3068000	I talked to
3068000	3070000	they told me
3070000	3072000	for example
3072000	3074000	Dr. Tsai
3074000	3076000	he does a lot of
3076000	3078000	events
3078000	3080000	and he feels
3080000	3082000	in his events
3082000	3084000	he wants to
3084000	3086000	emphasize this
3086000	3088000	he wants to
3088000	3090000	show what is
3090000	3092000	Taiwanese culture
3092000	3094000	he cares about
3094000	3096000	events
3096000	3098000	he invites people to
3098000	3100000	spend a lot of time
3100000	3102000	researching
3102000	3104000	what stories
3104000	3106000	are unknown
3106000	3108000	to Taiwanese
3108000	3110000	Taiwan's latest research
3110000	3112000	on history and culture
3112000	3114000	and new discoveries
3114000	3116000	new debates
3116000	3118000	he is willing to
3118000	3120000	include these
3120000	3122000	he does not want to
3122000	3124000	to a superficial event
3124000	3126000	Taiwan is stinky tofu
3126000	3128000	Taiwan is Xiao Long Bao
3128000	3130000	Taiwan is traditional dance
3130000	3132000	we drink bubble tea
3132000	3134000	we are Taiwanese
3134000	3136000	he thinks
3136000	3138000	this kind of
3138000	3140000	cultural imagination
3140000	3142000	is a pity
3142000	3144000	and superficial
3144000	3146000	I have seen this kind of attempt
3146000	3148000	another attempt
3148000	3150000	this is Taiwanese American
3150000	3152000	heritage week
3152000	3154000	not Taiwan culture
3154000	3156000	heritage week
3156000	3158000	I tried to ask them
3158000	3160000	this is Taiwanese American
3160000	3162000	heritage week
3162000	3164000	not Taiwan heritage week
3164000	3166000	how do you draw the boundary
3166000	3168000	and distinguish it
3168000	3170000	of course
3170000	3172000	on the one hand
3172000	3174000	Taiwan culture is part of
3174000	3176000	Taiwanese American
3176000	3178000	you do not need to
3178000	3180000	clearly say
3180000	3182000	which part is Taiwanese American
3182000	3184000	which part is Taiwan
3184000	3186000	this problem may not exist
3186000	3188000	for the older generation
3188000	3190000	this problem may not be an issue
3190000	3192000	on the other hand
3192000	3194000	I heard some young people
3194000	3196000	willing to think about this
3196000	3198000	they will say yes
3198000	3200000	I think Taiwanese American
3200000	3202000	is a little different from
3202000	3204000	Taiwan's culture
3204000	3206000	how should I
3206000	3208000	in such a cultural festival
3208000	3210000	to show the difference
3210000	3212000	they will start
3212000	3214000	some people
3214000	3216000	they were born in the United States
3216000	3218000	and then use English
3218000	3220000	to write their memories
3220000	3222000	of Taiwan
3222000	3224000	what is their imagination of Taiwan
3224000	3226000	draw or write
3226000	3228000	some short articles
3228000	3230000	use that way
3230000	3232000	to present
3232000	3234000	Taiwanese American
3234000	3236000	as a very special
3236000	3238000	he is not Chinese American
3238000	3240000	he is not Taiwanese
3240000	3242000	a very special existence
3242000	3244000	to see such a common sense
3244000	3246000	it exists
3246000	3248000	to respond to
3248000	3250000	what is the culture
3250000	3252000	I think I still think
3252000	3254000	that point
3254000	3256000	Taiwan culture
3256000	3258000	how do you distinguish
3258000	3260000	Taiwan culture from Chinese culture
3260000	3262000	I think this will be an issue
3262000	3264000	the second issue
3264000	3266000	you can apply
3266000	3268000	to a bigger issue
3268000	3270000	when doing the creative industry
3270000	3272000	you have to think
3272000	3274000	how can I push further
3274000	3276000	to let
3276000	3278000	deeper understanding
3278000	3280000	or imagination about culture
3280000	3282000	not just to copy
3282000	3284000	the imaginations of the mainstream society
3284000	3286000	I don't know
3286000	3288000	if I have answered
3288000	3290000	your question
3290000	3292000	for me
3292000	3294000	my question is
3294000	3296000	I believe most people
3296000	3298000	can agree that
3298000	3300000	Taiwan culture
3300000	3302000	even Taiwanese
3302000	3304000	are trying to define
3306000	3308000	in such a situation
3308000	3310000	we are in the US
3310000	3312000	actually abroad
3312000	3314000	to hold a Taiwan culture
3314000	3316000	promotion
3316000	3318000	in 1998
3318000	3320000	we have been promoting
3320000	3322000	calligraphy, pen and paper
3322000	3324000	xiaolongbao
3324000	3326000	in the next 8 years
3326000	3328000	we have been promoting
3328000	3330000	calligraphy, pen and paper
3330000	3332000	in the next 8 years
3332000	3334000	it is not stable
3334000	3336000	we are still
3336000	3338000	searching for
3338000	3340000	identity
3340000	3342000	to hold such an event
3342000	3344000	is it positive
3344000	3346000	or negative
3346000	3348000	I would say
3348000	3350000	identity
3350000	3352000	this concept
3352000	3354000	is always flowing
3354000	3356000	so I don't think
3356000	3358000	it has to be
3358000	3360000	stable
3362000	3364000	but we have been
3364000	3366000	talking
3366000	3368000	there may be
3368000	3370000	conflicts
3370000	3372000	finally we found
3372000	3374000	a consensus
3374000	3376000	we all agree
3376000	3378000	I think
3378000	3380000	it is
3380000	3382000	so you can find
3382000	3384000	for example
3384000	3386000	indigenous people
3386000	3388000	you can say
3388000	3390000	it is politically correct
3390000	3392000	but it is
3392000	3394000	kind of
3394000	3396000	after 30 years
3396000	3398000	we have been
3398000	3400000	discussing
3400000	3402000	it has become
3402000	3404000	an important
3404000	3406000	cultural icon
3406000	3408000	or heritage
3408000	3410000	so I would say
3410000	3412000	identity building
3412000	3414000	identity
3418000	3420000	identity building
3420000	3422000	it is not
3422000	3424000	a consensus
3424000	3426000	it is
3426000	3428000	a process
3428000	3430000	a process of discussion
3430000	3432000	it is not
3432000	3434000	a clean
3434000	3436000	it has many
3436000	3438000	grey areas
3438000	3440000	but finally we found
3440000	3442000	a consensus
3442000	3444000	we all agree
3444000	3446000	there are many
3446000	3448000	these things will
3448000	3450000	continue to move forward
3452000	3454000	I don't know if I answered
3454000	3456000	your question
3456000	3458000	thank you
3458000	3460000	because of the time
3460000	3462000	you can
3462000	3464000	wrap up for 3 minutes
3464000	3466000	thank you
3466000	3468000	so
3468000	3470000	my point is
3470000	3472000	when I look at
3472000	3474000	a cultural
3474000	3476000	traditional week
3476000	3478000	for me
3478000	3480000	there are two important things
3480000	3482000	one is
3482000	3484000	three
3484000	3486000	why it is important
3486000	3488000	I think
3488000	3490000	we should not
3490000	3492000	give up this opportunity
3492000	3494000	to introduce Taiwan to the US
3494000	3496000	because it is
3496000	3498000	not only
3498000	3500000	important for
3500000	3502000	diversity
3502000	3504000	it is also
3504000	3506000	a tool
3506000	3508000	to promote
3508000	3510000	Taiwan
3510000	3512000	so
3512000	3514000	if
3514000	3516000	I become an organizer
3516000	3518000	it will be
3518000	3520000	an important
3520000	3522000	part of my agenda
3522000	3524000	so
3524000	3526000	the second
3526000	3528000	is
3528000	3530000	how to
3530000	3532000	encourage
3532000	3534000	and organize
3534000	3536000	how to
3536000	3538000	gather our
3538000	3540000	fellow citizens
3540000	3542000	to have
3542000	3544000	more
3544000	3546000	interaction
3546000	3548000	to know
3548000	3550000	who we are
3550000	3552000	I think
3552000	3554000	these are
3554000	3556000	two important things
3556000	3558000	the third is
3558000	3560000	how to help
3560000	3562000	Taiwan to
3562000	3564000	promote diplomacy
3564000	3566000	because
3566000	3568000	the US is still
3568000	3570000	the place with the most
3570000	3572000	Taiwanese
3572000	3574000	if we can do well
3574000	3576000	I think this model
3576000	3578000	can be applied
3578000	3580000	Taiwan has a lot of
3580000	3582000	important work
3582000	3584000	and meaningful
3584000	3586000	things to do
3586000	3588000	anyway
3588000	3590000	thank you
3596000	3598000	thank you
3598000	3600000	for the wonderful speech
3600000	3602000	before we end
3602000	3604000	I want to ask
3604000	3606000	if there are any questions
3606000	3608000	we can chat
3608000	3610000	if there are
3610000	3612000	any questions
3612000	3614000	we can chat
3616000	3618000	Emma left
3618000	3620000	but she said
3620000	3622000	LA and Mazu temple
3622000	3624000	yes
3624000	3626000	she also
3626000	3628000	invited
3628000	3630000	the master
3630000	3632000	what was his name
3632000	3634000	anyway
3634000	3636000	is it Oscar
3636000	3638000	yes
3638000	3640000	I don't know if this is a question
3640000	3642000	or an idea
3644000	3646000	when everyone
3646000	3648000	is promoting the traditional state
3648000	3650000	and the theme of Taiwan
3650000	3652000	I think
3652000	3654000	the biggest difficulty is
3654000	3656000	young people in Taiwan
3656000	3658000	don't want to
3658000	3660000	come out to help
3660000	3662000	rely on the old people
3662000	3664000	old people are pushing
3664000	3666000	is that enough
3670000	3672000	I don't know
3672000	3674000	I think my question
3674000	3676000	is more like
3676000	3678000	how to make more people
3678000	3680000	willing to promote this
3680000	3682000	instead of these Taiwanese
3684000	3686000	I will say
3686000	3688000	remind everyone
3688000	3690000	you are sharing your Gmail
3690000	3692000	you can turn off
3692000	3694000	the sharing screen
3694000	3696000	luckily I didn't
3696000	3698000	post it on Facebook
3698000	3700000	remind everyone
3700000	3702000	you can answer
3702000	3704000	yes
3704000	3706000	I think this is
3706000	3708000	a good question
3708000	3710000	I talked to some elders
3710000	3712000	because the Taiwanese community
3712000	3714000	has a very important crisis
3714000	3716000	the elderly have retired
3716000	3718000	they are old
3718000	3720000	it's like
3720000	3722000	there are generations
3722000	3724000	of problems
3724000	3726000	different ideas
3726000	3728000	so I will say
3728000	3730000	young people
3730000	3732000	don't come
3732000	3734000	it's not just young people
3734000	3736000	it's also
3736000	3738000	old people
3738000	3740000	for example
3740000	3742000	I can't accept
3742000	3744000	the elderly
3744000	3746000	who talk to me
3746000	3748000	we grew up
3748000	3750000	in the era of
3750000	3752000	martial law
3752000	3754000	we are the generation of
3754000	3756000	sunflowers
3756000	3758000	even if you are a
3758000	3760000	pro-democracy
3760000	3762000	you talk to me
3762000	3764000	like an old green man
3764000	3766000	I can't accept
3766000	3768000	the anti-KMT
3768000	3770000	the KMT is very
3770000	3772000	sexist and racist
3772000	3774000	I can't talk to them
3774000	3776000	will it be recorded?
3776000	3778000	will they hear?
3778000	3780000	hello?
3780000	3782000	yes
3782000	3784000	yes
3784000	3786000	but
3786000	3788000	if you have
3788000	3790000	something you can't talk about
3790000	3792000	wave your hand
3792000	3794000	and tell me to cut it
3794000	3796000	I don't know if we have a name
3796000	3798000	the answer is
3798000	3800000	young people don't come
3800000	3802000	because
3802000	3804000	young people and old people
3804000	3806000	have different ways
3806000	3808000	of doing things
3808000	3810000	I know many young people
3810000	3812000	they are willing to
3812000	3814000	do things for free
3814000	3816000	but they
3816000	3818000	will leave
3818000	3820000	they are not happy
3820000	3822000	because they don't think
3822000	3824000	they should be treated like this
3824000	3826000	so I think this problem
3826000	3828000	is the internal organization
3828000	3830000	of different generations
3830000	3832000	young people
3832000	3834000	I am very busy
3834000	3836000	you want me to do a lot of volunteer work
3836000	3838000	it depends on my ability
3838000	3840000	I have to work
3840000	3842000	I have to write papers
3842000	3844000	I have to do unpaid work
3844000	3846000	if I have good physical strength
3846000	3848000	I don't have to worry
3848000	3850000	one of my worries
3850000	3852000	I will be willing to commit more
3852000	3854000	but at this stage
3854000	3856000	there is no way
3856000	3858000	let alone those who have children
3858000	3860000	young people don't come
3860000	3862000	I think our job is
3862000	3864000	to create a space
3864000	3866000	this space is very friendly
3866000	3868000	a very warm space
3868000	3870000	it's ok if you cannot join now
3870000	3872000	it's ok
3872000	3874000	we understand
3874000	3876000	but I will tell you
3876000	3878000	this space is always welcome
3878000	3880000	if you have time today
3880000	3882000	you can come
3882000	3884000	as an organizer
3884000	3886000	I will position myself
3886000	3888000	I am not saying
3888000	3890000	why don't you come
3890000	3892000	why don't you love Taiwan
3892000	3894000	I think this is too harsh
3894000	3896000	because everyone's life agenda
3896000	3898000	different time points
3898000	3900000	their tasks are different
3900000	3902000	yes
3902000	3904000	understand
3904000	3906000	thank you
3906000	3908000	thank you Oscar and Qiqi
3908000	3910000	for your answers
3910000	3912000	I want to ask
3912000	3914000	one last question
3914000	3916000	if not
3916000	3918000	we are ready
3918000	3920000	to end today's speech
3920000	3922000	do you have any feedback
3922000	3924000	let's ask if there are any questions
3924000	3926000	yes
3928000	3930000	I will count to three
3930000	3932000	1
3932000	3934000	2
3934000	3936000	3
3936000	3938000	feedback
3938000	3940000	do you have any
3940000	3942000	points to add
3944000	3946000	I have a suggestion
3946000	3948000	I think you asked
3948000	3950000	a lot of questions
3950000	3952000	these questions
3952000	3954000	are actually
3954000	3956000	related
3956000	3958000	but
3958000	3960000	I think
3960000	3962000	these questions can exist independently
3962000	3964000	so if you
3964000	3966000	say them all
3966000	3968000	like a group
3968000	3970000	without a specific
3970000	3972000	order
3972000	3974000	connect them all
3974000	3976000	actually
3976000	3978000	the most important question
3978000	3980000	you have to ask
3980000	3982000	is not that clear
3982000	3984000	so I think
3984000	3986000	you may have to
3986000	3988000	make a choice
3990000	3992000	these materials
3992000	3994000	the question you want to ask
3994000	3996000	at least
3996000	3998000	in this article
3998000	4000000	you may want to ask another question
4000000	4002000	but you can answer
4002000	4004000	from these materials
4004000	4006000	and you want to use this question
4006000	4008000	to ask the question of the paper
4008000	4010000	that's another question
4010000	4012000	but I think for a presentation
4012000	4014000	like you want to write to the newspaper
4014000	4016000	you may have to think about
4016000	4018000	a very clear question
4018000	4020000	and you have to give up some
4020000	4022000	secondary but these materials
4022000	4024000	can also answer the question
4024000	4026000	otherwise the structure
4026000	4028000	will not be so clear
4028000	4030000	there are a lot of materials
4030000	4032000	you have to tie up
4032000	4034000	the most important thing
4034000	4036000	very good advice
4036000	4038000	I think
4038000	4040000	this research is very interesting
4040000	4042000	because actually
4042000	4044000	I had a few Taiwanese friends
4044000	4046000	who came to the US
4046000	4048000	they had a meeting in the US
4048000	4050000	and they did business in Taiwan
4050000	4052000	they wanted to promote
4052000	4054000	Taiwan's exquisite agricultural products
4054000	4056000	to the world
4056000	4058000	such as milk and coffee
4058000	4060000	and fruit jam
4060000	4062000	the exquisite processing of fruit
4062000	4064000	of course they are very
4064000	4066000	recognized by Taiwan
4066000	4068000	but we talked about
4068000	4070000	what is the Taiwanese culture
4070000	4072000	for example
4072000	4074000	a group of Chinese
4074000	4076000	went to New York
4076000	4078000	and made a Chinatown
4078000	4080000	are these cultures
4080000	4082000	American culture
4082000	4084000	if so
4084000	4086000	how do we define
4086000	4088000	Taiwan culture
4088000	4090000	I think this is
4090000	4092000	a very important issue
4092000	4094000	of course I have no answer
4094000	4096000	and I'm not an expert
4096000	4098000	but I think this kind of research
4098000	4100000	is very important
4100000	4102000	to all Taiwanese
4102000	4104000	so I think it's great
4104000	4106000	I can understand
4106000	4108000	that kind of
4108000	4110000	in a hurry to cut
4110000	4112000	the workers
4112000	4114000	in a hurry to cut
4114000	4116000	the traditional Chinese
4116000	4118000	Chinese characters
4118000	4120000	I can understand
4120000	4122000	their anxiety
4122000	4124000	because you are
4124000	4126000	doing a political battle
4126000	4128000	you want to establish a
4128000	4130000	discourse as a weapon
4130000	4132000	for your political agenda
4132000	4134000	you have to be very careful
4134000	4136000	anything that can weaken your argument
4136000	4138000	you have to figure out a way to get rid of it
4138000	4140000	so I can understand their anxiety
4140000	4142000	and their persistence
4142000	4144000	but
4144000	4146000	but I think
4146000	4148000	I can accept
4148000	4150000	and I can understand
4150000	4152000	and I think it's a process
4152000	4154000	when Taiwan is really established
4154000	4156000	these things can all come back
4156000	4158000	now
4158000	4160000	you can only let it be
4160000	4162000	vague
4162000	4164000	you don't have to mention it
4164000	4166000	you don't have to talk about it
4166000	4168000	you can talk about it
4198000	4200000	you can talk about it
4200000	4202000	assimilate
4202000	4204000	assimilate
4204000	4208000	with the English
4208000	4210000	family
4210000	4212000	family
4212000	4214000	family
4214000	4216000	family
4218000	4220000	family
4220000	4222000	family
4222000	4224000	family
4224000	4226000	family
4226000	4228000	process
4228000	4230000	as an organizer
4230000	4232000	as a political organizer
4232000	4234000	it will be
4234000	4236000	considered as a
4236000	4238000	can throw away
4238000	4240000	can
4240000	4242000	can use, can not use
4242000	4244000	depends on different context
4244000	4246000	when it's useful, you use it
4246000	4248000	when it's not useful, you keep it
4248000	4250000	no need to build a
4250000	4252000	unbreakable
4252000	4254000	Taiwan culture is what
4254000	4256000	I think you don't have to
4256000	4258000	set yourself to death
4258000	4260000	you don't have that flexibility
4260000	4262000	to swim in different
4262000	4264000	different context
4264000	4266000	Oscar
4266000	4268000	seems to have a question or not
4268000	4270000	seems
4270000	4272000	no, I just think
4272000	4274000	this question, I also think for a long time
4274000	4276000	then I think
4276000	4278000	uh
4278000	4280000	should say that in my experience
4280000	4282000	is
4282000	4284000	I think
4284000	4286000	it is more likely to
4286000	4288000	make Taiwan into a
4288000	4290000	speaking
4290000	4292000	uh
4292000	4294000	is a little bit of an
4294000	4296000	assimilated society
4296000	4298000	to let people know that Taiwanese people are
4298000	4300000	what people have, for example
4300000	4302000	for example
4302000	4304000	last week we just
4304000	4306000	held a speech
4306000	4308000	and then our theme
4308000	4310000	is to put all kinds of people
4310000	4312000	in the picture
4312000	4314000	he is a Japanese
4314000	4316000	so he has his own
4316000	4318000	Japanese elementary school students
4318000	4320000	and his grandmother is Chinese
4320000	4322000	and then his
4322000	4324000	anyway, there are all kinds of people
4324000	4326000	different races over there
4326000	4328000	and then our theme at that time
4328000	4330000	is to define it as Taiwan is
4330000	4332000	everything
4332000	4334000	because we are
4334000	4336000	an island, it is impossible to have only one thing
4336000	4338000	everywhere
4338000	4340000	this is the influence of many cultures
4340000	4342000	so you see a certain
4342000	4344000	aspect of Taiwan, like you said
4344000	4346000	Mazu, in fact, it is also the people of the south
4346000	4348000	Mazu is also from Meizhou
4348000	4350000	that is not Taiwan, of course you can
4350000	4352000	seriously say that the real Taiwan is also the indigenous people
4352000	4354000	that you are in the indigenous people is actually from the south
4354000	4356000	to the Yuxin side, it is also the real Taiwan
4356000	4358000	that is not
4358000	4360000	so I mean
4360000	4362000	instead of going to find a
4362000	4364000	fact, like you just said
4364000	4366000	is to find a majority
4366000	4368000	then I think instead of
4368000	4370000	finding a very clear
4370000	4372000	subject, it is better to be very honest
4372000	4374000	so that everyone knows
4374000	4376000	Taiwan is everything
4376000	4378000	you see is not a whole
4378000	4380000	and then we have
4380000	4382000	elements of Chinese, we have elements of Japanese
4382000	4384000	even the Dutch
4384000	4386000	and Spanish
4386000	4388000	really
4388000	4390000	just an
4390000	4392000	impression
4392000	4394000	I agree with this
4394000	4396000	this is the controversy of the textbook
4396000	4398000	although the KMT has been saying
4398000	4400000	that the KMT is going to China
4400000	4402000	but in fact, the KMT is hoping to
4402000	4404000	you can't say
4404000	4406000	that the KMT brought in something wrong
4406000	4408000	right?
4408000	4410000	How do you navigate that direction today?
4410000	4412000	You look at the world
4412000	4414000	from a different angle, if you look at Taiwan
4414000	4416000	from a diversified perspective
4416000	4418000	you will find that it
4418000	4420000	is not just a Han society
4420000	4422000	it is not
4422000	4424000	just the history of the past
4424000	4426000	great China
4426000	4428000	made it into a
4428000	4430000	history written from the perspective of the Han people
4436000	4438000	that
4438000	4440000	are there any other questions?
4440000	4442000	because I think the time
4442000	4444000	is actually almost
4444000	4446000	that
4446000	4448000	looks like everyone
4448000	4450000	should have learned a lot today
4450000	4452000	like me
4452000	4454000	I heard a lot of things
4454000	4456000	at the end of the speech
4456000	4458000	I want to talk a little bit
4458000	4460000	because I was listening to your speech
4460000	4462000	I suddenly thought of a little story
4462000	4464000	I started from high school
4464000	4466000	I participated in the
4466000	4468000	indigenous tribe service
4468000	4470000	I basically go there every year
4470000	4472000	we are in the camp
4472000	4474000	every time it is about a week
4474000	4476000	every time we go to the camp
4476000	4478000	there will be a show
4478000	4480000	and then I was
4480000	4482000	the first year I went up the mountain
4482000	4484000	I was very shocked
4484000	4486000	because the first year we let the children
4486000	4488000	decide what to play
4488000	4490000	and then they played the theme
4490000	4492000	I think it's amazing
4492000	4494000	although they are all
4494000	4496000	very playful
4496000	4498000	but you can see the context of their life
4498000	4500000	for example, there is a play called
4500000	4502000	Grandpa is drunk
4502000	4504000	or the sister who sells incense
4504000	4506000	or father beats sister
4506000	4508000	you will go
4508000	4510000	although they are very
4510000	4512000	if they are free to play
4512000	4514000	they will talk about these things
4514000	4516000	so I thought
4516000	4518000	every year to hold a traditional week in Taiwan
4518000	4520000	is like an identity
4520000	4522000	a time point
4522000	4524000	so if you see
4524000	4526000	activities or slogans used
4526000	4528000	in this traditional week
4528000	4530000	more or less
4530000	4532000	reflects the identity of
4532000	4534000	our subgroup
4534000	4536000	I think it's very interesting
4536000	4538000	after listening to your speech
4538000	4540000	when they write their own things
4540000	4542000	they will say
4542000	4544000	as long as the topic they write is
4544000	4546000	we let them decide
4546000	4548000	what to play
4548000	4550000	we don't care
4550000	4552000	let them play
4552000	4554000	so it can be imagined
4554000	4556000	that those children
4556000	4558000	from Taiwan National High School
4558000	4560000	what they can think of
4560000	4562000	must be the most direct theme in life
4562000	4564000	they can immediately think of
4564000	4566000	who the grandpa beats
4566000	4568000	or who the father is drunk
4568000	4570000	you can imagine
4570000	4572000	although you can't see
4572000	4574000	but these are their life
4574000	4576000	and they are exposed to these things every day
4576000	4578000	this sharing is great
4578000	4580000	just like I just mentioned
4580000	4582000	a question
4582000	4584000	if you don't reflect
4584000	4586000	will you just repeat
4586000	4588000	what the mainstream society
4588000	4590000	imagines of you
4590000	4592000	I think
4592000	4594000	the culture they can imagine
4594000	4596000	is very different
4596000	4598000	from the story
4598000	4600000	you have heard
4600000	4602000	and I think
4602000	4604000	this diversity
4604000	4606000	should be brought out
4606000	4608000	but I think
4608000	4610000	I have organized
4610000	4612000	things
4612000	4614000	and when you are
4614000	4616000	very busy
4616000	4618000	sometimes you can't think
4618000	4620000	just like the past
4620000	4622000	just let it be
4622000	4624000	it's simple
4624000	4626000	there is a network
4626000	4628000	you can't be sure
4628000	4630000	whether it will be popular
4630000	4632000	there are all kinds of considerations
4632000	4634000	so I think
4634000	4636000	you will continue
4636000	4638000	the imagination of the past
4638000	4640000	but this is very dangerous
4640000	4642000	because it simplifies a lot of things
4642000	4644000	and what's worse
4644000	4646000	if it just reinforces
4646000	4648000	it doesn't help
4648000	4650000	the mainstream society to understand Taiwan
4650000	4652000	it's harmful
4654000	4656000	so
4656000	4658000	that's it for today
4658000	4660000	thank you
4660000	4662000	thank you
4662000	4664000	I'm looking forward to it
4664000	4666000	I feel like
4666000	4668000	I'm the type of person who keeps talking
4668000	4670000	now I have more inspiration
4672000	4674000	keep writing
4674000	4676000	that's it
4676000	4678000	thank you for your participation
4678000	4680000	that's the end of the speech
4680000	4682000	you can leave the chat room
4682000	4684000	good night
4684000	4686000	next time I will talk about
4686000	4688000	the South China Sea issue
4690000	4692000	and the Chinese
4692000	4694000	good luck
4694000	4696000	you too, bye
4696000	4698000	good night
