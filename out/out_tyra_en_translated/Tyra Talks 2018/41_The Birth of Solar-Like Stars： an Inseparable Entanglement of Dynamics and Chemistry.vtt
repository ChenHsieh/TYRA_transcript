00:00.000 --> 00:19.000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are approaching the end of the year, so we may not have a speech next week.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Yang Yaolun to tell us about his doctoral research.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is now a doctoral candidate for the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
In fact, he is about to graduate.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
When he was in college, he graduated from the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin, and then came to the United States to study astronomy.

00:42.000 --> 00:55.000
His specialties and research interests include early-phase star formation, including observations and simulations.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
In his doctoral research career, he has used various telescopes such as Herschel, ALMA, and SOFIA to do his research.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
What is interesting is that he is also the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
What kind of event is this?

01:14.000 --> 01:25.000
They will regularly give speeches to the public on astronomy at the bar.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
They have now grown to more than 250 people attending each time.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

01:36.000 --> 01:49.000
Today, he will talk about the topic of the birth of solar-like stars and the inseparable entanglement of dynamics and chemistry.

01:50.000 --> 02:00.000
Let's welcome Dr. Yang Yaolun to give a speech.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
Thank you.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I have been involved in this project for a long time.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you.

02:12.000 --> 02:21.000
Over the past few years, I have been doing research on star formation at UT Austin.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
I am a 6th-year PhD student at UT Austin.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
My main advisor is Neil Evans.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
We mainly do various observations on star formation.

02:36.000 --> 02:47.000
We use models to explain the physical and chemical phenomena observed in early star formation.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Dr. Yang mentioned SOFIA observations.

02:51.000 --> 03:00.000
What is SOFIA?

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observations for Infrared Astronomy.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
It is an astronomical observatory for infrared.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Why do we use SOFIA for infrared observation?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Because there are a lot of water vapors in the atmosphere.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
These water vapors emit a lot of infrared rays.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
When we observe on the ground, we only observe the water vapors on the earth.

03:27.000 --> 03:37.000
So, many times, we use a telescope, such as Spitzer or Hubble, to observe infrared rays.

03:37.000 --> 03:48.000
If I remember correctly, we can avoid 95% to 99% of water vapors by using a telescope.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
This is SOFIA.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
You can see that SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
You can see that there is a bulge in the middle section of the tail of the plane.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
It is not very clear here.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It is a hole in the middle section.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
A 2.7-meter telescope is placed in the hole.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
When the telescope flies up, the door will open.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
This is how it is observed.

04:21.000 --> 04:40.000
Astronomers and technicians discuss how to make the observation easier to achieve and adjust the strategy in time.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
This is how my advisor and I are going to get on the plane.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
It is very different.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
This is a military airport.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
When you enter the airport, you will go up the stairs.

04:54.000 --> 05:01.000
There is a B-2 bomber in the same airport.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
This is the inside of SOFIA.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
The blue part is the instrument.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
The other side of the closed cabin is the telescope.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
The other side of the telescope is the mirror.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
The other side is the instrument.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
There is a balance on the weight on both sides.

05:27.000 --> 05:42.000
Different instruments, telescopes, and mission operators monitor the observation on these stations.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
This is a very complicated task.

05:45.000 --> 06:00.000
NASA considers every flight of SOFIA as a mission.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
There is a mission director.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
There is a mission briefing before departure.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
This is the route we flew that day.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
We flew from Palmdale, California, about an hour and a half north of LA.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You can see that the route is very strange.

06:19.000 --> 06:27.000
Basically, the route is determined by each arc.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
One arc is for a target.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Here we have six or seven targets.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
The longer, the longer you stay on the celestial body.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Let's move on to today's topic.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Today's topic is mainly about star formation.

06:43.000 --> 06:54.000
How do we understand the dynamics of early planetary orbits and the corresponding chemical changes?

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
This is a picture of our galaxy.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
You can see a lot of these black irregularities in the middle.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
This is what we call Darkland.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
It has a lot of dust.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It is also a higher density place.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
It is also an area where stars are forming.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
If we zoom in to one of them, the Molecular Cloud,

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
It is mainly a star-forming place.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
These black areas are also the so-called dust gathering areas.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
It is a place where stars form early.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
If we switch to infrared light,

07:36.000 --> 07:45.000
You can see that there are a lot of these pillars or even what we call filamentary structures.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
These are from what we imagine as a celestial sphere on Earth.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
It's like a sphere in the sky, but it's not a ball or even a block here.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
It's more like a texture or a filamentary structure.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Then through these filaments,

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Then pull to the middle and then reach a high enough density.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Then trigger the activity of this star formation.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
This is when the star formation occurs.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
You will have a lot of.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Basically, the density will be from 10 to 3 or 10 to 5.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
This is the mole per cubic centimeter.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
It will be quickly multiplied by 10 to the power of 9 to the power of 10 to the power of 4.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
This is a very large number of changes.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
In the process, if you have, um.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
At the beginning, um.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
When the collapse, um.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
You're going to have a little bit of, uh.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
The angular momentum is in the outermost part.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
If you have this smaller angular momentum, it's in a very small area.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
At this time, the degree of rotation is likely to make this.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
The collapse of the star formation is not very effective.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That is to say, your, uh.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
The gas becomes itself to rotate there, not to continue.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Continue, uh.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's sucked into the middle of the star.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
In the process, there will be a lot of.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
We call outflow, and then go.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Go to these, um.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
The high-speed rotation of the matter is released.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And then go in to reduce.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
The angular momentum of the whole system.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
You see the green ones here.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
The matter that looks like a jet is the outflow.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, this is a simulation.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
That is, um, a simulation.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Roughly describe that we are from a filament.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
And then slowly, uh, develop into.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It will start with a filament, and then zoom in.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And then you'll see a star.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
The early shape of the star.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
The situation is a lot of molecules.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Very, very fatal molecules.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
How to be in that state.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
And then, um.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Collapse and then erupt.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
That's what you saw in the picture just now.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
This kind of outflow.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
OK, so you can see this whole process.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Is very, very.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Very big change, and then, um.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Irregular structure.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
So.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
We also found in observation.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
That's what it is.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You can see here, this one.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
The picture behind this black and white picture is.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Uh, the distribution of molecules.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
This is.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And then the different symbols in front of it.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
It means that we are directly observed.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Early star.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Uh, where it appears.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You can see most of it.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Early stars are in, um.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
These molecules.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Uh, it's also a more fatal place, so it's produced.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
So, um.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
We can probably get one of these.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Uh, scenario is to say that you first have a lot of very fatal clouds and dust.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And then through.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
Um, these clouds and dust may slowly or even quickly.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Um.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
It will collapse to the middle and then become.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Uh, a star or a few stars, I don't know.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
So in this process, a very important thing is to say.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, this is probably a very simple one.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Uh, cartoon pattern to express the words is that we have a, uh, a core at the beginning.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
We call pre-stereo core.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Simply put, it's the core before the stellar.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So it's called pre-stereo core.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And then you start to collapse.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
These core collapse to the middle and become, uh.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Uh, in the early days, it was called pro-star.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
So we called this core pro-stereo core.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
At the same time, it may, uh.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Um.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
It produces a lot of, uh, these.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
These flow, this orange side is called the flow.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
What about the evolution?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
These substances.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
The surrounding matter is either sucked into the middle and becomes a part of the star.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Or.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It will be affected by a lot of feedback.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
And then it just.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It's just slowly, uh, dissipated.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And then the rest of you are left with a disk.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Because.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
There's still a lot of matter, um, in the middle.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
The middle part of the high-speed rotation.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
There's no way it's very direct.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
It's sucked into the middle, uh, on the planet.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
So there's a disk.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
What about this side?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
This disk is, um, planet.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
It's where the stars are produced.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So gradually, this disk will slowly evolve into, uh.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Generally, we recognize the planter system.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Just like.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Our solar system, we may be somewhere here.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Okay, um.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So we, uh.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
There's a pretty important one.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Uh, the question is, is this.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
In the early days of this info, from this.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
When you want to produce a pro star.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
What?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Uh, it's like a process like this.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
How much is his time scale?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Okay, um.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
In the pre-status evolution, it's not quite certain now.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
So basically.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Um.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
If a core starts to collapse.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
To become.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Um.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It's about.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
2 million years.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Relatively short.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
From disk to disk, it's about 10 million years.

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
So then a, like our sun, our sun can probably live.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
10 million years.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
So this is probably their, maybe 1% of the time.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
1% of the time.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Then I have another question.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Uh, that's it.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
How do you say this?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Such a process.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
With the limit, for example, is Modern Universe.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Or, for example, Z3, Z5.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Or something like that.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Or these things will only happen in the near future.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So there is no difference.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I'm going to ask you to go in.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, it's actually happening, but it's also happening in the early days.

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
There are even a lot of active research areas that are doing so-called first star, which is the first star that starts the earliest.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
The biggest difference is in.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Uh.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It's in the cold, it's.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Um.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
This core, a dance core, he wants to collapse, he doesn't need.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Uh.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It doesn't have to be dynamic.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
If he is.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Uh.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
The temperature is very high, he is very, his thermal motion is very strong, so he.

14:43.000 --> 14:49.000
His thermal pressure, he can easily be greater than this gravity to him.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
This middle attraction, so.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Um, when the temperature is very high, it is not easy to collapse.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
So he has to be cold enough for him to collapse.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Of course, in the early universe.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Um, I should say, um.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
So how do you make this core cold?

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Usually a very important mechanism is called, uh, radio cooling.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Basically, uh.

15:09.000 --> 15:19.000
Your energy, uh, is absorbed by molecules, and then molecules, molecules, decay, connect, decay, and then turn into radiation, radiation, and then your energy leaves this system.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
So you, you will slowly become cold.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
That molecule or.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Um.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
It's more, except for hydrogen and hydrogen, all of them are quite useful for cooling.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
That's relative to the early universe.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
You will be weaker.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
So, in the early universe, everyone will think that you can become very, you can become very big.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
And then, and then it's easy to form a super big quality, etc.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
And so on.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.000
I believe that we haven't observed anything yet, but there should be a lot of simulation to do this part.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Okay, thank you.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Okay, so, um.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
So, from an observational point of view, we want to know, uh, how does this collapse happen?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
What kind of mold does this material go through?

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
From the outside of this core to the area that is transferred to the inside.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
So, like, in this simulation, it's simulating.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
How does this core collapse?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And then, in the end.

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
You can see that this middle collapse is very, very short at the beginning.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Compared to the time point after that.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
So, uh, you can see that this is the same as the previous one.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You can see that it is very irregular.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
And so it means that there may be a lot of structures in it.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Different structures, different modes.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Depending on the angle you look at, there may be an outflow.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Other places may see info.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
So, um.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
For this info measurement, we mainly want to know how this info started.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
And then how did he do it?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
For example, how far is he?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
How big is it?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
What kind of size scale starts?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
What kind of characteristic?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
For example, how big does this core need to grow at what temperature?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
He will start to have info.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
So what's his process?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
He's with, uh.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Uh, the radius is getting smaller and smaller.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
How fast is it increasing?

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Or even not increasing, so the radius is getting smaller and smaller.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
It may be slower or faster inside.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
So how did he evolve in the end?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It becomes the inside.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
This rotation dominates the region.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
It's like saying, uh, this disk, the early disk.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
A region like that.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
How did he go from the original radio info motion to the rotation?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
So, uh.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Through this view, we want to know what the model of this info is.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
We have a way to write a very good model.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
To simulate this part.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
And then there's this chemical change.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
How to change with this info?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I'll talk a little bit more about this later.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
So now I'm going to mention it.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
And then in a bigger structure.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Uh, this info is actually for our so-called initial mass function.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Very important.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
What is the initial mass function?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
It's a bit like saying.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Uh, we're going to build a galaxy now.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Build a star.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
The star of different quality, how much is the ratio?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
So it's called initial mass function, and it's less likely to be large.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
Small quality stars are more that this one.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Uh.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Mass distribution is the initial mass function.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Uh.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
But these initial mass functions are mainly referring to the stars that have already been generated.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
So we're in the early days.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
In the morning, we really want to know, OK.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
If we have all of these, big, big, small, small, different sizes of core,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
What kind of traces will these cores become?

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
The core mass distribution between them and the initial mass distribution and the star mass distribution.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Uh, what's the change?

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
So we hope to get to know this model in the future.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Can be.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
There are some hints that say, OK, if we have a core, it may be a solar quality.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
That may be how much of it will become, uh.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
How much of the middle star will be 3?

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
So, do we hope that we can use this model to do this research?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Go to approach the problem.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
How do we go from this blue core mass function to this dash line, all kinds of different dash lines?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Uh, initial mass function.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
The other thing is that we're in the early days.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Uh, these are a lot of binary systems.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
And in the general, uh, already formed, we know, uh.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Most of the stars are binary, that is, uh, double stars or more.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Uh, multiple system.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
So we saw that in the early days.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
So you want to know how this early star is how to form this kind of binary system.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
So what's the impact of this binary system on this info?

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Or what kind of criteria do you want to reach?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
What kind of threshold will trigger this kind of fragmentation?

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
Fragment into different two or three or more sources.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
So we want to know.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Uh, this initial condition, what is it?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
How big is it?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
How much is its quality?

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
So I hope we can get to know how much.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
How much mass will be in the middle?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
How much will be in the middle?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Okay, so this is another one.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
This is a very neat system.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
It has three, three, three stars in the middle.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
And then you look at the structure.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
So we still don't know why it's like this.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Okay, the other part is.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Hey, we're like this, this MWC480, this, this disk.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You see a lot of this kind of structure.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Very neat structure.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
But we also see a lot of different, uh, more complex molecules.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
Like this CH3N or this is different.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Um.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Uh, more large-molecule organic compounds.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
So, uh, we were in the early, uh.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
The core stage also saw a lot of these, uh, organic compounds.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
So these.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Organic compounds, because organic compounds, ultimately, they will become.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
It will enter the interstitial atmosphere, and then it may be.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Trigger, uh.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
The main part of the life cycle, because these organic compounds are.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Maybe it's just.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
In addition to speaking more broadly, it may be.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Even the first step of life, or even the seed of life.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So we want to know that in the early star evolution process.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
How do these chemistries change with the information?

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
Um, the same, I'm going to do a lot of explanation in the back.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Okay, so our goal is to find out how this information happened.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Then we are in our current method.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
We are, uh, want to measure, uh, through the distribution of molecules to measure, uh.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Uh, the performance of, uh.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Kinematic structure is simply through.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Its distribution of, uh.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
To analyze that in the end, his, uh, we look at this.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
The path of the movement of the gas inside.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
What does it look like?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Here, if we look at it from this antenna,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
This is a very simplified one on the left.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Um, the look of the core info.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
One of the more common models is the middle.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
Info's velocity is higher, and the outside info's velocity is lower.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
So you can simplify this thing to the right.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
This picture is like this.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Uh, the red one is, um.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Uh, the red one is, um.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
This, uh, the red one is, um.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
We've seen the path.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Because he has this radio motion, so you can.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Um, you can draw a circle like this.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
A trace, and then they, um.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
The line of sight above the two points is the same.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
It means that you will have two, you will have two groups of gas.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
And then they, for you, his, uh.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
What is it called?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
The speed is the same.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
But they are in different places.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Uh, this will cause, uh.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
He will look like he's on the left.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
A profile like this.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Um, yeah, that's about it.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
And then, and then the middle of this, this is the dip.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
It's just, it's just, it's from the outside.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Um, gas in your, maybe it's a cold gas.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
It's a strong radiation that comes in behind the absorption.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Because you're cold in front of you, so you're more likely to be excited.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
Then you will be absorbed by this cold material.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
So you see a dip.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Um, if you have a higher resolution.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
You can see, uh, like this.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
It's like this, if this purple, this.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Shady area refers to our telescope beam.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
Uh, you can see the cold gas outside.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
Uh, gas, but it's still, uh, moving to the center.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
It's still falling on to the center.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
That kind of, uh, cold gas will give you one.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
It's not in the deep, it's not in, uh.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Source velocity of an absorption.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Because he's still far away from you.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
And then he's going to make this redshift absorption on the right.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
That's basically the profile we want to see.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
We want to measure a profile like this.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
And then, um.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
And then when you, uh, in the back, we have this in the middle.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Every collapsing star will have one in the middle.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Um, continuous source, he might be.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Uh, this is the hottest place in there.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
The temperature is very high.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Maybe it's a few thousand degrees.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Then he just gives you a very strong black body radiation.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
So if you put it on, this radiation, this, um.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Radiation continuous radiation will also be absorbed by the cold material in front.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
It's the radiation that's going to be absorbed.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
So in the end, you're going to get something like this.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
This kind of continuous, originally your continuous may be flat.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
But in the middle of this part, uh, because you have material in.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Away from you in this velocity, so you'll be a part of it.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
It's absorbed, so you actually see it.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Uh, observation is observed in your telescope.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
It will probably look like this.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
So, of course, if we're in, uh, according to this.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
The two front and back ends of the continuum.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Go to it.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
When you correct the continuum, you'll get this.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
It's a strange one.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
We'll see, uh, the middle absorption is.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
Less than 0.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
That's actually not because we assume the continuum in the middle.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Still, uh.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
On the surface, it's part of it.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
So we basically want to measure a line profile like this.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
And then analyze it like this line profile.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
To understand that we, uh, uh.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
I've seen the inside of this line of sight.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
I want to ask a question.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Hey, that.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
Why is that profile?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
That is, these profiles are not symmetrical to that.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
OK, OK, this is the part I just skipped.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Uh.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
OK, if we go back to the two circles on the right, this picture.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
Um, in the middle, I write this high high temperature.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
The place is more central.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
And then on both sides, uh.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Large radius is the place where the temperature is lower.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
Then you can imagine it as, um, in this.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Uh.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
In your foreground, in front of you, your foreground is your red.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
The foreground material is basically redshift.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
That is, it is falling to the center, so it is redshift to you.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
But in this redshift part, you will have.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Um, high temperature is behind.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Low temperature is in front.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
It means that you are more like you have a cold thing in front of a hot thing.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
So this cold thing will absorb the back.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
The hot gas gives you the radiation.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Uh, but in the blue shift part, it is in the back side of the envelope.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
You will, you, you don't have this situation.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
It is the cold material behind the hot material.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
So you don't have this kind of self-absorption.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
So this is why the redshift peak.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Will be lower.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
Why is that the same shape in Continuum is not symmetrical.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
Because continuum is continuum, only in the middle.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
If you imagine it is a radiation from the very last look of the Curtain.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
I went to the middle, so I got the continent.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
So continue only in, only in RTS part is absorbed because of the continent.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
In front of it, there is no material of BlueSchi Photo.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, I see.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Ok, thank you.

28:06.000 --> 28:14.000
Yes, so about 20 years ago, people started to measure this kind of profile.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Then this is usually measured with a radio wave network.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
That was usually used in the past.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
It's like the small ears we usually think of.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Or is it bigger?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
Maybe it's a 10-meter network mirror or a 10-meter dish.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Then measure these different molecules.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Then try to measure the profile just now.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
Then you can see here.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
The first one, in addition to the sensitivity, is not very good.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
There are a lot of different structures.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
It has a lot of this kind of broad profile.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Or even you don't have a very obvious absorption.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Even the most important thing is that you don't have less than 0.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
The so-called no less than 0.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
The most important thing is that this absorption is very likely to be.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Uh, you're in front of this source.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Other completely unrelated clouds to you.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Caused absorption.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
You can't test it.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Uh, is this absorption real?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
It belongs to what you see now.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
If you can see this absorption.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Uh.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Drop to 0.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
If it becomes negative.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
You can find a way to move your telescope's beam.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Then you can say, OK, if I move away from the middle.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
This has a continuum source.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
See if there's any change in this absorption.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
You can be more sure.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
When is it confirmed that this absorbent material is associated with?

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
The audience is the core that you can see.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
So that because the relationship between decisions and the ability to ask.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
Uh, this question, about 20 years ago, was studied widely, and maybe 5 to 10 years later.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Everyone thinks this okay, it's almost done.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
You can't just keep doing it, so just wait.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Um.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Uh, new generation, the voltage waves of thisicated.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Power garage to not be able to have a better optimization result.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
So what is Oma?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Oma is, uh.

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Uh, Akitama Large Millimeter Sub-millimeter Array.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
It is a wireless wave array on the Akitama Desert plateau in Chile.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Then.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
He mainly.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
There should be 66 antennas, which is probably like the bigger antenna outside.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Each antenna is a 12 meter antenna, and there is a smaller one in the middle.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Another, uh, separate array.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Uh, it's 7 meters.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Then he is.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Uh, he's basically a whole world.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
A collaboration, the United States is NRAO.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Oh, that's not NRAO, that's NRC.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
NRC is Canada's National Research Council.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Then Japan's NLJ, Europe's ESO.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Taiwan is A, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Uh, there's participation.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And then there's Chile.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
And then this is open to the world.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Um.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Astronomers can apply to observe.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Then he mainly.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Uh, the biggest bonus is that he can have a very, very good resolution.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
His.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
He can see very, very small things.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Then basically the array is.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
Uh, the telescope is, uh, your resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Uh, you, you.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
The diameter of your telescope.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
The wireless wave array is simply a mirror.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Cut.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Cut into a lot of little ones.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Uh, a different telescope.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Then, so you can pull the two telescope very far as a telescope to use.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
So, like this, the biggest of this.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Uh, baseline is called baseline.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
Simply put, his diameter can be up to 15, 15 kilometers.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Yes, it can be analyzed to a very small area.

31:27.000 --> 31:37.000
Ok, then, at the beginning of this, we started with two more similar profiles that we just drew at the beginning.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Like the left side, this is a.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
This is a, uh, organic molecule, uh, Chinese, what is this English Miso?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Uh.

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
This is the appearance, you can see, if we, uh.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
After taking the continuum off, you can see this absorption is enough, and then you can see his, uh, absorption.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Redshift.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.000
And then in the same way, in this other source, we also see the same thing.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Uh, but in these two cases.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
These are still relatively small, because the first one, like the left one, is an organic molecule, so his.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
He may, uh, in those early stars, uh.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The abundance is not so high.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Uh, not much, so the image is relatively weak.

32:23.000 --> 32:32.000
Then, like the source on the right, it is a relatively, uh, darker source, so his continuum is not so high, so his absorption is relatively small.

32:33.000 --> 32:41.000
Then, in my main research, I mainly want to use, uh, the target, the other, which is the B, H, R, 71.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
Then go to understand, see if we can measure a better, uh.

32:46.000 --> 32:51.000
Uh, the signature of the infor, which is the double peak, and then analyze it.

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
Then he is also a very isolated, uh, early, uh.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
Uh, and then if you look at it in the optical band, it's a black thing, basically all of it.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Uh, all kinds of dust, uh, and gas.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Then, in the infor, you can see that he has a beautiful outflow.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
In the radio, you can also see a beautiful outflow.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
He actually has two sources in the middle.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
Then, here, we just focus on the RS1, which is the main source.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
Ok, then we are in Alma cycle 4, so we propose, and then we get our data.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
It looks like the right side, which is very much like the way it was drawn before.

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
Especially this HCL plus, this curve is basically the same as the front.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Then you can see here, although, um.

33:38.000 --> 33:45.000
This absorption is very wide, but you can probably see that he is actually in, uh.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
Redshift velocity still has a lot of absorption, which proves that he is actually part of it.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
It comes from, um, the middle, uh, those who are really falling in the gas.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
To produce absorption.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
That, uh.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Ok, then we need to analyze this curve.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
We actually need to use one.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
We can't just read it out of this.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Absorption is in, maybe it's in 0.5 kilometers per second, and then you'll know.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
Uh, I, you might know there's something in 0.5 kilometers per second falling in.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
But you don't know if he's in, you've seen this line of sight in which place.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
That, uh, because you have absorption and emission mixed together.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
So we have to, um, use a very common technique in astronomy.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
The technique is ready to transfer the calculation to find a way.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
Um, to model the curve we see.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
That way to transfer, simply put, uh, if I'm here now, every one of these, this, this.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
The shape is a, a, a, a gas.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
All right, you may have radiation on the left.

34:54.000 --> 35:00.000
Come in, and the radiation will be in the gas, it may be absorbed by the research, your research will become weak.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
Or after you have been absorbed, or you, you, this, this gas is actually very hot.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
So he has some, uh, he has some black radiation, or he has some of his own radiation.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
So you, he may have, there will be a mission.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
So, in these energy transitions, he may be part of it.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
It becomes the temperature of this gas, or, uh, inside the excite.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
The level population of different molecules.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
Your mother from the beginning to the end, and then you can know from the inside.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Uh.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
Radiation to the end, uh, we observed what it should look like.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
And then, uh, through, uh.

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
The process of more than once, and then to get a better model to explain what we saw in front of us.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
So, in fact, what we do is very, um.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
It's tedious, but it's also, um.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Um.

36:26.000 --> 36:31.000
It's actually okay, it's actually not that tedious, but it's a lot of iteration, a lot of iterative process.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
Basically, after we have a model, we can get it, we can say, okay, our, our.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
What does the density of the envelope look like?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Um.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
Info this, uh, velocity should look like.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
We can throw it into, uh, different radio transfer models to do.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Uh, this is where we separate gas and dust.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Because basically.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Um.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
First of all, we use, uh, dust.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Uh, it's the continuation of the part of the register.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Go to, uh.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
To constrain this whole envelope structure.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
For example, this envelope.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Uh, his, uh.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
What is the density?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
So, uh, what is the change in the radius?

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
How much does he stand behind this?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
His.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Uh, what is the angle?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
How much is it?

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Then, when we determine this envelope structure.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Let's put it in again.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
And then we'll figure out that we're okay.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
If we follow this structure, we'll get the spectrum.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
What should it look like?

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Okay, so, uh, this is what we did before, uh, the model.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
And then here, uh.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
See this is, uh.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
That is.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
The spectrum of BHS 1.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
That's behind this.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
The gray line is the spectrum.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And then this is probably.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Uh, 2 microns, 3 microns, up to.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Up to 1 millimeter range.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
And then.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Uh.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
The blue circle is our model.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
And then the red square is the observation.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And then you see most of us.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
We just fit through this.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
To fit, we put the model fit to the observation.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
And then we'll get a.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Uh, a better model to describe this envelope.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
For example, I drew it like this here.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
But actually, how do we construct this?

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
How much is his output angle?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
What is the density distribution of the envelope?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Okay, so you don't have to say.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
It's more like it's coming out of the outflow.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
And then the long way is coming out of the envelope.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Okay, and then.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
Uh, I said earlier that we're going to take this envelope structure.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
Plus, uh, we can think of a way to model this.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
Uh, but in fact, one of the very, very important.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Uh, the factor is chemistry.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
So the chemistry is not.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Uh, well, so the chemistry is not just thinking, okay.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
What are you going to have?

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
And it's this kind of molecule.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
Is it possible to exist in that kind of condition?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
In the atmosphere, you can see it, especially in.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Um, these dense core, the density in the middle is very high.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
And then the temperature is quite low.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
So it's possible to be frozen on top of these dust.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Then if it freezes, you, you, you.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
You can't do it in him.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
You expect the atmosphere to give you a curve.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And see that this is.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
So there's a different chemical abundance profile.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
You might be out there, you might have.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Uh, the radiation from other places might take you.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
By H, this is an example of H.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
You might let him.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
It's a separation of two different things, or it's.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
In there, he might be frozen on top of the dust.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Or in this one, he's going to be with some, uh.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Active molecules interact with each other, and then.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Produce fat particles, and then he disappears.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
So you can't measure it.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So in the middle, we're going to.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Mainly, like I've been in.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Uh, it's been a long time.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
It takes a while to say what we're going to do.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
A relatively good abundance profile.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
To explain our data.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
So, uh.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Basically, we need to understand this kind of info profile.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Uh, we're going to take our dust model.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
You can get density, temperature, and velocity.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And then we add our.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Chemical abundance.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The, uh.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
We're going to find a way.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Uh, get a spectrum.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
If you don't feel good, we'll go back.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Modify and change, so this is very.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Uh, a long one.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Uh, the process.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Uh, this is us.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Uh, hey.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Um, uh, yeah, that's good.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
The front is almost the same.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
That's my question.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Um, like this, like this, like this.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
It's a relatively small system.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Uh, that kind of info.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Or the final outflow.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
The distribution of gravity.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
It's all about, uh, normal.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
That matter is good.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
If there is a dark matter, he has a way.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It doesn't really matter.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
It doesn't really matter.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm not sure if it's early.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Early universe will be affected.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
But at least in the modern universe.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Uh, the general assumption should be dark matter.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Mainly in the outer galaxy.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
It's in the black building.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
So I rarely.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I heard that.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Uh, dark matter will affect.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It's the evolution of these.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
At least in the.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
In the region.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
So I don't think there's much.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Big impression.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Uh, because I.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
My idea is like this.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
If today, in some of those.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Dark matter can be strong with them.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Interacting, then there will be some small.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Small structure, for example.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Is a relatively clumpy phenomenon.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Uh, maybe.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Can be constrained, but I don't think so.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I can't see it.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Yeah, I guess I can't see it.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
If you have a big.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
It should be very, very small.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
That's probably like a micro lens.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You're looking at things.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
So.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Uh, so I'm going to be like this.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
A system should be able to see it.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
The current observation.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
The relationship should be.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Very far away.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Maybe there will be, but it's hard.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Okay, thank you.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
So, uh.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Like this, like me.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
This model is our latest.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
This is the latest model we got.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Actually, it was about two days ago.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Uh, uh, on the right.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Uh, blue is our data.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Then orange is our current model.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Then you see our model.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Roughly capture is data.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
The feeling.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
But you can see, for example, in Russian.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
We still miss a lot of emissions.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
So, uh.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
This is this is actually.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Now.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
In the future, we should continue to do more.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Uh, different tuning, and then even.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
To understand that there is no way to make up.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Uh, to make up for this part.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Missing mission.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Uh, to understand that it is possible to say.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Um.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Of course, our current model is very, very.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Symmetry is basically a.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Symmetry model.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Um.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
The first one is to understand that, okay.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Under this very strong assumption.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Is there any way to make this model better?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
What if it doesn't work?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
How do we break this?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
This assumption.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
And it won't cause too much.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
The freedom.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Okay, you can say whatever you want.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Um.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
So, uh, this is probably the future.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
The main thing to do in the next month or two.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
That's on the left.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
This picture is.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Basically, it's like.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Uh, if you look at.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
The mission map.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Then if you take the middle continent.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
It's like this.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
The dark place in the middle is the continent.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
After being removed, it causes a very strong absorption.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Just like the right side, you see this very strong absorption.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
So when you get close, you will become negative.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
And then up and down like this.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
This bright spot is because.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Uh, you have all flow, so all flow is up.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Uh, up and down, this, this, this direction.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
So, uh.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Uh.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Uh, the density is relatively low, so it is easier to be heated.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
So it's brighter.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Ok, then.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Why do you say this?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Info will affect this chemistry?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That is to say.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Uh, simply put, if there is a group, a group of gas.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Now he, he is from.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Um, this envelope.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
The outer circumference keeps traveling.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
You are affected by the infogravity.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
You can't travel to the middle.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
And then falling to this star or disk.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
It will pass through the middle.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Different temperatures.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
The middle may be getting hotter and hotter.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Basically, it's getting hotter and hotter.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Because there is a pro star in the middle.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Pro star is emitting a very strong emission.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
That, but this info.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
This chemistry is determined by.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Say, ok, I have this, this group of gas.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
This group of gas will be at different temperatures.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
How long will it take?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
If he is very slow.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Then he may spend a long time in every place.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
That or even.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
He may spend more time in the lower temperature.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Or at a higher temperature.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
That will affect.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Uh, at different temperatures, it will affect.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Um.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
It should be said that at different temperatures.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
The chemical reaction you can produce is different.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
That, and every chemical reaction.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
The time scale is also different.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
If you are at low temperature, although you have a lot.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Low temperature chemical reactions can be produced.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
But if you just spend it at low temperature.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Very short time, then those reactions.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Will not be for, um.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
The chemical state of these molecules.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Uh.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
The state has caused any change.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
What about the other way?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
To see is to say.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Um, we are actually using these molecules.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
The.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
The radiation to go.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
To trace this.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
The envelope inside the dynamic.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
If we don't understand which side of the road.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
These molecules are sometimes our interpretation.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
It will become incorrect.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
That.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Another point is what I said before.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Uh, the evolution of the dynamic code.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Will affect you.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
What is the chemical reaction you can produce?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
So these two are a bit like interaction.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
It's like being tied together.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It's hard for you to separate one from each other.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
That's to say here.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
At different, for example, at low temperature.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
You may have a lot of free.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
You have a lot of deterioration.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
H will become very low.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Then, more.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
So-called medium tension.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
You will have a lot on the surface of this dust.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Different chemical reactions.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
That will cause the chemistry.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
The people who do the chemical model will tell you.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
That this may produce different species.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Different species.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Now, at high temperature.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
When it comes to Kelvin.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Uh, you used to be.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
The ice is frozen on the dust.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
These molecules may all come out because the temperature has risen.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So it will affect us.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
What you see is different.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Or at different temperatures.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
There will be different changes.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Well, basically, uh.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
There will be two in the early stars.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
There are currently two different types of observations.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Uh, source, one is called.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Uh, the other is.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
One carbon molecule source.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
That's basically it.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
His original meaning is.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
It represents his small hot core.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
What is the hot core?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
It is a relatively large-capacity source.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
He may be.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
100, 1000, even a few thousand.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Uh, the sun.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
A source.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Uh, we've been observing for a long time.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Oh, in these sources.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
You'll see a lot of mess.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Different organic molecules.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
So this kind of.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
The source is classified.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
It's classified as a hot core.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Because he doesn't have to be hot enough.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
These molecules will become gas.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Let you be observed.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
So the hot core is.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
We observe similar chemical states.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
A lot of organic molecules.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
It's a relatively low quality.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Little quality.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Uh, 0.5 to.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Uh, 10.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Uh, range.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
That's another one.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
One carbon molecule source is.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Uh, in the same process.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
We found.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Uh, there's another kind of source.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Um, he doesn't have a lot of this.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
He still has a lot of organic molecules.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
It doesn't look like this.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Uh, so-called.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Uh, long convention means that he has a lot of carbon.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
One by one.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
So you might see something like C2H.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
C4H or something.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
C7H.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
These carbons are both.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Maybe it's a double or three.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Three pieces together.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
He can have a lot of carbon stuck together.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
And then you don't have any other hydrogen atoms.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Or other different atoms.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
That, um, in.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Hot core, you know, these saturated molecules.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
It means that these points.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
The square or triangle is opened to pick up different functional groups.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Then produce different organic molecules.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
That's in chemistry.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Um.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Their, uh, their formation path is different.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
So now it's.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Uh, everyone.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
From the model, from the control.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Try to characterize it.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Is the first one really true?

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Or is it just that we see two different extremes?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
In fact, there are a lot of overlaps in the middle.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Or say.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Hey.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
In terms of models, how can we produce a lot of long carbon molecules?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
How can we produce a lot of, uh, these saturated complex molecules?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
That's the same source.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
In the same observation.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
We measure a lot of, uh.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Uh, organic molecules.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Like the middle one.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
This is very high.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
This is outstanding.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
This is more than this.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
This is the four panels in front of it.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I'll show you.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Uh, four panels.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
This is the four main lines.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
But we also found that in.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
The other places of this spectrum.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
We see a lot of weaker emissions.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
And then we identify them.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
In fact, uh.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Most of them are from organic molecules.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
And then we identified it.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
There should be 14 different organic molecules.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
On the right side.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Some of them are quite complicated.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
There's alcohol, alcohol.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Or some different, uh.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
Calcium, different.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Uh, his isotope.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Uh, his isotope.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
And then we found that in different sources.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Inside?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Like here, we have three different sources.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
That.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Basically, they are, uh, these three sources.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Their, um,

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Luminosity difference will be more than 10 times.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
So the so-called luminosity is basically.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Uh, depending on the control.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
How much of the radiation can be released in the middle?

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
How bright is the star in the middle?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
How bright is the process in the middle?

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
That's the difference in brightness.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
So in such a big different source.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Inside?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
We found that his organic molecules.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
For methanol.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
Uh, the abundance is about the same.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
That is to say, you can see these three symbols.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Basically, they are all quite close.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
That, uh, that means.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Um.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
The middle of this.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Um.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
How much is the luminosity?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
How strong is the radiation in the middle?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
It doesn't affect the production of these complex molecules.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Well, since it's not.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
The middle, uh, this radiation.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
If you say carbon, that means it's in front.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
These, uh.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
In the early days, these complex molecules.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
It's already formed.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
He might be in, uh.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
When it freezes on the ice.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Through some of the relatively low temperature.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Some reactions are formed.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
When he travels to the middle, it's relatively high temperature.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
He was released.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
To the gas station, and then you see it.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
So he didn't have too much.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Processing produces different.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
So this is a very small sample.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
But I.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
It's just a hint.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
This is actually with, uh.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
The prediction of the chemical model is quite close.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
So, in addition, we found that we can do this.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Uh, complex molecules can also give us some.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Uh, can imagine the signature.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Uh.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Let's look at the cartoon on the right.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Simply put, if you have a structure like this.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
The middle of this gray ring.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
The middle of this gray ring represents a disk.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
And then you might have an info outside.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Now we have, like, we're going down from the top.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
This, this disk.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
If you look at it from the left.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
If it's yellow, this disease.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
You can see, uh.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
On one side, there's a red shift emission.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
It's far from you.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
It's a red emission.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
But at the same time, you can see it in the back.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Uh, blue shift, the info.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
So you become one of the same.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
There's the same offset inside.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
You can see at the same time.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
There's a blue shift and a red shift emission.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It's not the same as if you're just a disk.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
If you're just a disk.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Your left.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
It's all going to be, for example, it's all going to be a red shift emission.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
It's all going to be a blue shift emission on the right.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
It's all going to be a blue shift emission on the right.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
In this case.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
You'll see two different kinds.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
At the same time, you'll see a blue shift and a red shift emission.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
So this is our left.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
We're in, uh.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
What you see in the observation.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Offset you can see.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
If it's 0.1, we can see it at the same time.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
You can see the blue shift and the red shift emission.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
So if it's.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
It's just a desk.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
You'll see two triangles.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
It's in the upper right corner and the lower left corner.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
So that's what we're talking about.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Um, and then at the same time, this.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
If you go in and analyze it.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
A morphology like this.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Or what kind of structure is it?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
We found that he was in the middle.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
It's 50 to 100.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
It's a disk.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

53:34.000 --> 53:34.000


53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
This is the mission.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I found that we can use it at the same time.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Hcl plus.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
That's the mission to trace.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Um, the info of the envelope skill.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Um, the info, uh, the same complex.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
A lot of molecules can give us some.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Uh, more central information.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
So the goal for the future is to figure out a way.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
If we can put this big tree, we should say.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Envelope skill and desk have two different dynamics.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Let's see if we can get a better one.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Uh, info model.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
At the same time, we see a lot of different structures.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
This is the other thing we can do.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
We see a lot of different outflow structures.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
It's just a school picture.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Um.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
So, um, it means that we're actually this observation.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
There's only an hour of observation time.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
But he probably can bring it to us.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
It may be more than three projects.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
It may be more than three projects.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um, so, um.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Um, so, um, so, um, so, um.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Um.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Ok.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
We're going to ask again.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Um, you can go back to the first two.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
In the front page.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Uh, just, uh.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Uh, uh, next page, next page.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
There's one.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
That's right, this page.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Just.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
It's just that I just missed it.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Why is there only a complex?

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
You can do this thing.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Then you before.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
It's the few lines that are very bright at the beginning.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Why can't I see this?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Um.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Basically,

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
the front.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Those in the front, for example,

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
it may have some.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
It may have some destruction in the middle.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
But even if those models don't have destruction,

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
it's relatively simple.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
It may be.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
It may be in the middle.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
It's very high, but it's because of its.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Um.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
It may be at the same time,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
from 10 to 2000,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
all of them.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
So in terms of analysis,

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
it causes a lot of complexity.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
The advantage of the complex model is that

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
the first one, most of the time,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
it's in the state of defrosting.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
It may have to be more than 100 Kelvin.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
The temperature, it will go to the gas phase,

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
and you can see it.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That's a relatively simple model.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
It may be 20 K, 40 K,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
you can see it.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
So, um, this kind of temperature

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
constraint, let the complex molecule

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
basically gather in a very

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
compact center,

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
or this scale place.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
So basically,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
its existence itself is self-selected,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
so that you can probe

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
a very well-defined or

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
very compact region.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
So, of course, other simpler

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
molecules can also be traced in the middle.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
You can find other molecules in the middle,

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
but it's relatively difficult to analyze.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Oh, okay.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Got it. Thank you.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Okay, so

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
we basically, so maybe we have

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
a case now, that is, this source, we can

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
derive an info model,

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
and then we can connect from this core

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
and then draw a line to trace

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
its evolution from core to

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
a star case.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
But in the future,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
we should

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
pursue more samples,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
so this observation is actually

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
very simple.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
15 minutes on source,

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
the rest is actually calibration.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
15 minutes on source,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
you can measure so many things.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
So it should be very,

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
if we have a good argument,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
it is actually

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
relatively easy to push

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
more samples,

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
maybe 10 or even 50 sources,

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
you can probably know, okay,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
the evolution of different mass sources

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
So this is more of a future

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
direction.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Then I will put my summary here,

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and then if you have any other

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
questions, you are welcome.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Thank you.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Then

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
please turn on the microphone.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
We are now applauding,

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
thank you for

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
giving us a speech.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Thank you.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Thank you.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I don't know if you have any questions.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
If you have any questions,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
remember to turn on the microphone.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I will ask another question.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Okay.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Just stop here.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
The picture in the upper right corner,

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
you just said you are

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
using your

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
radiative transfer model

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
to fit your

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
observation data.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
So

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
you

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
will use, for example,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
like MCMC,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
you may run one first,

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
and then compare the observation,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
and then come back to adjust the parameters,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
and then run again?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Or is it

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
theoretically possible?

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Theoretically it is possible, but

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
the biggest

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
limitation is that we

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
are running this 3D radiative transfer,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
because this is a very high density

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
place, so

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
running a model of realization

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
takes a very long time.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
A realization may take 2 hours, 3 hours.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So if you are MCMC,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
you may have to map,

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
so you have to probe this parameter space.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
If you need 1000 models,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
it will take 3000 hours

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
per source.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
So we later thought

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
it was not very feasible.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
But

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
some

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
other studies do simpler

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
sources, they use MCMC

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
to characterize different

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
parameters. But I think that's

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
actually very important.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Maybe we can

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
test, for example,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
other things are all fixed,

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
we will

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
change the chemical abundance profile.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Because that's actually

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
a pretty

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
hand-tuning parameter.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
We currently have some ideas

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
to see if we can

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
optimize the radiative transfer

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
calculation. For example,

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
we can fix the gradient,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
some more technical considerations

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
can be relaxed.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
So I think

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
in the future, maybe I will

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
do some more

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
small experiments. But

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I think this part

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
has its own

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
limitations. So

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
if you can do MCMC

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
optimization,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
it should be

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
in a more

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
special situation.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
your current approach is

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
to run one first

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
and see if it's not

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
right. Then you probably

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
know what

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
parameter to choose.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Yes, it's the brain

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
to guide the search.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
For example,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
we have a lot of different tools

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
to do this. For example,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
we have some tools

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
that can tell us,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
in this beam,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
as a function of radius,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
what our velocity looks like.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
If I want to say that I think

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
the emission at a certain velocity is too low,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I'll see if I can adjust it,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
or see

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
what the reason is.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It takes a lot of time to

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
model the inspection,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and then think about

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
how to adjust it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Got it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It feels like

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
a project

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
that can be used for machine learning.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Yes, I hope so.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Who can help me do this?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Yuting can help you.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
She's really good at it now.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Okay.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
In January,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I'll need your help.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Before today's speech,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
before everyone

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
came in,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
we talked about

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
the content of today's speech,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
which is still being written and submitted.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
If you want to discuss,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
you can contact our speakers directly.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
You can

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
put your email in the chat.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Whether you want to be contacted

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
or you want to contact someone,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
you can exchange

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
contact information here.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Or you can Google it.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
You can Google it directly.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
The recording of our speech will be delayed

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
until February or March next year

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
before it is uploaded.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
The reason is that it is now

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
being written.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Do you have any questions?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
If you don't have any questions now,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'll promote it.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I'm going to put

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
the two main websites

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
in the chat.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
One is our Facebook,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
the other is our website.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
If you go in,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
you can see

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
the purpose of our project.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
We hope that through

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
young people

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
working in the research circle,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
we can cooperate with each other

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and exchange research information quickly,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
get to know each other,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
and share information.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
If you support such a project,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
we hope you can consider

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
joining the member.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I also put the information

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
for joining the member in the chat.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
More importantly,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
we are now open to sign up

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
for the 2019 speech.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
If you are in the past year

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
or expected to be in the next year,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
there will be interesting research discoveries

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
or information or ideas

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
to share with you.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I also put the link

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
in the chat.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
There are several websites here,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
you can go in and play.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I'll ask one last time,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
do you have any questions?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
By the way,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Yaolun's email is in the chat,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
so you can ask him directly.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Thank you.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
If there are no questions,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
let's turn on the microphone

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and thank Yaolun again.
