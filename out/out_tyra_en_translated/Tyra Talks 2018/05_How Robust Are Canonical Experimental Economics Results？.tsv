0	10000	I'm very happy to have you all here today for Lin Bo-xuan's talk.
10000	14000	Let me first introduce our speaker, Lin Bo-xuan.
14000	20000	She studied economics at NTU, and is now a sophomore at NTU Economics.
20000	29000	Currently, she is an intern at a startup company called ModLab in Pasadena, California.
29000	35000	Her main topic is game-related data analysis.
35000	39000	Today, we are very happy to invite Lin Bo-xuan to give a talk
39000	43000	about how to use class experiment data to test the stability of the final window match
43000	46000	and the results of the double-sided auction experiment.
46000	50000	Let's welcome Lin Bo-xuan to start her talk.
50000	52000	Thank you, Director Lin.
52000	55000	Without further ado, I'll get started.
55000	57000	Today's topic is very simple.
57000	59000	I'll just ask one question.
59000	65000	Are the results of the economic experiment we see on paper stable?
65000	68000	To be honest, in the field of economic experiments,
68000	70000	people are the ones doing the research.
70000	73000	So, if you want to say that a result is stable,
73000	75000	you can't just say,
75000	78000	if I were in Taiwan, I'd do this result.
78000	80000	Or, if I were in a victim group, I'd do that.
80000	84000	Often, we need to do a lot of different victim groups.
84000	87000	If we were to say that this result is right for all humans,
87000	90000	then it should be right to take the same result
90000	93000	and do the same experiment in every place.
93000	96000	But in fact, we often know that
96000	98000	this situation is often not necessarily right.
98000	102000	For example, let's say we measure the risk.
102000	104000	In Taiwan alone,
104000	106000	if you only measure the risk for men or women,
106000	108000	the set of risks may be different.
108000	111000	So, in fact, if we want to measure stability,
111000	113000	that is, if we want to do the same experiment
113000	116000	in many places, the result is wrong.
116000	118000	But often,
118000	120000	what we want to do
120000	123000	is actually very difficult in the experiment.
123000	125000	First, because economists know
125000	127000	that our research funds are limited.
127000	129000	Second, our time is limited.
129000	131000	So, often, it's hard for us to think about
131000	133000	whether we can do the same experiment
133000	134000	in every corner of the world.
134000	136000	So, this is a very difficult thing.
136000	138000	Because, mainly, there is a big limitation in economic experiments.
138000	141000	In fact, we hope to provide real benefits to consumers.
141000	143000	Because of this,
143000	146000	we need a lot of money and a lot of time.
146000	148000	We need to have a good enough time design.
148000	151000	Basically, it will be impossible to measure in every place in the world.
151000	153000	So, because of this,
153000	155000	we did not give up
155000	157000	to test whether our experiment results are stable or not.
157000	159000	So, there are two main ways
159000	161000	to do this on our website.
161000	163000	First,
163000	165000	for example,
165000	167000	in the case of Ultraman Game,
167000	169000	in fact, in the past 50 years,
169000	171000	there have been a lot of studies on the series of Ultraman Game.
171000	173000	So, basically,
173000	175000	there is a method
175000	177000	that we take the previous experimental data
177000	179000	and break it into a very large database
179000	181000	to do some meta-analysis here.
181000	183000	Just like what Usterbeck did in 2004.
183000	185000	But, like this,
185000	187000	there is a problem.
187000	189000	In fact, many times,
189000	191000	all the previous studies of Ultraman Game
191000	193000	are the same game,
193000	195000	but their context is a bit different.
195000	197000	So, in practice,
197000	199000	many times, your usage is different,
199000	201000	or your context is different,
201000	203000	which may affect the result of the experiment.
203000	205000	So, when we use this method,
205000	207000	we have already lost the control
207000	209000	of our experimental design.
209000	211000	Although this method
211000	213000	can make our database very rich.
213000	215000	The other way is that
215000	217000	we control the same experimental design,
217000	219000	but go to other places
219000	221000	to do the same experiment.
221000	223000	Just like Roth,
223000	225000	he has been to four countries in the world.
225000	227000	One is the United States,
227000	229000	one is Slovenia,
229000	231000	one is Israel,
231000	233000	and the other is Japan.
233000	235000	He went to these four countries
235000	237000	to do the same final analysis
237000	239000	and market game
239000	241000	to see if the results of these four countries
241000	243000	were stable or not.
243000	245000	This is the largest experiment
245000	247000	so far.
247000	249000	But, from this point of view,
249000	251000	even so,
251000	253000	we can only do it in a small number of places.
253000	255000	So, in this way,
255000	257000	although you can
257000	259000	control your experimental design,
259000	261000	but you can't make
261000	263000	your database very large.
263000	265000	So, today,
265000	267000	what we are doing is
267000	269000	using the third method.
269000	271000	It's like
271000	273000	you want to test the stability
273000	275000	of a result of an experiment.
275000	277000	There are three things to do.
277000	279000	One is the real sound,
279000	281000	and the third is to have a large enough sample.
281000	283000	The first two methods
283000	285000	are to give up
285000	287000	and control the experimental design.
287000	289000	The other is to give up a large enough database.
289000	291000	But what we are going to do today
291000	293000	is to have a large enough database,
293000	295000	and the design
295000	297000	is exactly the same.
297000	299000	But what we give up today is to give up
299000	301000	and control the sound.
301000	303000	In this case,
303000	305000	I can only say that we are the first article
305000	307000	to do this.
307000	309000	We have a lot of data.
309000	311000	But when we give up
311000	313000	and control the sound,
313000	315000	our experiment
315000	317000	will be done in a very
317000	319000	no-easy situation.
319000	321000	So, if we can
321000	323000	reproduce
323000	325000	all the experimental results
325000	327000	in the lab,
327000	329000	it means that the experimental results
329000	331000	are very stable.
331000	333000	As I said,
333000	335000	what we are going to use today
335000	337000	is MobLab.
337000	339000	MobLab is an experimental platform
339000	341000	for all class economics experiments.
341000	343000	If we take all the data from the class,
343000	345000	it is actually good and bad.
345000	347000	Of course, the two biggest concerns are
347000	349000	that all the students in the class
349000	351000	do not use money
351000	353000	to provide their sound.
353000	355000	Most of the time, they just use
355000	357000	the grade of the course
357000	359000	or other random numbers
359000	361000	to provide their sound.
361000	363000	This is what we have lost control of.
363000	365000	The two biggest concerns are
365000	367000	that many students in class
367000	369000	may not necessarily be
369000	371000	the representative sample
371000	373000	of the culture.
373000	375000	However, there are still
375000	377000	a lot of benefits
377000	379000	for us to try this method.
379000	381000	First of all,
381000	383000	there is no publication bias
383000	385000	in our database.
385000	387000	For example,
387000	389000	if you take the results
389000	391000	of the previous article
391000	393000	as a meta-analysis,
393000	395000	you may get too good results.
395000	397000	This is called publication bias.
397000	399000	However,
399000	401000	all the results, good or bad,
401000	403000	are recorded in our database.
403000	405000	Another thing is that
405000	407000	our company is
407000	409000	at least in the class of
409000	411000	experimental economics.
411000	413000	If you want to do a class experiment
413000	415000	in the world,
415000	417000	you basically use our company.
417000	419000	In fact, our sample is very diverse.
419000	421000	There are many different areas.
421000	423000	This gives us a lot of
423000	425000	variation to test.
425000	427000	Thirdly,
427000	429000	the environment in which our data is generated
429000	431000	is exactly the same.
431000	433000	The interface, language,
433000	435000	and the entire experiment process
435000	437000	are exactly the same.
437000	439000	This means that we have
439000	441000	completely controlled
441000	443000	the process of their game.
443000	445000	These are the three advantages
445000	447000	that we think
447000	449000	are very important.
449000	451000	Before talking about these two areas,
451000	453000	I would like to talk about
453000	455000	how big our dataset is.
455000	457000	First of all,
457000	459000	we can see that
459000	461000	this table is a total of
461000	463000	10 areas in our dataset.
463000	465000	You can see that
465000	467000	this data is across North America,
467000	469000	Europe, and Asia.
469000	471000	In Ultraman Game,
471000	473000	we have more than
473000	475000	15,000 sample points.
475000	477000	For those of you who do not know
477000	479000	the economics of time,
479000	481000	the data in Ultraman Game
481000	483000	is about 10 times more than
483000	485000	a normal article,
485000	487000	or 0 to 2.0.
487000	489000	In DoubleAction,
489000	491000	there are basically 2.0 more.
491000	493000	This is a very large sample
493000	495000	that we can test.
495000	497000	Next,
497000	499000	I will talk about these two areas.
499000	501000	These two areas are actually very simple.
501000	503000	The first is Ultraman Game.
503000	505000	In addition,
505000	507000	why do we choose these two areas?
507000	509000	The first is because these two areas
509000	511000	are the most abundant in our database.
511000	513000	The second is that these two areas
513000	515000	are basically the origin of
515000	517000	the economics of time.
517000	519000	In Ultraman Game,
519000	521000	there are two people in this game.
521000	523000	One is Proposer,
523000	525000	the other is Responder.
525000	527000	Proposer can decide
527000	529000	how much to give to the other party.
529000	531000	This game is very simple.
531000	533000	There is a ball in the middle.
533000	535000	You can decide how much to give to the other party.
535000	537000	You can pull the ball
537000	539000	and decide how much to give to the other party.
539000	541000	If you decide,
541000	543000	you can press Submit.
543000	545000	In this way, the other party can see
545000	547000	how much you gave to the other party.
547000	549000	Next,
549000	551000	suppose I decide to give the other party $45.
551000	553000	In this way,
553000	555000	the other party can see
555000	557000	that this is
557000	559000	a Proposer you have provided.
559000	561000	Proposer is
561000	563000	I take $55, you take $45.
563000	565000	Do you want to accept it?
565000	567000	If you are Responder,
567000	569000	if you decide to accept it,
569000	571000	you take $45, he takes $55.
571000	573000	If you refuse,
573000	575000	you both take $0.
575000	577000	This is a very simple environment.
577000	579000	It's like the simplest negotiation
579000	581000	in simulation life.
581000	583000	For example, when you go to the night market to buy vegetables,
583000	585000	you often say
585000	587000	that you might say in the last round
587000	589000	don't pull the ball.
589000	591000	It's like simulating such a concept.
593000	595000	This is the game interface
595000	597000	of our Ultraman Game.
597000	599000	Next, I want to talk about
599000	601000	double-sided auction.
601000	603000	The most classic example
603000	605000	of double-sided auction is
605000	607000	like Wall Street.
607000	609000	They are selling stocks.
609000	611000	You often see some pictures and news photos
611000	613000	that there may be a lot of machines
613000	615000	with a lot of stations.
615000	617000	Many traders are raising their hands
617000	619000	and shouting loudly.
619000	621000	It's like everyone is shouting at the same time.
621000	623000	How much do I want this? How much do I want this?
623000	625000	It's like buyers and sellers are arguing there at the same time.
625000	627000	So double-sided auction is
627000	629000	compared to Ultraman Game.
629000	631000	Ultraman Game has only one side.
631000	633000	I propose a proposal to you.
633000	635000	In double-sided auction,
635000	637000	no matter which side, buyer or seller,
637000	639000	they can call at the same time.
639000	641000	So in double-sided auction,
641000	643000	I will introduce what this game is playing now.
643000	645000	One is a buyer and the other is a seller.
645000	647000	So if you are a buyer today,
647000	649000	you want to buy something.
649000	651000	We are buying oranges here.
651000	653000	In this game interface,
653000	655000	the first thing you can see is
655000	657000	how much satisfaction you will get when you buy an orange.
657000	659000	This is called value.
659000	661000	Next, you have to raise a price.
661000	663000	You can pull a slider bar here.
663000	665000	You can move left and right
665000	667000	to decide how much you want to bid
667000	669000	to bid for this orange.
669000	671000	If you buy an orange,
671000	673000	your advantage is
673000	675000	your value today is
675000	677000	how much you spent to buy it.
677000	679000	OK.
679000	681000	If you are buying,
681000	683000	you have two ways to buy.
683000	685000	One is to bid here.
685000	687000	The other one is
687000	689000	if there are a lot of buyers in front,
689000	691000	they have already asked for a price.
691000	693000	So you can also buy directly at the lowest price.
693000	695000	OK.
695000	697000	The next one is
697000	699000	seller.
699000	701000	We have the same interface.
701000	703000	If you sell an orange today,
703000	705000	you have a cost.
705000	707000	So you will see your cost here.
707000	709000	OK.
709000	711000	Next,
711000	713000	you can pull a slider bar here
713000	715000	to decide how much you want to bid.
715000	717000	You can ask for a price here.
717000	719000	Or you can decide
719000	721000	to sell the highest price here.
721000	723000	So I can sell it here.
723000	725000	Then pay attention here.
725000	727000	There is a special design in our game interface.
727000	729000	When you decide to
729000	731000	ask for a price here,
731000	733000	if you ask for a price,
733000	735000	if the transaction
735000	737000	makes you pay a negative price,
737000	739000	I will make it red
739000	741000	to warn you
741000	743000	that
743000	745000	this transaction may bring you
745000	747000	a negative price.
747000	749000	So this is a double option
749000	751000	game interface.
751000	753000	Let me introduce
753000	755000	our game settings here.
755000	757000	This is because
757000	759000	in such a simple game interface,
759000	761000	many teachers
761000	763000	can adjust the game parameters
763000	765000	themselves.
765000	767000	But in most cases,
767000	769000	many teachers use our preset options.
769000	771000	In Ultimatum Game,
771000	773000	you can divide the money
773000	775000	into 100 yuan.
775000	777000	In the case of double option,
777000	779000	there are five buyers in total.
779000	781000	Then each person
781000	783000	can have three products to buy.
783000	785000	That is to say, there are a total of
785000	787000	15 things in the market to buy and sell.
787000	789000	If we draw this value,
789000	791000	this is our black line.
791000	793000	This is our demand curve.
793000	795000	Then the gray line
795000	797000	is our supply curve.
797000	799000	Before I start,
799000	801000	I want to talk a little bit
801000	803000	about the theoretical prediction
803000	805000	of these two games.
805000	807000	In Ultimatum Game,
807000	809000	the theoretical prediction is very simple.
809000	811000	If we look at it
811000	813000	from the perspective of the respondent,
813000	815000	we say that
815000	817000	the balance of a game is basically
817000	819000	that if I do this option,
819000	821000	the reward is higher than the other option,
821000	823000	then I should do this.
823000	825000	So if you look at the responder,
825000	827000	no matter what positive reward he sees,
827000	829000	I should accept it.
829000	831000	For example, if I take 1 yuan,
831000	833000	it is still better than 0 yuan.
833000	835000	So in this case,
835000	837000	if I get a positive reward,
837000	839000	I should accept it.
839000	841000	If I get a negative reward,
841000	843000	I should accept it.
843000	845000	If I get a positive reward,
845000	847000	I should accept it.
847000	849000	So this is the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Game.
849000	851000	But in fact,
851000	853000	in the past 50 years of research,
853000	855000	we all know that
855000	857000	this theory is basically written to be overturned.
857000	859000	This is because many times
859000	861000	when we do research,
861000	863000	we will find that
863000	865000	basically all the recipients
865000	867000	will not only give the other party 1 yuan.
867000	869000	This is Ultimatum Game.
869000	871000	Then in Double Option,
871000	873000	this is like a high school science textbook,
873000	875000	you will see Supply and Demand Curve.
875000	877000	If you want to solve this game,
877000	879000	it is actually very simple,
879000	881000	you have to find a price
881000	883000	to clear all the markets.
883000	885000	So if you are here,
885000	887000	this gray curve is the price
887000	889000	of our theoretical prediction.
889000	891000	It just happens to be the intersection
891000	893000	of Supply and Demand Curve.
893000	895000	If the price is higher,
895000	897000	it means that
897000	899000	there are more sellers who want to sell things at this time,
899000	901000	and fewer sellers want to sell.
901000	903000	So if the supply and demand are uneven at this time,
903000	905000	this force will force the price down.
905000	907000	But if the price is lower,
907000	909000	then there are more people who want to sell,
909000	911000	and fewer people want to sell.
911000	913000	So this force will push the price back.
913000	915000	This is also the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.
915000	917000	This is our equilibrium price.
917000	919000	Then in our prediction market,
919000	921000	the number of equilibrium is 13,
921000	923000	and the price of equilibrium is 112 yuan.
923000	925000	So this is our game setting.
927000	929000	I want to stop here for a while.
929000	931000	Is everyone OK?
931000	933000	If there is no problem,
933000	935000	I will continue to talk about the results.
937000	939000	Wait a minute,
939000	941000	let me confirm first.
941000	943000	So the buyer's
943000	945000	willing price here is
945000	947000	150,
947000	949000	the prediction is 150,145,
949000	951000	140, and so on?
951000	953000	From 150 to 115.
957000	959000	So from 150 to minus 3,
959000	961000	how much is the last one?
961000	963000	The last one is about
963000	965000	112 or 117.
967000	969000	Then the other side is from 50,
969000	971000	and then keep adding up.
971000	973000	Yes.
973000	975000	Thank you.
975000	977000	OK, then I have no problem.
977000	979000	I want to continue.
979000	981000	Let's talk about
981000	983000	the overall results.
983000	985000	First of all, I want to show you
985000	987000	this table.
987000	989000	Let me summarize first.
989000	991000	We mainly looked at five outcome variables.
991000	993000	What are some of its numerical statistics?
993000	995000	First of all, in the Ultimation Game,
995000	997000	we mainly looked at two outcome variables.
997000	999000	One is how much proposal you give the other party.
999000	1001000	The other is how much your acceptance rate is.
1001000	1003000	First of all, we see the first one.
1003000	1005000	In the case of 100 yuan,
1005000	1007000	on average,
1007000	1009000	you will give the other party about 36 yuan.
1009000	1011000	This number is actually
1011000	1013000	very close to the result of our experiment.
1013000	1015000	For example, if we take
1015000	1017000	Rock's article in 1991 as a benchmark,
1017000	1019000	the average of the article
1019000	1021000	is 40.
1021000	1023000	In fact, our gap is only 4%,
1023000	1025000	so I think it's a very close result.
1025000	1027000	Then the second one
1027000	1029000	we look at is the acceptance rate.
1029000	1031000	What we are looking at now is unconditional.
1031000	1033000	If we look at
1033000	1035000	the unconditional acceptance rate,
1035000	1037000	the acceptance rate is 66%.
1037000	1039000	Rock's result is about 73%.
1039000	1041000	So the gap is only 6% or 7%.
1041000	1043000	But because our offer
1043000	1045000	is relatively low,
1045000	1047000	I think our result
1047000	1049000	is able to reproduce
1049000	1051000	Rock's result at the aggregate level.
1051000	1053000	Hello, I have a question.
1053000	1055000	You just said
1055000	1057000	he made 40 and then 36.
1057000	1059000	Or let's just say
1059000	1061000	how much is the experimental
1061000	1063000	and how much is the theoretical expectation.
1063000	1065000	I think it's very close.
1065000	1067000	What I want to ask is
1067000	1069000	what do you think?
1069000	1071000	Because you didn't show
1071000	1073000	your uncertainty range.
1073000	1075000	Maybe it's actually a very stable difference,
1075000	1077000	so it's not very close.
1077000	1079000	This is
1079000	1081000	what I will continue to talk about later.
1081000	1083000	Because I'm going to show you a statistic now.
1083000	1085000	Show you an approximate
1085000	1087000	rapid statistics.
1087000	1089000	If you're right,
1089000	1091000	I should do some statistics
1091000	1093000	to see if there is a significant difference.
1093000	1095000	But in fact,
1095000	1097000	the first one is
1097000	1099000	this is one point.
1099000	1101000	If I want to do an assessment,
1101000	1103000	there is another problem.
1103000	1105000	Our sample number is very unbalanced.
1105000	1107000	Very unbalanced.
1107000	1109000	So it means that our sample number
1109000	1111000	is about more than 10,000 points,
1111000	1113000	and their sample number is only more than 1,000 points.
1113000	1115000	So in fact, many times,
1115000	1117000	when you do an assessment like this,
1117000	1119000	sometimes there are some
1119000	1121000	things that you need to pay attention to.
1121000	1123000	But in fact,
1123000	1125000	at least in the case of showing data now,
1125000	1127000	I can only say it out loud.
1127000	1129000	What I can only say now is
1129000	1131000	to see if it's close or not.
1131000	1133000	Next,
1133000	1135000	the other three are
1135000	1137000	the results of the double option.
1137000	1139000	For the double option, I'm going to use three indexes
1139000	1141000	to talk about whether this market
1141000	1143000	has been able to
1143000	1145000	refine
1145000	1147000	the prediction of the theory.
1147000	1149000	The first three indexes we look at
1149000	1151000	are the average error.
1151000	1153000	The definition of the average error is actually below.
1153000	1155000	DQ is the price of
1155000	1157000	each unit
1157000	1159000	of each contract.
1159000	1161000	Subtract.
1161000	1163000	This means
1163000	1165000	how much is the difference
1165000	1167000	from our theoretical prediction.
1167000	1169000	Next, I look at the average.
1169000	1171000	Because we often have
1171000	1173000	about 800 different market configurations.
1173000	1175000	So in order to make everyone
1175000	1177000	comparable, I use
1177000	1179000	the average price to standardize it.
1179000	1181000	So we can actually use this index
1181000	1183000	to see how much our accuracy is.
1183000	1185000	The next one is
1185000	1187000	our
1187000	1189000	Smith Alpha.
1189000	1191000	Smith is to commemorate
1191000	1193000	Brown-Smith.
1193000	1195000	This index is actually very simple.
1195000	1197000	It is the distance
1197000	1199000	between my price
1199000	1201000	and
1201000	1203000	the price of my theoretical prediction.
1203000	1205000	So I take the square here.
1205000	1207000	Then I take another one.
1207000	1209000	Next, I look at the average distance.
1209000	1211000	Then I open a number.
1211000	1213000	So it's actually like my standard error.
1213000	1215000	But
1215000	1217000	what I'm doing today is not average.
1217000	1219000	What I'm doing today is
1219000	1221000	theoretical prediction.
1221000	1223000	Next, I still use
1223000	1225000	my average price to standardize it.
1225000	1227000	So I can use this index
1227000	1229000	to measure the fluctuation of price.
1229000	1231000	The next
1231000	1233000	and the third index is Efficiency.
1233000	1235000	For Efficiency, I want to use
1235000	1237000	the above picture to explain.
1237000	1239000	So in this
1239000	1241000	market equation,
1241000	1243000	if this seller
1243000	1245000	makes a deal with this buyer,
1245000	1247000	then it shows
1247000	1249000	the above section
1249000	1251000	in the middle
1251000	1253000	is the profit I made.
1253000	1255000	It's the buyer's profit.
1255000	1257000	The following section is the seller's profit.
1257000	1259000	So it tells me
1259000	1261000	the total length of this section
1261000	1263000	is the
1263000	1265000	profit I can make
1265000	1267000	from this deal.
1267000	1269000	That is to say,
1269000	1271000	I sum up the area of
1271000	1273000	the supply curve and demand curve.
1273000	1275000	In theory,
1275000	1277000	this is the total
1277000	1279000	surplus I can get.
1279000	1281000	So this year's efficiency
1281000	1283000	definition is
1283000	1285000	the efficiency I achieve
1285000	1287000	in this market
1287000	1289000	and the efficiency
1289000	1291000	I expect in theory.
1291000	1293000	The following
1293000	1295000	can be seen as
1295000	1297000	the first one is
1297000	1299000	my average error is about 6%.
1299000	1301000	That is to say, my average price
1301000	1303000	is about 6% higher than the theory.
1303000	1305000	The next one is
1305000	1307000	my Smith Alpha.
1307000	1309000	The fluctuation rate
1309000	1311000	is about 30%.
1311000	1313000	The efficiency
1313000	1315000	is about 84%.
1315000	1317000	In fact,
1317000	1319000	these numbers are
1319000	1321000	significantly different from the theory.
1321000	1323000	However,
1323000	1325000	this is related to another problem.
1325000	1327000	In our lab,
1327000	1329000	we often let our customers
1329000	1331000	play the same game for 10 or 20 rounds.
1331000	1333000	At this time,
1333000	1335000	after more than 10 rounds,
1335000	1337000	the price will become very stable.
1337000	1339000	But here,
1339000	1341000	if we play for 10 rounds,
1341000	1343000	the customer may have gone up to level 3.
1343000	1345000	This is why the price
1345000	1347000	here is unstable.
1347000	1349000	However,
1349000	1351000	I will try to show
1351000	1353000	if our students
1353000	1355000	can play enough rounds,
1355000	1357000	where will they end up?
1357000	1359000	This is the result
1359000	1361000	of the double option.
1361000	1363000	Let's continue to see
1363000	1365000	the whole distribution.
1373000	1375000	I don't know
1375000	1377000	which computer
1377000	1379000	I used to jump out.
1379000	1381000	I don't know
1381000	1383000	what to do now.
1383000	1385000	Thank you for reminding me.
1385000	1387000	I hope you don't
1387000	1389000	knock on my door anymore.
1389000	1391000	I don't want to leave the group.
1391000	1393000	Thank you.
1393000	1395000	Let's continue.
1395000	1397000	First, let's see
1397000	1399000	the whole distribution of Proposal Offer.
1399000	1401000	Because
1401000	1403000	in our game design,
1403000	1405000	the teacher can decide
1405000	1407000	whether to play one round, two rounds,
1407000	1409000	or several rounds.
1409000	1411000	If you play more than two rounds,
1411000	1413000	it will become a repeat game.
1413000	1415000	If we divide the data
1415000	1417000	into a repeat game and a single game,
1417000	1419000	we can see
1419000	1421000	that
1421000	1423000	the first point
1423000	1425000	is
1425000	1427000	theoretical prediction.
1427000	1429000	This is theoretical prediction.
1429000	1431000	This is theoretical prediction.
1431000	1433000	So here,
1433000	1435000	whether it is a one-shot game or a repeat game,
1435000	1437000	only about 10% of the audience
1437000	1439000	played on the theoretical prediction.
1439000	1441000	Next, we have seen
1441000	1443000	50% of the audience
1443000	1445000	played on the theoretical prediction.
1445000	1447000	Next, we have seen
1447000	1449000	50% of the audience
1449000	1451000	played on the theoretical prediction.
1451000	1453000	The first observation
1453000	1455000	is that we have a lot of Proposal Offer
1455000	1457000	on the natural focal point.
1457000	1459000	So I played 0,
1459000	1461000	10, 20, 30.
1461000	1463000	This is the first observation.
1463000	1465000	The second observation is that
1465000	1467000	only 6% of the audience
1467000	1469000	gave themselves
1469000	1471000	less than the Proposal Offer.
1471000	1473000	I gave myself more.
1473000	1475000	In this game,
1475000	1477000	there should be a first mover advantage.
1477000	1479000	I should give you 50% if I'm great.
1479000	1481000	According to the theory, I should not give you 10%.
1481000	1483000	But only 6% of the audience
1483000	1485000	gave more than the Proposal Offer.
1485000	1487000	This is the first observation.
1487000	1489000	Next, let's compare
1489000	1491000	the distribution with ROF.
1491000	1493000	This is ROF's distribution
1493000	1495000	in 1991.
1495000	1497000	As Mr. Zhang said,
1497000	1499000	we did not do a statistical analysis.
1499000	1501000	So we can only see
1501000	1503000	the distribution characteristics.
1503000	1505000	The first observation is that
1505000	1507000	the density is
1507000	1509000	about 50% to 40%.
1509000	1511000	The density is about 50% to 40%.
1511000	1513000	But this is
1513000	1515000	ROF's distribution.
1515000	1517000	So we can
1517000	1519000	give them the result.
1519000	1521000	In addition,
1521000	1523000	the biggest difference
1523000	1525000	between ROF and ROF
1525000	1527000	is that almost no one
1527000	1529000	played in the theoretical prediction.
1529000	1531000	But about 10% of the audience
1531000	1533000	played in the theoretical prediction.
1533000	1535000	In fact,
1535000	1537000	at least I and Colin
1537000	1539000	are not sure.
1539000	1541000	This may be the reason for the prediction option.
1541000	1543000	In the beginning of a game,
1543000	1545000	the prediction ball
1545000	1547000	is placed on the theoretical prediction.
1547000	1549000	So if the students
1549000	1551000	press the button
1551000	1553000	without thinking,
1553000	1555000	it means that
1555000	1557000	there is no strategy at all.
1557000	1559000	So 10% of the audience
1559000	1561000	may play in the theoretical prediction.
1561000	1563000	Of course, it may also be affected by the prediction option.
1563000	1565000	But this is...
1565000	1567000	Do you have the response time here?
1567000	1569000	I will fix it later.
1569000	1571000	According to your hypothesis,
1571000	1573000	the response time should be the lowest.
1573000	1575000	But the response time is actually very high.
1575000	1577000	But I will show the result later.
1577000	1579000	So it may not be the result of the prediction option.
1579000	1581000	Yes.
1581000	1583000	But...
1583000	1585000	Sorry, Bo-Xuan.
1585000	1587000	Can you show the previous video?
1587000	1589000	OK.
1589000	1591000	Because I just thought
1591000	1593000	if you said it was because of the default option,
1593000	1595000	then you should see...
1595000	1597000	Because the information of ROF
1597000	1599000	is very rare.
1599000	1601000	Almost none.
1601000	1603000	Yes.
1603000	1605000	But the people who chose 1
1605000	1607000	seem to be more likely than 0.
1607000	1609000	Yes.
1609000	1611000	So...
1611000	1613000	Although 0 is so high,
1613000	1615000	it may be the effect of the default option.
1615000	1617000	But it seems that there are more people
1617000	1619000	who are more likely.
1619000	1621000	If you look at the balance
1621000	1623000	as 0 or 1,
1623000	1625000	there are more people who chose 1.
1625000	1627000	Yes.
1627000	1629000	That's what I think.
1629000	1631000	Thank you for this comment.
1631000	1633000	But it is indeed...
1633000	1635000	It should be...
1635000	1637000	In this...
1637000	1639000	There should be a lot of people who play with the theory.
1639000	1641000	But it is indeed the default option.
1641000	1643000	This effect is indeed a confirmation.
1643000	1645000	But I will continue to talk about it.
1645000	1647000	Then here is
1647000	1649000	our acceptance rate.
1649000	1651000	Because I think this result is very cool.
1651000	1653000	So it doesn't matter if I talk about it later.
1653000	1655000	I will talk about it later.
1655000	1657000	First of all, because what we talked about earlier
1657000	1659000	is the unconditional acceptance rate.
1659000	1661000	What is more interesting now
1661000	1663000	is to measure the conditional acceptance rate.
1663000	1665000	Unconditional...
1665000	1667000	What is the number of offers I see?
1667000	1669000	That is to say, because we measure
1669000	1671000	the expected value of the conditions.
1671000	1673000	Then this is actually
1673000	1675000	a function of an offer.
1675000	1677000	So on this graph,
1677000	1679000	my X-axis shows
1679000	1681000	how many proposal offers I see.
1681000	1683000	What is the acceptance rate?
1683000	1685000	OK.
1685000	1687000	In this graph, the black dot represents the information of one-shot game.
1687000	1689000	The orange dot represents the information of repeat game.
1689000	1691000	Next,
1691000	1693000	the size of each point
1693000	1695000	represents
1695000	1697000	the density of the histogram
1697000	1699000	we saw earlier.
1699000	1701000	So if you put the size of this ball
1701000	1703000	projected to the X-axis,
1703000	1705000	it becomes the entire histogram.
1705000	1707000	OK.
1707000	1709000	Next, because when I was checking the data,
1709000	1711000	between 49 and 50,
1711000	1713000	there is actually a jump of about 20%.
1713000	1715000	So I thought it was strange.
1715000	1717000	So I used a specification
1717000	1719000	to measure
1719000	1721000	the P-splice linear
1721000	1723000	specification.
1723000	1725000	So what you can see
1725000	1727000	is that I think it is quite special.
1727000	1729000	If you are less than 50,
1729000	1731000	you see
1731000	1733000	that your acceptance rate is this curve.
1733000	1735000	When it is greater than 50,
1735000	1737000	there will be a big break here.
1737000	1739000	This is completely obvious.
1739000	1741000	It is very obvious.
1741000	1743000	When we measure the standard error,
1743000	1745000	we also use
1745000	1747000	a cluster.
1747000	1749000	We have a cluster at the session level.
1749000	1751000	So we use the most conservative estimation
1751000	1753000	to estimate our variability.
1753000	1755000	So in this case,
1755000	1757000	it is also very obvious.
1757000	1759000	If we put all the data together,
1759000	1761000	there is a jump of about 20% to 21%.
1761000	1763000	If we divide it into one-shot game
1763000	1765000	and repeat game,
1765000	1767000	the jump is about 16%.
1767000	1769000	If we divide it into one-shot game
1769000	1771000	and repeat game, the jump is about 26%.
1771000	1773000	First of all,
1773000	1775000	this phenomenon has not been seen
1775000	1777000	in the first 50 years.
1777000	1779000	So I think it is a very cool discovery.
1779000	1781000	Next, let's talk about 1.
1781000	1783000	First of all,
1783000	1785000	this interpretation is actually very complicated.
1785000	1787000	Because we have a lot of confounds here
1787000	1789000	that our database cannot detect.
1789000	1791000	But what we can be sure is that
1791000	1793000	at least the source of this break
1793000	1795000	is the difference in payoffs.
1795000	1797000	Because you can see that
1797000	1799000	when we come in from the left B,
1799000	1801000	you can come in from 49.99999.
1801000	1803000	Then the next is coming in from the right B,
1803000	1805000	it is about 50.0000001.
1805000	1807000	In fact, this gap is less than
1807000	1809000	how small your Epsilon is.
1809000	1811000	So this effect is definitely not
1811000	1813000	from monetary payoffs.
1813000	1815000	Or even if you are in a hypothetical state,
1815000	1817000	it is basically not from
1817000	1819000	how much your payoff is.
1819000	1821000	So it is very possible that
1821000	1823000	you have to consider
1823000	1825000	how other people
1825000	1827000	distribute the whole proposal.
1829000	1831000	Next, there are many interpretations here.
1831000	1833000	We can't uniquely pin down.
1833000	1835000	It may be like
1835000	1837000	because you are from 49.999 to 50.
1837000	1839000	There is a big gap here,
1839000	1841000	which is equality.
1841000	1843000	Because this paragraph can also mean
1843000	1845000	that I may be very, very care.
1845000	1847000	Am I equal to you?
1847000	1849000	Or this is the first one.
1849000	1851000	Or another one is that
1851000	1853000	if you don't give me 50,
1853000	1855000	I may punish you.
1855000	1857000	So this is why this paragraph
1857000	1859000	may be 10% more in the repeated game.
1859000	1861000	It may be that this 10% is more
1861000	1863000	that I want to punish you.
1863000	1865000	Or I may care about my fairness.
1865000	1867000	Or I simply
1867000	1869000	since we are not playing real money,
1869000	1871000	I just don't want to lose you.
1871000	1873000	So it means that
1873000	1875000	my acceptance rate is relatively low.
1875000	1877000	But when I can at least not lose you,
1877000	1879000	my acceptance rate is about the same.
1879000	1881000	This is what we see
1881000	1883000	in the data.
1883000	1885000	I want to ask
1885000	1887000	what is your idea?
1891000	1893000	I don't know.
1895000	1897000	Before you do this,
1897000	1899000	there is a problem.
1903000	1905000	Although you know a lot,
1905000	1907000	you just showed us
1907000	1909000	that there are very few offers above 50.
1909000	1911000	There are about 600.
1913000	1915000	So
1915000	1917000	your estimate of acceptance rate
1917000	1919000	is because
1919000	1921000	you are not using strategy method.
1921000	1923000	You are showing an offer.
1923000	1925000	So it means that
1925000	1927000	the point of return you are running now
1927000	1929000	when it is below 50
1931000	1933000	the variation
1933000	1935000	is relatively good.
1935000	1937000	But when it is above 50,
1939000	1941000	your estimate may not be stable.
1943000	1945000	But this point
1945000	1947000	is really interesting.
1947000	1949000	Because
1949000	1951000	let me think about it.
1955000	1957000	Have you ever tried
1957000	1959000	not to use
1959000	1961000	a linear return when it is below 50?
1961000	1963000	I haven't tried it yet.
1963000	1965000	But I want to try quadratic.
1967000	1969000	There is another possibility.
1969000	1971000	It is not like a breakpoint.
1971000	1973000	It is a
1973000	1975000	more complicated non-linear.
1977000	1979000	Because you fit linear,
1979000	1981000	it looks like a breakpoint.
1981000	1983000	If you look at the data directly,
1983000	1985000	it looks at least
1985000	1987000	I think it is quite linear.
1987000	1989000	If you look at the
1989000	1991000	orange repeating game,
1991000	1993000	it looks like
1993000	1995000	it is a
1995000	1997000	falling down.
1997000	1999000	But it is stable
1999000	2001000	when it is above 40.
2001000	2003000	It is like quadratic.
2003000	2005000	If you only look at
2005000	2007000	black,
2007000	2009000	it looks like
2009000	2011000	it is
2011000	2013000	between 20 and 50.
2013000	2015000	It is a steep drop.
2015000	2017000	But
2017000	2019000	it is stable
2019000	2021000	when it is below 20.
2021000	2023000	So
2023000	2025000	there is a possibility here.
2025000	2027000	It's just because
2027000	2029000	you fit a
2029000	2031000	straight line relationship.
2031000	2033000	Anyway, I will try quadratic.
2033000	2035000	But this is
2035000	2037000	what I estimated.
2037000	2039000	I think it is quite interesting.
2039000	2041000	If this is true,
2041000	2043000	how do we
2043000	2045000	reproduce this
2045000	2047000	breakpoint in the lab?
2047000	2049000	Let's look at
2049000	2051000	the result of ROS.
2051000	2053000	If we look at the data of ROS,
2053000	2055000	this breakpoint is completely invisible.
2057000	2059000	I think this result
2059000	2061000	is quite special.
2061000	2063000	We have a lot of work hypothesis
2063000	2065000	running at the same time.
2065000	2067000	But we have tried
2067000	2069000	a power test.
2069000	2071000	If we only draw the data,
2071000	2073000	the sample number is about 0.
2073000	2075000	So if we only draw 10% of the data,
2075000	2077000	can we estimate this breakpoint?
2077000	2079000	In our data, we can still estimate this breakpoint.
2079000	2081000	So it may not be because
2081000	2083000	of the problem of power in statistics.
2083000	2085000	Then another
2085000	2087000	work hypothesis is
2087000	2089000	hypothetical stake.
2089000	2091000	Is it because it's all
2091000	2093000	not about making money?
2093000	2095000	So I care more about the ranking between you and me.
2095000	2097000	At least I don't want to lose you.
2097000	2099000	So
2099000	2101000	this is my current work hypothesis.
2101000	2103000	This may be
2103000	2105000	the next article to do
2105000	2107000	is how to reproduce this breakpoint in the lab.
2107000	2109000	I think it's quite interesting.
2109000	2111000	Can you remind us
2111000	2113000	again
2113000	2115000	the population composition of your data?
2115000	2117000	For example,
2117000	2119000	the proportion of each state.
2119000	2121000	We have
2121000	2123000	seen that
2123000	2125000	the United States has the West,
2125000	2127000	the Middle West,
2127000	2129000	the Northeast,
2129000	2131000	the South America,
2131000	2133000	Canada,
2133000	2135000	the United Kingdom,
2135000	2137000	Spain,
2137000	2139000	China, Japan,
2139000	2141000	and Singapore.
2141000	2143000	What about the proportion?
2143000	2145000	About 80% of the data is in the North,
2145000	2147000	about 10% in Europe,
2147000	2149000	and 10% in Asia.
2149000	2151000	OK.
2151000	2153000	So overall,
2153000	2155000	this result
2155000	2157000	is more conservative.
2157000	2159000	It's based on the North America,
2159000	2161000	right?
2161000	2163000	Yes.
2163000	2165000	OK, I just want to ask.
2165000	2167000	But I want to add
2167000	2169000	that the problem is
2169000	2171000	all the results in the lab
2171000	2173000	are not in the North America.
2173000	2175000	Yes.
2175000	2177000	That's true.
2177000	2179000	OK.
2179000	2181000	Then I'll...
2181000	2183000	Bo-Xuan,
2183000	2185000	if you want to compare
2185000	2187000	with Ross's article,
2187000	2189000	Ross's article is mainly not in the North America,
2189000	2191000	but the data of
2191000	2193000	other works
2193000	2195000	such as Automaton Game
2195000	2197000	can be observed.
2197000	2199000	I have almost never seen any shortcomings.
2199000	2201000	Yes.
2201000	2203000	OK.
2203000	2205000	Because of the time...
2205000	2207000	You can go first.
2207000	2209000	I'll go first.
2209000	2211000	I have a question.
2211000	2213000	Because the article was written
2213000	2215000	about 20 years ago,
2215000	2217000	right?
2217000	2219000	Yes.
2219000	2221000	Do you think the change of time
2221000	2223000	has a big impact on the data?
2223000	2225000	Of course it's possible.
2225000	2227000	Because a lot of social preferences
2227000	2229000	may change with time.
2229000	2231000	For example, the value of Taiwanese
2231000	2233000	may change every few years.
2233000	2235000	So it's true that
2235000	2237000	there may be a difference.
2237000	2239000	But we can see that
2239000	2241000	there is a difference.
2241000	2243000	If we look at it simply,
2243000	2245000	if it has any impact on the shortcomings,
2245000	2247000	maybe it's okay.
2247000	2249000	Because the shortcomings may be a mirror effect.
2249000	2251000	But this is a big problem.
2251000	2253000	We can talk about it later.
2253000	2255000	Then I'll go on.
2255000	2257000	Finally, the teacher just said
2257000	2259000	to show the reaction time.
2259000	2261000	Because our server does record
2261000	2263000	the reaction time.
2263000	2265000	Then I look here.
2265000	2267000	Because in one-shot game and repeated game,
2267000	2269000	the reaction time is very similar.
2269000	2271000	So I only use one-shot game
2271000	2273000	to demonstrate the result.
2273000	2275000	First of all, the black line,
2275000	2277000	the y-axis is the reaction time.
2277000	2279000	The black line represents the reaction time.
2279000	2281000	Then the black line is
2281000	2283000	our lowest estimation.
2283000	2285000	Then the orange line,
2285000	2287000	the y-axis is my acceptance rate.
2287000	2289000	Then this is
2289000	2291000	also my lowest estimation.
2291000	2293000	Then below me,
2293000	2295000	the x-axis is
2295000	2297000	my offer.
2297000	2299000	If you don't have any concept,
2299000	2301000	you can think of it as
2301000	2303000	doing a return in each section
2303000	2305000	to measure it.
2305000	2307000	This means that
2307000	2309000	I'm fitting the data
2309000	2311000	when it's close to infinity.
2311000	2313000	It's very close.
2313000	2315000	So what the teacher saw at the beginning
2315000	2317000	was at zero.
2317000	2319000	It actually took a lot of time.
2319000	2321000	It actually took almost 20 seconds
2321000	2323000	to make a decision.
2323000	2325000	However,
2325000	2327000	at 50,
2327000	2329000	there was a very sharp drop.
2329000	2331000	It only took about 8 seconds
2331000	2333000	to make a decision.
2333000	2335000	This means that
2335000	2337000	50-50 may be
2337000	2339000	a very special allocation.
2339000	2341000	At least for them,
2341000	2343000	if I see 50-50,
2343000	2345000	I don't have to think too much
2345000	2347000	and I can decide to accept it.
2347000	2349000	Another thing is
2349000	2351000	we see a very sharp kink
2351000	2353000	at 50-50.
2353000	2355000	It's true that
2355000	2357000	no matter how
2357000	2359000	qualitative you are,
2359000	2361000	at least we can still see something.
2361000	2363000	This is the data
2363000	2365000	on the reaction time.
2365000	2367000	However,
2367000	2369000	the interpretation is quite special.
2369000	2371000	At least for Show,
2371000	2373000	at 50-50,
2373000	2375000	we can spend very little time
2375000	2377000	to make a decision.
2377000	2379000	You can't record
2379000	2381000	the proposal time
2381000	2383000	to enter the game.
2383000	2385000	Because if you want to see
2385000	2387000	if it's default...
2387000	2389000	We can see
2389000	2391000	the time it takes
2391000	2393000	to enter the game.
2393000	2395000	If you want to see
2395000	2397000	if it's the default option
2397000	2399000	that causes a lot of people to raise their hands,
2399000	2401000	you should look at the proposal time.
2401000	2403000	Yes, you're right.
2405000	2407000	We did look at the proposal time.
2407000	2409000	But I remember
2409000	2411000	it took a lot of time here.
2415000	2417000	Hello?
2417000	2419000	Let me respond.
2419000	2421000	At the close to 0,
2421000	2423000	you said
2423000	2425000	it took a lot of time.
2425000	2427000	You mentioned
2427000	2429000	that
2429000	2431000	you were thinking
2431000	2433000	that
2433000	2435000	at 0,
2435000	2437000	there would be a lot of people raising their hands.
2437000	2439000	At that time,
2439000	2441000	I was wondering
2441000	2443000	if it was because the starting point
2443000	2445000	of the slider bar was 0.
2445000	2447000	However,
2447000	2449000	if they spent a lot of time
2449000	2451000	to think about it,
2451000	2453000	I don't think
2453000	2455000	it's because...
2455000	2457000	I think it's a bit like
2457000	2459000	negating
2459000	2461000	the explanation you mentioned
2461000	2463000	at the beginning.
2463000	2465000	I just accepted it casually.
2465000	2467000	That's right.
2467000	2469000	But it took a lot of time here.
2469000	2471000	It took a lot of time
2471000	2473000	to respond.
2473000	2475000	But I should show you
2475000	2477000	the proposal time.
2477000	2479000	But it's true.
2479000	2481000	It's funny to explain the coding.
2481000	2483000	It took a lot of time
2483000	2485000	to look at this.
2485000	2487000	A lot of people didn't want to accept it.
2487000	2489000	It took me a long time
2489000	2491000	to accept it.
2491000	2493000	That's right.
2493000	2495000	Bo-xuan, you can
2495000	2497000	split the responder into
2497000	2499000	accepting and not accepting.
2499000	2501000	Okay.
2501000	2503000	This point is quite special.
2503000	2505000	I'll split it.
2505000	2507000	I'll write it down.
2509000	2511000	Next,
2511000	2513000	I still have some time.
2513000	2515000	I'm going to talk about the result of double option.
2515000	2517000	Double option, first of all...
2517000	2519000	Bo-xuan, before you enter the double option,
2519000	2521000	let's talk about the
2521000	2523000	Automatic Game breakpoint.
2523000	2525000	I was just thinking,
2525000	2527000	you just said that one possibility of the breakpoint
2527000	2529000	is that everyone cares about fairness.
2529000	2531000	The other possibility is that
2531000	2533000	everyone cares about
2533000	2535000	not counting you.
2535000	2537000	Is there a way to look at
2537000	2539000	the 50 proposed
2539000	2541000	in your data?
2541000	2543000	Is the acceptance rate
2543000	2545000	particularly high?
2545000	2547000	Or is it the whole breakpoint
2547000	2549000	after the breakpoint is raised
2549000	2551000	to form a frequency curve?
2551000	2553000	Because if you care about fairness,
2553000	2555000	maybe after 50 is particularly high,
2555000	2557000	there will be another breakpoint
2557000	2559000	after 51 and 52.
2559000	2561000	One-shot game is like this.
2561000	2563000	There is no repeated game.
2563000	2565000	Okay.
2565000	2567000	I'll keep talking.
2567000	2569000	I'm afraid I don't have enough time.
2569000	2571000	The next double option is...
2571000	2573000	The first thing I want to show here
2573000	2575000	is what the data looks like.
2575000	2577000	This is our predicted market.
2577000	2579000	The next one is
2579000	2581000	the price fluctuation.
2581000	2583000	This is just an example.
2583000	2585000	I have 10 regions here.
2585000	2587000	I choose a market for each region.
2587000	2589000	I draw it out to show you
2589000	2591000	what it looks like.
2591000	2593000	You can see that I only draw four periods.
2593000	2595000	Because the length is about four periods.
2595000	2597000	If you look at the first period,
2597000	2599000	everyone may be very noisy.
2599000	2601000	Then look at the second and third periods.
2601000	2603000	In fact, the price fluctuation
2603000	2605000	becomes less.
2605000	2607000	Then look at the fourth period.
2607000	2609000	The more they play, the more stable they become.
2609000	2611000	So what we want to see here is
2611000	2613000	that under the double option market mechanism,
2613000	2615000	as long as they play about three or four times,
2615000	2617000	consumers can find
2617000	2619000	a balanced price, even if I don't tell them anything.
2619000	2621000	The next thing is
2621000	2623000	what I said earlier.
2623000	2625000	Because our bidders play very short,
2625000	2627000	we want to estimate
2627000	2629000	what it is like.
2629000	2631000	If it can play a lot of games,
2631000	2633000	where will it end up?
2633000	2635000	We spent about a month
2635000	2637000	with Alex
2637000	2639000	to figure this out.
2639000	2641000	First of all, let's talk about intuition.
2641000	2643000	Don't think about intuition.
2643000	2645000	Let me give you an example.
2645000	2647000	Let's say
2647000	2649000	a lot of people here have the same experience.
2649000	2651000	When you apply for a PhD,
2651000	2653000	I want to know
2653000	2655000	how this student
2655000	2657000	will perform in the next career.
2657000	2659000	But the only information I can know
2659000	2661000	is his GPA for the next four years.
2661000	2663000	So
2663000	2665000	at this time,
2665000	2667000	if a student wants to estimate
2667000	2669000	what will happen next,
2669000	2671000	the only thing he can do is to increase his GPA
2671000	2673000	in different periods of time.
2673000	2675000	So it's possible that
2675000	2677000	I put more players in the last GPA
2677000	2679000	and fewer players in the first GPA.
2679000	2681000	So in this market,
2681000	2683000	you can look at two parts.
2683000	2685000	First, the left side is our dependable variable.
2685000	2687000	On the right side,
2687000	2689000	if T is 1,
2689000	2691000	that means I'm in the first period.
2691000	2693000	In this case,
2693000	2695000	it's back to the simplest way to go back.
2695000	2697000	This is very common.
2697000	2699000	In the first period,
2699000	2701000	if you use the example of GPA,
2701000	2703000	it means that in the first semester,
2703000	2705000	there may be a lot of variables.
2705000	2707000	Maybe it's because you're a middle school student
2707000	2709000	or you're from another school,
2709000	2711000	so it will affect your GPA in the first semester.
2711000	2713000	But in the second semester,
2713000	2715000	I only put you at the starting point.
2715000	2717000	Maybe you're a middle school student
2717000	2719000	or something like that to explain this.
2719000	2721000	I only give you a quarter of the weight.
2721000	2723000	I also give you a quarter of the weight
2723000	2725000	of your GPA at that time.
2725000	2727000	It means that your GPA at this time
2727000	2729000	may be only half,
2729000	2731000	and it can be attributed to
2731000	2733000	the population composition in front of you.
2733000	2735000	In the third period,
2735000	2737000	I put your GPA at two-thirds of the weight.
2737000	2739000	In this case,
2739000	2741000	I only give you one-third of the weight
2741000	2743000	of the starting point.
2743000	2745000	In other words,
2745000	2747000	if I can make T
2747000	2749000	converge to infinity,
2749000	2751000	then my beta2
2751000	2753000	is actually the progressive estimate
2753000	2755000	of our dependent variable.
2755000	2757000	In other words,
2757000	2759000	if we put this y
2759000	2761000	on all the indicators of the first three markets,
2761000	2763000	it means that this market
2763000	2765000	will converge to where
2765000	2767000	if consumers can play enough.
2767000	2769000	If we put this value
2769000	2771000	in front of our three dependent variables,
2771000	2773000	this is the mean error deviation.
2773000	2775000	The final price is only
2775000	2777000	1% higher than the average price.
2777000	2779000	It is not significantly different
2779000	2781000	from the theoretical estimation.
2781000	2783000	The final price change
2783000	2785000	is reduced to 11%.
2785000	2787000	Although the point estimate is a bit big,
2787000	2789000	it is also not significantly different
2789000	2791000	from the theoretical estimation.
2791000	2793000	Finally, we can reduce the efficiency
2793000	2795000	to 97%,
2795000	2797000	which is not significantly different from 1%.
2797000	2799000	So these results are basically
2799000	2801000	the same.
2801000	2803000	At least we can prove that
2803000	2805000	double option is a very stable
2805000	2807000	price mechanism
2807000	2809000	to achieve 100% efficiency.
2809000	2811000	At that time, we saw that
2811000	2813000	our data also showed the same thing.
2813000	2815000	When our students can play enough,
2815000	2817000	all of our waffers
2817000	2819000	should be exhausted.
2819000	2821000	The last word is
2821000	2823000	Can I go back to the last page?
2823000	2825000	Yes, you can.
2825000	2827000	I want to confirm
2827000	2829000	why there is no variable
2829000	2831000	next to beta 2
2831000	2833000	in the model?
2835000	2837000	Because this means that
2837000	2839000	I want to see where your final GPA
2839000	2841000	is. I bring a constant here.
2841000	2843000	I multiply here
2843000	2845000	by a constant.
2847000	2849000	This means that I am adding
2849000	2851000	your GPA
2851000	2853000	to your original
2853000	2855000	demographic variation.
2857000	2859000	Is it OK?
2859000	2861000	It doesn't matter.
2861000	2863000	If you don't understand,
2863000	2865000	I will discuss with you later.
2865000	2867000	I will continue.
2867000	2869000	What we see at the end is that
2869000	2871000	although there are some
2871000	2873000	theoretical estimates,
2873000	2875000	if there are still some gaps,
2875000	2877000	where are they?
2877000	2879000	What we see at the end is the amount of transactions.
2879000	2881000	The horizontal axis
2881000	2883000	is the amount of theoretical estimates.
2883000	2885000	The vertical axis is the amount of theoretical estimates.
2885000	2887000	The horizontal axis is the amount of theoretical estimates.
2887000	2889000	Here is the real
2889000	2891000	amount of observations.
2891000	2893000	You can see that
2893000	2895000	if the market is not balanced,
2895000	2897000	we are often under-traded.
2897000	2899000	This is because
2899000	2901000	the last 1-2 transactions
2901000	2903000	may bring us 1-2%
2903000	2905000	of the efficiency gap.
2905000	2907000	In this case,
2907000	2909000	I am too lazy to make the last 1-2 cents.
2909000	2911000	I am too lazy to make the last 1-2 cents.
2911000	2913000	This is the main result of the double option.
2913000	2915000	We still have about 10 minutes.
2915000	2917000	I want to talk about
2917000	2919000	what I said earlier.
2919000	2921000	We have a lot of
2921000	2923000	transactions in different countries.
2923000	2925000	I want to use
2925000	2927000	some metanonysis tools
2927000	2929000	to analyze
2929000	2931000	the composition
2931000	2933000	of these transactions.
2933000	2935000	The first thing we look at
2935000	2937000	is the transactions between countries.
2937000	2939000	The first thing we look at
2939000	2941000	is the transactions between countries.
2941000	2943000	This is a
2943000	2945000	calculation in metanonysis.
2945000	2947000	This is a calculation in metanonysis.
2947000	2949000	It is called I-square.
2949000	2951000	If you look at the graph,
2951000	2953000	you can see that
2953000	2955000	these are
2955000	2957000	the average transactions
2957000	2959000	of the proposal offer.
2959000	2961000	Next,
2961000	2963000	we have all the transactions.
2963000	2965000	We have the transactions between countries.
2965000	2967000	Of course, we also have the transactions within the country.
2967000	2969000	What we want to know is
2969000	2971000	the proportion of transactions
2971000	2973000	between countries.
2973000	2975000	Let's calculate I-square.
2975000	2977000	Since we don't have much time,
2977000	2979000	I won't talk about how to calculate I-square.
2979000	2981000	However,
2981000	2983000	the proportion of I-square is
2983000	2985000	the number of transactions
2985000	2987000	from between regions.
2987000	2989000	We can see that
2989000	2991000	the result of the calculation is
2991000	2993000	86.6% of the proposal offer.
2993000	2995000	This is a very significant transaction.
2995000	2997000	Although we dare not say this is a cultural difference,
2997000	2999000	what we can say is
2999000	3001000	at least we can see that
3001000	3003000	the transactions between countries are very significant.
3003000	3005000	From the same perspective,
3005000	3007000	we look at the acceptance rate.
3007000	3009000	The acceptance rate is special
3009000	3011000	because we want to look at the acceptance rate of conditions.
3011000	3013000	What we have to do is
3013000	3015000	to compare the shape of the whole probability function.
3015000	3017000	In order to make it
3017000	3019000	comparable,
3019000	3021000	what we can do is
3021000	3023000	we ask for a logic regression.
3023000	3025000	On the left,
3025000	3027000	we put 0 or 0.1.
3027000	3029000	On the right,
3029000	3031000	we put 10 countries' dummy variables.
3031000	3033000	On the right,
3033000	3035000	we put 10 countries' dummy variables.
3035000	3037000	The result of the calculation is
3037000	3039000	the coefficient of the dummy variable
3039000	3041000	is the shape of the whole probability function.
3041000	3043000	We use this coefficient
3043000	3045000	to measure the variation between countries.
3045000	3047000	We can see that
3047000	3049000	only 30% of the variation
3049000	3051000	comes from countries.
3051000	3053000	This is not significant.
3053000	3055000	On the right,
3055000	3057000	we can see that
3057000	3059000	Proposal Offer has a significant variation
3059000	3061000	between countries.
3061000	3063000	The acceptance rate is not significant.
3063000	3065000	This is in response to
3065000	3067000	Roth's conjecture in 1991.
3067000	3069000	In 1991,
3069000	3071000	Roth proposed a hypothesis
3071000	3073000	that the cultural difference
3073000	3075000	between countries
3075000	3077000	should be
3077000	3079000	influenced by
3079000	3081000	Proposal Offer.
3081000	3083000	However,
3083000	3085000	the acceptance rate is not affected.
3085000	3087000	This is a good evidence
3087000	3089000	to respond to
3089000	3091000	Roth's initial hypothesis.
3091000	3093000	This is a good evidence to respond to
3093000	3095000	Roth's initial hypothesis.
3095000	3097000	Finally, we look at the variation
3097000	3099000	between double options.
3099000	3101000	We look at the first round
3101000	3103000	of the market.
3103000	3105000	Then we look at
3105000	3107000	the first price
3107000	3109000	and the last price
3109000	3111000	between them.
3111000	3113000	We want to know
3113000	3115000	how the market price
3115000	3117000	is balanced.
3117000	3119000	This is the first price
3119000	3121000	of each market.
3121000	3123000	We can see that
3123000	3125000	only 27.3% of the variation
3125000	3127000	comes from countries.
3127000	3129000	This is not significant.
3129000	3131000	We can see that
3131000	3133000	the first price
3133000	3135000	between countries
3135000	3137000	is very noisy
3137000	3139000	because of
3139000	3141000	the standard error.
3141000	3143000	However,
3143000	3145000	the standard error bar
3145000	3147000	is quite large in other countries.
3147000	3149000	In the first round,
3149000	3151000	you may be wondering
3151000	3153000	what the price is.
3153000	3155000	In the last price,
3155000	3157000	the standard error bar
3157000	3159000	is very small.
3159000	3161000	Basically,
3161000	3163000	every country
3163000	3165000	can predict the price.
3165000	3167000	If we look at
3167000	3169000	the overall price distribution,
3169000	3171000	the first price
3171000	3173000	is about 0.33%.
3173000	3175000	In the last price,
3175000	3177000	the overall price is only 14%,
3177000	3179000	so the standard error bar is 60%.
3179000	3181000	This tells us that
3181000	3183000	in the beginning,
3183000	3185000	you may not know
3185000	3187000	what the price is,
3187000	3189000	but in the end,
3189000	3191000	you can get the balance
3191000	3193000	very stable.
3193000	3195000	The market will tell you
3195000	3197000	what the balance looks like.
3197000	3199000	In the end,
3199000	3201000	I will summarize
3201000	3203000	with this video.
3203000	3205000	In this project,
3205000	3207000	we tested
3207000	3209000	the stability of
3209000	3211000	the final purchase.
3211000	3213000	In the Ultimate Game,
3213000	3215000	we can see that
3215000	3217000	more than 94% of the proposals
3217000	3219000	are offered at 50%.
3219000	3221000	Many of the proposals
3221000	3223000	will be offered
3223000	3225000	at the natural breakpoint.
3225000	3227000	In terms of acceptance rate,
3227000	3229000	we saw a 20% breakpoint.
3229000	3231000	In the repeat auction,
3231000	3233000	we saw 10% more
3233000	3235000	breakpoints.
3235000	3237000	In terms of response time,
3237000	3239000	it is basically the lowest
3239000	3241000	at 50%.
3241000	3243000	In the double auction,
3243000	3245000	no matter which of the three indicators
3245000	3247000	we use, accuracy,
3247000	3249000	fluctuation, or efficiency,
3249000	3251000	we can predict
3251000	3253000	when our students
3253000	3255000	can play enough.
3255000	3257000	In the end,
3257000	3259000	we tested
3259000	3261000	all the variations.
3261000	3263000	In the Ultimate Game,
3263000	3265000	the proposal offer
3265000	3267000	has more variables
3267000	3269000	than the acceptance rate.
3269000	3271000	This corresponds to
3271000	3273000	Roth's contracture in 1991.
3273000	3275000	In the Ultimate Game
3275000	3277000	and the double auction,
3277000	3279000	we saw a big difference
3279000	3281000	between the two countries.
3281000	3283000	This corresponds to the fact that
3283000	3285000	the double auction is a very stable mechanism
3285000	3287000	in every country.
3287000	3289000	I think this is
3289000	3291000	all I have.
3291000	3293000	I will show my email.
3293000	3295000	If you have any questions,
3295000	3297000	you can email me or contact me on Facebook.
3297000	3299000	We have about 5 minutes left.
3299000	3301000	Let's see what questions you have.
3301000	3303000	Do you have any comments?
3307000	3309000	Thank you.
3311000	3313000	Please comment.
3317000	3319000	Do you have
3319000	3321000	any questions?
3321000	3323000	I will ask first.
3323000	3325000	Wait a minute.
3325000	3327000	The first question is for you.
3331000	3333000	You have to estimate the long-term result.
3333000	3335000	There is a way.
3335000	3337000	You can show us
3337000	3339000	the data
3339000	3341000	in the lab.
3341000	3343000	If you only use the first few rounds,
3343000	3345000	then you can estimate
3345000	3347000	the long-term result.
3347000	3349000	In this way,
3349000	3351000	people may understand better.
3355000	3357000	I'm not sure
3357000	3359000	how long
3359000	3361000	the gap
3361000	3363000	is.
3363000	3365000	How do you estimate the long-term result?
3365000	3367000	Let me explain first.
3371000	3373000	I mean
3373000	3375000	what you want to verify.
3375000	3377000	If it is a double auction,
3377000	3379000	then
3379000	3381000	why...
3381000	3383000	You mean Asians are more polite?
3383000	3385000	No, I mean
3385000	3387000	double auctions
3387000	3389000	in different parts of the world
3389000	3391000	are closer to each other.
3391000	3393000	However,
3393000	3395000	there is a big difference
3395000	3397000	between each country.
3399000	3401000	That's what I want to say.
3409000	3411000	Okay.
3411000	3413000	Let me think about it.
3413000	3415000	Because...
3415000	3417000	There is a problem here.
3417000	3419000	You mean
3419000	3421000	the market is
3421000	3423000	universal,
3423000	3425000	and
3425000	3427000	there is no
3427000	3429000	final
3429000	3431000	negotiation.
3431000	3433000	However,
3433000	3435000	there is a problem here.
3435000	3437000	If you don't use
3437000	3439000	the strategy method,
3439000	3441000	you can't see the
3441000	3443000	strategy of the
3443000	3445000	mutual fund.
3447000	3449000	So,
3449000	3451000	what you see
3451000	3453000	is that
3453000	3455000	in terms of
3455000	3457000	acceptance or not,
3457000	3459000	you can only explain
3459000	3461000	the 30% variation.
3461000	3463000	However,
3463000	3465000	in terms of
3465000	3467000	the actual strategy,
3467000	3469000	I'm not sure
3469000	3471000	how far you can go.
3471000	3473000	Maybe
3473000	3475000	it's because
3475000	3477000	different countries
3477000	3479000	have already explained
3479000	3481000	most of the proposal.
3481000	3483000	So,
3483000	3485000	it means
3485000	3487000	that everyone
3487000	3489000	has proposed
3489000	3491000	social norms
3491000	3493000	based on that culture.
3493000	3495000	So, there is not much difference
3495000	3497000	in terms of acceptance or not.
3497000	3499000	Maybe it's because
3499000	3501000	it's not in the proposal.
3501000	3503000	This is also
3503000	3505000	what I want to point out.
3507000	3509000	Ok, that's all.
3509000	3511000	Can I ask a question?
3511000	3513000	Sure.
3513000	3515000	Hi.
3515000	3517000	In the Ultimatum game,
3517000	3519000	0 and 100
3519000	3521000	have more than 2.
3521000	3523000	I agree with what Meng just said.
3523000	3525000	According to the proposal,
3525000	3527000	the default reaction time
3527000	3529000	might be
3529000	3531000	a factor
3531000	3533000	in the outcome.
3533000	3535000	But you said
3535000	3537000	you have an instruction
3537000	3539000	for the experiment,
3539000	3541000	right?
3541000	3543000	So, can you tell
3543000	3545000	what is
3545000	3547000	the incentive
3547000	3549000	to give
3549000	3551000	the same result
3551000	3553000	as the proposal?
3553000	3555000	Usually,
3555000	3557000	the incentive is
3557000	3559000	how many points you get
3559000	3561000	if you participate in the experiment.
3561000	3563000	But I don't know
3563000	3565000	what their design is like.
3565000	3567000	Maybe some of them
3567000	3569000	are related to the outcome
3569000	3571000	and give you points in proportion.
3571000	3573000	Some of them
3573000	3575000	just participate in the experiment and give points.
3575000	3577000	If they participate in the experiment
3577000	3579000	and give points,
3579000	3581000	the proposal or the result
3581000	3583000	basically have no effect on them.
3583000	3585000	If you compare the outcome
3585000	3587000	with Ralph's experiment,
3587000	3589000	it's normal to have more than 100 points.
3589000	3591000	Because the result
3591000	3593000	is just a result.
3593000	3595000	He didn't think of anything else.
3595000	3597000	As for the fact that
3597000	3599000	there are more than 0 points,
3599000	3601000	I think
3601000	3603000	it's just a question.
3603000	3605000	In general,
3605000	3607000	people who do the experiment
3607000	3609000	should be
3609000	3611000	from the economics department.
3611000	3613000	I don't know if this hypothesis is right.
3613000	3615000	But this is what I imagine.
3615000	3617000	And then...
3617000	3619000	There is also a postgraduate school.
3619000	3621000	Yes, postgraduate school.
3621000	3623000	It's a class
3623000	3625000	teaching the ultimate game theory.
3625000	3627000	It may teach the game theory
3627000	3629000	or something like that.
3629000	3631000	The problem here
3631000	3633000	is that
3633000	3635000	some classes
3635000	3637000	teach the ultimate game theory
3637000	3639000	and the theoretical prediction is 0.
3639000	3641000	Or
3641000	3643000	they do the experiment
3643000	3645000	before the theoretical prediction.
3645000	3647000	There is a gap.
3647000	3649000	Because if you do the experiment
3649000	3651000	after the theoretical prediction is given,
3651000	3653000	the default of many people
3653000	3655000	will be 0.
3655000	3657000	Let me respond to this.
3657000	3659000	We have seen different classes.
3659000	3661000	The smallest class
3661000	3663000	is the game theory class.
3663000	3665000	This is a response.
3665000	3667000	OK.
3667000	3669000	Can you see
3669000	3671000	the degree
3671000	3673000	of the class
3673000	3675000	related to the game theory?
3675000	3677000	Can you see this?
3677000	3679000	Yes.
3679000	3681000	We can see it.
3681000	3683000	Because we have the name of the class,
3683000	3685000	so we probably know.
3685000	3687000	What we can't see is
3687000	3689000	that they teach the theoretical prediction
3689000	3691000	before the game theory.
3691000	3693000	OK.
3693000	3695000	For 0 and 100,
3695000	3697000	there is a big difference
3697000	3699000	between these two classes.
3699000	3701000	So I think
3701000	3703000	if you can
3703000	3705000	clear the data,
3705000	3707000	or find the way
3707000	3709000	like just now,
3709000	3711000	then compare with the kink.
3711000	3713000	OK.
3713000	3715000	Maybe it will be closer.
3715000	3717000	I don't know if this will affect.
3717000	3719000	OK.
3719000	3721000	I have notes.
3721000	3723000	Thank you.
3723000	3725000	Hello.
3725000	3727000	OK.
3727000	3729000	You ask first.
3729000	3731000	OK. Thank you.
3731000	3733000	This is not a problem.
3733000	3735000	It's more like a comment.
3735000	3737000	Since
3737000	3739000	you have the default option
3739000	3741000	bias,
3741000	3743000	it seems to be a serious thing.
3743000	3745000	It will make your two curves
3745000	3747000	different from the theoretical one.
3747000	3749000	My idea is
3749000	3751000	can you...
3751000	3753000	Will it be too difficult?
3753000	3755000	Can you change the program
3755000	3757000	and make the starting point
3757000	3759000	different every time?
3759000	3761000	You can choose a starting point
3761000	3763000	to solve the problem.
3763000	3765000	Let me respond.
3765000	3767000	This is technically
3767000	3769000	easy to do.
3769000	3771000	But there is another problem
3771000	3773000	in economics.
3773000	3775000	I'm afraid there will be
3775000	3777000	the result of anchoring.
3777000	3779000	So...
3779000	3781000	Sorry.
3781000	3783000	If your starting point
3783000	3785000	is a very high offer,
3785000	3787000	you may be affected
3787000	3789000	by that point.
3789000	3791000	If your starting point
3791000	3793000	is low,
3793000	3795000	you may be affected by that point.
3795000	3797000	So we can't
3797000	3799000	control
3799000	3801000	the most
3801000	3803000	standard time.
3803000	3805000	Usually,
3805000	3807000	the way to control
3807000	3809000	is to put $100
3809000	3811000	directly on the desktop.
3811000	3813000	Don't put it on both sides.
3813000	3815000	Put it one by one.
3815000	3817000	But
3817000	3819000	in their
3819000	3821000	operation,
3821000	3823000	they choose
3823000	3825000	to put it directly at the beginning.
3825000	3827000	So there will be a prediction effect.
3827000	3829000	But in terms of response time,
3829000	3831000	the prediction effect should be small.
3831000	3833000	I have a response.
3833000	3835000	Or just change the interface
3835000	3837000	and just fill in the numbers.
3837000	3839000	Don't use Labar.
3839000	3841000	Of course,
3841000	3843000	this is also possible.
3843000	3845000	But you may have to
3845000	3847000	talk to the engineer.
3847000	3849000	But this is also possible.
3849000	3851000	But we want to change Labar.
3851000	3853000	We want to use Labar mainly
3853000	3855000	to make the picture interesting
3855000	3857000	and make consumers want to buy it.
3857000	3859000	Make students have fun.
3859000	3861000	I don't know why.
3861000	3863000	Everyone thinks Labar is fun.
3863000	3865000	I like Labar.
3865000	3867000	Yes, but there will be a lot of problems.
3867000	3869000	Of course.
3869000	3871000	Many people
3871000	3873000	operate with a tablet.
3873000	3875000	Yes, that's right.
3877000	3879000	I have a question.
3881000	3883000	Hello, can you hear me?
3883000	3885000	This question is like this.
3885000	3887000	Because you know
3887000	3889000	Zhang Anping is studying
3889000	3891000	social psychology.
3891000	3893000	He often plays
3893000	3895000	the game of the game.
3895000	3897000	But they like to do one thing.
3897000	3899000	That is to manipulate the victim.
3899000	3901000	For example, let you play the game first.
3901000	3903000	Then teach you Game Theory.
3903000	3905000	Then let you play the game and look at the difference.
3905000	3907000	But what they do more often is
3907000	3909000	let you play the game first.
3909000	3911000	Then let you watch Hitler's documentary.
3911000	3913000	Then let you play the game and see if there is any difference.
3913000	3915000	Have you ever tried to manipulate the victim?
3917000	3919000	This is what we can't do.
3919000	3921000	Because you are
3921000	3923000	giving the victim different treatments.
3923000	3925000	We can compare the experimental group and the control group.
3925000	3927000	But we are basically
3927000	3929000	because we don't have an experimental group and a control group.
3929000	3931000	So this is
3931000	3933000	what we can't do.
3933000	3935000	But of course, if we are in the lab,
3935000	3937000	we can do it completely.
3937000	3939000	But you can sell the product to the psychology department.
3939000	3941000	I'm sure of this.
3941000	3943000	This is
3943000	3945000	So we are now
3945000	3947000	going to hire a psychologist.
3947000	3949000	I think it will be an interesting tour.
3949000	3951000	Because they are writing.
3951000	3953000	And they have to write by themselves.
3953000	3955000	In fact, I think
3955000	3957000	it's ugly to meet.
3957000	3959000	That's what you're doing.
3959000	3961000	I think there is a marketing potential.
3961000	3963000	I should tell the boss about this.
3963000	3965000	And science
3965000	3967000	is also interesting.
3969000	3971000	I want to tell the boss about this.
3971000	3973000	Then Bozun
3973000	3975000	ask again.
3975000	3977000	As long as you can see
3977000	3979000	in each area,
3979000	3981000	you should be able to see which schools use
3981000	3983000	I can.
3983000	3985000	Then you have
3985000	3987000	the education level or
3987000	3989000	income level
3989000	3991000	proposal or acceptance.
3991000	3993000	But we have
3993000	3995000	each school.
3995000	3997000	I want to say that the school itself is an income proxy.
3997000	3999000	It must be some
3999000	4001000	I can.
4001000	4003000	I haven't connected yet.
4003000	4005000	I haven't connected with the income area.
4005000	4007000	You can
4007000	4009000	take a look.
4009000	4011000	You now have income data.
4011000	4013000	You have similar income or education
4013000	4015000	level data.
4015000	4017000	You should be able to find it.
4017000	4019000	But don't give me homework, please.
4023000	4025000	If you have any questions,
4025000	4027000	you can write an email to me.
4027000	4029000	Or you can find me on Facebook.
4031000	4033000	The small question I just wanted to ask
4033000	4035000	is that you said that
4035000	4037000	ROTH
4037000	4039000	between Proposer and Responder
4039000	4041000	is a hypothesis
4041000	4043000	of ROTH.
4043000	4045000	Is this hypothesis
4045000	4047000	from his data observation?
4047000	4049000	It is
4049000	4051000	from his data observation.
4051000	4053000	In short,
4053000	4055000	there are only four countries.
4055000	4057000	You can't compare the last round of data.
4057000	4059000	You are discussing
4059000	4061000	100 data points.
4063000	4065000	He can't do
4065000	4067000	statistical analysis.
4067000	4069000	He can only say what the four distribution
4069000	4071000	look like and
4071000	4073000	what my observation looks like.
4079000	4081000	Are there any questions
4081000	4083000	from the audience?
4083000	4085000	It's time to
4085000	4087000	wrap up.
4087000	4089000	Can you stay for a while?
4089000	4091000	I want to have a talk with you.
4091000	4093000	Sure.
4095000	4097000	That's all for today.
4097000	4099000	Thank you.
4101000	4103000	Thank you.
4105000	4107000	Let's give him a big hand.
4107000	4109000	I'll pause the recording.
