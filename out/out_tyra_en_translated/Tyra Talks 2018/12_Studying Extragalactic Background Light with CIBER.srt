00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello everyone, welcome to this week's Terra Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong. I am currently studying high-energy physics experiments at the University of California.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Before we officially start, let's first introduce what kind of organization Project Terra is.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In fact, as we wrote on the website, our goal is to establish a timely cross-national academic information sharing platform,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
connect Taiwan's academic talents from all over the world, exchange results and trends in Taiwan's academic circles overseas,

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and provide each other with a platform for effective communication.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To put it simply, we hope to establish a platform that helps Taiwanese from all over the world engage in research and work to communicate with each other quickly and timely.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We will hold a webcast like today every week.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The speakers are basically our members, and the audience can sign up online.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The topic of the speech is based on the results of the speaker's research, review his current development in his special field,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and share new ideas, plans, or opportunities for cooperation.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Project Terra is currently a fully self-funded, fully volunteer organization.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Our staff are basically all doctoral students and post-doctoral students.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can see the About page on our website.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to add that we recently added a lot of staff who may not have been updated to the website.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The most important purpose of a project like this is to fully open up, share and cooperate.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The more friends who are willing to join us, share and help each other,

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
we can move towards the goals we all want.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I also hope that it will be helpful to Taiwan's academic circle and everyone's research career, or to transfer jobs in the future.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now I'm going to post the link to our website on the chat room next to it.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you feel that you support our ideas, or are passionate about sharing your very passionate research,

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you can consider joining our members, and you will continue to receive our speech and activity information.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Of course, you can also go to our Facebook fan page and continue to follow our news.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We also want to emphasize that we have no profit at all.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you are willing to share with other Taiwanese, it will be the biggest reward for us.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It is also the biggest help to other friends who work in the academic circle.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the introduction of TARA.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Next, I want to introduce our speaker.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We are honored to invite Zheng Yunting today.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Zheng Yunting is currently studying physics at the California Institute of Technology.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He is currently a doctoral candidate.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yunting graduated from the Department of Physics in 2014 and joined the Caltech Research Institute.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is currently studying his doctorate.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
His special field is observational cosmology.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He will introduce to us today that he is doing a data analysis project.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It is a rocket project.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There is one more thing to remind everyone.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In order to let the speaker feel our enthusiasm,

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the microphone must be turned on when applauding, so that he can hear the voice.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's applaud and welcome Yunting to give us this speech.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you everyone.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am Zheng Yunting. I am studying my PhD at Caltech.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you to my office mate, Zhang Yanyong, for the introduction.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The topic I am going to talk about today is

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Measuring Extragalactic Background Light at Optical and Near-Infrared.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is a project I am doing.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I am doing its data analysis.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What I am going to talk about today is more focused on

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the background in this field.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What do we want to measure?

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do we want to understand?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What is a signal?

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let me start by introducing the history of our universe.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the universe we know so far.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We can start from the left.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The left is the earliest period.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We have inflation and Big Bang.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Inflation is the theory of explosion in Chinese.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Big Bang is the beginning of the universe.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In the very early period,

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the universe is very small and hot.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everything inside is very hot and oily.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
As the universe expands,

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the gas will expand.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
At a certain point in time,

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the temperature in the universe is low enough.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The electrons and protons in the gas

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
will combine to form hydrogen.

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This process is called recombination.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
After recombination,

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
there are a lot of photons in the universe.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Photons are easily scattered with free electrons.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
After recombination,

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
there are almost no free electrons in the universe.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
These photons will not become long.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We can see the photons emitted at that time.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is called a cosmic microwave background or CMB.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is the earliest signal we can measure in cosmology.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After recombination and CMB,

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
a lot of protons and electrons combine to form hydrogen.

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
During this period,

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the universe is full of neutral hydrogen and hydrogen.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This period is called the Dark Age.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because it is very dark,

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
there are no photons like the CMB at that time.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
However, there are no stars and galaxies yet.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The universe during this period is completely black.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
During this period,

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
there will be some density fluctuations in the universe.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
These density fluctuations are because of gravity.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
As time goes by,

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
there will be more matter coming in.

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The main component is dark matter.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
These dark matter may form heavier and condensed structures.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We call this dark matter halo.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because there is a strong gravitational potential in the halo,

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the background gases such as hydrogen will also gather here.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When the gathering becomes compact,

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
it will cause a fusion reaction and form the first star or galaxy.

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
After a period of time,

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the universe begins to form stars and galaxies.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After these stars and galaxies form,

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
they will release a lot of photons.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If the energy of the photons is strong enough,

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the energy gap between the hydrogen and the gas will be strong enough.

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The gas will separate the hydrogen nearby.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can see that there are some separated areas on this map.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We call this ionizing bubble.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This process is called reionization.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
As time goes by,

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
there will be more and more stars and galaxies in the universe.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It will ionize the hydrogen nearby.

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
At the end,

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
if you have enough galaxies,

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you will separate all the hydrogen in the universe.

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The gases outside the galaxy are all ionized.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is our current universe.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is the history of the development of the universe.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What I'm going to study now is called an extra-galactic background light.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have a question.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, okay.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I see.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I see.

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I see.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, what if I put a traffic light on my screen and it disappears?

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can you see it clearly like this?

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Actually, I think it's pretty clear.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay, then I'll do it like this.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I also think traffic lights are more convenient.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, what I'm going to measure is the extra-galactic background light,

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or EVL.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
In the universe, the word galaxy is used to refer to our own galaxy.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
In the universe, the word galaxy is used to refer to our own galaxy.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So, extra-galactic is outside our own galaxy.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Background light means everything outside the galaxy is called background.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, the EVL we measure is the time and space that happened in the universe.

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, from the earliest meter, you can see C and B and the Dark Age and many stars.

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The frequency along which posters were laid out is locked on through that spectrum.

144
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We call this spectrum the EDL.

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We call this spectrum the EDL.

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Specture on different wavelengths or language.

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
These data are gathered so far.

148
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can see that different wavelengths have different EDL measurements.

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's talk about what each wavelength does.

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We can look at the highest and lowest energy.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The highest energy is gamma ray and X-ray.

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The main source of these high-energy photons are

153
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
active galactic nuclei.

154
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
These nuclei have a large black hole

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
in the center of each galaxy.

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sometimes these black holes may suck in

157
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
all kinds of messy gas and then

158
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
heat them up and release some radiation.

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
These radiations will have very strong energy.

160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
These high-energy photons are called

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
active galactic nuclei.

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The main source is from the galaxy cluster.

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The center of the cluster has a large black hole.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The cluster itself has some very hot gas.

165
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It has a very strong gravitational potential.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is the main source of gamma ray and X-ray.

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The main source of X-ray is gamma ray.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The main source of gamma ray is gamma ray.

171
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The main source of X-ray is gamma ray.

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
At the same time, the source of very low-energy radio

173
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is also from something like AGN.

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is also from something like AGN.

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know if you've heard of synchrotron radiation.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know if you've heard of synchrotron radiation.

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is also when gas is heated

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
or accelerated to a very high speed.

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This is also when gas is heated or accelerated to a very high speed.

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Next is UV.

181
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We didn't measure a lot of data for UV.

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We didn't measure a lot of data for UV.

183
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's hard to see UV data

184
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
because it's a higher-energy photon

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
than 912 Armstrong.

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because it's a higher-energy photon

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
than 912 Armstrong.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In our own galaxy,

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
it's easy to absorb

190
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the UV photons.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So it's hard to see the background

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
of the UV astro-galaxy.

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So it's hard to see the background

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
of the UV astro-galaxy.

195
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The strongest peak is in the microwave.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The strongest peak is in the microwave.

197
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The source of the microwave is from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The source of the microwave is from the cosmic microwave

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
bakick-de normando radiation.

200
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The source is from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
One is in the optical and the other in infrared.

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
These two are mostly stars pieces

203
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
emitted in different galaxies.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Star emission is in optical.

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
In infrared,

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There's dust emission in the galaxy.

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There's dust emission in the galaxy.

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
These dusts will suck

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
stellar lights

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They will emit thermal radiation

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They will emit thermal radiation

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and it's in the infrared

213
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can see

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This star's light

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
is emitted from as equal from the opposition

216
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
of the star to the star.

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The wavelengths I will talk about today

218
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
are in the optical area.

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
are in the optical area.

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If we zoom in

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
we can see a lot of different data

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is the far-infrared

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is the far-infrared

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
This is the far-infrared

225
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is the far-infrared

226
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You can see a lot of different data

227
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I will focus on this area

228
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I will focus on this area

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You can see a lot different data

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and these data change

231
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
up to different values

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
up to different values

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,900
You can see data changing

234
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
These data are inconsistent

235
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,900
because they are used in different ways

236
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,900
because they are used in different ways

237
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,900
in Constraint EDL

238
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,900
There are 4 ways

239
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,900
I will introduce them

240
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,900
The first method is called Galaxy Counts

241
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,900
These data are from Galaxy Counts

242
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Galaxy Counts means

243
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,900
I want to measure

244
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,900
in the near-infrared or optical background

245
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I will use a telescope

246
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,900
to look at a field

247
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
I can measure many galaxies in this field

248
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,900
I will add the light from the near-infrared

249
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,900
I will add the light from the near-infrared

250
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,900
I will say these are the extra-galactic backgrounds I measured

251
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,900
I will say these are the extra-galactic backgrounds I measured

252
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
You can only contain low-LE in EBL

253
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
You can only contain low-LE in EBL

254
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,900
You will only get the brightest galaxies

255
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,900
You will only get the brightest galaxies

256
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
You can only get a few of them

257
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,900
You will only get a few of them

258
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,800
I also place multiple

259
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,900
You will only get a feliz

260
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,900
You will only get a few of them

261
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,240
I also explained the number of colors

262
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I also explained the number of colors

263
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,240
I also explained the number of colors

264
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,240
I also explained the name

265
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,200
I also explained the name

266
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
I also explained the name

267
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,240
the second method is Absolute Photometry

268
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Absolute Photometry

269
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Absolute Photometry

270
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
Absolute Photometry

271
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Absolute Photometry

272
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:16,240
