1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm very happy to have you all here today for Lin Bo-xuan's talk.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let me first introduce our speaker, Lin Bo-xuan.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
She studied economics at NTU, and is now a sophomore at NTU Economics.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Currently, she is an intern at a startup company called ModLab in Pasadena, California.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Her main topic is game-related data analysis.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today, we are very happy to invite Lin Bo-xuan to give a talk

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
about how to use class experiment data to test the stability of the final window match

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and the results of the double-sided auction experiment.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's welcome Lin Bo-xuan to start her talk.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you, Director Lin.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Without further ado, I'll get started.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Today's topic is very simple.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll just ask one question.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are the results of the economic experiment we see on paper stable?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
To be honest, in the field of economic experiments,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
people are the ones doing the research.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So, if you want to say that a result is stable,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you can't just say,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
if I were in Taiwan, I'd do this result.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Or, if I were in a victim group, I'd do that.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Often, we need to do a lot of different victim groups.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If we were to say that this result is right for all humans,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
then it should be right to take the same result

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and do the same experiment in every place.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But in fact, we often know that

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
this situation is often not necessarily right.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
For example, let's say we measure the risk.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In Taiwan alone,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
if you only measure the risk for men or women,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the set of risks may be different.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, in fact, if we want to measure stability,

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that is, if we want to do the same experiment

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in many places, the result is wrong.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But often,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
what we want to do

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
is actually very difficult in the experiment.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
First, because economists know

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
that our research funds are limited.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Second, our time is limited.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, often, it's hard for us to think about

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
whether we can do the same experiment

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
in every corner of the world.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, this is a very difficult thing.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because, mainly, there is a big limitation in economic experiments.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In fact, we hope to provide real benefits to consumers.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Because of this,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we need a lot of money and a lot of time.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We need to have a good enough time design.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Basically, it will be impossible to measure in every place in the world.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, because of this,

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
we did not give up

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to test whether our experiment results are stable or not.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, there are two main ways

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to do this on our website.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
First,

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
for example,

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
in the case of Ultraman Game,

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
in fact, in the past 50 years,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
there have been a lot of studies on the series of Ultraman Game.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So, basically,

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
there is a method

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that we take the previous experimental data

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and break it into a very large database

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to do some meta-analysis here.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just like what Usterbeck did in 2004.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But, like this,

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
there is a problem.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In fact, many times,

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
all the previous studies of Ultraman Game

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
are the same game,

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
but their context is a bit different.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So, in practice,

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
many times, your usage is different,

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
or your context is different,

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which may affect the result of the experiment.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So, when we use this method,

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
we have already lost the control

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
of our experimental design.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Although this method

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
can make our database very rich.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The other way is that

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
we control the same experimental design,

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but go to other places

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to do the same experiment.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just like Roth,

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
he has been to four countries in the world.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
One is the United States,

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
one is Slovenia,

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
one is Israel,

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and the other is Japan.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He went to these four countries

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
to do the same final analysis

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and market game

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to see if the results of these four countries

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
were stable or not.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the largest experiment

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
so far.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But, from this point of view,

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
even so,

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we can only do it in a small number of places.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, in this way,

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
although you can

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
control your experimental design,

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but you can't make

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
your database very large.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, today,

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
what we are doing is

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
using the third method.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's like

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
you want to test the stability

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
of a result of an experiment.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There are three things to do.

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One is the real sound,

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and the third is to have a large enough sample.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The first two methods

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
are to give up

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and control the experimental design.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The other is to give up a large enough database.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But what we are going to do today

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is to have a large enough database,

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and the design

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is exactly the same.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But what we give up today is to give up

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and control the sound.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In this case,

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can only say that we are the first article

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to do this.

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We have a lot of data.

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But when we give up

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and control the sound,

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
our experiment

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
will be done in a very

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
no-easy situation.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, if we can

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
reproduce

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
all the experimental results

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in the lab,

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
it means that the experimental results

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
are very stable.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As I said,

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
what we are going to use today

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is MobLab.

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
MobLab is an experimental platform

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
for all class economics experiments.

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If we take all the data from the class,

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
it is actually good and bad.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Of course, the two biggest concerns are

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
that all the students in the class

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
do not use money

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to provide their sound.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Most of the time, they just use

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the grade of the course

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
or other random numbers

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to provide their sound.

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is what we have lost control of.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The two biggest concerns are

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that many students in class

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
may not necessarily be

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the representative sample

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
of the culture.

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
However, there are still

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
a lot of benefits

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
for us to try this method.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
First of all,

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
there is no publication bias

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in our database.

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For example,

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
if you take the results

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
of the previous article

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
as a meta-analysis,

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you may get too good results.

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is called publication bias.

173
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
However,

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
all the results, good or bad,

175
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
are recorded in our database.

176
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Another thing is that

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
our company is

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
at least in the class of

179
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
experimental economics.

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you want to do a class experiment

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
in the world,

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you basically use our company.

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
In fact, our sample is very diverse.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There are many different areas.

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This gives us a lot of

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
variation to test.

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thirdly,

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the environment in which our data is generated

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
is exactly the same.

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The interface, language,

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and the entire experiment process

192
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
are exactly the same.

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This means that we have

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
completely controlled

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the process of their game.

196
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
These are the three advantages

197
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
that we think

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are very important.

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Before talking about these two areas,

200
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I would like to talk about

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
how big our dataset is.

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
First of all,

203
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we can see that

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
this table is a total of

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
10 areas in our dataset.

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can see that

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
this data is across North America,

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Europe, and Asia.

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
In Ultraman Game,

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
we have more than

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
15,000 sample points.

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
For those of you who do not know

213
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the economics of time,

214
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
the data in Ultraman Game

215
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
is about 10 times more than

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
a normal article,

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
or 0 to 2.0.

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In DoubleAction,

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
there are basically 2.0 more.

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is a very large sample

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that we can test.

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Next,

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I will talk about these two areas.

224
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
These two areas are actually very simple.

225
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The first is Ultraman Game.

226
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In addition,

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
why do we choose these two areas?

228
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The first is because these two areas

229
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
are the most abundant in our database.

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The second is that these two areas

231
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
are basically the origin of

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the economics of time.

233
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
In Ultraman Game,

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
there are two people in this game.

235
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
One is Proposer,

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the other is Responder.

237
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Proposer can decide

238
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
how much to give to the other party.

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This game is very simple.

240
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There is a ball in the middle.

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You can decide how much to give to the other party.

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can pull the ball

243
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and decide how much to give to the other party.

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you decide,

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you can press Submit.

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In this way, the other party can see

247
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
how much you gave to the other party.

248
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Next,

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
suppose I decide to give the other party $45.

250
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In this way,

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the other party can see

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that this is

253
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
a Proposer you have provided.

254
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Proposer can decide

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
how much to give to the other party.

256
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you decide to give $45,

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the other party can see

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
how much to give to the other party.

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you decide to give $45,

260
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the other party can see

261
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
how much to give to the other party.

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is a very simple game.

263
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It is like a simple negotiation

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
in a simulation game.

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For example,

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
when you go to a night market

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to buy vegetables,

268
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
don't pull the ball.

269
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It is like a simulation game.

270
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is the game interface

271
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
of the Ultraman Game.

272
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Next, I will talk about

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
double-sided auction.

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The most classic example

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
of a double-sided auction

276
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is like Wall Street.

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They are selling stocks.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You may often see some pictures

279
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
or news photos

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that there are many machines

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and many traders

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
raising their hands and shouting.

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This means that

284
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
everyone is shouting

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
how much to give to this person

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and how much to give to that person.

287
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Double-sided auction is like

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ultraman Game.

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Ultraman Game has only one side

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and you are given a Proposer.

291
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
In Double-sided auction,

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
no matter which side,

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the buyer or seller

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
can shout at the same time.

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
One is the buyer, the other is the seller.

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you are the buyer,

297
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you want to buy something.

298
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We are buying oranges.

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In this game interface,

300
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the first thing you can see is

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
how much satisfaction you will get

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
when you buy an orange.

303
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Next, you want to bid.

304
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can pull a slider bar.

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can move left and right

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to decide how much you want to bid

307
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
to bid for this orange.

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you buy an orange,

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the benefit is

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the value deducted

311
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and how much you spent to buy it.

312
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you are buying,

313
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
there are two ways to buy.

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
One is to bid here.

315
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The other is

316
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
if there are many buyers

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and they are already bidding

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
so you can also buy

319
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
at the lowest price.

320
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The next one is

321
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
the seller.

322
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The seller actually has the same

323
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
interface as the buyer.

324
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If you sell an orange,

325
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
you have the cost

326
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
so you can see the cost here.

327
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Next,

328
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you can pull a slider bar

329
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to decide how much you want to bid.

330
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can ask the price here.

331
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Or you can decide

332
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to sell the highest price here.

333
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I can sell it here.

334
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Please note that

335
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
there is a special design

336
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
here.

337
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When you decide to

338
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
ask the price here,

339
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
if the price is

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
negative,

341
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will change it to red

342
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to warn you

343
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that

344
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
this transaction

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
may result in a negative price.

346
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So this is the double option

347
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
game interface.

348
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let me introduce

349
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
the game settings here.

350
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is because

351
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in such a simple game interface,

352
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
many teachers

353
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
can adjust the game parameters

354
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
by themselves.

355
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But in most cases,

356
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
many teachers use the pre-set options.

357
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In Ultimatum Game,

358
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
the pre-set price is $100.

359
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In the case of double option,

360
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the pre-set market is

361
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
5 buyers

362
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and each buyer

363
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
can buy 3 items.

364
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In other words,

365
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
there are a total of 15 items in the market.

366
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If we draw the value here,

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
the black line

368
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
is the demand curve.

369
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The gray line

370
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
is the supply curve.

371
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Before I start,

372
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to talk about

373
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
the theoretical prediction

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
of these two games.

375
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In Ultimatum Game,

376
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the theoretical prediction is very simple.

377
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If we look at it

378
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
from the perspective of the respondent,

379
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the balance of a game

380
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is basically

381
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that if I do this option,

382
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
the reward is higher than the other option,

383
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I should do this.

384
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So if you look at the responder,

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
no matter what positive reward he sees,

386
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I should accept it.

387
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If I take $1, it's better than $0.

388
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If I take $2, it's better than $0.

389
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So in this case,

390
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
if I get a positive reward,

391
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I should accept it.

392
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If I get a negative reward,

393
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I should accept it.

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If I get a positive reward,

395
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I should accept it.

396
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Game.

397
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
However, in the past 50 years of research,

398
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
we all know that

399
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
this theory is basically written to be overturned.

400
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Because a lot of times

401
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
when we do research,

402
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
we will find that

403
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
basically all the recipients

404
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
will not only give the other party $1,

405
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
because a lot of times you will be very unhappy.

406
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is Ultimatum Game.

407
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
In Double Option,

408
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
this is like the high school science textbook,

409
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
you will see Supply and Demand Curve.

410
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If you want to solve this game, it's actually very simple.

411
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You have to find a price

412
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
to clear all the markets.

413
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So if you are here,

414
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
this gray curve is our

415
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
theoretical prediction price,

416
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
which is just the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.

417
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If this price

418
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
is higher,

419
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
if it is higher than the balance price,

420
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
it means that

421
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
there are more sellers who want to sell things at this time,

422
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and fewer sellers want to sell.

423
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So if the supply and demand are uneven at this time,

424
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
this force will force the price down.

425
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But if the price is lower,

426
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
then there are more people who want to sell,

427
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
and fewer people want to sell.

428
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So this force will push the price back.

429
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is also the intersection of Supply and Demand Curve.

430
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is our balance price.

431
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Then in our predicted market,

432
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
the number of balances is 13,

433
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and the price of the balance is $112.

434
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So this is our game setting.

435
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to stop here for a while.

436
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is everyone OK?

437
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If there is no problem,

438
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I will continue to talk about the results.

439
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wait a minute,

440
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
let me confirm first.

441
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So here

442
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the buyer's demand price

443
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
is $150.

444
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The forecast is $150, $145,

445
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
$140, and so on.

446
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Then it is reduced to $130.

447
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So $150

448
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and then $130.

449
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What is the last one?

450
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The last one is

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
$120 and $117.

452
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then the other side is from $50

453
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and then continue to add $50.

454
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then I will continue.

455
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
First of all,

456
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
let's talk about

457
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the overall result.

458
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
First of all, I want to show you

459
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
this table.

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
To summarize,

461
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
we mainly looked at the five outcome variables.

462
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What are their numerical statistics?

463
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
First of all, in the Ultimation Game,

464
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
we mainly looked at two outcome variables.

465
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
One is how many proposals you give to the other party.

466
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The other is how much your acceptance rate is.

467
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
First of all, we see the first one.

468
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In the case of $100,

469
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
on average,

470
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you will give the other party about $36.

471
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This number is actually

472
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
very close to the result of our experiment.

473
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
For example, if we take

474
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Rock's article in 1991 as a benchmark,

475
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the average of the article

476
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
is 40.

477
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So our difference is only 4%.

478
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So I think it's a very close result.

479
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then the second one we looked at

480
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
is the acceptance rate.

481
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What we are looking at now is unconditional.

482
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If we look at

483
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the unconditional acceptance rate,

484
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
the acceptance rate is 66%.

485
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Rock's result is about 73%.

486
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So the difference is only 6% or 7%.

487
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But because our offer

488
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
is relatively low,

489
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think our result

490
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
is able to reproduce

491
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Rock's result on the aggregate level.

492
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hello, I have a question.

493
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You just said

494
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
he made 40 and then 36.

495
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Or let's just say

496
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
how much is the experimental

497
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and how much is the theoretical expectation.

498
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think it's very close.

499
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I want to ask

500
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
what do you think?

501
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Because you didn't show

502
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
your uncertainty range.

503
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Maybe it's actually a very stable difference,

504
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
so it's not very close.

505
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is

506
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
what I will continue to talk about later.

507
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Because I'm going to show you a statistic now.

508
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll show you an approximate

509
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
numerical statistic.

510
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But actually you're right.

511
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If I have to do it,

512
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I have to look at whether there is a significant difference.

513
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But actually

514
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
the first one is

515
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
this is one point.

516
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If I want to do an assessment,

517
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
there is another problem.

518
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Our sample number is very unbalanced.

519
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Very unbalanced.

520
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So it means that our sample number

521
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
is about more than 10,000 points,

522
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and their sample number is only more than 1,000 points.

523
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So in fact, when you do an assessment,

524
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
sometimes there are some

525
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
bad points.

526
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You need to pay attention.

527
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But in fact,

528
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
at least in the case of showing data now,

529
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can only say it out loud.

530
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can only say it out loud now.

531
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It depends on whether it's close or not.

532
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Next,

533
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
the other three are

534
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
the results of the double option.

535
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
For the double option, I'm going to use three indexes

536
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to talk about whether this market

537
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
has been able to

538
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
refine

539
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
the prediction of the theory.

540
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The first three indexes we look at

541
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
are the average error.

542
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The definition of the average error is actually below.

543
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
DQ is the price of

544
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
each unit

545
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
of each contract.

546
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Subtract it.

547
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This means

548
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
how much is the difference

549
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
from our theoretical prediction.

550
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Next, I look at the average.

551
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Because we often have

552
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
about 800 different market configurations.

553
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So in order to make everyone

554
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
comparable, I use

555
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
the average price to standardize it.

556
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So we can actually use this index

557
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
to see how much is our accuracy.

558
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The next one is

559
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
our

560
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Smith Alpha.

561
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Smith is to commemorate

562
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Brown-Smith, so that's why it's called this name.

563
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Next, this index

564
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
is actually very simple.

565
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's the distance between

566
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
my price and

567
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
my theoretical prediction price.

568
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I take the square here.

569
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then I take another one.

570
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Next, I look at the average distance.

571
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Then I open a number.

572
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So it's actually very similar to

573
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
my standard error.

574
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But what I'm doing today is not average.

575
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What I'm doing today is

576
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
theoretical prediction.

577
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Next, I still use

578
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
my average price to standardize it.

579
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I can use this index

580
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
to measure the fluctuation of price.

581
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The next

582
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and the third index is Efficiency.

583
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
For Efficiency, I want to use

584
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
the above graph to explain.

585
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So in this

586
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
market balance,

587
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
if this seller

588
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
makes a deal with this buyer,

589
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
then in the middle,

590
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the upper part

591
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
is the

592
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
profit I make.

593
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's the buyer's profit.

594
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The lower part is the seller's profit.

595
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So that means

596
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the total length of this segment

597
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
is the

598
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
profit I can make

599
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
from this deal.

600
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So I take the

601
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
supply curve and demand curve

602
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and divide it by the area.

603
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So in theory,

604
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
how much surplus

605
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
can I get?

606
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So the efficiency

607
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
definition is

608
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
the efficiency I achieve

609
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
in this market

610
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and the efficiency

611
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I expect in theory.

612
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
How much can I get?

613
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So what I can see here is

614
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
first,

615
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
my average error is about 6%.

616
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That means my average price

617
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is about 6% higher than the theory.

618
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Next,

619
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
my Smith Alpha,

620
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
my price fluctuation

621
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
is about 30%.

622
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Next, my efficiency

623
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
is about 84%.

624
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So in theory,

625
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
these numbers

626
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
are significantly different.

627
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
However,

628
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
this is related to another problem.

629
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
In our lab,

630
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
we usually let our customers

631
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
play the same game for 10 or 20 rounds.

632
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
At this time,

633
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
after more than 10 rounds,

634
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
the price will become very stable.

635
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But here,

636
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
if we play 10 rounds,

637
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the customer might have already

638
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
played 2 or 3 rounds.

639
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is why the price here is unstable.

640
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But later on,

641
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I will try to show

642
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
if

643
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
our students can play

644
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
enough rounds,

645
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
where will they end up?

646
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is the result of the double option.

647
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I will show it.

648
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's continue to look at

649
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
the whole distribution.

650
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Sorry to interrupt you.

651
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This has nothing to do with your speech.

652
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know if you have noticed

653
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the Chrome dialogue next to you.

654
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't know which computer

655
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
you are using.

656
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't know what to do.

657
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Thank you for reminding me.

658
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I hope you don't interrupt me.

659
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't want to leave the group.

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you.

661
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's continue.

662
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
First, let's look at

663
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
the whole distribution of Proposal Offer.

664
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Because

665
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
in our game design,

666
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
the teacher can decide

667
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
whether to play 1 round, 2 rounds,

668
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
or how many rounds.

669
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If you play more than 2 rounds,

670
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
it will become a repeated game.

671
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If we divide the data

672
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
into repeated and repeated games,

673
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
we can see

674
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that

675
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the first point

676
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
is

677
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the theoretical expectation.

678
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
This is the theoretical expectation.

679
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
This is the theoretical prediction.

680
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So here,

681
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
whether it's 1 shot game or repeated game,

682
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
only about 10% of the audience

683
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
play on the theoretical prediction.

684
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Then we have 50%

685
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
of the audience

686
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
play on the theoretical prediction.

687
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Next,

688
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
let's look at

689
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
the distribution.

690
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The first observation is

691
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
that we have a lot of proposal offers

692
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
which means

693
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I play on the whole number.

694
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I play on 0, 10, 20, 30.

695
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This is the first observation.

696
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The second observation is

697
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
that only about 6% of the audience

698
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
play on the theoretical prediction.

699
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I give myself less

700
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
and I give myself more.

701
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
In this game,

702
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
there should be a first-mover advantage.

703
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I should give you 50%

704
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
if I'm great.

705
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I shouldn't lose to you.

706
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I should give you more.

707
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This is the first observation.

708
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Next, let's compare

709
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
the distribution with ROC.

710
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This is ROC's distribution

711
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
in 1990.

712
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
As Zhang said,

713
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
we didn't do a statistical assessment.

714
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So we can only see

715
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
whether we can catch the distribution.

716
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The first observation is

717
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
that the density

718
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
is about 50 to 40.

719
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
is about 50 to 40.

720
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We can capture this.

721
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
We can capture this.

722
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
At this level,

723
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
we can replicate their results.

724
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
At this level, we can replicate their results.

725
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
In fact, the biggest difference

726
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
between our distribution and their distribution is

727
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
that almost no one here plays on

728
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
the theoretical prediction.

729
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But about 10% of people

730
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
play on the theoretical prediction.

731
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
In fact,

732
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
at least me and Colin

733
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
are not sure.

734
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Maybe this is the prediction option.

735
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
In the beginning of a game,

736
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the prediction ball

737
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
is placed on the theoretical prediction.

738
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is placed on the theoretical prediction.

739
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If the student

740
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
doesn't think about it,

741
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I will throw it away

742
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
without any strategy.

743
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So 10% of people

744
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
may play on the theoretical prediction

745
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and may be affected by the prediction option.

746
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But this is...

747
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you have response time here?

748
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I will show it later.

749
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
According to your hypothesis,

750
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
the response time should be the lowest.

751
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But the response time is very high.

752
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But I will show the result later.

753
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So it's not necessarily the predicted result.

754
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So it's not necessarily the predicted result.

755
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But...

756
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sorry, can you show the previous video?

757
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Sorry, can you show the previous video?

758
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
OK.

759
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Because I was thinking

760
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
if you said it's because of the default option,

761
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
if you said it's because of the default option,

762
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I can see...

763
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Because there are very few people

764
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
who mentioned 1 in Rose's data.

765
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But the people who mentioned 1 here

766
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
seem to be

767
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
significantly higher than 0.

768
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But the people who mentioned 1 here

769
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
seem to be

770
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
significantly higher than 0.

771
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So although 0 is so high,

772
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
it may be the effect of the default option.

773
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But it seems that there are more people

774
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
who seem to be significant.

775
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If you look at the balance behavior as 0 or 1,

776
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
there are more people who seem to be significant.

777
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
There are more people who seem to be significant.

778
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That's what I think.

779
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank you for this comment.

780
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It should be said that

781
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
it should be said that

782
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
it should be said that

783
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
there should be quite a lot of people

784
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
playing with the theory.

785
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But it is true that the effect of the default option is a confirmation.

786
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I will continue to talk about it.

787
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Next, this is our acceptance rate.

788
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Next, this is our acceptance rate.

789
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Because I think this result is very cool.

790
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It doesn't matter if I talk about it later.

791
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I must make this result clear.

792
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
First of all, because what we talked about earlier

793
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
is the unconditional acceptance rate.

794
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What is more interesting now

795
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
is to measure the conditional acceptance rate.

796
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Unconditional

797
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
is the number of offers I see.

798
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That is to say, because we measure

799
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
the expected value of the conditions.

800
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is actually a function of an offer.

801
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This is actually a function of an offer.

802
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So on this graph, my X axis

803
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
shows how many proposal offers I see.

804
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Then my Y axis shows

805
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
what is my average acceptance rate.

806
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
In this graph,

807
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
the black dot represents the information of one-shot game.

808
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The orange dot represents the information of a repeat game.

809
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Next, the size of each point

810
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
represents

811
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the density of the

812
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
histogram we saw earlier.

813
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So if you put

814
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
the size of the size of the ball on the X axis,

815
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
it becomes the full

816
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
histogram.

817
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Next, because

818
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
when I was checking the data,

819
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I found that between 49 and 50,

820
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
there is actually a

821
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
20% jump.

822
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So I think it's weird.

823
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So I used a specification

824
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to measure

825
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the P-splice linear

826
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
specification.

827
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So what you can see is

828
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
that if you are

829
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
less than 50,

830
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
you see that your acceptance rate is this curve.

831
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
When it is greater than 50,

832
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
there will be a big break point here.

833
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This is completely obvious.

834
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It is very obvious.

835
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When we measure the standard error,

836
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
we also use

837
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
cluster. Then we have a cluster

838
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
at the session level.

839
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
We use the most conservative calculation

840
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
to estimate our variability.

841
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So in this case, it is also very obvious.

842
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
If we put all the data

843
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
together, there is about

844
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
20% to 21% jump.

845
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If we divide it into one-shot game and

846
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
repeated game,

847
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
one-shot game is about 16%.

848
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Then again, in repeated game,

849
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
this jump becomes 26%.

850
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
First of all,

851
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
this phenomenon has not been seen in the first 50 years.

852
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So I think it's a very

853
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
cool discovery.

854
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Next, let's talk about 1.

855
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
First of all,

856
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
this interpretation is actually very complicated.

857
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Because we have a lot of confounds here,

858
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
which our database can't detect.

859
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But what we can be sure of is that

860
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
the source of this point is not

861
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the difference in your payoff.

862
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because you can see that when we come from the left

863
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
B, you can come from 49.99999.

864
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Then the next step is to come from the right B,

865
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
which is about 50.0000001.

866
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
In fact, this gap is less than

867
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
how small your Epsilon should be.

868
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So the effect of this is definitely not

869
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
from monetary payoff.

870
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Or even if you are in a hypothetical state,

871
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
it is basically not from

872
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
how much your payoff is.

873
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So it is very possible that this point is

874
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
your other regarding preference.

875
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That is to say, at this time, you must

876
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
consider what other people

877
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in this proposal offer.

878
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What does it look like?

879
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Next, there are many ways to say

880
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
that we can't uniquely pin down.

881
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It may be like

882
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
because you are from 49.999 to 50.

883
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You have a big gap here,

884
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
which is equality.

885
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because this paragraph can also mean

886
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that I may be very, very care.

887
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Am I equal to you?

888
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Or this is the first one.

889
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Or the other is to say that

890
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
if you don't give me 50,

891
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I may have to punish you.

892
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So this is why this paragraph may be

893
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
10% more in the repeated game.

894
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It may be that this 10% is more

895
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and I have to punish you.

896
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Or I may care about my fairness.

897
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Or I just say that since

898
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
we are not playing real money,

899
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I just don't want to lose you.

900
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So it means that if I am below,

901
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
my acceptance rate is relatively low.

902
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So basically it's the same as

903
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
you and Yuqi.

904
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
This is what we see in the data.

905
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I would like to ask

906
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
what your thoughts are.

907
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Actually, I don't know.

908
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Before you do this,

909
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
there is a question.

910
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Although you know a lot,

911
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
but in fact,

912
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
even if you just showed us,

913
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
there are very few offers

914
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that exceed 50.

915
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There are about 600.

916
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
If you look at the group,

917
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
there are 600.

918
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
For example,

919
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
your estimate of acceptance rate

920
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
because you are not using strategy method,

921
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
you are showing offer.

922
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So it means that

923
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
you are now running this break point return.

924
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I think that

925
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
when it is below 50,

926
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the variation is actually better.

927
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But the part above 50

928
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
is probably more unstable.

929
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But it looks like

930
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
this break point is really interesting.

931
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Because

932
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I think about it.

933
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Because

934
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Have you ever tried

935
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you don't use

936
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
in the part below 50,

937
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you don't use linear return to run.

938
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I haven't tried it yet,

939
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
but I want to try quadratic.

940
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Because there is another possibility

941
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
that it is actually not

942
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
presented as a break point,

943
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
but a more complex

944
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
non-linear.

945
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Just because you fit linear,

946
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
it doesn't look like a break point.

947
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Because if you look at the data directly,

948
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
it looks at least

949
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I think it's quite linear.

950
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If you look at the part of the orange repeat game,

951
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it looks like

952
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
it's actually

953
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
a strange fall first,

954
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
but it's more stable

955
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
when it reaches 40.

956
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
This may be more like quadratic.

957
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you only look at black,

958
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
it looks like

959
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
it's a

960
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it's a

961
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
between 20 and above

962
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
50 is a shakier

963
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
drop, but

964
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
below 20

965
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
it's more stable.

966
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So

967
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
it's possible here,

968
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
just because

969
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
you fit a one-point

970
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
linear relationship.

971
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Anyway, I will try quadratic.

972
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But this is

973
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
what I estimated.

974
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I think it's quite interesting.

975
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
If this is true,

976
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
how do we

977
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
at least I think

978
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
how to reproduce this break point in the lab

979
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I think it's quite interesting.

980
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Let's look at the results of ROS.

981
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
If we look at the data of ROS,

982
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
this break point is completely invisible.

983
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So

984
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
this result

985
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I think it's quite special.

986
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
This means that we have a lot of work hypothesis

987
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
running here at the same time.

988
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
However, we have tried

989
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
a power test.

990
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
This means that if we only draw 10%

991
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
because our sample number is about 0.

992
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So if we only draw 10%

993
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
can we estimate this break point?

994
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
This means that we still have a way to estimate this break point.

995
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So it may not be because

996
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
the problem of power in statistics.

997
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Then another

998
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
our work hypothesis may be because of

999
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
hypothetical stake.

1000
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Is it because it's all

1001
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
invisible?

1002
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I care more about the ranking between you and me.

1003
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
At least I don't want to lose to you.

1004
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So

1005
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
this is my current work hypothesis.

1006
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This may be

1007
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
the next article that can be done

1008
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
is how to reproduce this break point in the lab.

1009
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think it's quite interesting.

1010
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Can you remind us again

1011
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
about the population composition

1012
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
of your data?

1013
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
For example,

1014
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the proportion of each state or

1015
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
province?

1016
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We have seen that

1017
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
in the United States, there are western states,

1018
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
central and western states.

1019
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Then there are northeastern states.

1020
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Then there are southern states.

1021
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Then there is Canada.

1022
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Then in Europe, there are

1023
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
the United Kingdom and Spain.

1024
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Then in Asia,

1025
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
there are China, Japan and Singapore.

1026
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
What about the proportion?

1027
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
About 80% of the data is in the north.

1028
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Then about 10% in Europe

1029
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
and about 10% in Asia.

1030
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OK.

1031
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So overall,

1032
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
this result

1033
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
is more conservative.

1034
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It is the result of the main cultural circle

1035
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
in North America, right?

1036
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes.

1037
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
OK. I just want to ask.

1038
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But I want to add

1039
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that the problem is

1040
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
that all the results of the lab

1041
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
are not in North America.

1042
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes.

1043
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This is true.

1044
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OK.

1045
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Then I will...

1046
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Bo-xuan,

1047
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
if you want to compare with

1048
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Ross's work,

1049
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Ross's work is mainly not in North America.

1050
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Then the data of

1051
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
the other works,

1052
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
such as Madden Game,

1053
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
can you observe?

1054
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I have almost never seen any points.

1055
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes. OK.

1056
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
OK.

1057
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because of the time...

1058
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
OK.

1059
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Let me continue.

1060
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I have a question.

1061
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This article was made

1062
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
about 20 years ago,

1063
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
right?

1064
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes.

1065
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you think that the evolution of time

1066
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
has a big impact on the data?

1067
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Of course it is possible.

1068
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Because a lot of social preferences

1069
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
may follow the evolution of time.

1070
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
For example, the value of Taiwanese

1071
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
has changed over the past few years.

1072
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So it is true that this may be

1073
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
different.

1074
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But we can see that

1075
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
the social preferences

1076
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
have a big impact on the game.

1077
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
If this has any impact on the data,

1078
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
it may be OK.

1079
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Because the data may be a mirror effect.

1080
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But this is a big problem.

1081
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We can talk about it later.

1082
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Then I will continue.

1083
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Finally, the teacher just said

1084
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that we need to show the reaction time.

1085
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Our server does record the reaction time.

1086
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Then...

1087
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Because

1088
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
OneShotGame and RePDGame

1089
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
have similar patterns.

1090
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So I only use OneShotGame

1091
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to show the result.

1092
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
First of all, the black line

1093
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
represents the reaction time.

1094
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The black line represents the reaction time.

1095
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The black line represents

1096
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
the lowest estimation.

1097
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The orange line

1098
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
represents the acceptance rate.

1099
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Then...

1100
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This is also my lowest estimation.

1101
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Then...

1102
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The X-axis represents

1103
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
my offer.

1104
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
If you don't have any concept,

1105
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
the lowest estimation is

1106
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the return time

1107
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
in each section.

1108
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
This means that

1109
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I am fitting the data

1110
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
when I am close to 0.

1111
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It is close.

1112
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So what the teacher saw at the beginning

1113
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
is that

1114
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
he spent a lot of time

1115
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
to make the decision.

1116
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
He spent almost 20 seconds to make the decision.

1117
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But you can see

1118
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
that 50 is very short.

1119
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There is a drop.

1120
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It only takes about 8 seconds to make the decision.

1121
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This means that

1122
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
50 is a very special allocation

1123
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
for the number.

1124
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
At least for them,

1125
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
if I see 50,

1126
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't need to think too much

1127
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
to make the decision.

1128
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Another thing is that

1129
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
we see a sharp kink

1130
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
in the acceptance rate.

1131
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
This means that

1132
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
it is possible that

1133
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
no matter what the

1134
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
probability is,

1135
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
at least we can still see something.

1136
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is the data

1137
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
on the reaction time.

1138
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
However, the interpretation is

1139
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
quite special.

1140
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
At least for the show data,

1141
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
we can spend very little time

1142
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
to make the decision.

1143
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Bo-xuan,

1144
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
is there no way to record

1145
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the time for the proposer to enter the game

1146
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and his proposal?

1147
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Because if you want to see if it is D4...

1148
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Let me think about it.

1149
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
What we can see is that

1150
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
we only start to calculate the time

1151
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
when we enter the game.

1152
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Because it depends on whether

1153
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the effect caused by the default option

1154
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
causes many people to raise 0.

1155
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Right.

1156
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You are right.

1157
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
We do see the time for the proposer.

1158
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
However, I remember that

1159
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
it took a lot of time.

1160
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
OK.

1161
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This is...

1162
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Hello?

1163
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let me answer.

1164
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
At the time close to 0,

1165
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
you said that

1166
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
it took a lot of time.

1167
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You mentioned that

1168
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
you were thinking...

1169
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
At the beginning,

1170
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
you said that

1171
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
there were many results at 0, right?

1172
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes.

1173
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
At that time,

1174
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
you thought that

1175
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
the starting point of SliderBar was 0, right?

1176
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes.

1177
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
In fact,

1178
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
they spent a lot of time thinking about it.

1179
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It seems that

1180
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
it is not because...

1181
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I think it is like

1182
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
canceling the explanation

1183
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
you mentioned at the beginning.

1184
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Is it because

1185
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
they just accepted it?

1186
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That's right.

1187
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
However,

1188
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
it took a lot of time.

1189
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It took a lot of time.

1190
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It took a lot of time.

1191
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I should show you the time for the proposer.

1192
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The time for the proposer.

1193
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
However,

1194
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the explanation of calling is quite interesting.

1195
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Why did it take a lot of time

1196
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to think about it?

1197
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Many people were reluctant to accept it.

1198
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It took a lot of time

1199
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
to accept it.

1200
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's right.

1201
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Bo-xuan,

1202
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
you can split the responder

1203
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
into accepted and unaccepted.

1204
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
OK.

1205
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
This is a special point.

1206
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I will split it.

1207
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I will write it down.

1208
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Next,

1209
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I still have some time.

1210
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I want to talk about the result of double option.

1211
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Double option is...

1212
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Sorry, Bo-xuan.

1213
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Before you talk about double option,

1214
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
can I talk about the point of

1215
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Automaton Game?

1216
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I was just thinking that

1217
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you just said that

1218
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
one possibility is that

1219
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
everyone cares about fairness.

1220
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The other possibility is that

1221
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
everyone cares about

1222
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
not losing.

1223
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Is the acceptance rate

1224
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
particularly high?

1225
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yes.

1226
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Or is it a whole point?

1227
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
There is a point that goes up

1228
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and then forms a square curve.

1229
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
If you care about fairness,

1230
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
maybe 50 is particularly high,

1231
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and then 51, 52,

1232
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
there will be another point.

1233
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
One-shot game is like this.

1234
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
There is no repeated game.

1235
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
OK.

1236
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I will continue to talk about it.

1237
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
OK.

1238
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

1239
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Next, double option is...

1240
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
First, I want to show you

1241
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
what the data looks like.

1242
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is our predicted market.

1243
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Next, the whole price changes.

1244
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
This is just an example.

1245
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I have 10 regions here.

1246
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I choose a market for each region.

1247
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I draw it out

1248
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
to show you what it looks like.

1249
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
You can see that I only draw four levels.

1250
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Because the length is about four levels.

1251
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If you look at the first level,

1252
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
everyone may be very noisy.

1253
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Next, look at the second level

1254
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and the third level,

1255
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
the price changes less.

1256
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
In the fourth level,

1257
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
the more you play, the more stable it becomes.

1258
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
What we want to see here is

1259
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
that under the market mechanism of double option,

1260
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
as long as you play about three or four times,

1261
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
consumers can find

1262
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
a balanced price, even if I don't tell them anything.

1263
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Next, another thing,

1264
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
as I said before,

1265
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
the market is very short.

1266
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So we want to estimate

1267
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
what it is like.

1268
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
If it can play a lot of games,

1269
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
where will it end up?

1270
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
We spent

1271
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
about a month

1272
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
to come up with this.

1273
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
First of all,

1274
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
let's talk about intuition.

1275
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Let's talk about an example.

1276
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Let's say

1277
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
a lot of people here have the same experience.

1278
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
When you apply for a PhD,

1279
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I want to know

1280
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
what this student will do

1281
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
in the rest of his career.

1282
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But the only thing I can know

1283
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
is what his GPA

1284
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
will look like in the next four years.

1285
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So at this time,

1286
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
for a school,

1287
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
if it wants to estimate

1288
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
what will happen next,

1289
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
the only thing it can do is

1290
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
to increase his GPA in different periods.

1291
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So it's possible that

1292
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I put more weight on the GPA at the end

1293
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
You can look at two parts.

1294
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
The first one is

1295
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
the Dependent Variable on the left.

1296
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
On the right,

1297
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
if we look at T as 1,

1298
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
this means that I am in the first period.

1299
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
In this case,

1300
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
this is back to the simplest return.

1301
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
This is very common.

1302
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
In the first period,

1303
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
if you use the example of GPA,

1304
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
your first semester

1305
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
is likely to have a lot of variables.

1306
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Maybe it's because you're a middle school student

1307
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and you don't know what's wrong with your GPA in the first semester.

1308
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
However,

1309
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
in the second period,

1310
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I only give you one-second weight

1311
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
to explain your starting point,

1312
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
such as building a house or something like that.

1313
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I only give you one-second weight.

1314
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I also give you one-second weight

1315
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
for your GPA at that time.

1316
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
This means that your GPA at this time

1317
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
may be only half of the population

1318
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
in front of you.

1319
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
In the third period,

1320
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I put two-thirds weight on your GPA.

1321
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
In this case,

1322
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I only give you one-third weight

1323
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
for your starting point.

1324
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So you can see that

1325
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
if I can make T

1326
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
as large as infinite,

1327
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
then my beta2

1328
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
is actually

1329
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
the progressive estimate of

1330
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
our dependent variable.

1331
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
In other words,

1332
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
if we put this Y

1333
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
on all the indicators of the first three markets,

1334
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
then where will this market end up?

1335
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
If consumers can play enough,

1336
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
then we put this Y

1337
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
on all the indicators of the first three markets,

1338
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
then we can see that

1339
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the first one is mean error deviation.

1340
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Its final price is only

1341
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
1% higher than the average price.

1342
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It is not significantly different

1343
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
from the theoretical estimate.

1344
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Then the final price change

1345
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
is reduced to 11%.

1346
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Although the estimate is a bit big,

1347
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
it is also not significantly different

1348
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
from the theoretical estimate.

1349
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The final price change is reduced to 97%.

1350
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It is also not significantly different from the first one.

1351
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So these results are basically

1352
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
completely the same as the results of the lab.

1353
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So at least

1354
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
we can prove that

1355
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
double auction is a very stable

1356
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
price mechanism

1357
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
to reach 100% efficiency.

1358
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So we can see that

1359
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
our data also shows the same thing.

1360
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
When our students can play enough,

1361
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
all of our welfare

1362
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
should be exhausted.

1363
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Can I go back to the last page?

1364
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Yes, you can.

1365
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I want to confirm

1366
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
the quantitative model.

1367
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Why is there no variable

1368
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
next to Beta 2?

1369
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Because this means

1370
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
what I want to see is

1371
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
where your final GPA is.

1372
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
What I bring here is a constant.

1373
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
What I multiply here

1374
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
is a constant.

1375
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
The point is that I am

1376
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
multiplying your

1377
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
current GPA

1378
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
with your original demographic

1379
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
variation.

1380
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Is it OK?

1381
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
It doesn't matter.

1382
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
If you don't understand,

1383
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I will discuss with you later.

1384
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I will continue.

1385
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
What we see in the end is that

1386
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
although we can basically

1387
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
get the theoretical estimate,

1388
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
what we want to see is that

1389
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
where your final GPA is.

1390
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
What we see in the end is the amount of transactions.

1391
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The horizontal axis

1392
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
is the theoretical estimate amount.

1393
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The vertical axis is the amount of transactions.

1394
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.

1395
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.

1396
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The horizontal axis is the amount of transactions.

1397
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
The point is that

1398
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
if the market is not balanced,

1399
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
we are often under-traded.

1400
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It is possible that

1401
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
the last one or two transactions

1402
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
may bring us only 1% or 2% of efficiency.

1403
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
In this case,

1404
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it is possible that

1405
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I am too lazy to make the last 1 or 2 cents.

1406
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
This is the main result of

1407
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
the double option.

1408
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I have about 10 minutes left.

1409
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I want to talk about

1410
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
what I said earlier.

1411
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We have a lot of

1412
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
variations in different countries.

1413
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I want to use some

1414
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
meta-analysis tools

1415
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
to analyze

1416
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
the composition of these variations.

1417
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
First,

1418
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
we look at

1419
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
the variations between countries.

1420
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Basically,

1421
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
we need to use

1422
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
a

1423
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
meta-analysis

1424
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
to calculate

1425
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I squared.

1426
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
If you look at

1427
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
this graph,

1428
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
you can see that

1429
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
these are

1430
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
the average variations of the proposal offer.

1431
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Next,

1432
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
we have all the variations,

1433
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
the variations between countries,

1434
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and the variations within countries.

1435
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What we want to know is

1436
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
what is the proportion of

1437
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
the variations between countries.

1438
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
We calculate I squared.

1439
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Since we don't have much time,

1440
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I won't talk about

1441
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
how to calculate I squared.

1442
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
What we can figure out is

1443
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
the proportion of

1444
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
the variations

1445
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
within countries.

1446
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
We can see that

1447
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
86.6% of the variations

1448
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
in the proposal offer

1449
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
are significant.

1450
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Although we can't say

1451
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that this is a cultural difference,

1452
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
we can say that

1453
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
the variations within countries

1454
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
are significant.

1455
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
From the same perspective,

1456
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
we look at the acceptance rate.

1457
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
The acceptance rate is special

1458
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
because we look at

1459
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
the shape of the probability function.

1460
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
In order to make it comparable,

1461
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
what we can do is

1462
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
we look at

1463
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
a logic regression.

1464
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
On the left, we put 0 and 1 variables,

1465
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
which is whether you accept or reject.

1466
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
On the right, we put

1467
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
10 dummy variables

1468
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
in addition to the offer.

1469
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
The result is that

1470
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
the dummy variable

1471
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
is the shape of the probability function.

1472
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We take the coefficient

1473
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
to measure the variations.

1474
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We can see that

1475
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
only 30% of the variations

1476
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
come from countries.

1477
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
This is not significant.

1478
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
We can see that

1479
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
in the Ultimatum Game,

1480
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
the proposal offer has a significant

1481
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
variation between countries,

1482
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but the acceptance rate is not significant.

1483
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This also responds to

1484
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Roth's conjecture in 1991.

1485
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Roth proposed a hypothesis

1486
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
in 1991.

1487
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
In the Ultimatum Game,

1488
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
the cultural difference between

1489
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
countries should be

1490
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
reflected by

1491
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
the proposal offer,

1492
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
but it does not affect

1493
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
the acceptance rate.

1494
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
This is a very good

1495
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
evidence

1496
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
to respond to

1497
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Roth's initial hypothesis.

1498
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Next, we look at

1499
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
the variation between double options.

1500
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
We take two things,

1501
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
the first one is the price.

1502
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We look at the first round

1503
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
of each market.

1504
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Then we look at

1505
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
the first and last price

1506
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
in the predicted market.

1507
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
We want to know

1508
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
how the market price

1509
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
is balanced.

1510
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
First, we look at

1511
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
the first price of each market.

1512
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
We can see that

1513
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the first one is

1514
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
only 27.3% of the variations

1515
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
are not written.

1516
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
The second one,

1517
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
we can see that

1518
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the first price

1519
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
is very noisy

1520
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
in some places

1521
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
like Spain or Singapore.

1522
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Although the number of variations

1523
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
is small,

1524
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
it causes the standard error

1525
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
to be large.

1526
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
However,

1527
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
in other countries,

1528
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
the standard error bar

1529
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
is very small.

1530
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Moreover,

1531
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
every country can

1532
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
predict the market price.

1533
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Next,

1534
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
if we look at

1535
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
the overall price distribution,

1536
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the first price

1537
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
is about 0.33%.

1538
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
The second one is

1539
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
only 14% of the overall price,

1540
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
so it is almost 60%.

1541
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This tells us that

1542
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
you may not know

1543
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
the market price,

1544
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
but you can

1545
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
stabilize the balance.

1546
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
This is the reason

1547
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
why many economists

1548
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
like the market.

1549
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Even if you don't know anything,

1550
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the market will tell you

1551
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
what the balance looks like.

1552
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Finally,

1553
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I want to summarize

1554
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
with this video.

1555
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
In this project,

1556
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
we use the lab data

1557
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
to predict the market price.

1558
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
In Ultimate Game,

1559
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
we can see that

1560
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
more than 94% of the proposals

1561
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
are below 50%.

1562
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Many proposals

1563
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
are above the natural

1564
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
poker point.

1565
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
In terms of acceptance rate,

1566
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
we see a 20% breakpoint.

1567
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
In the reaction,

1568
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
we see 10% more breakpoints.

1569
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
In response time,

1570
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
it is the lowest

1571
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
of the three.

1572
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Finally,

1573
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
no matter which of the three

1574
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
we use,

1575
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
accuracy,

1576
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
fluctuation,

1577
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
or efficiency

1578
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
will all be calculated.

1579
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Finally,

1580
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
we can see that

1581
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
in Ultimate Game,

1582
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the proposal offer

1583
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
has more breakpoints

1584
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
than acceptance rate.

1585
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
This is in response to

1586
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Roth's 1990 contracture.

1587
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Finally,

1588
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
if we compare Ultimate Game

1589
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
with Double Option,

1590
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
we can see a big difference

1591
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
between the two countries.

1592
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
This is in response to

1593
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Double Option is a very stable mechanism

1594
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
in all countries.

1595
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I think this is all

1596
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I want to say.

1597
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I will show my email.

1598
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
If you have any questions,

1599
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
we have about 5 minutes left.

1600
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Let's see what questions you want to ask.

1601
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Mr. He,

1602
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
do you want to comment?

1603
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Mr. He, please comment.

1604
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I want to ask

1605
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
if you have any questions.

1606
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I will ask first.

1607
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Wait a minute.

1608
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The first question is for Mr. He.

1609
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Do you want to estimate

1610
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
the result of long-term training?

1611
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There is a way.

1612
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You can show us

1613
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
the data

1614
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
in the lab.

1615
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
If you only use the previous few rounds,

1616
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
then you can estimate

1617
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
the result of long-term training.

1618
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
This way,

1619
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
you can estimate the result of long-term training.

1620
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm not sure

1621
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
how you estimate the result

1622
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
of long-term training

1623
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
in the country.

1624
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm not sure

1625
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
how you estimate the result of long-term training.

1626
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I will talk about it first.

1627
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
No, no.

1628
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
What I mean is

1629
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
what is the hypothesis

1630
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
you want to verify.

1631
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If it is a double auction,

1632
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
why do you

1633
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
say that

1634
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Asians are more polite?

1635
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No, what I want to say is

1636
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
double auctions

1637
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
in different places around the world

1638
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
have similar results.

1639
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
However,

1640
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
there is a big difference

1641
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
between each country.

1642
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That's what I want to say.

1643
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Let me think about it.

1644
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Let me think about it.

1645
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There is a problem here.

1646
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You think the market

1647
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
is universal.

1648
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You think the market

1649
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
is universal.

1650
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You think the market

1651
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
is universal.

1652
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
However,

1653
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
there is a problem here.

1654
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
There is a problem here.

1655
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
If you don't use the strategy method,

1656
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
you can't see

1657
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
the complete strategy

1658
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
of the respondent.

1659
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
You think

1660
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
what you see is

1661
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
what you see is

1662
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
acceptable or not,

1663
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you can only explain

1664
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
30% of the variation.

1665
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
However,

1666
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
what is the actual strategy?

1667
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I'm not sure

1668
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm not sure

1669
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
where you can check.

1670
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It is possible

1671
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
that because

1672
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
different countries

1673
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
have already explained

1674
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
most of the proposal

1675
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
that is,

1676
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
everyone

1677
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
has proposed

1678
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
a social standard

1679
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
that meets

1680
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
the social standard

1681
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
of the proposal.

1682
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But that part

1683
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
may be because it is all

1684
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
hidden in the

1685
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
proposal.

1686
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
This is also the point I want to talk about.

1687
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
This is also the point I want to talk about.

1688
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
OK.

1689
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Can I ask a question?

1690
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Can I ask a question?

1691
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Hi.

1692
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
0 and 100

1693
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
0 and 100

1694
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
0 and 100

1695
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I agree with what Meng just said.

1696
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I agree with what Meng just said.

1697
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
The default reaction time

1698
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
The default reaction time

1699
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
is a test

1700
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
to see if it is a default effect.

1701
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You said you have

1702
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
experimental instructions.

1703
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You said you have

1704
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
experimental instructions.

1705
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Can you tell

1706
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
which ones are

1707
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
really incentivized?

1708
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?

1709
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?

1710
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Can you tell which ones are really incentivized?

1711
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Usually, the incentive for

1712
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
an experiment is

1713
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
how many points I give you

1714
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
if you take part in the experiment.

1715
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But I don't know what their design is like.

1716
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But I don't know what their design is like.

1717
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Some may be related to

1718
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
your test result.

1719
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Some may be related to

1720
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
your test result.

1721
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Some may be related to

1722
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
a participation experiment.

1723
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
But the result is not affected by it.

1724
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
But the result is not affected by it.

1725
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You will see more than 100 points.

1726
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You will see more than 100 points.

1727
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
You will see more than 100 points.

1728
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It may be normal.

1729
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Because the result may be

1730
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
a naive or unexpected behavior.

1731
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
a naive or unexpected behavior.

1732
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
About the more than 0 points,

1733
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I think

1734
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
it is a

1735
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
inherent problem.

1736
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
In general, those who do experiments with

1737
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
telecom all use

1738
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Marbled.

1739
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Marbled.

1740
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I don't know whether it is right.

1741
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But, I think it is.

1742
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
What about after-graduate students?

1743
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
What about after- graduate students?

1744
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
What about after- graduate students?

1745
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
The third option is

1746
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
the course of

1747
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Ultimatum Gate.

1748
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The third option is

1749
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the course of Ultimatum Gate.

1750
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The 3rd option is

1751
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
for example,

1752
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
after-graduate students finish the course,

1753
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
the theoretical prediction of Ultimatum Gate is 0.

1754
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Then, they do the experiment.

1755
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Or, they do the experiment before the theoretical prediction.

1756
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
There is a difference.

1757
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
There is a difference.

1758
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because, after-graduate students do the experiment,

1759
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
the 3rd option

1760
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
is the default of many people.

1761
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I know.

1762
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
We have seen

1763
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
different courses.

1764
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The smallest course is the course of Game Theory.

1765
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
OK.

1766
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
This is a sample.

1767
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
OK.

1768
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You can imagine

1769
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
the degree of

1770
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
interaction between

1771
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
the scope of each course,

1772
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
this is Ludger' class.

1773
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Because we have a class name,

1774
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So, we may roughly know the degree of interaction.

1775
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
The only difference is

1776
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
after-shared theory prediction

1777
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
of Ultimatum Gate is 0,

1778
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I can't see it.

1779
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
For 0 and 100,

1780
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
in the data of Google Earth,

1781
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
the two peaks

1782
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
are very different.

1783
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So, I think

1784
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
if you can

1785
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
clear those data,

1786
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
or find the way

1787
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
like just now,

1788
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and then compare with the kink,

1789
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
OK.

1790
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Maybe it will be closer.

1791
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I don't know if it will affect.

1792
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
OK.

1793
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I have a notebook.

1794
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
OK.

1795
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
You ask first.

1796
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
OK. Thank you.

1797
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
This is not a question.

1798
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's more like a comment.

1799
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Since

1800
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
you have the default option

1801
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
bias,

1802
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
it seems to be a very serious thing.

1803
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It will make your two curves

1804
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and theory different.

1805
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
My idea is

1806
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
whether you can...

1807
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I don't know if it will be too difficult.

1808
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
When you change your program,

1809
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
when you change your game,

1810
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
you make every starting point different.

1811
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
You can choose a starting point

1812
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
to solve your next problem.

1813
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Let me respond.

1814
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
This is technically

1815
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
very simple.

1816
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But there is another problem

1817
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
in economics.

1818
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
There is a friction effect.

1819
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I'm afraid there will be an anchoring result.

1820
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So...

1821
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh.

1822
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
If

1823
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
your starting point is a very high offer,

1824
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
it is very likely that people will be affected

1825
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
by that point.

1826
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
OK. My offer is higher.

1827
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
If my starting point is lower,

1828
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I may be affected by this point.

1829
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So we are...

1830
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
About this,

1831
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
we can't control

1832
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
the standard time.

1833
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Usually,

1834
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
the way to control the prediction effect

1835
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
is to put $100

1836
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
directly on the table.

1837
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Don't put it on both sides.

1838
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Put it one by one.

1839
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
OK.

1840
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
But

1841
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
in their operation,

1842
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
they choose

1843
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
to put it directly at the beginning.

1844
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So there will be a prediction effect.

1845
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But in terms of reaction time,

1846
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
the effect should be very small.

1847
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I have a response.

1848
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Or just change the interface

1849
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
to fill in the numbers directly.

1850
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Don't use the LaBar method.

1851
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Of course,

1852
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
this is also possible.

1853
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But this may have to talk

1854
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
to the engineer.

1855
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But this is also possible.

1856
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
But we want to change it.

1857
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
We want to use LaBar mainly to

1858
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
make the picture interesting

1859
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and make consumers want to buy it.

1860
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I don't know why.

1861
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Everyone thinks LaBar is fun.

1862
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I don't know why.

1863
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Everyone likes LaBar.

1864
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
But there will be a lot of problems.

1865
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Of course.

1866
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
LaBar is because

1867
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
a lot of people are operating

1868
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
with a tablet.

1869
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
This is also...

1870
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I have a question.

1871
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You say.

1872
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Hello.

1873
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You say.

1874
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
This question is like this.

1875
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You know that Zhang Anping

1876
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
is studying social psychology.

1877
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
They often play this kind of

1878
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
game.

1879
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But they like to do one thing,

1880
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
which is to manipulate the victim.

1881
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
For example, let you play the game first,

1882
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
then teach you game theory,

1883
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
then let you play the game,

1884
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
then look at the difference.

1885
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
But what they do more often is

1886
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
to let you play the game first,

1887
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
then let you watch Hitler's documentary,

1888
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
do you try to manipulate the victim?

1889
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
This is what we can't do.

1890
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Because we...

1891
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Because it means

1892
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
different treatments for the victim.

1893
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We can compare the experimental group and the control group.

1894
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But we are basically because

1895
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
we don't have an experimental group and a control group.

1896
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So this is what we can't do.

1897
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
There is no way to look at this information.

1898
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
But of course, if we are in the lab,

1899
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
it can be done completely.

1900
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But you can sell the product to the psychology department.

1901
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
This is what I am sure of.

1902
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
This is what I am sure of.

1903
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
So now we are going to hire a psychologist.

1904
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I think this will be a pretty interesting tour.

1905
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Because they are indeed writing.

1906
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And they are going to write the first book

1907
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
by themselves in MATLAB.

1908
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
In fact, I think the meeting is ugly.

1909
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That's what you're doing.

1910
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So I think there is

1911
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
marketing potential.

1912
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I should tell the boss about this.

1913
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And science, in terms of science,

1914
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
is actually interesting, I think.

1915
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I want to tell the boss about this.

1916
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I want to tell the boss about this.

1917
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And Bozun,

1918
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
let me ask you again.

1919
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
As long as you can see

1920
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
all the regions,

1921
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
you should be able to see which schools

1922
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
use MATLAB, right?

1923
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Yes.

1924
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Do you have a proposal for

1925
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
the education level or the income level?

1926
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
No income.

1927
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But we have a division

1928
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
for each school.

1929
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I want to say that the school itself is an income proxy.

1930
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It must be some library.

1931
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Yes.

1932
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But I haven't connected yet.

1933
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I haven't connected with the income in that area.

1934
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I propose that you can

1935
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
take a look.

1936
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Because you have income data now.

1937
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You have similar income or education

1938
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
level data.

1939
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You should be able to find it up there.

1940
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
But don't give me homework, please.

1941
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
OK.

1942
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
In fact, if you have any

1943
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
questions, I can't think of it now.

1944
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
You can e-mail me.

1945
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Or you can find me on Facebook.

1946
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Then...

1947
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
The small question I just wanted to ask is

1948
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
that you said that

1949
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
ROTH is between

1950
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
the proposer and the responder.

1951
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You said that the variation comes from the

1952
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
proposer, which is the ROTH hypothesis.

1953
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Does this hypothesis come from

1954
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
the observation of its data or from

1955
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
some theory?

1956
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It comes from the observation of its data.

1957
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Because there are only four

1958
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
countries, and each country basically

1959
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
compares the last round of data.

1960
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So you're talking about

1961
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
comparing 100 data points.

1962
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
So

1963
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
for ROTH, it can't do

1964
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
statistical analysis. It can only say

1965
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
what the four distributions look like.

1966
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
And what my observation looks like.

1967
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
OK.

1968
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
OK.

1969
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So are there any questions

1970
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
from the audience?

1971
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Our speech time is

1972
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
almost over.

1973
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Can you stay for a while?

1974
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I want to talk to you.

1975
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Sure.

1976
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
OK.

1977
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That's all for today's speech.

1978
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Thank you, everyone.

1979
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Thank you.

1980
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Applause, please.

1981
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Thank you.

1982
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I'll pause the recording.
