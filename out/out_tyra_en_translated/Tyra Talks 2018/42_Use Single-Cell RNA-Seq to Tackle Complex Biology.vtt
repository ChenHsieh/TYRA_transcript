00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, everyone.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
I am honored to be able to introduce Dr. Sun today.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
Dr. Sun completed her bachelor's degree from 1999 to 2013

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Taiwan University.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
After completing her bachelor's degree from 2003 to 2005,

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
she completed her master's degree in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the same university in Taiwan.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
She then completed her Ph.D. degree from 2005 to 2010 at Purdue University.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Her major is Chemical Biology.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
After completing her Ph.D. degree, she went to MIT to do her postdoc.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
After four years, she went to UCSF to do her second postdoc and assistant researcher.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
This year, she started her new job as a Senior Scientific Researcher at Genentech.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Today, Dr. Sun is going to talk about

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Use Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Tackle Complex Biology.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Now, let's welcome Dr. Sun to give her presentation.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Sun.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
Sorry, my voice is a bit hoarse due to my cold.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Today, I am going to talk in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Just in case, some of you may not have a background in biology.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
I hope you can at least learn about Single-Cell RNA-Seq.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Here is my personal email and LinkedIn account.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Although my LinkedIn account is not up to date,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
please feel free to connect with me.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
I will be speaking in Chinese today,

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
but I am not sure what the term is in Chinese.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I don't want to make it too complicated.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
I will be focusing on technology.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I am currently working at a company,

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
so I can't really talk about research projects here.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
I will try my best to talk about the applications of this technology,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
and the principles behind it.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
I hope this will be helpful to those who are interested.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Before we get into the technology,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I will briefly review the biology of NTU.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
As you may already know, our body is made up of cells.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Many cells form organs,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
and eventually form organs in our body,

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
becoming a functional human body.

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
An interesting fact is that our body is composed of over 20 different types of cells.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
You can see that their forms and functions are very different.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
For example, there are nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells,

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
and even different types of cells in different organs.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Their functions and forms are very different.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Let's take a deeper look.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
As you can see, our body is made up of cells.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Each cell has a nucleus,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
which is a red dot.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
In English, it's called a nucleus.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
In Chinese, it's called a cell nucleus.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
In this cell nucleus, there is a chromosome.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
This chromosome is made up of our genes.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
I think everyone has a concept of genes.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Genes are our genetic material.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Genes are our genetic material,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
and they can determine our body functions.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
Generally speaking, genes are basically DNA fragments.

04:55.000 --> 05:03.000
They can be converted into useful molecules,

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
which can perform the functions required by our body.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
We usually talk about gene decoding or gene encryption.

05:11.000 --> 05:22.000
The main reason is that DNA is composed of a series of ATCG,

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
which is a double helix structure made up of four different genes.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Generally speaking, if we talk about gene decoding,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
the sequence you get may be composed of four ATCG

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
in different ways.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
This is our so-called gene code.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
In molecular biology, there is a so-called central dogma.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
It's the principle that we have this genetic material.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Its main structure is DNA,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
which is transcribed into RNA.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
RNA is further transcribed into protein.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
Protein can perform various biological functions.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
As time goes by,

06:15.000 --> 06:22.000
the central dogma is gradually extended to more different forms.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
We can even find more different directions from the virus or other systems.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
Today's technology involves a discovery.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
In the past, we thought that DNA was transcribed into RNA.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Later, scientists found another molecule

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
that allows RNA to reverse transcribe back to the DNA.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Because of the help of this molecule,

06:54.000 --> 07:03.000
many related extension technologies can be built on this basis.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
Today, we are going to talk about RNAseq.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
In other words, transcriptome analysis,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
or gene expression profiling,

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
we can use genes to understand human physiology.

07:26.000 --> 07:37.000
This picture shows a major timeline and milestone in molecular biology and sequencing technology.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
In 1953, the first discovery of DNA double-stranded structure was made.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
In 1977, Sanger's DNA sequencing was developed.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Later, PCR technology was also developed.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
PCR technology allows us to rapidly increase our DNA in the lab.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
Many related technologies can be built on this basis.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
In 1990, the Human Genome Project was launched.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
After 13 years, the Human Genome Project was established.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
At this stage, the sequencing cost was still very high.

08:25.000 --> 08:33.000
It was difficult to operate the sequencing project in the lab.

08:33.000 --> 08:40.000
In 2005, the Next Generation Sequencing was introduced.

08:40.000 --> 08:50.000
Next Generation Sequencing is a next-generation sequencing technology.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
This technology has greatly reduced the cost of sequencing.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
More and more Genome Projects related to sequencing can be carried out more smoothly in labs.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Up to now, Next Generation Sequencing technology is still widely used.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
In recent years, the Third Generation Sequencing technology has been introduced.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
When was Single Cell RNAse developed?

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
Single Cell RNAse was first reported in 2009.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
Single Cell RNAse is a technology that is becoming more and more mature.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
Single Cell RNAse is a technology that is becoming more and more mature.

09:43.000 --> 09:52.000
Many advanced protocols, technologies, and companies continue to develop rapidly in this field.

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
Why do we need to do Single Cell RNAse?

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
Before Single Cell RNAse, we can look at gene profiling.

10:08.000 --> 10:18.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

10:18.000 --> 10:28.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

10:28.000 --> 10:38.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

10:48.000 --> 10:58.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

10:58.000 --> 11:08.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

11:18.000 --> 11:28.000
For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

11:28.000 --> 11:36.000
