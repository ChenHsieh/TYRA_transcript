00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hi, everyone, welcome to today's Tarot Talk. I am today's host, Zhang Yanyong.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.000
Today's Tarot Talk is very happy to invite Dr. Yu Zhejing.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Can I say this? Although half of my feet have already stepped into Ph.D.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Zhejing is a graduate of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
He directly enrolled in the PhD class of the University of Taiwan Chemical Engineering.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
This year is the fourth year of the PhD class.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
In the first three years of the PhD class, he conducted a cooperation experiment in Poland.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Last year, he applied for the Thousand Miles Project.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I want to say that I am in Caltech.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
He conducted research on visiting in Caltech.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
We have become very good friends this year.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
He just returned to Taiwan and is expected to graduate this summer.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
He is almost graduating.

00:51.000 --> 01:01.000
He is interested in the study of nanoparticless materials and green energy and environmental governance through the application of light, vinegar, coal, blowing, and chemical engineering.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
So far, he has published nearly ten articles.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Half of them are written by Ph.D.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Can you go back to the first page?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You should be able to see the first video now.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Today's topic is very interesting.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
It's called The Air We Breathe and The Water We Drink.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Yu-Zhe Jin.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I forgot to say one thing.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
When you applaud, you have to put the microphone down so that the speaker can hear your applause.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Yes, I heard it.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Please start.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Thank you, Tara, for inviting me to speak today.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I am Yu-Zhe Jin.

01:40.000 --> 01:49.000
Today I am going to talk about how we use chemical engineering to manage our air and water.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
The speech will be divided into two parts.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
The first is to use light blowing to manage the toxic gas in the air.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
The second part is to use electromagnetic methods to deal with our waste water.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
I hope that if you have any questions, we can discuss them directly.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I will limit the time to about an hour.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Including Q&A, I will limit it to about an hour.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Sorry, let me interrupt.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I have a question.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
You can see a small microphone pattern on the right side of the screen.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
You have to mute your own microphone to make a sound.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Don't forget.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Please continue.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Okay.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
In general, in the combustion process,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
they will release a lot of toxic gases.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
Among them, nitric oxide will release about 250 to 400 BPM.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
What kind of harm will this cause?

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
The toxic gas of nitric oxide, after a series of light chemical reactions,

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
may produce carbon dioxide, NO2, or ozone.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
These two things are actually toxic gases.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
In fact, in the early days, there were some problems with light chemicals.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
You can see that the air is orange.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
They are the so-called light chemicals.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
These light chemicals are produced by carbon dioxide and ozone produced by these oil reactions.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
In the early 1952s in London and the 1980s in Los Angeles,

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
about tens of thousands of people died because of these light chemicals.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
At the same time, carbon dioxide will also form acid rain with water.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
The harm of acid rain is corrosion of buildings.

03:53.000 --> 04:02.000
At the same time, the most recent problem is probably the air whirlpool we know, PM2.5.

04:02.000 --> 04:10.000
Nitric oxide will form a whirlpool in the air after it is combined with some solvents in the air, such as dust.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
These whirlpools are lighter in density.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
For example, PM2.5 means that the particle diameter is less than 2.5 microns.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Carbon dioxide is lighter, so it will stay in the air.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
When it is absorbed by the human body, it will harm the lungs.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
So our research focus is to deal with nitric oxide in the air,

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
to prevent it from generating more harmful substances with other chemical reactions.

04:39.000 --> 04:48.000
This chart is based on the air quality standards set by the US Department of Environment.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Among them, the air quality standards set six legal pollutants.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
Three of them are the toxic gases we just mentioned, NO2, ozone, and air whirlpools.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
These three will be generated by our carbon dioxide.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
So this is why we have to solve the problem of carbon dioxide.

05:09.000 --> 05:19.000
Q&A

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
They will be monitored in different ways.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
For example, they will measure the concentration of carbon dioxide for 1 hour.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
If the concentration is more than 35 ppm in 1 hour, it is not standard.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
But for a long time, if you put the magnitude to 8 hours of monitoring,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
8 hours is OK as long as it is below 9 ppm.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
The short-term concentration should not be too high, and the long-term concentration should be a standard.

05:49.000 --> 06:03.000
If my understanding is correct, is it possible to say that if I have a temporary or monotonous NO2 emission,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
it is a shot and then it is over.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
How long does it take to decay?

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
Or it should be said that some things, such as CO, may cause harm if absorbed in a short time.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
So it will be set, for example, that it cannot exceed this concentration within 1 hour.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Otherwise, if the absorption exceeds this concentration, it will actually harm the human body.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
But some things may be absorbed for a long time.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Even if the concentration is low, it will cause harm to the human body.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It will set a long-term standard.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Or it is set such a standard for the long-term toxicity of that substance and the short-term toxicity.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Does this answer your question?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
OK, thank you.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
The most commonly used method in the industry is called Selective Catalytic Reduction.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
We often call it SCR.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
We use the method of recovery to deal with our carbon monoxide.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
The reason I put this picture is because you know that there is something in the car called a catalyst.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.000
Because the car will actually burn those diesel or gasoline,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
which will also produce a lot of carbon monoxide by burning.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
This catalyst can turn carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Let me give you an idea.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
If a car has been used for 10 years, it may have bought 50,000 yuan.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
How much money do you think will be left after 10 years?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Does anyone want to guess?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
If the car is used for 10 years, there are about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan left.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
In fact, 2,000 to 3,000 yuan is the price of a catalyst.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Because the catalyst actually contains a lot of precious metals.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So the most important thing for a car is its catalyst.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
Through this, we can turn our carbon monoxide into a non-toxic gas.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
There are other methods, such as oxidation.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
If carbon monoxide is added to its oxidizer, it will actually turn into a more toxic carbon monoxide.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Carbon monoxide will actually harm our lungs.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Carbon monoxide will even cause uric acid tears.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
Uric acid tears will cause the function of the oxidizer to decrease, causing the oxidation of the uric acid.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
This is why we need to use restoration, not oxidation, to deal with our carbon monoxide.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
We are doing experiments.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
In fact, we considered NOx.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
NOx is actually the synthesis of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
Although our initial reaction was carbon monoxide, we do not want to produce more toxic gas after our reaction.

09:00.000 --> 09:11.000
So if we are evaluating whether our air is handled well, we will use this indicator to confirm that all carbon monoxide has been removed.

09:11.000 --> 09:23.000
The operating temperature of NOx is usually above 250 degrees Celsius, according to current research.

09:23.000 --> 09:35.000
This is why we want to use light-supported SCR reaction, which is to use light blowing to support the restoration reaction just mentioned.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Sorry, I have a question.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
You said that 200-300 degrees Celsius is assumed to be long-pressure, right?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Yes, long-pressure.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
So basically you are heating NOx in the air.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Yes, because the exhaust pipe of the car is very hot.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
So we are heating NOx in the exhaust pipe.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
We need to reach the operating temperature of carbon monoxide to effectively remove NOx.

10:06.000 --> 10:15.000
So if I use a pump to collect all these gases into a chamber to make it super high-pressure, but I don't need to heat it.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Isn't the energy density high enough?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Theoretically, yes.

10:21.000 --> 10:29.000
But in the actual handling of the case, the flow rate is very fast.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
So if you want to do this, you can't handle such a large amount of waste in time.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Yes, because you have to collect it first.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Collect it in the cylinder and then process it.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yes.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Then empty the cylinder and collect it and process it.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh, OK.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
It's more impractical in the process.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
OK.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Of course, it's not a problem.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
OK.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
So why do we use light to blow our reaction?

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
First, let's talk about the background of light emission.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Light emission is actually the use of light.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Then usually the material we choose is semiconductor material.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
It will have its bearing and guide.

11:09.000 --> 11:15.000
After using the light, it can illuminate the guide.

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
Then the electron will be magnetized from the next generation to the next generation.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
Then it will form its electron and the remaining electric field.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
The electron can actually participate in our chemical reaction.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
For example, the reaction can turn our carbon dioxide into our gas.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
So this study is actually using light to provide an energy.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Then use this energy to carry out our chemical reaction.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
What advantages does it have compared to the traditional SCR reaction we just talked about?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
It can be reacted at room temperature.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
It doesn't need to be heated to, for example, 200 or 300 degrees.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
At the same time, we think of light as an energy that can't be used or used.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So it's a green energy.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
The third point is that the traditional SCR reaction must be operated at very limited temperatures.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
For example, there is only 10 degrees of tolerance space.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Light can actually operate at a wider temperature.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
So we don't have to design its reaction temperature so strictly.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
Provide a better operating condition.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
The top three points of the doctoral class are our cooperation with Poland.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I think I've been interrupting you.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm asking a small question.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm actually quite welcome to do this.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Otherwise, I might talk about it until the end.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
So the bandgap of the semiconductor is about a few eV.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
So the photon you're talking about is visible light.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Good question.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I'm using TiO2 here.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
So it's actually not a visible light material.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Its bandgap is 3.2 eV.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
3.2 eV?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yes, and then...

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Oh, is it a near-infrared?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Near-infrared.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Near-infrared.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
So in fact, TiO2 can only absorb ultraviolet light.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
OK.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So it's just eV level.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yes.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
So we have a lot of researchers who want to modify the material.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Make its bandgap smaller.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Then we can absorb the wavelength of ultraviolet light to the wavelength of visible light.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
That is, it can really be used for solar energy.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Because only 4% of solar energy is ultraviolet light.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
In fact, more than 90% is visible light or infrared light bandgap.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
OK.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Got it.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
OK, thank you.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
OK, thank you.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
OK, so we're working with Boron.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm just going to talk a little bit about what we did before.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
Then we designed a large-scale light-emitting reaction.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
Because before that, a lot of teams were lab-scale.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
They only do it in the lab.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
So we want to be able to test whether this thing can actually be used in practical.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So we designed a large-scale light-emitting reactor.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Its scale is about 1 meter.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
We can see from this picture.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
The picture on the right is about 1 meter.

14:10.000 --> 14:19.000
So we filled our catalyst, which is our antifreeze, in the outer layer of the tube and the tube.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
And then we see that we've actually installed a light tube.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
And we're going to blow these reactions with these light tubes.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
And then we're going to put the results we made before.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
The y-axis is the concentration.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
We reflect the concentration of the toxic gas NO.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
The horizontal axis is the time.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
At initial concentration, we can see that NO is about 250 to 200 ppm.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
After the reflection of light, it does reduce our toxic gas.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
It's about 50 ppm.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
So we're going to calculate their NOx removal efficiency, which is about 75%.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
That's what I'm talking about.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Because you can see that his NOx removal efficiency is only 75%.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
So we want to be able to further improve its removal efficiency.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
So what about this part?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
How do you say?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
If you meet someone who does the light brittle field today,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
If you don't understand anything, it doesn't matter.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
You just ask him, how much is your NOx?

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
That will make you feel that he thinks, oh, you might be an expert in this field.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
That's why I'm going to put this thing on.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.000
The definition of NOx is actually that it can absorb as much light as it can.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
And then convert it into how many moles of electrons to participate in the reaction.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
So, in theory, if a light can produce an electron to react,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
This value will be at most one.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
And then we're going to compare the light reflectors that we've tested in the lab before.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Compare it with the light reflectors in our factory.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Their quantum yaw is actually on a similar scale.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
And then even the light reflectors in the factory,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
His quantum yaw is better than him.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
So we guess why he's better.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
It's because in our design,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
His light tube is actually in the reaction.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
He's this box, he's going to be covered.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
So he can effectively use all the functions to prevent the dissolution of light.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Okay, so the next study,

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
We're trying to make our materials better,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
To make it more light efficient.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.000
So, someone came up with a thing called titanium dioxide nano sheets.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
This is the most traditional integrated Tl2.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
If you actually magnify it to a large size,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
It looks like this under the microscope.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
An octahedron.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
What about this octahedron?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's our traditional titanium dioxide.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
But there are scientists who have found that.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Let's call this side this direction.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
You can see the definition of this XYZ.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
X is called 110.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Y is our 010.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
It's the same as our previous mathematical definition.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
So we're going to call the yellow side the gold side of 001.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
And then the red side is the gold side of 101.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
So we see that the traditional titanium dioxide,

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
It's not actually exposed to the gold side of 001.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
It's mostly the gold side of 101.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
Scientists have found that the gold side of 001 is more responsive than the gold side of 101.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
But it's because it's more responsive.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
So it's actually not stable in thermodynamics.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
So it's not easy to synthesize.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
That's why the gold side of the tradition is mainly 101.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And then it looks like this.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
So in our research, we want to go.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
So in our research, we want to go.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
Let him expose more of this 001 side.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Let him be more reflective.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
And then by computer calculations.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
They found that when we put the gold of TiO2,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
The gold of TiO2,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
It's a different element that can reduce its stomach.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
That's the stomach of each of their gold surfaces.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
The lower the stomach, the more stable it is, the easier it is to be synthesized.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
And then they found that if they mixed the Fu element,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
It can make this gold of 001 the most stable.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
You can see that the black dot represents the gold of 001.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
The black dot represents the gold of 001.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
You can see that the black dot is actually lower than the white.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
It means that its stomach is actually more stable.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
And then for other elements,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
It doesn't have the same effect.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
So we try to...

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
So we try to...

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
So we try to...

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
The one above you is the image of the electronic microscope, right?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
So you are actually...

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I guess it's because you want to reduce the cost.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
But you use this, what is it called?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
It's a single crystal, not a big one.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
It's a single crystal, not a big one.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
You mean the Taisha and Danjing?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Because you look like a small piece now.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
But if you grow a crystal today,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
It's the Tetra Hyperion you just made.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Grow it to a super perfect and super big one.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
It's a single crystal as big as a fist.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
It's a single crystal as big as a fist.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh, if it really grows to such a perfect size,

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
It's going to have a very small surface area.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
Because it means it's a very large particle.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
For our good reaction,

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Surface area is a very important thing.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Surface area refers to how much surface is exposed

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
under each grain of material.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
The molecular area is the area where the grain is engraved.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
But our chemical reaction happens mainly on the surface of the material.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
So we care about the surface area.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
It's better to be very fine.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
So your question is,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
If the particles are too large, it means the surface area is very low.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
So we want the particles to be smaller and better.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
So you want to know why people make nanoparticles.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Because nanoparticles means the particles are small.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
And nanoparticles means the surface area is high.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Oh, I was thinking that because of the big single crystal,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
the quantum efficiency can be up to 30% or 40% or something like that.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
But mainly the chemical reaction is done by the material.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
They are combined into a perfect crystal.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
This is what they are doing.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
But for practical use,

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
they hope that the smaller the particle, the better.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I see. I understand. Thank you.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
I have another question.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Someone asked,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Fu and Xi are not all black below?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Fu and Xi are not all black below?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Yes. So it means that Xi is also good.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
If you use Xi to synthesize,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
it will be more than 101.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
But Fu's overall energy is lower.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Its scale is less than 0.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
So Fu's crystal will be more stable than Xi's.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Both are good,

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
but Fu is better.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
But a follow-up question.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
If the industry is so big,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
the cost should be much lower, right?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
That's right.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
This is more of a fundamental research.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
If it is applied,

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
there will be a difference in cost.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Various facilities,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
factories,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
the cost of handling Xi should be very low.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
You can imagine that Fu's amount of friction

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
accounts for about 0.1% of the overall cost.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
So Fu is very little.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
It's mainly the process of friction.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
So the cost is not bad.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Yes. TI2 is very cheap.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
So it's still OK.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
OK. I'll go on.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
So we actually

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
added some Fu atoms during the synthesis

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
to form the Titanium Nanosheets we just talked about.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
This is obvious from the appearance.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
SG is actually a

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
carbon dioxide that is synthesized in a traditional way.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
So it's actually a granule.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Here we just

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
control the ratio of their precursors.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
So they are all nanosheets.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
You can see that they are obviously a granule structure.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Then

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
how do we

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
explain that

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
this surface is 001?

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
We will use TEM to explain that this surface is 001.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Because you can't say that you set this 001,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
it's 001. You have to explain something.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Our method is to continue to magnify TEM.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Then if you

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
magnify it for the area, you can actually see their

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
diameter, their despacing.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
According to the measurement, we know that their diameter

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
is about 0.239 nanometers.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
So the despacing corresponded to

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
is actually the same as their

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
calculation value of 0.235.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Then we can say for sure

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
that this direction is

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
our 001 side.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
This picture is actually the side picture.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
In fact, we will look like this

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
from the side of it.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
B and C are actually its covers.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
So we can see that the top is actually

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
the 001 side.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Then we will use

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
XRD to confirm that our

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
service source is really involved in it.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
XRD is for their

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
diameter.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
XRD is made up of the analysis material by the diameter.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
You can see

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
about 25-26 degrees.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
You can find that

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
SG and P25 are actually

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
a traditional TIL2,

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
a traditional granulated TIL2.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Then their wind is probably in this position.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
Then I use the line to mark this part.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
In fact, you can find that these three are our

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
nanometers of our synthesis.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Their wind is actually deviated.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
This deviation can actually point out that

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
because its flux is involved in its diameter,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
in fact, if its diameter is getting bigger,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
we are based on our Bragg law.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
You can know that if the diameter is getting bigger,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
the D spacing is getting bigger,

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
it will change its theta value,

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
so that the wind is deviated.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
So we use XRD to confirm that

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
its flux is involved in its diameter.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
Then this is

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
XRD's light-electromagnetic chart.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
We can use this to analyze its

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
TIL.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Because TIL is an excess metal,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
so in fact, TIL may exist in 2, 3, 4.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
We want to know how many of them

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
exist in our carbon dioxide.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
From this chart, we can find that

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
TIL is mainly a 4-car.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
In fact, in our carbon dioxide plate,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
we will find that it has more TIL.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
This wind actually represents

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
TIL's wind.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
Then after our calculation,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
we can know that TIL's wind,

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
TIL's content is probably

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
about 20% for the plate.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Then we can find that

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
TIL is mainly a 4-car.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Then we can find that

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
TIL's wind,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
TIL's content is probably

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
about 20% for the plate.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Then we can find that

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
TIL's wind,

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
TIL's content is probably

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
about 20% for the plate.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Then we can find that

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
