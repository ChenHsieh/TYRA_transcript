0	4000	Welcome everyone to today's Terra Talk.
4000	9000	Today is the whole summer vacation of Terra.
9000	12000	Because we did not plan for the summer vacation at the beginning of this year.
12000	14000	Because there are a lot of people joining this year.
14000	17000	So we arranged a new session during the summer vacation.
17000	21000	Today is the first speaker, the speaker of the summer vacation program.
21000	23000	Today's speaker is Chen Xinhao.
23000	27000	He graduated from the Department of Atmospheric Engineering of NTU.
27000	31000	He is currently a doctoral student in the Department of Atmospheric Engineering of NTU.
31000	33000	He is about to graduate.
33000	35000	Wait a minute.
43000	48000	His interest is mainly in the hot zone area,
48000	49000	which is near Taiwan.
49000	55000	This is the analysis and simulation of the diagnosis of the weather phenomenon to the mid-level.
55000	58000	Then there is a special thing that everyone in Taiwan is very familiar with.
58000	62000	Disastrous weather such as typhoons or heat currents after noon.
62000	66000	In terms of method, it is mainly used for numerical and weather forecasts.
66000	75000	Then he can provide this simulation to give a fixed amount of precipitation forecast and assessment.
76000	83000	In addition to the research part, Chen Xinhao is a very good friend of mine for more than 10 years.
83000	87000	We were classmates of the Taita Bicycle Club.
87000	90000	He had a very famous feature when he was on the club.
90000	93000	He is a human weather forecaster.
93000	95000	It is very important to the bicycle club.
95000	97000	So let's listen to him today.
97000	102000	How did he become an atmospheric scientist from a human weather forecaster?
102000	104000	The method of numerical simulation.
104000	106000	The topic he often tells us is
106000	113000	Medium-Range Cloud Resolving Typhoon Rainfall Ensemble Forecast for Taiwan Through Time-Lagging Approach.
113000	114000	This topic is very long.
114000	118000	So I hope Xinhao can tell us what his Chinese vocabulary is.
118000	121000	Without further ado, let's applaud and welcome him.
124000	125000	Hello everyone.
125000	128000	I am Chen Xinhao, the speaker today.
128000	130000	You can call me Guige.
131000	134000	Maybe because when I report to the police,
134000	139000	The main setting is related fields of research.
139000	143000	So if there is something in the middle that you can't understand,
143000	146000	You can interrupt and ask.
146000	150000	Because today I will report to the previous seminar.
150000	154000	Then I will explain the name a little bit.
154000	156000	The topic I want to talk about today is
157000	163000	Medium-Range Cloud Resolving Typhoon Rainfall Ensemble Forecast for Taiwan Through Time-Lagging Approach.
163000	171000	This is what he came up with after I came in from the PhD class.
171000	183000	For Taiwan, there is a new typhoon forecast strategy.
184000	186000	Okay, I don't care.
186000	189000	Let's start with the first one.
195000	200000	In our country, typhoon and rainfall are extremely low.
200000	206000	Every year, there will be a large loss of all kinds of life.
206000	209000	Typhoon is the main cause of Taiwan's drop in water.
210000	215000	This is the typhoon in 2016.
215000	216000	From 26th to 29th.
216000	219000	This is the drop in water for 26 hours.
219000	225000	The amount of wind and rain they bring can be compared to Taiwan.
225000	232000	Anyway, the typhoon is an important drop in water in Taiwan.
232000	236000	In addition, Taiwan is different from other places.
236000	237000	Taiwan is not a high mountain.
237000	241000	When the typhoon passes, it will cause a terrible drop in wind and rain.
241000	246000	Taiwan also has a lot of people living in the mountains because of the underground population.
246000	248000	The map is a map of Taiwan's geography.
248000	253000	The black spot is the location of the Yuliang Station in Taiwan.
253000	257000	Because of the high mountains and the people living in the mountains,
257000	262000	These two characteristics of Taiwan cause the typhoon forecast.
262000	268000	The maximum drop in water will be higher than other places.
268000	274000	For example, mainland China.
274000	282000	These big countries will have a higher drop in water.
282000	290000	In the past, it was thought that the forecast limit was about three days.
291000	299000	It is generally thought that the area model forecasts more than 72 hours for numerical weather.
299000	307000	The following results are low in reference value.
307000	316000	Wang Teng conducted an 8-day drop in water forecast in cloud analysis mode.
316000	321000	We evaluated five typhoons in 2002 and two typhoons in 2013.
321000	323000	There are a total of six typhoons.
323000	331000	We found that the drop in water forecast is different from the above past.
331000	337000	We found that the drop in water forecast may be in 8 days or 4 days, 6 days, or 3 days.
337000	342000	These 10 days make a reference value drop in water forecast.
342000	345000	There is a conclusion in this paper.
345000	348000	Our path is different.
348000	353000	However, the drop in water forecast is still useful.
353000	362000	This paper is to break down the past.
362000	369000	Let me briefly introduce the current detailed forecast method.
369000	376000	The blue dot is the start time.
376000	380000	The blue dot is the start time.
380000	394000	The method of forecasting more than 10 years ago is to forecast 72 hours before the start time.
394000	400000	The current detailed forecast method is based on different physical parameters.
400000	408000	Based on different physical parameters, there are different rules.
408000	416000	Then make about 20 to 30 conditions and forecast for 3 days.
416000	422000	The drop in water time for this target will be about 20 to 30 days.
423000	435000	The picture on the bottom right is a detailed forecast result for the 2013 Kaohsiung typhoon.
435000	440000	The blue dot is a detailed member.
440000	446000	The forecast is different.
446000	450000	The middle is a detailed black line.
451000	457000	The result of the current detailed forecast is like this.
457000	462000	Let me briefly introduce the difference.
462000	471000	As mentioned earlier, they divided all the calculation resources into 20 parts.
471000	477000	The concept of the difference in detail is that I put 20 parts of the forecast resources in the same place.
477000	482000	Then I increase the frequency and increase the forecast range.
482000	485000	I only run single mode.
485000	491000	And I have a forecast of 8 days.
491000	499000	Then every 6 hours, the start time will increase by about 6 hours.
500000	509000	In this way, there will be more than 20 members for the target time.
509000	511000	This is the difference in detail.
511000	514000	It's a little different from the current forecast.
520000	526000	Because it's regional mode, the maximum level is the same.
526000	528000	There are also 24 members.
528000	531000	The forecast range is about this.
531000	533000	Then the X-17 forecast.
533000	535000	The cloud analysis X-17 forecast.
535000	538000	The forecast range is about the red box.
538000	543000	Then the distance between the two networks.
543000	546000	Its resolution is higher.
546000	548000	The forecast range is larger.
548000	553000	The length of the forecast is also longer.
553000	557000	I forgot to show my little arrow.
557000	565000	The members of Ensembl will be used in a while.
565000	572000	And the calculation resources they use are about 1500 core systems.
572000	576000	It's all about 1500 core systems.
577000	582000	In other words, it can do this.
582000	584000	I raise the resolution.
584000	586000	I raise the forecast range.
586000	588000	The length of the forecast is also longer.
588000	591000	Then there are about the same number of members.
591000	593000	Then use the same data.
597000	602000	In the model, we use the Japanese National University developed
602000	604000	X-17 forecast mode.
606000	610000	It is a non-linear model.
612000	616000	The key is that there is no linearization.
616000	620000	The original physics is the same process.
620000	628000	On the right is the conversion method of its six waterfalls.
628000	631000	There are all kinds of models.
632000	635000	Hello, Gui, can you hear me?
635000	638000	The first example I explain is that.
638000	641000	In 2013.
641000	647000	The bottom left is the final path of the Central Meteorological Bureau.
647000	656000	The red box is the original X-17 forecast range.
656000	665000	The top right is the observation waterfall from August 29th to 30th.
665000	675000	The bottom right is the forecast a few days ago.
675000	678000	It's about this time, the observation time.
678000	682000	The color bar is the waterfall.
682000	687000	You can see that after the meteorological conditions are strong.
687000	697000	The path is very similar to what it did a day ago.
697000	703000	Its strength is weak.
703000	708000	But it is a strong deterrent.
709000	718000	This picture is the forecast from August 22nd.
718000	723000	For the target time, from August 29th to 30th.
723000	731000	You can see that the forecast can be calculated from August 22nd.
732000	736000	When the meteorological conditions are weak.
736000	740000	You can tell the disaster prevention unit.
740000	749000	There may be more than 311 waterfalls in the south.
749000	752000	Maybe you don't know 311.
752000	760000	311 is about the same size as Yanda Waterfall in Pingting.
760000	764000	Because the weather conditions are different.
764000	767000	The weather forecast is different.
767000	773000	So the result is good or bad.
773000	776000	Some results are better.
776000	786000	Some results are not the observed weather forecast.
786000	793000	So the meteorological conditions will be observed.
793000	802000	After August 24th, the meteorological conditions will be observed.
802000	806000	The meteorological conditions will be observed.
806000	810000	This method is based on.
810000	813000	Before a lot of days.
813000	818000	It can provide the meteorological conditions of the disaster prevention unit.
818000	820000	Provide meteorological conditions.
820000	824000	Then it will be on August 26th.
824000	826000	On August 18th.
826000	830000	It will be 5 kilometers below zero.
830000	831000	24 members.
831000	833000	It will provide.
833000	835000	This is their detailed frequency.
835000	837000	The detailed frequency of 24 members.
838000	840000	After 24 reports.
840000	843000	Add their water.
843000	845000	Then.
845000	847000	They are like this.
847000	849000	The other is the poured water.
849000	851000	Although the progress is similar.
851000	854000	But the results are different.
856000	857000	Then.
857000	858000	Yes.
863000	864000	Add.
864000	865000	Hello.
865000	866000	Hello.
868000	869000	Then.
869000	871000	In the last few days.
871000	872000	Add water.
872000	873000	More and more.
877000	878000	Then this is.
878000	880000	Meteorological weather forecast.
880000	881000	For a strong typhoon.
881000	883000	On the 29th and 30th.
883000	884000	Then the lower right corner.
884000	885000	This is.
885000	886000	You can see.
886000	887000	No. 22.
887000	888000	Black.
888000	889000	No. 23.
889000	890000	Green.
890000	891000	Different time.
891000	892000	Hello.
892000	893000	Did you hear that?
894000	895000	Typhoon warning.
895000	896000	Then black.
896000	897000	This is.
897000	898000	Joint.
898000	899000	With us.
899000	900000	Complete.
900000	902000	They made it.
902000	904000	Best warning.
904000	905000	Before.
906000	907000	Then.
907000	908000	The above group.
908000	909000	Is.
909000	910000	No. 22.
910000	911000	No. 22.
911000	912000	No. 22.
912000	913000	Their.
913000	914000	Forecast.
914000	915000	For this forecast.
915000	916000	The water situation.
917000	918000	Ok.
918000	919000	Then.
919000	920000	You may say.
920000	921000	Ok.
921000	922000	Give me so many situations.
922000	923000	Then how do I use.
925000	926000	The water system.
928000	929000	Ok.
929000	930000	From the water system.
930000	931000	We can see.
932000	933000	This refers to.
934000	935000	The leftmost.
935000	936000	This is the leftmost.
936000	937000	Then this is the leftmost.
937000	938000	Then the largest.
939000	940000	Then.
941000	942000	Typhoon.
942000	943000	Out.
943000	944000	There is also.
944000	945000	The most famous.
946000	947000	There will be the most famous.
948000	949000	Then.
949000	950000	There is also.
950000	951000	Of course.
951000	952000	Through Taiwan.
952000	953000	That is.
954000	955000	The epidemic situation.
955000	956000	There is no flood in Taiwan.
957000	958000	Then.
958000	959000	There will be.
959000	960000	With.
960000	961000	With.
961000	962000	With the government of the United States.
963000	964000	He is.
964000	965000	In.
965000	966000	Five days.
966000	967000	Or.
967000	968000	Five days ago.
968000	969000	He will provide.
969000	970000	Such.
971000	972000	The water situation.
972000	973000	For example.
973000	974000	If this typhoon.
974000	975000	If it is.
975000	976000	On the left.
976000	977000	He will.
977000	978000	He will.
978000	979000	Taiwan.
979000	980000	May.
980000	981000	Pingtung.
981000	982000	Erlangbi.
982000	983000	In.
983000	984000	Such.
984000	985000	The water situation.
986000	987000	If it is.
987000	988000	On the right.
988000	989000	The water.
989000	990000	May.
990000	991000	Occur.
991000	992000	On the north coast.
992000	993000	If.
993000	994000	I.
994000	995000	Fortunately.
995000	996000	Landed in Taiwan.
996000	997000	Then.
997000	998000	Zhongfu Mountain Area.
998000	999000	Dangerous.
999000	1000000	Will be in Zhongfu Mountain Area.
1000000	1001000	If.
1001000	1002000	Go.
1002000	1003000	Is.
1003000	1004000	He will.
1004000	1005000	Will.
1005000	1006000	There will be different.
1006000	1007000	Paths.
1007000	1008000	Then.
1008000	1009000	Provide.
1009000	1010000	The most dangerous.
1010000	1011000	Of course.
1011000	1012000	No. 22.
1012000	1013000	No. 8.
1013000	1014000	No. 22.
1014000	1015000	Because.
1015000	1016000	These two.
1016000	1017000	The water situation.
1017000	1018000	Will be.
1018000	1019000	Free.
1019000	1020000	Then.
1020000	1021000	As time goes by.
1021000	1022000	Then.
1022000	1023000	The water.
1023000	1024000	Because.
1024000	1025000	Not sure.
1025000	1026000	Typhoon.
1026000	1027000	What is it called?
1027000	1028000	Butterfly effect.
1028000	1029000	Is.
1029000	1030000	The longer.
1030000	1031000	Then.
1031000	1032000	The error will be magnified.
1032000	1033000	Then.
1033000	1034000	The closer the time.
1034000	1035000	The error.
1035000	1036000	Is getting smaller and smaller.
1036000	1037000	So.
1037000	1038000	This typhoon.
1038000	1039000	Road.
1039000	1040000	Handling.
1040000	1041000	Then.
1041000	1042000	The water situation.
1042000	1043000	Handling.
1043000	1044000	Then.
1044000	1045000	You can find out.
1045000	1046000	Oh.
1046000	1047000	He.
1047000	1048000	Road.
1048000	1049000	Handling.

1265000	1266000	Other than
1267000	1268000	This.
1268000	1269000	Because the left side
1269000	1270760	expect it to have a
1270760	1272000	trend
1272000	1273000	other than
1273000	1274000	the left
1274000	1275000	5km
1275000	1276000	24 layers
1277000	1279000	Every importance
1282000	1284000	Besides
1284000	1285000	We just mentioned
1285000	1287000	Temperature drop in 24 hours
1287000	1288000	If I put the drop in time
1288000	1289800	up to 48 hours
1289800	1291800	In fact, the Kangrui Typhoon
1292800	1294800	Drop in 48 hours
1294800	1296800	Then we color bar
1296800	1298800	300 to 1500
1298800	1300800	Then its value is about
1300800	1301800	700 or so
1301800	1302800	742
1302800	1303800	That
1304800	1305800	I don't know if this typhoon
1305800	1306800	Do you have any impression
1306800	1307800	This typhoon is
1308800	1310800	Lai Ching-Ting's mayor
1310800	1312800	When he was the mayor
1312800	1313800	He was in Tainan
1314800	1316800	He used to
1316800	1317800	Before this typhoon
1317800	1319800	He was called God Lai
1320800	1321800	Then
1321800	1323800	Then
1323800	1325800	His god place
1325800	1326800	It's written on it
1326800	1328800	I think I'm going to take a vacation
1328800	1329800	Then Ching-Ting said
1329800	1330800	I don't want to take a vacation
1330800	1331800	Then
1331800	1332800	Then the next day
1332800	1333800	No wind, no rain
1333800	1335800	He became God Lai
1335800	1336800	What about this typhoon
1336800	1338800	He did the same thing
1338800	1342800	Then he fell from the mountain
1342800	1343800	I don't know if you have any impression
1343800	1345800	On this matter
1345800	1346800	This typhoon
1346800	1347800	Then this typhoon in Tainan
1347800	1349800	It's raining a lot
1349800	1350800	Then salt water
1350800	1351800	Then
1352800	1354800	Lai Ching-Ting insisted
1354800	1355800	You have to go to work
1355800	1356800	So
1356800	1358800	It's pretty bad
1358800	1359800	it is good
1359800	1360800	That
1360800	1361800	So
1361800	1363800	The precipitation in 48 hours
1363800	1365800	It's the same on August 23
1365800	1366800	That is
1366800	1367800	Six days ago
1368800	1369800	He can have
1369800	1371800	Precipitation
1371800	1372800	Then
1372800	1373800	Of course
1373800	1374800	Some precipitation
1374800	1375800	Some precipitation
1375800	1377800	Have been grasped
1377800	1379800	The one who ran away in the middle
1379800	1381800	Did not grasp
1381800	1382800	Precipitation
1382800	1384800	But he had a trend
1384800	1385800	Uh
1385800	1386800	Excessive at first
1386800	1387800	Then again
1387800	1388800	Uh
1388800	1390800	The big environmental trend is
1390800	1393800	This typhoon may not affect Taiwan
1393800	1395800	But gradually came back
1395800	1396800	Tell him
1396800	1397800	Oh, this typhoon
1399800	1401800	May really affect Taiwan
1401800	1403800	Then
1403800	1405800	A day ago
1405800	1407800	Three days in advance
1407800	1408800	And tell you
1408800	1409800	Uh
1410800	1411800	Typhoon
1411800	1412800	It looks like this
1412800	1413800	Then
1413800	1414800	Typhoon
1414800	1415800	Here
1415800	1416800	More than 200
1418800	1419800	That
1419800	1420800	His shortcoming is
1423800	1424800	Your mechanism
1424800	1425800	Can't grasp
1427800	1428800	Then he can't
1428800	1429800	In many days
1429800	1430800	Provide
1430800	1431800	Uh
1431800	1432800	The trend of precipitation
1432800	1433800	Uh
1434800	1435800	It's raining
1435800	1436800	It's raining
1436800	1437800	Gradually
1437800	1438800	Uh
1438800	1439800	One by one
1439800	1440800	It's raining
1441800	1442800	I think the model
1442800	1444800	Should go in this direction
1444800	1445800	I think he
1445800	1446800	He can't provide such
1447800	1448800	Uh
1451800	1452800	That two days
1453800	1454800	Result
1455800	1456800	Can
1456800	1457800	That is
1457800	1458800	Five or six days ago
1458800	1459800	Provide such precipitation
1459800	1460800	Then
1460800	1461800	Then
1461800	1462800	The typhoon
1462800	1463800	Three or four days
1463800	1464800	Provide such precipitation
1464800	1465800	One or two days
1465800	1466800	Uh
1466800	1467800	Collect
1467800	1468800	Should be
1468800	1469800	Five kilometers per hour
1469800	1470800	Twenty-four meters
1470800	1471800	He
1471800	1472800	There is no way to go
1472800	1473800	That
1473800	1474800	If for
1474800	1475800	It will rain for three days
1475800	1476800	Uh
1476800	1477800	The example I chose here is
1477800	1478800	Typhoon Morak
1478800	1479800	That
1479800	1480800	Morak is a typhoon
1480800	1481800	He actually
1482800	1483800	In 2019
1483800	1484800	Typhoon
1484800	1485800	The typhoon
1485800	1486800	Uh
1486800	1487800	The most famous thing
1487800	1488800	Is
1488800	1489800	In the small village
1490800	1491800	Right
1491800	1492800	That
1492800	1493800	What about this method
1493800	1494800	Uh
1494800	1495800	But
1495800	1496800	Let's talk about it first
1496800	1497800	This technology
1497800	1498800	There was no such thing at that time
1498800	1499800	And
1499800	1500800	There was no such thing at that time
1500800	1501800	Calculation resource
1502800	1503800	Now this
1503800	1504800	Calculation resource
1504800	1506800	Gradually increasing
1506800	1508800	He can use this way
1509800	1510800	That
1511800	1512800	If
1512800	1513800	I
1513800	1514800	I am
1514800	1515800	Only three days
1516800	1517800	If this typhoon
1517800	1518800	Just three days
1518800	1519800	That is
1519800	1520800	He can't provide
1521800	1522800	Everyone is
1522800	1523800	Oh
1523800	1524800	He must be
1525800	1526800	After it started
1526800	1527800	He told me
1527800	1528800	Oh this mode
1528800	1529800	Three days
1530800	1531800	He rained
1531800	1532800	Will
1532800	1533800	Become
1533800	1534800	How
1534800	1535800	This typhoon
1535800	1536800	Observed in
1537800	1538800	Taiwan's Zhongpu Mountain Area
1538800	1540800	More than 1,500 kilometers
1540800	1542800	The value is about 2,000
1543800	1544800	But
1544800	1545800	If I forecast eight days
1546800	1547800	There is a way
1547800	1548800	For the next three days
1549800	1550800	Preliminary forecast
1551800	1552800	That
1552800	1553800	Because my show in front
1554800	1555800	He is a weather forecast
1555800	1556800	With five kilometers
1556800	1557800	That now
1557800	1558800	I can't fix it
1558800	1559800	Because they
1559800	1560800	Can't do it
1561800	1563800	If he only forecasts three days
1563800	1564800	Then
1564800	1565800	Here's a little conclusion
1565800	1566800	Is
1566800	1567800	In general
1567800	1568800	He is a weather forecast
1568800	1569800	Can be called
1569800	1570800	The current weather forecast
1571800	1572800	Earlier
1572800	1573800	Provide
1573800	1574800	Damage
1574800	1575800	That's it
1576800	1577800	If the rainfall
1577800	1578800	The rainfall time
1578800	1579800	Longer
1579800	1580800	One day
1580800	1581800	Half a day
1581800	1582800	Two days
1582800	1583800	Three days
1583800	1584800	So if the rainfall time is long
1584800	1586800	It increases the possibility of dust
1586800	1587800	That way
1587800	1588800	Just call
1588800	1589800	Current
1590800	1591800	More useful
1594800	1595800	Then
1595800	1597800	I want to talk about another typhoon
1597800	1598800	Is the Subing typhoon
1599800	1600800	That
1600800	1601800	Hello
1601800	1602800	The typhoon
1602800	1603800	In
1603800	1604800	Because
1605800	1606800	I
1606800	1607800	Can you hear me
1609800	1611800	This is a strong typhoon
1611800	1612800	Then
1613800	1614800	Observation room
1615800	1616800	24 hours
1616800	1617800	Then he is very powerful
1617800	1618800	Is in
1618800	1619800	Uh
1619800	1620800	Hsinchu Miaoli Mountain Area
1620800	1621800	About 1500
1621800	1622800	800
1622800	1624800	876 meters
1624800	1625800	About water
1629800	1630800	That
1630800	1631800	This typhoon
1631800	1633800	His strength is stronger
1633800	1635800	Then he can be in 20 hours
1635800	1636800	More than 800 meters
1636800	1637800	Water
1638800	1639800	Then
1639800	1640800	What's next
1640800	1641800	Just tell everyone
1641800	1642800	Uh
1642800	1643800	His name is
1643800	1644800	M01 M02
1644800	1645800	Is
1646800	1647800	Uh
1647800	1648800	Uh, let me mention it first
1648800	1649800	Because we
1649800	1651800	The laboratory also provides
1653800	1654800	TTFR
1654800	1657800	Typhoon flood research center
1657800	1658800	Then they
1658800	1659800	In charge of running this
1660800	1661800	Typhoon forecast
1662800	1663800	They have members
1663800	1664800	Then
1664800	1666800	Every school has to provide
1666800	1667800	Not every school
1667800	1668800	Must provide
1668800	1669800	Some schools are interested
1669800	1670800	Will provide some
1670800	1671800	Typhoon results
1671800	1673800	Then put it in this
1673800	1674800	Then for everyone's reference
1675800	1676800	That
1677800	1678800	Simply put
1678800	1680800	This is the typhoon forecast
1680800	1681800	M01
1681800	1682800	M02
1683800	1684800	Then
1684800	1685800	Uh
1686800	1688800	Shida also provides a member
1688800	1689800	M17
1691800	1692800	That
1692800	1693800	Basically he
1693800	1694800	Every member is
1694800	1695800	5 km
1696800	1697800	But only M17
1698800	1699800	With me below
1699800	1701800	This is the typhoon forecast
1701800	1702800	Made
1702800	1703800	Typhoon forecast
1703800	1704800	That can be seen
1704800	1705800	Uh
1705800	1706800	In fact, every result
1707800	1708800	The situation is different
1710800	1711800	Then my red box
1711800	1712800	Is
1712800	1713800	Means
1713800	1714800	Uh
1714800	1716800	Typhoon
1716800	1717800	More than 700
1717800	1718800	More than 700
1719800	1720800	Because
1720800	1721800	I'm in a lot of
1721800	1723800	I also talked about it in my video
1723800	1725800	Taiwan because of heavy rainfall
1725800	1726800	Mountain area
1726800	1727800	So
1727800	1728800	The water level
1728800	1729800	Exploded
1730800	1731800	Very serious
1731800	1732800	For example, if my water level
1732800	1733800	Exploded 310
1733800	1734800	That
1734800	1735800	Everyone knows
1735800	1736800	That is probably
1736800	1737800	Go down
1737800	1738800	Go down the mountain area
1740800	1741800	But if the mountain area
1741800	1742800	700-800 meters
1742800	1743800	Down
1743800	1744800	Water
1744800	1745800	That might be
1745800	1746800	A disaster
1748800	1749800	That is
1749800	1750800	That
1750800	1751800	5 km resolution
1751800	1752800	Can be calculated
1752800	1753800	That is
1753800	1754800	About 24 members
1756800	1757800	More than two-thirds
1757800	1758800	Did not explode
1758800	1759800	Uh
1759800	1760800	Water level
1760800	1761800	But in 2.5 km
1763800	1764800	Members
1764800	1765800	Just
1765800	1766800	There is a way to explode
1768800	1770800	That is also for this typhoon
1771800	1773800	Just change different timing
1774800	1775800	Then my initial time
1775800	1776800	Is always
1776800	1777800	In
1778800	1779800	Close
1779800	1780800	This observation time
1781800	1782800	So
1782800	1783800	You can see that
1783800	1784800	Is
1784800	1785800	The result will be more and more
1785800	1786800	Closer observation
1788800	1789800	But one thing
1789800	1790800	Has not changed
1790800	1791800	Uh
1791800	1792800	5 km resolution
1792800	1793800	Members
1793800	1794800	N01 N02
1794800	1795800	And so on
1796800	1797800	Then in addition to N17
1797800	1798800	They explode
1798800	1799800	This kind of
1802800	1803800	possibility
1803800	1804800	Not so much
1805800	1806800	Then he
1806800	1807800	This explosion
1807800	1808800	Strange
1808800	1809800	I do not know why it looks like this
1810800	1811800	933
1812800	1813800	It looks like this
1816800	1817800	Then the time of the experiment
1818800	1819800	The same is 2.5 km
1819800	1820800	He can master the water level
1821800	1822800	That
1822800	1823800	5 km members
1823800	1824800	There is no way
1825800	1826800	But the time of the experiment
1826800	1828800	Everyone is getting closer
1829800	1830800	But
1830800	1831800	Now there should be half
1831800	1832800	Explode the water level
1832800	1833800	That
1833800	1834800	Then everyone thinks
1834800	1835800	Oh
1835800	1836800	We may
1836800	1837800	Really
1837800	1838800	Will be so much
1842800	1843800	Then I am here as a lady
1843800	1844800	Is
1844800	1845800	There are two sentences
1845800	1846800	I said before
1846800	1847800	That
1847800	1849800	Because my understanding is improved
1850800	1851800	Can explode the water level
1853800	1854800	That
1854800	1855800	These things are
1856800	1857800	Uh
1857800	1858800	What I did a few years ago
1858800	1859800	That
1860800	1861800	He is
1861800	1862800	Will be a
1862800	1863800	Effective way
1863800	1864800	But he also has a
1865800	1866800	Uh
1866800	1867800	The problem is
1867800	1868800	Say
1868800	1869800	Hey
1869800	1870800	That
1870800	1871800	I just talked a lot
1871800	1872800	That is to say
1872800	1873800	Oh
1873800	1874800	If it's on the left
1874800	1875800	The water level is
1875800	1876800	That
1876800	1877800	On the right
1877800	1878800	The water level is
1878800	1879800	That
1879800	1880800	Before I have this black observation
1880800	1881800	Before
1881800	1882800	How do I know
1883800	1884800	The path is right
1884800	1885800	Which path
1885800	1886800	Your reference value is higher
1887800	1888800	Then you tell me
1888800	1889800	Say
1889800	1890800	Oh
1890800	1891800	So recently
1891800	1892800	The trend is
1892800	1893800	The more to the middle
1894800	1895800	The more to the back
1895800	1896800	The closer the time
1896800	1897800	The water level
1897800	1898800	The closer
1898800	1899800	Will be more like
1900800	1901800	So
1901800	1902800	I'll just watch the last one
1904800	1905800	So
1905800	1906800	What I'm doing now
1906800	1907800	That is
1907800	1908800	Uh
1908800	1909800	If the observation comes in
1911800	1912800	I use
1912800	1913800	Machine learning method
1913800	1914800	He can judge that
1915800	1916800	Hey
1916800	1917800	On the left
1917800	1918800	These exposed
1918800	1919800	Observation
1919800	1920800	Far
1920800	1921800	So they
1922800	1923800	Uh
1923800	1925800	The machine will learn
1925800	1926800	Oh
1926800	1927800	Their credibility
1927800	1928800	Lower
1928800	1929800	That
1929800	1930800	These on the right
1930800	1931800	The credibility is lower
1931800	1932800	That
1932800	1933800	The method I use now
1933800	1934800	Can give
1934800	1935800	He
1935800	1936800	Every
1936800	1937800	Pre-report member
1937800	1938800	His
1939800	1940800	Uh
1940800	1941800	Water level score
1941800	1942800	That is to say
1942800	1943800	Hey
1943800	1944800	I 2618
1944800	1945800	This report
1945800	1946800	His water level score
1946800	1947800	May be
1947800	1948800	70 points
1948800	1949800	This may be
1949800	1950800	60 points
1950800	1951800	That
1951800	1952800	May be too far
1952800	1953800	Because he is too far from the observation
1953800	1954800	So he
1954800	1955800	Water level score
1955800	1956800	With
1956800	1957800	2 points
1957800	1958800	Something like this
1958800	1959800	Let's make an example
1960800	1961800	That this is
1961800	1962800	What I'm doing now
1962800	1963800	That
1965800	1966800	Uh
1966800	1967800	Because
1967800	1968800	Because machine learning
1968800	1969800	He needs more
1972800	1973800	Cases
1973800	1974800	So
1974800	1975800	I have run a lot of
1975800	1976800	Is
1976800	1977800	Recently
1977800	1978800	Keep running
1978800	1979800	Run more cases
1979800	1980800	Want to give
1980800	1981800	Uh
1981800	1982800	Computer
1982800	1983800	More things to learn
1983800	1984800	Recently
1984800	1985800	Keep doing
1985800	1986800	Such a thing
1986800	1987800	That
1990800	1991800	That why
1991800	1992800	Uh
1992800	1993800	What is that
1993800	1994800	Why
1994800	1995800	The machine's forecast can't do this
1996800	1997800	Because they
1997800	1998800	No
1999800	2000800	Six days ago
2000800	2001800	No five days ago
2001800	2002800	No four days ago
2002800	2004800	The captain is three days
2004800	2006800	So they can't
2006800	2007800	Use this method
2007800	2008800	To support the forecast
2008800	2009800	Then give out
2009800	2010800	Each
2010800	2011800	Score
2012800	2013800	That
2013800	2014800	The last one
2014800	2015800	Is
2015800	2016800	Because we
2016800	2017800	This method has
2017800	2018800	Past
2018800	2019800	Forecast results
2019800	2020800	So we can use
2020800	2021800	Objective method
2021800	2022800	To
2022800	2023800	Guide us
2023800	2024800	That
2024800	2026800	My report today
2026800	2027800	Is
2027800	2028800	Probably this
2028800	2029800	About this
2029800	2030800	Then
2031800	2032800	Uh
2032800	2033800	Just
2033800	2034800	Report to everyone
2034800	2036800	I don't know if everyone has any questions
2036800	2037800	Like this
2043800	2044800	Can you hear me
2049800	2051800	Can anyone hear me
2054800	2055800	Oh
2055800	2056800	Can hear
2058800	2059800	I found a very serious problem
2061800	2062800	Because
2062800	2063800	Without turning on
2063800	2064800	He didn't
2064800	2065800	No
2065800	2066800	No sound
2066800	2067800	So I just
2067800	2068800	If you didn't speak
2068800	2069800	I didn't hear it
2069800	2070800	Oh ok
2070800	2071800	So you can hear it now
2071800	2072800	Yes yes I can hear it now
2073800	2075800	I don't know if you interrupted me in the middle
2075800	2076800	Have
2076800	2077800	I tried a few times
2077800	2078800	But it doesn't matter
2078800	2079800	I just want to ask a question
2079800	2080800	That
2080800	2081800	Ok
2081800	2082800	Does everyone have a question
2085800	2086800	If there is no problem
2086800	2087800	I ask one first
2087800	2088800	Just
2088800	2089800	You are running this
2089800	2090800	Ensemble time
2090800	2091800	You said you ran
2091800	2092800	More than 20
2092800	2093800	More than 30
2093800	2094800	Their
2094800	2095800	Initial conditions
2095800	2096800	Is it all
2096800	2097800	Is it exactly the same
2097800	2098800	Or
2098800	2099800	You will use some
2099800	2100800	For example, observe
2101800	2102800	The actual inaccuracy
2102800	2103800	Go
2103800	2104800	Go
2104800	2105800	That is to say
2105800	2106800	To slightly disrupt
2106800	2107800	His initial conditions
2107800	2108800	Then let him run
2109800	2110800	You said that way
2110800	2111800	Is it
2111800	2112800	Oh
2113800	2114800	Uh
2114800	2115800	In that way
2115800	2116800	The difference is
2116800	2117800	Different
2119800	2120800	The initial time is different
2121800	2122800	Because
2122800	2123800	Uh
2123800	2124800	To put it simply
2124800	2125800	Uh
2125800	2126800	For example, this is the 7th
2127800	2128800	Assuming it's the 22nd
2128800	2129800	Okay
2129800	2130800	After 6 hours
2130800	2131800	He will have different
2133800	2134800	That is to say
2134800	2135800	I
2135800	2136800	8 o'clock in the morning
2136800	2137800	Start forecasting
2137800	2138800	Then
2138800	2139800	This is
2139800	2140800	2 o'clock in the afternoon
2141800	2142800	The initial conditions of the two
2142800	2143800	Is different
2143800	2144800	So
2144800	2145800	The result they caused
2146800	2147800	Is the same
2147800	2148800	He didn't
2148800	2149800	Add any
2149800	2150800	Disturbance
2150800	2151800	Like this
2151800	2152800	Oh so you won't say
2152800	2153800	To slightly disrupt
2153800	2154800	I mean
2154800	2155800	For example, for example
2155800	2156800	What is your air pressure
2156800	2157800	What is the temperature
2157800	2158800	Then
2158800	2159800	For example, your air pressure is
2159800	2160800	1
2160800	2161800	Oh no
2161800	2162800	No no
2162800	2163800	The temperature is 30 degrees
2163800	2164800	You are 30
2164800	2165800	Then add a
2165800	2167800	Random constant
2167800	2168800	That constant is
2168800	2169800	Is
2169800	2170800	For example, minus 0.2
2170800	2171800	Something like that
2171800	2173800	Then let the random number add
2173800	2174800	because
2174800	2175800	Originally you measured
2175800	2176800	There will be
2176800	2177800	Uncertainty
2177800	2178800	Still not
2178800	2179800	You are
2179800	2180800	These things are fixed
2180800	2181800	Is a very certain number
2181800	2182800	Enter
2182800	2183800	Yes
2183800	2184800	What is the number it predicts
2184800	2185800	I put it in
2185800	2186800	Just like this
2186800	2187800	Because
2187800	2188800	Because because
2188800	2189800	Because one
2190800	2191800	Run a round every six hours
2191800	2192800	So i don't need
2192800	2193800	Do
2193800	2194800	Such action
2195800	2196800	That
2196800	2197800	Typical ensemble
2197800	2198800	He
2198800	2199800	Can use this technology
2199800	2200800	That
2201800	2202800	The result
2204800	2205800	The result is
2206800	2207800	Some of them
2207800	2208800	Members are
2208800	2209800	Use this method
2209800	2210800	This method
2211800	2212800	Made
2212800	2213800	Uh-huh
2216800	2217800	Then
2217800	2218800	Yes
2218800	2219800	I have another question
2219800	2220800	Just
2220800	2221800	There was a show in front of you
2221800	2222800	Say
2222800	2223800	You are now
2223800	2224800	Typically running these things
2224800	2225800	Are using
2225800	2226800	One or two thousand cores
2226800	2227800	right
2227800	2228800	Correct
2229800	2230800	OK
2230800	2231800	That
2232800	2233800	You think
2233800	2234800	This
2234800	2235800	Computation
2235800	2236800	This hardware
2236800	2237800	Restriction
2237800	2238800	Is
2238800	2239800	Is
2239800	2240800	Main
2240800	2241800	Accuracy
2241800	2242800	Restriction
2242800	2243800	Just say
2243800	2245800	For example, I will give you 5000 cores
2245800	2246800	Can you do it
2246800	2247800	Obviously better
2249800	2250800	Uh
2250800	2251800	Mainly
2251800	2252800	Maybe this model
2252800	2253800	He wrote
2253800	2254800	Is that
2254800	2255800	He
2255800	2256800	Must be distributed
2256800	2257800	1500
2257800	2258800	After parallel computing
2258800	2260800	He has to combine again
2262800	2263800	Just take it apart
2263800	2264800	And stick it up
2264800	2265800	Is that he will divide
2265800	2266800	These two actions
2266800	2267800	Uh-huh
2267800	2268800	That
2268800	2269800	1500
2270800	2271800	Core
2271800	2272800	When you want to stick it up
2272800	2273800	Is actually
2273800	2275800	It also takes a lot of time
2275800	2276800	Uh-huh
2276800	2278800	Let's say it becomes 5000
2279800	2280800	Maybe he is
2281800	2282800	Parallel computing
2282800	2283800	He will double
2283800	2285800	But he is stuck
2285800	2286800	May increase
2286800	2287800	Much
2290800	2292800	So actually the biggest difference
2293800	2294800	OK
2294800	2295800	So actually the biggest difference
2295800	2296800	Still your
2296800	2297800	That
2297800	2299800	The logic behind that thing
2299800	2300800	Is your algorithm
2300800	2301800	Like you want
2301800	2302800	How do you sign your grid
2302800	2304800	Then what do you want to resolve
2304800	2306800	Then how do you arrange your time
2310800	2311800	I
2311800	2312800	I think
2312800	2313800	Just now
2314800	2315800	Because i don't
2316800	2318800	I have no ability to change the mode
2319800	2320800	Then
2320800	2321800	So my current use
2321800	2322800	Test result
2322800	2324800	Probably use this
2324800	2325800	Core number
2325800	2326800	He is
2326800	2327800	Uh
2327800	2329800	In the forecast result
2329800	2330800	With
2330800	2331800	The time of use
2331800	2332800	Is
2332800	2333800	Is balanced
2333800	2334800	Because actually
2334800	2335800	The number of days to forecast
2335800	2336800	He
2336800	2337800	Must be
2337800	2338800	Must be effective
2339800	2340800	You can't be
2340800	2341800	Uh
2341800	2342800	For example, I can
2342800	2343800	20,000 core
2343800	2344800	Then run
2344800	2345800	The range is global
2345800	2347800	Then the efficiency is super high
2347800	2348800	But he ran
2348800	2349800	The typhoon is not raining
2349800	2350800	Yes yes yes
2350800	2351800	The typhoon is not raining
2351800	2352800	Then there is no
2352800	2353800	No problem
2353800	2354800	He
2354800	2355800	Uh
2355800	2356800	Is my
2356800	2357800	My design is
2357800	2358800	Uh
2358800	2359800	Stabilize time and efficiency
2359800	2360800	Then
2360800	2361800	Uh
2361800	2362800	Stabilize resolution
2362800	2363800	Then
2363800	2364800	Stabilize strength
2364800	2365800	Then he is
2365800	2366800	I think
2366800	2367800	After evaluation
2367800	2368800	I think
2368800	2369800	Very balanced
2369800	2370800	A more balanced design
2371800	2373800	Then increase or decrease
2373800	2374800	I think
2375800	2376800	That's what I just explained
2376800	2377800	Say
2377800	2378800	Because he needs you
2379800	2380800	After evenly distributed
2380800	2381800	He has to be united
2381800	2382800	Then when united
2382800	2383800	because
2383800	2384800	Japan
2384800	2385800	Japan National University
2385800	2386800	Their design
2386800	2387800	Use a core
2387800	2388800	To do
2388800	2390800	Combination action
2391800	2392800	That
2392800	2393800	Maybe in the future
2394800	2395800	Will also
2395800	2396800	I am
2396800	2397800	I want to say
2397800	2399800	I want to talk to them all day
2399800	2400800	You
2400800	2401800	It seems like
2402800	2403800	No
2403800	2404800	I
2404800	2405800	I want to talk to them later
2406800	2407800	OK
2407800	2408800	Hurry up
2409800	2410800	OK
2412800	2413800	Any other questions
2413800	2414800	I can do
2414800	2415800	I see
2418800	2419800	Does anyone have
2419800	2420800	Any other questions
2420800	2421800	Because I
2421800	2422800	In fact, I can ask a lot of questions
2422800	2423800	I think it's quite interesting
2423800	2424800	I have a lot of questions
2424800	2425800	But
2425800	2426800	Let's let others ask
2426800	2427800	Does anyone have any questions?
2434800	2435800	No one has a problem?
2435800	2436800	Or
2437800	2438800	Or you still can't hear me
2438800	2439800	Because I can hear it
2440800	2441800	Yes, because I can hear it
2441800	2442800	OK
2443800	2444800	Then I have another question
2444800	2445800	My question is
2445800	2447800	About machine learning
2448800	2449800	Yes
2449800	2450800	I'm not sure you
2455800	2456800	You are
2456800	2457800	Someone has a problem
2457800	2458800	But
2460800	2461800	You speak
2461800	2462800	I didn't hear you
2465800	2466800	The microphone is on
2466800	2467800	But
2467800	2468800	necessary
2470800	2471800	The more necessary
2471800	2472800	The more necessary
2472800	2473800	In fact, I don't know how to read
2474800	2475800	OK
2475800	2477800	Yes, we didn't hear your voice
2477800	2478800	You can type it
2488800	2489800	I heard it
2492800	2493800	I can't hear it again
2493800	2494800	No sound
2496800	2498800	I think you can type it
2500800	2501800	His question is
2501800	2502800	He asked
2502800	2504800	Double typhoon forecast
2504800	2507800	What is the difference between single forecast and double typhoon forecast?
2511800	2512800	Double typhoon forecast
2512800	2514800	What is the difference between single forecast and double typhoon forecast?
2514800	2516800	You said in a forecast
2516800	2518800	Will there be two typhoons?
2520800	2521800	I think that's what it means
2521800	2522800	Yes, he said that's what it means
2524800	2525800	For the model
2526800	2528800	It's just that the complexity will increase
2529800	2531800	The forecast time will be a little longer
2533800	2534800	That
2536800	2537800	I don't think there's anything wrong
2541800	2542800	Because
2542800	2543800	There will be two in the model
2543800	2544800	Rotating
2544800	2545800	Then they have to
2545800	2546800	Say
2546800	2547800	They
2548800	2550800	The water will rise and move
2550800	2551800	The air rises and moves
2551800	2552800	The air rises and moves
2552800	2553800	It's going to freeze
2553800	2554800	It will rain after freezing
2554800	2555800	After the rain
2555800	2556800	It will rise and move
2556800	2558800	Then the water will rise and move
2558800	2559800	They have been
2559800	2560800	Calculating this kind of thing
2560800	2562800	Because there are two typhoons
2562800	2563800	Inside
2563800	2564800	So the model is more complex
2566800	2567800	The forecast time will be longer
2567800	2568800	but
2568800	2570800	Almost a little bit
2570800	2572800	About 10% or so
2572800	2573800	6 hours
2573800	2574800	6 hours
2575800	2576800	That
2576800	2577800	Will there be any difference?
2580800	2581800	Yes
2588800	2589800	OK
2589800	2590800	He said
2591800	2592800	I see
2592800	2593800	Thanks
2593800	2594800	OK
2597800	2598800	Does anyone else have any questions?
2602800	2603800	If not
2603800	2604800	Today we
2604800	2605800	Wait a minute
2605800	2606800	Yes
2606800	2607800	OK
2607800	2608800	Please say
2619800	2620800	He said
2620800	2622800	The satellite measurement resolution
2622800	2623800	About how much
2625800	2626800	Because of the satellite
2627800	2628800	Simply put
2628800	2630800	How many satellites are there?
2630800	2631800	One is
2631800	2632800	Earth satellite
2632800	2633800	Another one is
2634800	2635800	Satellite orbit
2636800	2637800	That
2638800	2639800	I don't know
2639800	2640800	I don't know
2640800	2641800	I don't know
2641800	2642800	I don't know
2642800	2643800	I don't know
2643800	2644800	I don't know
2644800	2645800	I don't know
2645800	2646800	I don't know
2646800	2647800	I don't know
2647800	2648800	I don't know
2648800	2649800	I don't know
2649800	2650800	I don't know
2650800	2651800	What is the difference?
2651800	2652800	What about the satellites?
2652800	2653800	That is to say
2653800	2654800	The Earth is here
2654800	2655800	Then he is
2655800	2657800	Keep going around the earth
2658800	2659800	Then he
2659800	2660800	Because it keeps going around
2660800	2661800	So he flew a long way
2662800	2663800	I don't know why
2663800	2664800	Anyway, he
2664800	2665800	Because of this design
2665800	2666800	He flew a long way
2667800	2668800	Then there is another satellite
2668800	2669800	That is the earth
2669800	2670800	When the earth is here
2670800	2671800	He is going to
2671800	2672800	The earth follows
2672800	2674800	He keeps going around the same place
2675800	2676800	Then
2676800	2677800	This one flies higher
2679800	2681800	Because according to what gravity
2681800	2682800	Then rotate and so on
2682800	2684800	This one is higher
2684800	2686800	That resolution
2686800	2687800	I personally
2689800	2690800	In the image
2690800	2691800	How far back to the satellite
2691800	2692800	Probably
2692800	2693800	To
2695800	2696800	It's pretty thin
2697800	2698800	Then it depends on
2698800	2700800	When was it produced?
2701800	2703800	Because like the earth head satellite
2704800	2705800	Previous
2705800	2706800	For example, China's wind cloud
2707800	2708800	Satellite
2710800	2711800	Then
2711800	2712800	With the latest
2712800	2714800	Australian space
2714800	2715800	Is it Australia?
2717800	2719800	Let's call it the sunny track 8
2720800	2721800	Then
2721800	2722800	Their resolution
2722800	2723800	It's not the same
2724800	2725800	You have to ask me
2725800	2726800	That number
2727800	2728800	I personally
2728800	2729800	Because I am
2729800	2730800	Touch mode
2730800	2731800	I didn't touch the satellite
2731800	2733800	My resolution to them
2733800	2734800	To what extent
2734800	2735800	I am
2738800	2740800	No impression
2742800	2743800	But if you need
2743800	2744800	Just
2744800	2745800	What do you want to see my painting?
2747800	2748800	I can only insert it for you
2755800	2757800	But my impression is not too low
2758800	2759800	That is
2759800	2760800	Uh
2761800	2763800	Is there a few hundred meters?
2764800	2766800	Then their resolution is probably a few hundred meters
2771800	2773800	100 meters or 40 meters
2773800	2774800	Super cool
2776800	2779800	So the next question he asks is
2779800	2782800	So as the initial condition
2782800	2783800	Data input
2783800	2787800	Will the resolution be higher than the simulation?
2788800	2789800	Uh
2789800	2790800	Right
2792800	2793800	Oh
2796800	2797800	Correct
2802800	2803800	Because this is actually with me
2803800	2805800	What I was thinking was a bit similar
2805800	2806800	What I was thinking was
2806800	2808800	Because you observe the limit of resolution
2808800	2809800	So what you know
2809800	2812800	The limit is actually this big
2812800	2813800	and so
2814800	2816800	I think it can be
2816800	2817800	You input the initial condition
2817800	2819800	Then put it at this level
2819800	2821800	Smear it
2821800	2822800	It's more reasonable
2822800	2823800	You don't know
2823800	2825800	Then run a lot of ensembles
2825800	2826800	Then go and see
2826800	2827800	Do you have this smear
2827800	2828800	How much
2828800	2829800	Influence
2829800	2830800	But it seems
2830800	2832800	It will take a lot of time
2832800	2833800	Yes, there is no way
2833800	2834800	Do it before the valid time
2834800	2835800	I guess
2836800	2837800	Um
2837800	2838800	What you are talking about
2838800	2840800	Uh, what the atmosphere is doing is
2840800	2841800	Data synchronization
2841800	2842800	Simple
2842800	2843800	His name is called data synchronization
2843800	2844800	In other words
2844800	2845800	This is
2845800	2846800	It's almost the same as what you said
2846800	2847800	That is
2847800	2848800	Uh
2848800	2849800	At the beginning of atmospheric simulation
2849800	2851800	There will be a global
2851800	2852800	Global mode
2852800	2854800	Its resolution will be about 20 kilometers
2854800	2856800	About 10 kilometers
2857800	2859800	Then it forecasts the whole world
2860800	2861800	Then
2861800	2862800	After he ran
2862800	2864800	It will be based on satellites
2864800	2865800	And then the radars all over the place
2865800	2867800	Aerial balloons all over the place
2867800	2869800	We will be on the ground
2869800	2870800	A small balloon
2870800	2872800	Then the blue instrument hanging below
2872800	2873800	Then up
2873800	2875800	Then they will collect this vertical
2875800	2877800	Temperature pressure
2877800	2878800	Wind speed
2878800	2880800	He will collect such information
2880800	2881800	Then go
2881800	2883800	Tell this global mode
2883800	2884800	Uh, where am I
2884800	2886800	What is his observation
2886800	2888800	Then he will follow this observation
2888800	2889800	Correction mode
2890800	2892800	Then this global mode
2892800	2895800	Will be after the calculation
2895800	2896800	Cut
2897800	2899800	Send to various places
2899800	2900800	Then come to the area mode
2900800	2902800	Like the one I'm using now
2902800	2904800	This is the area mode
2905800	2906800	Then his
2907800	2909800	The resolution will be higher than the global mode
2911800	2912800	20 kilometers
2915800	2917800	That's what you just said
2918800	2919800	I think that's it
2919800	2920800	Then he put
2920800	2922800	Observation data transmission mode
2922800	2923800	This thing
2923800	2924800	It's called data transmission
2926800	2927800	Hey
2927800	2928800	Is anyone talking?
2929800	2931800	No, no, I'm listening to you
2931800	2933800	Oh, I want to say my microphone
2933800	2934800	Is it
2934800	2936800	Because no one is talking
2936800	2937800	So he
2938800	2939800	The system is closed
2939800	2941800	No, no, no, no, no, no
2941800	2943800	OK, that
2943800	2945800	We have 4 minutes
2945800	2947800	Is there any other question?
2947800	2948800	Is
2948800	2950800	Is it just doing numerical?
2950800	2952800	Or the question of atmospheric
2952800	2954800	In addition to
2954800	2956800	In fact, the question we asked should be
2956800	2957800	Asked almost
2957800	2959800	So do you have any games?
2959800	2960800	More scientific questions
2960800	2962800	Or have their own interests
2962800	2964800	Just ask
2964800	2966800	For example, let me show you one.
2966800	2968800	Just
2968800	2970800	I am actually curious about one thing.
2970800	2972800	Is this
2972800	2974800	This one
2974800	2976800	Let me talk about the objective prediction.
2976800	2978800	Have
2978800	2980800	How big a chance
2980800	2982800	Will be adopted by the government
2982800	2984800	Or they are
2984800	2986800	Anyway, they are
2986800	2988800	After reading the data, I still have to tell you
2988800	2990800	There is no problem with this return screen. We want to build a house.
2990800	2992800	Or they will really refer to professional advice.
2994800	2996800	Because
2996800	2998800	Uh
2998800	3000800	The disaster prevention units are probably divided into
3000800	3002800	layers
3002800	3004800	Is generally in contact with the people
3004800	3006800	Is the Central Meteorological Bureau
3006800	3008800	The things that the Central Meteorological Bureau releases to the people
3008800	3010800	Must be credible
3010800	3012800	To a certain extent
3012800	3014800	He can only be released
3014800	3016800	But
3016800	3018800	But if you want to fight for validity
3018800	3020800	Is to become a disaster prevention unit
3020800	3022800	Then he must have a little understanding of the weather.
3022800	3024800	For example, he knows
3024800	3026800	The credibility of the forecast a few days ago
3026800	3028800	Uh, for reference
3028800	3030800	How about a few days later
3030800	3032800	I did this set of things.
3032800	3034800	Is for the disaster prevention unit
3034800	3036800	Use
3036800	3038800	I don't seem to have answered your question.
3038800	3040800	I think
3040800	3042800	Are you asking
3042800	3044800	But my question is more like
3044800	3046800	That
3046800	3048800	The chiefs who decided to take a vacation
3048800	3050800	Does he have a weather forecast?
3050800	3052800	Or is he just looking at it?
3054800	3056800	Uh
3056800	3058800	Basically should have
3058800	3060800	I know Taipei City has it.
3060800	3062800	but
3062800	3064800	I don't think it's safe.
3066800	3068800	Uh, don't keep talking.
3068800	3070800	Because we are still recording
3070800	3072800	That one
3072800	3074800	A very good question
3074800	3076800	I think it's very interesting
3076800	3078800	We all know that you want to run this numerical
3078800	3080800	You have to enter the initial condition
3080800	3082800	Then let him propagate
3082800	3084800	To have a border condition
3084800	3086800	He just came from the global model.
3086800	3088800	As I just said a few minutes ago
3088800	3090800	He is running a global model first.
3090800	3092800	Then the global model
3092800	3094800	He is another model
3094800	3096800	He doesn't need a border condition.
3096800	3098800	Should be round
3098800	3100800	He is that
3100800	3102800	Symmetry
3102800	3104800	Will be connected
3104800	3106800	But because of the range
3106800	3108800	Will grow
3108800	3110800	He is
3110800	3112800	Then he needs to be initialized
3118800	3120800	OK
3120800	3122800	Let me repeat the question he just asked.
3122800	3124800	Because I just saw it directly.
3124800	3126800	His question is actually weather simulation
3126800	3128800	Do you need a border condition?
3128800	3130800	Because we actually see it now.
3130800	3132800	It's all a frame and you have Taiwan.
3132800	3134800	But if you say
3134800	3136800	This frame is windless
3136800	3138800	It's not very reasonable, so this is a pretty good question.
3140800	3142800	I just told you what the question was.
3142800	3144800	Ok, now it's just 7 o'clock.
3144800	3146800	Do you have any questions?
3150800	3152800	If there is no problem
3152800	3154800	I will announce it again.
3154800	3156800	When you clap, you have to turn on the microphone.
3156800	3158800	Only the speaker can hear
3158800	3160800	Let's applaud again, thank you Xinhao.
3166800	3168800	Thank you
3168800	3170800	Stop recording
