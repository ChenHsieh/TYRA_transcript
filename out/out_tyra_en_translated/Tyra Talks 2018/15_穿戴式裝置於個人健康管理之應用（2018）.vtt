00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this week's TerraTalk.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I am the host for this week, Lin Yu-Wei.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I am very happy to invite our speaker today, Zhou Zhijie.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
He obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at NTU,

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
and is currently a doctor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Lincoln.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Under the guidance of Professor Dai Yu-Chang,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
he has been conducting research on wearable devices and biomimics for medical purposes.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Let's give a round of applause to welcome Zhijie and his speech today.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Remember to turn on the microphone.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Now let's give the microphone to our speaker today, Zhijie.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you, Yu-Wei, for the introduction.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Hello, everyone. I am Zhou Zhijie.

00:56.000 --> 01:05.000
Today's topic is the application of wearable technology and personal health management.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Without further ado, let's get to the topic.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
First of all, I would like to introduce to you

01:17.000 --> 01:26.000
why wearable devices have become a hot topic in recent years.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
Basically, it can be divided into several aspects.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
The first is the concept of non-invasive.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
The concept of non-invasive means that the device does not need to enter our body.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
You may have been to the hospital for injections or blood draws.

01:51.000 --> 02:00.000
Once something enters your body, the first reaction is pain.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
In addition to the pain, the immune system will also react to foreign bodies.

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
For example, some white blood cells or other immune cells will attack foreign objects.

02:19.000 --> 02:28.000
Basically, it will cause a lot of inflammation, swelling, pain, and heat.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
Therefore, wearable devices basically avoid such risks.

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
Many technology giants like Apple and Fitbit

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
want to study non-invasive devices first

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
and see where their limits can be pushed.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
Then they will consider the so-called minimally invasive devices.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
In fact, there is a huge barrier between non-invasive and minimally invasive.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
Whether it is from the perspective of devices or from the perspective of government agencies like the FDA,

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
the biggest barrier is still entering the body.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Once you enter the body, there is a lot of risk.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
Stay outside the body is a very low-risk device.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
Basically, wearable devices have become so popular recently.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Next is the so-called big clinical data.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
I believe everyone has heard of big clinical data.

03:55.000 --> 04:05.000
The meaning of big clinical data is that this device can provide some diagnostic information.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
This diagnosis is also a bit tricky.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
How can we determine the value of the diagnosis?

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
What metrics are really useful?

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
The third part is the so-called Autonomous Sensing.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Autonomous Sensing is not as complicated as you think.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
Just put the wearable device on your body and it will automatically start to measure.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
Then you don't need to intervene.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
Then it can continuously send this data out in a wireless way.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
The advantage is that even if you are not conscious, for example, when you are sleeping,

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
this device can still continue to measure and send the data out.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
So it can let us see some things that we couldn't see before.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
For example, when you are sleeping, it can help you measure the cycle of sleep,

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
or the heartbeat when you are resting, and so on.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
The fourth aspect is that it is very easy to compare with portable devices,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
such as mobile phones, smartphones, or even tablets.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
Basically, these portable devices can be used as a relay station.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
You can imagine that your wearable sensor is a bit like a place to send signals.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Then store these signals in the portable device.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Basically, the computing power of these portable devices is relatively strong,

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
and the bandwidth to upload data is relatively high.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
On the one hand, it can be used as a relay station, and on the other hand,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
it can be used as a place to send signals.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
There are a lot of benefits that you can think about.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Next, I will talk about the logic of why we want to use wearable devices

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
to monitor the health of our body.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
There is a study in Stanford,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
which is called digital health.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
It is a comparison of regular visits to the hospital

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
and digital health.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
The so-called digital health is actually

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
collecting all the data that should be collected at the hospital,

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
digitizing it,

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
and then processing these digitized data.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
This study is actually very simple.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
There are only two main variables.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
One is to measure the skin temperature,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
and the other is to measure the heart rate.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
If I put the sensor on the patient

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
for a long time,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
the patient will inevitably get sick.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
when the patient is sick

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
are basically the same.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
are basically the same.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
are basically the same.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
are basically the same.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
are basically the same.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
are basically the same.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
are basically the same.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
are basically the same.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
are basically the same.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
The heart rate and skin temperature

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
are basically the same.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
The wearable sensor has some information in it.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
How do we get this information out?

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
How do we get this information out?

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
How do we get this information out?

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
We have big clinical data.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
When do we get this data?

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
You can get some useful information

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
such as your body temperature, heart rate, etc.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
It's basically 24 hours a day.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Can we tell if a person is healthy or sick?

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
We can tell from the data from the sensors.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
For example, a disease has a certain distribution in the data space of the sensor.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
So this is a very interesting question.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
So this is a very interesting question.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
Before this disease appeared, our data space was completely blank.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
Before this disease appeared, our data space was completely blank.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
But there are actually some privileges in this sleep stage.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
But there are actually some privileges in this sleep stage.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
For example, when we sleep, our body does not move.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
For example, when we sleep, our body does not move.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Because there is a lack of noise in our daily life.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
For example, motion noise.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Or when we do other things during the day, our heartbeat suddenly changes.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
But when we sleep, it doesn't change.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
At present, some wearable sensors are already measuring heartbeats during rest and sleep.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
At present, some wearable sensors are already measuring heartbeats during rest and sleep.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
I will show you some data later.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Location.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
The main thing is to see where our sensors can be placed in the body.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.000
The main thing is to see where our sensors can be placed in the body.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
Research related to motion impedance.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Research related to motion impedance.

12:30.000 --> 12:40.000
Research related to motion impedance.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
First look at this picture.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
You can see that its range is a bit different.

12:50.000 --> 13:02.000
You can see that the place where wearable devices are often placed, such as a bowl, is actually a good place to put it.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Because it doesn't have too many...

13:06.000 --> 13:21.000
This is a matrix.

13:21.000 --> 13:30.000
It tells us what sensor is most suitable for measuring when placed in a certain place.

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
For example, the red block is used to measure whole body motion.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Basically, it is used to measure the movement of the whole body.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
You can imagine that your limbs, hands and feet are often moving.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
But if you want to track the center of the whole body, the red block will be more accurate.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
And so on.

14:00.000 --> 14:10.000
For example, the extension of the joint stretch, of course, depends on the elbow and knee joint.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
So...

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
The last one is the place where the sensor is really placed.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
This is interesting. You can compare it with the two pictures just now.

14:27.000 --> 14:35.000
For example, many devices are placed at the wrist or ankle.

14:35.000 --> 14:57.000
Next, I will discuss the future prospects of wearable devices.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Basically, it is like this.

15:03.000 --> 15:15.000
From the era of personal computers, the market trend is to try to make the size of the computer smaller and smaller.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.000
From personal computers to knee-shaped devices and wearable devices.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
The so-called computing unit is the center of the data, which is closer to the body.

15:32.000 --> 15:40.000
The advantage of doing this is that you don't need too much delay from your sensor to get the data.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
You can do the operation directly.

15:43.000 --> 15:53.000
This is the size of the entire market of wearable devices.

15:53.000 --> 16:03.000
This is the size of the entire market of wearable devices.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
The size of the entire market of wearable devices is the largest at the beginning.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
However, as soon as Apple Watch appeared, it appeared around the middle of 2015.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
As soon as it appeared, it immediately ate up the market share.

16:18.000 --> 16:28.000
Then, until recently, 2016 to 2017, you can see that the largest has become Apple Watch.

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
Then, on the contrary, Feizui started to decline from the highest point.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
This is a very interesting phenomenon, and you can think about why.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
The last is my own imagination.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
From the beginning of the 2000s, the so-called smartphones began to appear.

16:56.000 --> 17:03.000
By 2010, the first generation of wearable devices began to appear.

17:03.000 --> 17:12.000
It has PPG, which is a method of optical heart rate detection.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Motion is basically an accelerometer.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
It can see the motion of your entire body.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
ECG is a heart rate map.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Blood pressure.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Basically, these are some of the information that is easier to get.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
However, its application is actually limited.

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
In the next ten years, there may be some new wearable devices.

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
For example, FUET, which measures biomarkers in sweat.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
LP is ocular pressure.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
CGM is Continuous Glucose Monitoring.

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
Basically, these devices may need to use minimally invasive sensors.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
However, it still has great advantages.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Because it basically gives us some information that the previous wearable sensors cannot provide.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
Of course, it is more difficult for the government to get FDA approval.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Because it is a relatively high-risk device for patients.

18:28.000 --> 18:39.000
My prediction is that after 2030, it depends on how the market reacts.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Because there is the first and second generation of wearable devices.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
If the market reacts well, there may be new minimally invasive devices.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Then let the market continue to grow.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
Or like personal computers or smartphones, it will start to saturate.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
So you can wait and see what the future of wearable devices will look like.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Next, let's move on to the next topic.

19:19.000 --> 19:26.000
I will introduce the wearable sensors on the market now.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
First, let's talk about Fitbit.

19:34.000 --> 19:43.000
Fitbit is the first company to launch a smartwatch.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
At first, it only gives you some heart rate information.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Heart rate information is based on optical detection.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
The principle is simple.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
It uses a green light LED to illuminate the threshold under the skin.

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
When your blood flow changes, it will affect the intensity of the reflected green light.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
When the green light shines fast enough, for example, this is a 25Hz frequency.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
The heart rate is about 1 to 2Hz.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
The 25Hz light can be modulated by the heart rate.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
You can get heart rate information by processing digital signals.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
This is the first generation of Fitbit.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Recently, they have added some new features.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
They are interested in sleep tracking.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
The reason is simple.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
First, it is easy to measure.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Because you don't move much when you sleep.

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
So there is little noise.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
You can see the picture on the right.

21:10.000 --> 21:23.000
Fitbit uses EEG to divide the sleep cycle into 3 to 4 types.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
The most famous is REM.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Rapid Eye Movement.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
This is the sleep cycle when you are dreaming.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
There are other types, such as pre-sleep and deep sleep.

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
It can show you the percentage of each sleep cycle.

21:45.000 --> 21:52.000
Although it is a sleep cycle, it does not use EEG.

21:52.000 --> 22:02.000
It only uses heart rate and acceleration to measure data.

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
You can see that the cycle is fast.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
Some people complain that there are some false signals.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
Let's take a look at the EEG.

22:29.000 --> 22:41.000
EEG measures the electric field on the head and nose.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
Different sleep cycles have different brain waves.

22:50.000 --> 23:04.000
Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 correspond to the sleep cycle of JELLO and DEEP.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.000
Fitbit does not measure EEG.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
It only uses heart rate and acceleration to measure data.

23:17.000 --> 23:30.000
This is the sleep cycle of JELLO and DEEP.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
Let's take a look at Apple Watch.

23:35.000 --> 23:42.000
Apple Watch is a little later than Fitbit.

23:42.000 --> 23:57.000
The reason is that it has a lot of functions that are not related to clinical information.

23:57.000 --> 24:05.000
Apple likes to make things fancy, so it adds a lot of external functions.

24:05.000 --> 24:14.000
In the latest series 4, Apple tried to add ECG.

24:14.000 --> 24:24.000
You can see that there is an optical heart rate sensor on the back.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
This part is the same as Fitbit.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
But there are two more electrodes.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
One is the crystal electrode on the back.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
The other one is the electrode above the circle.

24:42.000 --> 24:54.000
When you want to measure ECG, you have to touch the dial with your right finger.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
This way, you can form a circuit to measure your ECG.

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
But this ECG only has one channel.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
You can think about it. It measures the electrical field from the left to the right of your heart.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
But this also requires FDA clearance.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Because it claims to be a device that can assist with medical care.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
Any device that claims to have this needs FDA approval.

25:28.000 --> 25:36.000
Once you have this ECG, you can do some irregular rhythm notification.

25:36.000 --> 25:44.000
It can see if there are any abnormal frequencies in your ECG waveform.

25:45.000 --> 25:54.000
The so-called abnormal frequency is a signal like a heart beat or atrial fibrillation.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
Once the ECG is detected, it will give you an alarm.

25:59.000 --> 26:19.000
The so-called class 2 is not the simplest medical device for FDA.

26:19.000 --> 26:29.000
But it's not as invasive as class 3.

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
This device can't be used for diagnosis.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
This is a point that FDA emphasizes.

26:39.000 --> 26:47.000
The last feature is the accelerometer.

26:47.000 --> 26:59.000
When you fall, it will tell you if you need to call an ambulance.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
This is a very fancy feature.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
The next product I want to introduce is Omron.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
You may think of it as a blood pressure monitor.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Or a stopwatch.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
What I'm going to talk about today is a blood pressure monitor.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
The traditional blood pressure monitor has a cuff.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
You have to tie it to your arm.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Then it will start to add pressure.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Then it will measure your heart rate.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
When you can't hear your heart rate, it's a cuff.

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
When you can hear your heart rate again, it's a cuff.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Where is this intervention?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
You can see the watch on the right.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
It's actually made very small.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
You can wear it on your wrist.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
If you press a button, it will stop the process.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
But it's made on the wrist.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
The advantage is that you can wear it all day.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
The advantage is that you can wear it on your wrist.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
When you want to measure your heart rate, you can press it at any time.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
But you still need to operate it manually.

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
Ideally, this device will measure your heart rate every fixed time.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Even when you sleep.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
This is what I think is ideal.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
So there are still some improvements.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
And it's still under development.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
So it hasn't been released yet.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Because it still needs FDA clearance.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
Next is the Freestyle company.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
This is actually a British company.

29:19.000 --> 29:29.000
In the United States, I know Metronic and Dexcom are doing blood sugar testing.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Why do we need to measure blood sugar?

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
In fact, this device is not for ordinary people.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
It's actually for diabetes patients.

29:39.000 --> 29:45.000
Why do I want to let diabetes patients measure their blood sugar?

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
The reason is that their body can't produce insulin.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
So they have to inject insulin into their body to control their blood sugar.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.000
If their blood sugar is too low, it will be life-threatening.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
So they want to keep monitoring their blood sugar level.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
And keep it within the normal range.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
This device is already very small.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
Because the needle is only 0.4 mm.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
It can be regarded as a wearable device.

30:30.000 --> 30:39.000
After the needle is inserted into the skin, it can stay on it for about 14 days.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Just two weeks.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Then you don't have to take it off.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
It's basically like a patch.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
It's a bit like a sticker.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
You just stick it on your body.

30:47.000 --> 30:56.000
If you scan the sensor, it will send the glucose reading to your scanner.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Then the scanner can pair with your phone.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
It will send the glucose reading to your phone.

31:02.000 --> 31:17.000
The advantage of this device is that if you want to measure blood sugar, you need to poke a hole in your finger.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Then squeeze the blood out.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
You can imagine that the process is very painful.

31:20.000 --> 31:29.000
Basically, you just need to poke a hole with this device.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
You only need to poke it once every two weeks.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
And the advantage of this device is that you don't have to poke it yourself.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
This device continues to measure blood sugar.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
So basically, it can measure blood sugar even when you sleep.

31:48.000 --> 31:58.000
OK.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
The last one is a company called Emotiv.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
It's actually doing EEG.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
You can see this in the upper right corner.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
It's a bit like a headgear.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
There are actually more than ten electrodes on it.

32:13.000 --> 32:27.000
This is basically a device that is not really used for medical diagnosis.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
It's more like a device that monitors your brain waves.

32:32.000 --> 32:43.000
In addition to measuring EEG, it can also measure...

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
For example, if you say a command in your head, it will translate it for you.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
This is actually pretty cool.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
It can also detect facial expression changes on your face.

32:55.000 --> 33:02.000
This device has a EEG system with Clinical.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.000
You can see that this is basically very consistent.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
Clinical's EEG is actually very expensive.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It's about 60k.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
They developed Emotiv themselves.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It's only a few hundred dollars.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
OK.

33:27.000 --> 33:34.000
Let me give you a brief introduction to how EEG came about.

33:34.000 --> 33:41.000
Everyone knows that the brain has various cortex.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
This EEG...

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
You can see these...

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Have you ever heard of alpha or beta?

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
All kinds of brain waves come from the cortex.

33:58.000 --> 34:05.000
It's just that it's not the same as the nervous system.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
The reason is that this is not the real action potential.

34:09.000 --> 34:17.000
It's actually a change in hyperpolarization and depolarization.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
This cycle is actually very long.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
You can see that there's a scale at the bottom.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
This is one second.

34:24.000 --> 34:31.000
The action potential is usually only a few dozen milliseconds.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
So this is not the action potential.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
This is actually a change in hyperpolarization.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
After this is produced in the cell,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
it actually has a local field potential.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
It's measured near the cell to the junction point.

34:50.000 --> 34:58.000
Then this junction point goes all the way through the medium between the cells.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Then it's passed on to the cortex.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Then it's passed on to the cortex.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Then it's passed on to the cortex.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
So you can see that the cortex is actually just a depolarization of the nerve.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
Of course, the EEG hasn't been declared to be able to measure while sleeping.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
So I don't know what happens if it really wears this device when it's sleeping.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I think it should be quite interesting.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
Okay, let's move on to the third part.

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
The third part is mainly some relatively new technologies.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
There are mainly...

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
The first one is continuous blood pressure monitoring.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
As I just said, it still needs you to measure it yourself.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
So its measurement speed can't be that fast.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
Continuous blood pressure is a new device.

36:12.000 --> 36:20.000
It uses the ultrasound to track the blood pressure in the blood vessel.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
This is the normal distribution range of blood pressure in general.

36:25.000 --> 36:40.000
This is the basic structure of the device.

36:40.000 --> 36:52.000
The main signal source is the piezoelectric material.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
It's sealed in epoxy.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Then some electrodes are applied to the surface.

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
At the same time, the piezoelectric material is actually in two directions.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
One is when you give it electricity, it will generate a current.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
The other is when you have a current, it will generate a signal of electricity.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So it's actually in both directions.

37:15.000 --> 37:24.000
The principle is that you give a pulse at the beginning.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
So the piezoelectric material will generate a pulse.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
Then it presses the blood vessel.

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
So it will see how the blood vessel is changing with the blood pressure.

37:41.000 --> 37:48.000
According to the time-of-flight, it can reverse the environment of the blood vessel.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
Then this signal can be reversed into blood pressure.

37:53.000 --> 38:00.000
The two positions are in the pulmonary artery.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
So it's just a little patch on top of it.

38:03.000 --> 38:09.000
There are some sensor arrays in this patch.

38:09.000 --> 38:15.000
Maybe there are a few sensor arrays on top of the blood vessel.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
It can measure the blood pressure.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
The next one is actually quite interesting.

38:33.000 --> 38:39.000
This is actually a device that can measure sweat.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
So why are we interested in sweat?

38:47.000 --> 38:53.000
The reason is that a lot of metabolism will come out with sweat.

38:53.000 --> 39:00.000
Such as glucose and lactate.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
They all show up in the sweat.

39:03.000 --> 39:12.000
And their concentration is quite similar to the concentration in the blood.

39:12.000 --> 39:19.000
So sweat can be thought of as a substitute for blood.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
Then you don't really need to put a needle into your blood vessel.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
So it has the advantage of non-invasive.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
Then it can measure the concentration of electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium.

39:35.000 --> 39:58.000
I'm curious about the time difference between glucose and lactate in sweat and in blood.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
I would say about ten minutes.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
They actually did a similar research.

40:08.000 --> 40:19.000
Look at the concentration of glucose in your blood.

40:19.000 --> 40:26.000
Then you will see that if there is a spike in the blood, there will be a delay in the spike in the sweat.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
That delay is usually about ten minutes.

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
So it's a delay, but the timing resolution is higher.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
So even if it's a very short spike, you can still see it.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
It's just a delay, right?

40:40.000 --> 40:47.000
If it's a very short spike, it's not very certain.

40:47.000 --> 40:52.000
Because the spike I'm talking about is usually like a step.

40:52.000 --> 40:57.000
For example, after you eat, your blood sugar will suddenly rise and then slowly fall.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
So it's actually not a really short spike.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
It's actually a step up and then slowly decay.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
This device is actually made like a wristband.

41:23.000 --> 41:33.000
Its principle is basically to detect your target with a variety of different coating electrodes.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
Like glucose and lactate, it uses enzymes to detect.

41:40.000 --> 41:48.000
It basically puts the enzyme on the permeable film.

41:48.000 --> 41:53.000
Then let it react with the target.

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
After the target is reacted, the enzyme dissolves the target and releases the electron.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
Then the electron is picked up as a voltage signal.

42:02.000 --> 42:09.000
The other part is the concentration of sodium and potassium.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
It uses ion-selective electrodes.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
It uses a variety of coatings on the surface.

42:19.000 --> 42:27.000
This improves the professionalism of the ion.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
So there won't be any interference problems.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
It's the same as converting it into an electrode.

42:36.000 --> 42:45.000
Finally, it's sent to a wireless ECB and sends the signal to the mobile phone.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
This is what it actually measured when it was running.

42:54.000 --> 43:01.000
You can see that there are five different data.

43:01.000 --> 43:14.000
The temperature on the skin, lactate, sodium, potassium, and potassium.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
It also has a collaboration with the device.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
This collaboration is very good.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Because it matches the commercial device.

43:27.000 --> 43:35.000
The only bad thing about this device is that it needs to let this person sweat.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
Basically, you can see that there is a period of time after the exercise.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
Then he started to sweat to get this reading.

43:56.000 --> 44:03.000
The last one is the pressure in the eye.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
It's actually measured...

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
It's different for each eye.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Jump to the structure of the eye.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
This is the structure of the human eye.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
Basically, the pressure we're talking about is the small part in front of the eye.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
It's called aqueous humor.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
In Chinese, it's called aqueous liquid.

44:37.000 --> 44:44.000
Basically, it's the space between your mucous membrane and the crystal.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
There's actually a little bit of aqueous liquid in it.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
It's only a few microliters.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
In fact, these microliters determine the balance of pressure in your eyes.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
Because the vitreous body in the back is a glass body.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Basically, the volume won't change.

45:02.000 --> 45:10.000
So if the pressure in the front increases, it will start to compress the mucous membrane and blood vessels in the back.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
That's why it's called this disease.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
This disease is called glaucoma.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
OK.

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
So we want to monitor this 24-hour eye pressure change.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Can you imagine the same thing?

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
It's actually hard to sleep.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
And there's an interesting phenomenon.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
In fact, when you sleep, your eye pressure is the highest.

45:52.000 --> 45:58.000
So, in fact, ophthalmologists are very interested in eye pressure changes when they sleep.

45:58.000 --> 46:06.000
So we started to think about whether or not we could put a wearable device on your eyes and measure the eye pressure change.

46:06.000 --> 46:14.000
Someone suggested that you could actually use this wearable glasses as your platform to measure eye pressure changes.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
This is actually a new company's idea.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
It actually uses existing wearable glasses materials.

46:26.000 --> 46:36.000
Then they added a strain gauge to measure the change in the curvature of the mucous membrane.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
They claim that this can be connected to intraocular pressure.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
In fact, FDA has also approved this device.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
It can actually be placed on the glasses and continue to measure 24 hours.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
OK.

46:54.000 --> 47:04.000
Then the main target is still these patients with light eyes or patients who are about to get light eyes.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
As you can see, the structure of this device is very simple.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
There is a coil.

47:15.000 --> 47:25.000
It is actually used to receive power and send information back to the microcontroller.

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
There is also a small microcontroller here.

47:30.000 --> 47:40.000
But its function is just to help modulate the signal and measure the strain gauge itself.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
As you can see, this device does not have a battery.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
It actually needs a larger coil outside the glasses to provide this power.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
This power is also a receiver coil.

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
It can digitize the signal and send it to the recorder.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
I personally don't really appreciate this.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
Because it feels a little strange.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
You can actually make it like a blindfold device.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
You don't have to make it so complicated.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
And this wire is not very convenient when you sleep.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Then back to Glocoma.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
This is what I just talked about.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
When you sleep, the eye pressure is actually higher.

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
The black one in the middle is actually the eye pressure when you sleep.

48:36.000 --> 48:44.000
Generally, the standard eye pressure for Glocoma is 21 mmHg.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
It's about this line.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
21 is here.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
The upper line is actually the real Glocoma patient's eye pressure.

48:55.000 --> 49:04.000
The bottom line is normal.

49:04.000 --> 49:18.000
In fact, there is a big difference between standing up and squatting.

49:18.000 --> 49:26.000
Because when you stand up, there is a pressure difference caused by the height.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
It even has something to do with standing or lying down.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
So when you lie down, your posture changes.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Basically, the eye pressure will be a little higher.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Compare with when you stand up.

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
They maintain the same posture.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
If you stand up, it will be colder during the day.

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
The last new technology is the battery technology.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
I just talked about so many wearable devices.

50:12.000 --> 50:20.000
If they put batteries in, they will basically use lithium-ion batteries.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
The reason is that its energy density is the highest.

50:23.000 --> 50:30.000
Of course, this is also why smartphones and laptops use lithium-ion batteries.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
You can see this picture.

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
This is the current structure of the mainstream lithium-ion battery.

50:38.000 --> 50:45.000
It has two levels, one level and a separator in the middle.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
What's the bad thing about this?

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
It's very fragile.

50:53.000 --> 51:01.000
The reason is that when the lithium-ion battery is charged, it will heat up easily.

51:01.000 --> 51:10.000
Once it reaches a certain temperature, it will start to affect the electrolyte inside.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
After the electrolyte breaks down, it releases gas.

51:15.000 --> 51:21.000
The gas is more serious because it causes internal pressure to increase.

51:21.000 --> 51:29.000
After the internal pressure increases, the structure of the separator is destroyed.

51:29.000 --> 51:35.000
Once the structure is damaged, the battery is like a short-circuit.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
A short-circuit is a positive feedback.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
It will cause more heat to be released.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
The whole thing will break down.

51:44.000 --> 51:56.000
If you insert a nail into the lithium-ion battery, it will start to ignite and explode.

51:56.000 --> 52:05.000
We don't want this scenario to happen to wearable devices.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
It's basically wearing on your body.

52:08.000 --> 52:16.000
If there is a problem with the battery, it will be a big problem.

52:16.000 --> 52:22.000
Recently, someone proposed a new design.

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
It uses the same structure as the solar panel.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
The structure is on the right.

52:32.000 --> 52:38.000
It uses a 3D structure.

52:38.000 --> 52:48.000
Basically, the structure of the battery is changed to a solid-state silicon.

52:48.000 --> 52:56.000
So there is no weak and easy-to-puncture problem.

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
The traditional lithium-ion battery has a very fragile structure.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
It's easy to break through.

53:04.000 --> 53:12.000
But if you change it to a solid-state substrate, it's not easy to be affected by external forces.

53:12.000 --> 53:21.000
On the other hand, you can use the photolithography method to pattern the structure of the two-stage and one-stage.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
It can increase the density a lot.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
On the one hand, it is safer.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
On the other hand, the density of its unit has also been increased.

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
In the future, it is very likely to see this new lithium-ion battery being used on wearable devices.

53:41.000 --> 54:04.000
In the last part, we will discuss the problems that wearable devices may encounter in addition to this technology.

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
The first one is privacy.

54:09.000 --> 54:18.000
When a sensor starts to collect very personal data,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
and there is a lot of data,

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
there will be a question mark.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
What kind of people can access this data?

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
What kind of people can't access it?

54:31.000 --> 54:42.000
You may have heard of Google Glass before.

54:42.000 --> 54:56.000
The reason why it was scared was because it was collecting data.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.000
If the camera is not approved by other people,

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
it will randomly shoot everywhere.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
It violates other people's privacy.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
The same goes for wearable devices.

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
It collects personal data all the time.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
If it is not approved,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
for example, you wear a wearable device today,

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
and the watch is lost.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
Can other people easily access your data?

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
This is a privacy issue.

55:32.000 --> 55:45.000
The following table is a survey on wearable devices.

55:46.000 --> 55:57.000
On the left, you can see how people react to wearable devices.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Most people are very happy.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
There is a new toy to play with.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
But when it comes to trust,

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
people start to have questions.

56:11.000 --> 56:18.000
The most trusted people are doctors, hospitals,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
or health insurance.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
These people are more trustworthy.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.000
The following categories are cell phone providers,

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
entertainment providers, etc.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
People's trust suddenly dropped.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
This is also a trend.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
If you want to collect data,

56:37.000 --> 56:47.000
it is recommended to start from hospitals or doctors' offices.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
Traditionally, people are more confident in health care providers.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
They know they won't use these data.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
The second discussion is about business.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
This is an interesting issue.

57:15.000 --> 57:21.000
Everyone sees that wearable devices have a good market.

57:21.000 --> 57:29.000
But it is difficult to enter this market.

57:29.000 --> 57:39.000
The reason is that it requires a lot of investment.

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
First, if you want to use wearable devices for diagnosis,

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
you need to get FDA approval.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
Basically, whether it is class 2 or class 3,

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
you need to invest in research and development,

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
or even apply for a patent.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
Then you can get FDA approval.

58:04.000 --> 58:11.000
But consumers care a lot about the price of wearable devices.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
You can see the following.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
Whether it is fitness band, smart glasses, smart watch, or smart clothing.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
The first thing everyone cares about is the price.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
The second is that you may not use it.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Then there are others.

58:29.000 --> 58:35.000
The first is that the cost of investment is high,

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
but you can't lower the price.

58:49.000 --> 58:56.000
The last one is the difficulties that wearable devices may face.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
There are five points.

59:04.000 --> 59:12.000
The first is that consumers don't know why they need to use wearable devices.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
What can wearable devices do?

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
As mentioned earlier,

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
for example, sleep tracking.

59:27.000 --> 59:32.000
Even if I know that my sleep is divided into these weeks,

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
what are the possible applications?

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
For example, can it assist me in diagnosing what diseases I may have?

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Or when I go to see a doctor,

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
can it give the doctor some judgment criteria?

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
The second is that wearable devices are easy to lose.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
This is the same problem as mobile phones or other portable devices.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And it's quite troublesome to lose it.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Currently, wearable devices do not have ID settings.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Basically, it's wearable.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
It won't be linked to your account.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
The third is that

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
is it attractive or comfortable to wear?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
This is a question worth thinking about.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
When we don't know what function this device can do,

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
there is no reason to want to wear it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
For example,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
if you don't wear glasses,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
you may not want to wear glasses.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Wearing glasses only provides you with some minimal benefits.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
The fourth is battery life.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Currently, most wearable devices only last 7 to 10 days.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Some people may complain that they can't last longer.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
The fifth is about syncing.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Can it pair well with your smartphone?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
This is a technical problem.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
It's easy to solve.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But if you want to design a new wearable device,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
you need to read.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
This is the last video.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
If you have any questions or experiences with wearable devices,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
please feel free to ask.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
If you have any questions,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
please feel free to ask.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Thank you.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Thank you, Zijie.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Let's give him a round of applause.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Please turn on your microphones.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Let's open the Q&A session.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Do you have any questions?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I have a question.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Can you hear me?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Yes, I can hear you.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Let's say 10 or 15 years later,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
everyone wears a certain wearable device.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Your data will be uploaded to a data center for 24 hours.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
The manager of the data center is basically a group of MDs.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
They can see the data and know where the person's body may have problems.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
In other words, this system can replace the current GP.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
After the initial diagnosis,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
the GP may be suffering from a skin disease.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
The GP will be transferred to the relevant department.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
In other words, this whole system will become the first line of defense of the medical system.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Imagine this society.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
If this society really exists,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
what do you think is the technical problem?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I can imagine other problems in society or politics.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
But what do you think is the technical problem?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Now there is a fundamental question.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
How far can this wearable device go?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
If you don't want an invasive action,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
it's actually very limited.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So I think the first technical problem is

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
how to measure all the data you need in a minimally invasive situation.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Then your data can distinguish between different diseases.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I think this is the first problem.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And it's a must-solve problem.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
If you want to get into the ideal scenario,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
you have to be able to do it.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Hello, I have a question.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Can you hear me?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yes.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Hello, I would like to ask.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
You just said that there are some minimally invasive devices.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I do cancer research.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I know that some of the current scientific cancer fields

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
are already targeting some cancer prevention methods.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:31.000
For example, there are some so-called tumor DNA in the blood of cancer patients.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I wonder if this technology has been applied

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
or is already being developed on this wearable device.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
How will it develop in the future?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
OK, thank you, William.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Basically, yes.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Someone is already doing this.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I didn't mention it just now.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
In fact, many people are doing so-called lab-on-a-chip.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Basically, using a single chip,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000
you can do what a whole lab can do.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
For tumor cells, yes.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But because it needs to use a protocol.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Basically, it's still a protocol.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Because it basically looks at the circulating tumor cells.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So it needs to first design a filter

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
to filter out these tumor cells.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
After filtering out,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
it will look at which tumor cells belong to which cancer.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
For example, doing DNA sequencing and so on.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
If you want to turn it into a wearable device,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
you still have to solve the invasive problem first.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Because if you want to take a blood sample,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
the trouble with blood is that it is easy to coagulate.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Coagulation occurs.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So how do you get it from your bloodstream

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
to the cancer cell?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
At the same time, it doesn't coagulate.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
This is actually a problem that needs to be solved.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
But if you can get this blood sample,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
it's technically feasible.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So now in this wearable device,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
there is no way to make this breakthrough, right?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
If you don't want human intervention,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I don't think it's there yet.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But if you can do it like a blood sugar machine,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
you poke a hole and squeeze the blood out,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and then drop it on the lab arm chip,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
it can actually be done.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So the difference is whether it can be automated.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
So the difficulty now is that

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
the coagulation situation you just mentioned,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
that is, in a long-term surveillance,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
instead of a single-point,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
time-point time to detect.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
That's it.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Thank you.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Hi.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I'm from the Taiwan University Student Association.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Thank you for your wonderful speech.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'm the president of this year.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I'm also from the Electrical Engineering Institute.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
But I'm studying electrical waves now.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And then in this regard,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
maybe it's related to you.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Maybe it's like Energy Harvesting.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And then I'm doing the topic now.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It's UCLA.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
They're developing how to make the antenna satellite.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
It's possible to do the level of micrometer.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It should also be related to wearable.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But I'm pretty curious.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Like in the topic you're studying,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
now it's more of an application.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
What are the more common

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
or specific hardware bottlenecks?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
For example, the most common is of course the battery.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Or is there anything that is still difficult to overcome?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Or is it just that you need to find a better application?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Thank you.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
OK, thank you for your question.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Yes, you just mentioned the battery.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
It's already a big concern.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
In terms of hardware.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The reason is because, think about it.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:20.000
If you want to put a battery inside the body,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
the size has a big limit.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Because the bigger the size,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
the stronger the immune response.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Of course, we want to make the battery smaller and better.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Even without the battery.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Just use the wireless power transfer to provide energy.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So the battery is a concern.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
In fact, everyone has been thinking about

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
how to give the power to the device.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Either by inductive coupling.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Or even using ultrasound.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
In fact, I have been doing this kind of wireless power transfer project before.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Then I studied how to use ultrasound to provide this energy.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So everyone is also brainstorming

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
how to make this power better.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Because you don't want the battery to get into the body.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
There is also a biocompatibility.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So basically all the batteries you need to use in the implant.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Like your pacemaker battery.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
It also needs special design.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It must be placed in a good enclosure.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It must ensure that the electrolyte will not leak out.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And it won't short-circuit.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Because FDA has a lot of concerns about this.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Then you just talked about hardware.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
There is another question.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Because you are doing antenna related.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
So I would like to talk about communication.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
How to get the signal out with the minimum energy per bit.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
This is also a problem.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Because your body.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
For example, if you use gigahertz.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
It actually has a lot of energy damping.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
It is actually wasted in your interstitial space.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Because your tissue is also for power supply.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And in the gigahertz range.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Whether it's water or ion.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It actually absorbs a lot of energy.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
So if you want to use wireless.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
If you send this data out.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
It will waste a lot of energy.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
So how to use this.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Maybe you want to find a frequency band.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Optimize your energy.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
This is also a research question.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Then, of course, other things.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Like this sensor design.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Because now we can use the sensor on the left.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
In fact, it is also limited.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Then how to improve this sensor design.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Then make it energy efficient.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Or this.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
The smaller the bone factor.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So basically.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Let this patient.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
When you put these devices in your body.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You almost don't feel pain.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
This is also a direction.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
So yeah.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
These three aspects are actually Howard.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Especially in our lab that does this kind of device.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
In fact, I have been working hard.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Hello, I have a more naive question.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
But you just talked about the battery.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Then I thought at the beginning.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Hey, since the battery has its limitation.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Then why don't you use something like solar cells?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
In this way.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
To work hard in this direction.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
You talk about solar cells.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Does it mean that you harvest energy from the environment?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Correct.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
OK.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Yes.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Someone is also doing this direction.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
But basically.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
The current problem.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Because everyone.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
May say.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
If you want to harvest energy from the environment.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Where is your source?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
The first one is probably.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Temperature.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
But your body temperature is only 37 degrees.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So with you.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The room temperature is 25 degrees.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
There is only a dozen degrees difference in the middle.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
So this temperature may not be enough.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You use it to generate electricity.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Then the second one may be.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Is the motion produced by the body itself.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
But there is a problem here.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
The first one you are.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
To make sure this motion is.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Is.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It has been happening.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Not like this.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
For example, your muscles move.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Then it's gone.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You may want to.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
For example, heartbeats.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Or breathing.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
This kind of motion that has been happening all the time.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Then use this motion to generate electricity.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Someone is doing this.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Then the third type.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Is from chemical chemistry.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
For example, glucose.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Someone is studying how to use glucose to generate electricity.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But this is still in the research stage.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
There is no real commercial device.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
The reason is that.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Its conversion efficiency is still too low.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
There is no way to provide this.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The lowest power needed by the sensor.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So most of it is still.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It's all about providing power to the outside world.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
What about solar energy?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Solar energy.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
The first problem you encounter is the problem of light.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Because once the light enters the tissue.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
For example, the skin.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
It begins to diffuse.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
After the diffusion, you can really penetrate the depth.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Only a few millimeters.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
So after a few millimeters.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Basically, you can't see the light.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
So there is no way to use solar energy.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Unless you put it directly on the surface of the body.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
There is still a possibility.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Hello.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Hello.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I am currently doing.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Biological research.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Then I am also studying.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I want to ask some questions about animals.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
For example.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Now these devices are being developed.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Although I don't think so.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
But still at some stage.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Because of safety factors.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Like traditional experiments.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Do you use experimental animals?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Or say.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
These devices are for.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Because we know that animal experiments.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It is also necessary, for example, to draw blood every day.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Or measure blood pressure every day.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Or look at some of their physical changes.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Does anyone already use these devices?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Do some applications for animal experiments.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Thank you.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
In fact, there is.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Basically, we.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
These sensors.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Especially implant.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Is the device that is really placed in the human body.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Basically, all have to go through animal experiments first.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So actually animal experiments.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It is also a very good platform.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Can these sensors really work?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
OK.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Like I have a colleague.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
He is doing this.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I just talked about intraocular pressure.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
This is the device for measuring eye pressure.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
He basically puts it in first.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
For example, to study in the eyes of rabbits.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Then look at his sensor.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Is it a good response?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Because basically.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
The advantage of animal experiments is.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
It's easy.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
So.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Generally, if you are really doing implants.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Will use animal experiments first.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Then you just talked about.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Is there a device?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Really used to measure animal.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
That.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
For example, blood pressure or the like.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
In fact, there is really a company doing this.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Is specifically for animal experiments.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Then.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
It basically provides a.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
A whole set of complete wireless.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
This measuring system.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
For example, blood pressure.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Then.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I forgot the other parameters.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
But it can measure a lot of.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Basically very similar to people.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It basically can measure.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Because the lab often uses mice.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
So it can measure the mouse's blood pressure.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Then, for example, heartbeats and the like.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Then it can put this.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Integrated into a platform.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Then give the lab people a reference.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So what you say is actually done.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
OK, thank you.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Hello.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Hello, I am Red Stone.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Now at the University of Michigan.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
As a postdoc.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Then I have a.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I have two questions.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
The first one is that I heard before.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Is to use Fitbit.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
These products.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
They usually use it for a year or two.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Will be broken.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I want to know.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
These are the devices.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Is the problem solved?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I didn't mention these questions.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
OK.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Durability.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
If the problem is.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
In fact, I have been using Fitbit myself.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Its durability.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
In fact, the main thing is.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Mechanical durability.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Its sensor itself is not broken.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But he.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
For example, his wristband.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
With this sensor.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
The junction of the wristband.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
There is actually a problem with the connection.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
For example, you often go to this.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Exercise.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Then stretch it.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
It is easy to produce mechanical fatigue.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Then the place where the fatigue is easy to break off.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
OK, but this.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It has nothing to do with its sensor itself.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Because the sensor itself uses this optical method.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So unless you go on purpose.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
To break it down.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Otherwise, it is actually very difficult to break down.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
OK, so in fact.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
This problem has already been solved.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So basically.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
In fact, you just solve it.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Mechanical strength is OK.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
So this is actually with the sensor.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It is not related to the problem itself.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It's just that it's designed.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I don't think so much.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
OK, then the second question is.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
About that EEG.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I want to know that.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
When you use this.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
EEG device.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
You have to wear it on your head.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
That is the helmet.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
But you still have hair.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Those EEG.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Can't directly touch your scalp.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Then these.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
In this case, those EEG.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Can still work?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Oh, yes, that's a good question.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
They actually have a special design.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
For this EEG.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
It's not like what you think.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
It's just a flat EEG.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It's actually a bit like an octopus's foot.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It has this.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
For example, a few.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
This helmet.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It's actually a bit like.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Add a little pressure.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
On that EEG.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
It can actually.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Go through your hair.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Then directly touch your scalp.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
That EEG.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
It's actually a special design.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Yes, thank you.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Hello.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Hello.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I would like to ask a question.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Related to materials.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Because these wearable devices.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Relative to the skin.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Or any part of the body.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
So their.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Capability is relatively better.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I can imagine.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Consider some mechanical properties.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
If you consider these properties.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Biocompatible.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Bioresorption.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
So it will be weaker.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Based on these.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Material selection.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
What kind of material do you use most often?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Or is there any.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Already commercial.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Or is it special.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
To synthesize these.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Polymer or organic.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
To be able to do these things.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
This is also a good question.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Basically.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Currently.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Whether in this.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
The medical world.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Or this.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Medical equipment.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Everyone uses this most often.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
PDMS.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
That is.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
This.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
This.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Silicone.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
It's a bit like silicone.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Its advantage is because.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
First of all, its material is very soft.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Second.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Its extensibility is very good.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
You can pull it.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
For example, more than 200%.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
It still won't break.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Flexibility is also very good.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
It can confirm.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Confirm to your skin surface.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Then it is.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Water and air.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
It actually has this inside.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Porosity.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
It has this nanostructure inside.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Porosity.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
These small molecules.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Structure passed.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
So basically.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Everyone's first choice is to use PDMS.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Then.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
If you don't want to.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Let these.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
For example, water vapor.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Or something else.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
We will be outside PDMS.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Outside.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Coat a thin layer.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Polymer to protect it.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Like our lab.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
A kind of.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Polymer material.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It can.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
By chemical.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Then directly.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
On top of PDMS.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
It's a bit like.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Two-layer structure.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
It's just that the outer layer is very thin.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
It won't affect.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Overall mechanical property.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Then.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And this material.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It's actually a biochemical.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Then.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It's basically.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's a bit different from PDMS.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Because it doesn't have this inside.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Nanoporous.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
So it.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
So it won't let this.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Water vapor to pass.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So if you want.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
If it's a barrier.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
In fact, you can add this outside.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Polymer.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Then you can ask.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
What kind of standard.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Biofluid barrier.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Because we know these.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Protocols or biological.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
It may be an electrolyte.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
If it's on both sides of EEG or ECG.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
These will not form noise.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Or other concerns.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
OK.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Basically.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Of course, it depends on you.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
What about the process of adding this material?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Like PDMS, it's almost.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
If there is no process.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Just a few microns.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Just a few micrometers.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It basically won't have any.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
This transparency.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
So basically.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
That's our criteria.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Of course, he started.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
When commercialized.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
At first.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It's actually used to protect the circuit board.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Is to protect the circuit board.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Not corroded by this water vapor.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Their initial criteria.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It's about 10 or 20 microns.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Then we.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
If you take it.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
If you do this, it's probably the same thickness.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So it won't be much different.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
OK.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Thank you.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I would like to continue the last question.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
That is, why would you choose Perlin?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Don't choose PolyMNL.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Oh.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Actually.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
There are a few reasons.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
That is.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
The first one is.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
The two of them.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
The physical nature is a bit different.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
The first one.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
PolyMNL is.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
It's a bit like.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Semi-transparent material.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Then Perlin is completely transparent.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So if you want.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
For example, optical.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
If you want to use an optical device.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Perlin is a better choice.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Then the second one is.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
PolyMNL.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
That is.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Glass transition temperature.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Higher.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So basically you heat it up.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
For example, 200 or 300 degrees.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
It still won't deform.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Then Perlin.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
It's when you heat it up.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
200.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Around 200 degrees.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It's kind of like a semi-melted state.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
So it's easier to shape.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
If you need to shape.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Because.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Generally speaking, when we do Perlin.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
There are usually two layers of Perlin.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So how do you put these two layers of Perlin.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Just put it together.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I usually use this.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Is the heating method.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
To put it together.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
PolyMNL.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I don't know if it is.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Easier than Perlin.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
So generally.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
We usually choose to use Perlin.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
When the temperature is relatively low.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Yes.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So these are two.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
More different places.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Of course.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Some people use PolyMNL.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
His life.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
It won't be as long as Perlin.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Some people in our lab.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Is the same.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Circuit.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
The same circuit.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
One is using PolyMNL.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
The other is using Perlin.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
He found that PolyMNL.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
It can only last about a month.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
And then the top ones.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Layout is starting to melt.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Is to be dissolved.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Then but.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Perlin.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Because it has a very poor water permeability.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
So basically the water is not easy to pass through.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
If there is no water.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Basically your ion can't work.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So his device.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Yes.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Thank you.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Do you have any other questions?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
If not.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Then our speech is here.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Then I will turn off the recording first.
