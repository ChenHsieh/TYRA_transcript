00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Mengchang, and I am a student at Mata University.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
What I want to talk about today is about 4-way mixing and squeeze light.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
If you have any questions at any time, you can ask, just turn on your microphone.

00:22.000 --> 00:33.000
My field is in the field of atomic physics, which is relatively low-energy physics.

00:33.000 --> 00:44.000
Our research unit is JQI, which is the United States Department of State.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
It is a rather special institution, which is under the Department of Commerce in the United States.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Although they don't sound like they are doing this kind of specialized research,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
they have actually won four Nobel Prizes in atomic physics.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
So it's a pretty special national standard.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
My instructor is Paul Leitz.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
Our main source of research funding is from the Air Force in the United States.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
At the beginning, I want to let everyone know what squeezing means.

01:25.000 --> 01:51.000
We want to compress all the information into a better measurement.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
After watching the video, let's get down to business.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
The experiment we are doing now is using laser light.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
The characteristic of laser light is that it is a coherent state.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
What is a coherent state?

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
I don't know if you've heard of it.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm sure you've heard of the non-coherent principle.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
The non-coherent principle tells us that we can't...

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
We used to think that the results of delta x and delta t must be greater than h-bar.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
We can imagine that our laser light has a so-called non-coherent property.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
Non-coherent property means that it has its government amplitude and its horizontal axis.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Both of these can't be measured very accurately in practice.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
That is to say, it has its limits.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
You can see that when our laser light is in coherent state,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Basically, it's always in coherent state.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
When it's in coherent state, you'll see its...

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
Its FN or phase fluctuation is actually...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Its result is in...

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
That is to say, the curve on the left represents the line that meets the non-coherent principle.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Mathematically, we know that when your delta...

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
My y-axis is delta e, and my x-axis is delta phi.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
If these two variables are in the minimum value,

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
When the two are equal, they are actually in their so-called minimum value.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Laser light is when these two values are equal.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Then it presents such a coherent state.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
So what is Squeeze state?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Squeeze state means that you can...

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
That is to say, we don't need to measure all the information of laser light very accurately.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
We can say that we just need to measure the phase very accurately.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
Or we can measure our government very accurately.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
When you see that your phase is measured very accurately,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
In fact, it still meets its non-coherent principle.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Then it will lead to the inaccuracy of your government.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
It will become very large.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
Then your phase can be measured very accurately.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
So a while ago, probably the year before last,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Isn't there a gravity wave measurement experiment?

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
It is to use this Squeeze light to throw away your impurities.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I will talk about quantum impurities.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Because you are in coherent state.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Then go to the limits of quantum mechanics.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Then push it to compress it so that you can measure the phase very accurately.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Then they may have a so-called interferer.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Then the interferer can measure the phase of something.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
If the gravity wave passes over the earth,

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
Then you can measure the phase of this gravity wave.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
There will be some changes.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
As long as you have a way to enter this Squeeze state,

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
You can let a certain frequency of the phase be able to measure it very accurately.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
Because the gravity wave passes through like this,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
So its frequency will be very weak.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
If you are very weak, your impurities will be very strong.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
You need to have a way to get rid of this impurity.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Then measure to the phase you want.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
But what we did in the experiment,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
We did another one.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
We are so-called Two-Mode Squeezing.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Two-Mode Squeezing is to say,

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm producing two intangles of light.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
That is to say, I now have some special light and non-linear effects.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Then produce two intangles.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
What about these two intangles?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Some of their signals are exactly the same.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
So if I input a light,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
That light is called Probe.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Then it will produce its oscillation.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
It uses a Twin Beam.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
These two lights have each other.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
For example, there is quantum co-relative.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
That is, quantum co-relative.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Quantum co-relative.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
So when I can put these two lights together,

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
I can get another one called Intensity Difference.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
That is to say, I can let my Intensity Difference,

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
to measure the noise of this two-mode intensity is the lowest.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
This may be a bit abstract.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I'll show you some data later.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
If you don't quite understand, you can ask me again.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
The preliminary introduction is,

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
I spent 20 minutes to introduce what happened.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I have introduced the background knowledge needed at the beginning.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
If no one has any questions, I will continue.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
OK.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
How do we make this?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Excuse me.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You just said that the intangles,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
How is it produced?

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
Is it also produced by something?

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Is it produced by intangles?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
We don't use intangles.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
We use Rubidium Vapor.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Rubidium is a 2A group.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
The Rubinium Nitrate.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Rubinium Nitrate.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
We will hit a very strong laser beam.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
This strong laser beam will have a non-linear interaction with a very weak beam.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
Then produce another conjugate,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
another intangle beam.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
How are they produced?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
I will introduce a little later.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
How do they produce this twin beam?

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
I want to talk about 4-Way Missing.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
4-Way Missing.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Total is 4 beams.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
But we only put 2 beams in.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Then 3 beams will be produced.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
There will be a more detailed explanation of the pattern later.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
How is this produced?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Thank you.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Can I ask a question?

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
What is 4WM?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
4 is 4.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
W is 4-Way Missing.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Or translated into Chinese,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
it is 4-Way Missing.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
4-Way Missing.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I should say that it is the abbreviation of this.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
My standard abbreviation.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
Does it mean that 4 waves are mixed together?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Yes.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But you only have 2 beams.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
I will show you a picture of the conjugate later.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Then everyone will be confused.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
Did you just say that these 2 beams are added or subtracted?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Added.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Because they are...

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Actually, they said that the intensity of the beam is 1.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Then the intensity of the beam will have a magnification ratio.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
The magnification ratio is G.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
So the light coming out is G.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Then the other conjugate beam is G-1.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
So they even put that...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Originally it was Coherent State.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
If it has a magnification effect,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
it will become Thermal State.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
That is to say, it is no longer the original laser beam.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It is a very messy light.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
After the two conjugates are subtracted,

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
you will see the effect of the twin.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
They become very messy together.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But when they are subtracted,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
they will see that they are actually very beautiful and become messy together.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
OK, thank you.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
May I ask a question?

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
So what is the power of these laser beams?

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
My pump power is about 750mW.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It's quite big.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Of course, it can't be compared to super fast light.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
We are continuous wave.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
OK, you also answered my second question.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Sorry, let's continue.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
The result we did is...

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
There is a relatively influential improvement.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
Our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
When you want to look at the magnification compression,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
the lower the frequency,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
the greater the interference in other environments.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
For example, you walk over there.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Or you have a call coming in.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
These may have some interference in your system.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Then it will cause you to be unable to see the so-called squeeze light at a very low frequency.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
That is, the compression of the magnification.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Even if there is a car driving on the main road,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
it will have a great impact.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
So our lab is doing experiments in such a deep basement.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Our result is...

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Anyway, our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
In recent years, we have broken through the following three orders.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
From Kilohertz down to about 1,000 times to a few Hertz.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
You can see the effect of the magnification compression.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Especially like the gravitational wave measurement I introduced at the beginning.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
It must be seen at a very low frequency.

12:48.000 --> 12:55.000
Because theoretical mathematicians have calculated the magnitude of the gravitational wave.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
So if you can only see the squeeze light of Kilohertz,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
you can't use it to do these gravitational wave measurements.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
So in the past ten years,

13:09.000 --> 13:19.000
this squeeze light has been developed in such a way that it can still have this effect at a very low frequency.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
In the future, it will be possible to measure the gravitational wave.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
In the result of our experiment,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
there will be some applications in image processing.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
Because you want to see if you can pass the image through a very weak light.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Then maybe you can do some biological experiments.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
A lot of low light hits your sample.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Then you can get rid of these impurities.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Then you can see the signal very clearly.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
So it has some applications in biology.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Then it can even do some correction.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
And it's a quantum correction.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Then I will continue to introduce it later.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
This is our 4-way missing.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
So on the right, we are.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
This is our wafer cell.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I drew the picture like this.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
The length of this wafer cell is about two centimeters long.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
Then the diameter is about an inch.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Anyway, it's a very small cell.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
Then you put a very strong pump beam in.

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
Then the strength of this pump beam is about 450 mW.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
Then it will interact with the other very weak beam.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Then you look at the link map on the left.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
There are a lot of links in it.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
But we only care about the link that we will call.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
This lambda type link.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
It should be quite common to do quantum computing.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
There may be something very famous in quantum computing.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's called EIT.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Slow light storage technology.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Basically, it's quite similar to that.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
For example, you hit a very strong pump beam.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Very strong pump beam.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Then it will interact with your probe beam.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Then this very strong pump beam.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
It also interacts with the ground state on the other side.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Then because of energy conservation.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
So it releases the fourth conjugate beam.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
So you only hit two beams in.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
But in a continuous operation.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
It actually acts like there are four waves interacting with each other.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Two of the four waves are the same pump beam.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
So this pump beam is at the same time as these two ground states.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
What you want to see is that.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
In addition to energy conservation.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
It actually has to meet the other momentum conservation.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Then we usually don't talk about momentum conservation.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
We also talk about phase matching.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
In other words, this wave pump beam.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
In addition to interacting with the probe beam.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
The momentum inside.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
That is to say, the pump beam and the probe beam have a very small angle.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
About 0.3, 0.4 degrees.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Then we have four waves.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
So the total momentum of this pump beam.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
There will be two.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
Then it will produce another conjugate beam.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So it's in the other direction.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Then you see.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
When you have any phase fluctuation.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Or any frequency fluctuation.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It has to meet this.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Momentum energy conservation rate.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
So any fluctuation has to make it consistent.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
So this is a bit.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
This is a more general way to explain.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Because they have to be energy conservative.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Momentum conservation.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
So any fluctuation.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
The fluctuations must be consistent.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
In order to meet this condition at the same time.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
That's how it produces the twin beam.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
This is some of our experimental conditions.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Then you will see this delta.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Big delta.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
This big delta is about 1.3GHz.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
It's a pretty far detune.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Because of our experiment.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
In fact, our entire group is called.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Laser cooling and tracking.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Our group is called.

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
Laser cooling and tracking team.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Research team is like this.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
One of us.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Our big boss is.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
We have a big boss.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Then there are four teachers below.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Then I did this.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
The only thing is to do it with heat source.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
This heat source is about 120°C.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
We have to heat it up.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Then let it become a vapor.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So at the beginning, someone just asked.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Are we using crystal or what?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
We are not using crystal.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
If you use crystal.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
There are other.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Also doing.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Or doing that kind of twin beam.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
In fact, they are doing single mode.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Anyway, crystal can also be used to do that.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Squeeze line.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
But.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Anyway, some principles are still a bit different.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
We might use.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
K3 is the third stage.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
If it is crystal, it may be K2.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
There are some differences in nature.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
That's right.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Then the next one is.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
We are several.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
This one is about ten years ago.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Experimental results.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
That.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
You will see that.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Ten years ago.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We actually used TESAFA laser.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
To do this experiment.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
That.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
TESAFA laser is.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Its feature is that it is very expensive.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
That's about.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
One or two decades ago.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
We.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Buy a TESAFA.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
About.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
More than 200,000 dollars.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Then now it is more than 200,000.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Or its.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Power becomes stronger.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
That's right.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
You see.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
The company is doing this experiment.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
You need to have one.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Very expensive.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
TESAFA laser.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
More than 200,000 dollars.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
This.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
This is not practical at all.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
So.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
We started to develop.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Cheaper.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Then again.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
It is a dilutable.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Laser light source.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
That's it.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
What about the TESAFA laser we used at the beginning?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Go again.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
When doing this low-frequency quantization.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
There is a.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Ah.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Should I talk about this first?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Experimental map.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What does it mean?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
That is.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Here you will see the blue line here.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
The blue line here is the so-called shot noise.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Then I just started.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Not to say.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Laser light.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
It is coherent state.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
What about coherent state?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
In fact.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
One of its features is that.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Its impurities.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Will not change.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
That is to say.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
You are measuring.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
You are now inserting a light.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
This.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
This picture has pink.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
This light.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Insert.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Then you use this photodial.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
To detect this.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Then send it in.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Spectrum analyzer.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
That is.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Spectrum.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Spectrum analyzer.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
That.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
This spectrum analyzer will tell you.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
This.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
How much is the impurity of the frequency of this light?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
If you insert this light.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
It's a laser.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
It's a coherent state.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Its impurities.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Its impurities.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Will not change.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
According to the frequency of your measurement.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Just like this blue light.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
The blue.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The curve is like this.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
We insert a light.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Then use a beam splitter.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Divide this light into half.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Then divide it into half.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Then subtract these two.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Then do the measurement of this impurity.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Then why do these two subtract?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Because.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
You can also.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
You can only measure one light.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
That is.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
You can also get a similar answer.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It's just the impurity power.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
If you measure one light.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
The impurity power will be halved.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
If you measure two lights.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The impurity power will be doubled.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
That's it.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
There is another one.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
The reason we want to divide it into two lights.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
That is.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
In fact, although the laser light is a coherent state.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
But it's in the low frequency.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
There are all kinds of impurities.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Will come in.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
If you don't use two lights.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
If you don't use two lights.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
You can't put those.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
The so-called classical impurity.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Or the technical impurity.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Eliminate it.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
So you have to use.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Use one light.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Divide it into two.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Then do the subtraction.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Then measure the impurity.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
This is the so-called.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
I will talk about it later.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It is the so-called shot noise.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
It's called the mega shot.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Its frequency.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It should always be flat.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
This is a.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Our field is a very.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Ah.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I didn't know this was a common thing before I came in.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Then now.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Okay, this is the coherent state.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
The impurity must be.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
The so-called.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The so-called two-color frequency has changed.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
So it's the so-called shot noise.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
What about the red light?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
This is what I just produced.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Glow beam.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I am not.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
I am now.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
To be more specific.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
The setting of our experiment is to say.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I hit a pump beam.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Then.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Hit another glow beam.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Then these two.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Intensity.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
The pump beam.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Its intensity is about 10,000 times as strong as the glow beam.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yes.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Then it goes through this non-linear.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Element.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
The element plus.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
After the effect.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It will produce this glow beam.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
This glow beam is amplified.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Then it will also produce another one.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Conjugate beam.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
So they are a twin.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Then after these two lights are cut off.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I call it.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Intensity.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Difference.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Squeezing.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Or in other words, it is squeeze.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
In other words, it is squeeze light.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Then these two lights.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
That is to say.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
We will.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
To control the light of this input.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Then let the power of the output light.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
With these two lights.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
The power of these two shot noise lights is exactly the same.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Then you will see.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
When we.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
If I have the so-called.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Squeeze light.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Squeeze light.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
My two intensity.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Difference.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
This is weaker than my shot noise.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Sorry.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
Let me ask.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
So the frequency of your four lights should be.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
What is the range?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Because.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
So the frequency below you should be.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
The frequency of the big noise.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Right?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Ah.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
It should not be called big noise.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Because these two.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
The frequency of these two lights is different.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yes.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
You look at the left picture.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Have you seen this cross-section?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Yes.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So you have two pink lights.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Is it a wave of visible light?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
He.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
In fact, he is a distant infrared light.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Light of 795nm.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Ah.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Yes.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
So that.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
That is also right.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
A few hundred terahertz.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Right?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yes.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
So you.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
So you just.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
The next page.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
That one.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Um.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
The following frequency is kilohertz.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Is it the difference between the two?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
My.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
The problem is.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Is.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
The frequency on both sides.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
You.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
You want to see.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
You.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
You have a side wave now.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Correct.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Then this side wave has a side wave frequency.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Right?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
But I.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I am now.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
I.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm talking about.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
These noise.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
To do.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Negative analysis.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Of.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Noise frequency.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Not to say.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
My whole side wave.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
What is the frequency?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Not this frequency.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
But this noise.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
He has his own frequency.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
He has.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
So.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
So you just.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Your next page.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
The noise.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Your next page.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Spectrum is.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
These noise.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Spectrum.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Not the light itself.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Spectrum.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Yes.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
That is.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
His noise.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Just make sure.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Um.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Good.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Thank you.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Continue.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Because like.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Light.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Light has his.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
His distribution.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
So.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Anyway, he.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
He actually.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Anyway, he.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
He.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
There will be a.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Distribution of noise.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
That.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
If it is.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
His distribution of noise.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
That is to say.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
His frequency.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
The noise.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
The power should be the same.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
This.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
That.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Uh.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Here.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
For missing noise.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That is.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I do.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Intensity difference.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
When.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
The noise.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
That.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Uh.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
That red.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
This.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
The noise of the customer.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Only left.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
The original.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Only 17%.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
His.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
His noise is.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
It's actually very weak.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
That's right.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
The focus here is to say.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
You can see.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Hey.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
When it's low.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
There are some small peaks.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
In fact.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
This small peak.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
That is.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
This.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Very expensive.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
There are very stupid.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
The disadvantages of TESLA.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Because.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
There will be cavities in it.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
That.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
This.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Cavity will.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Causing him.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Will have these.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
The noise.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Run out.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
So.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
When you are in low frequency.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Will receive these.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
Cavity noise.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Affect.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
You can't see it.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Very low frequency.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Mass noise.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Compression.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Right.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
That.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Assuming that.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Uh.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
We are.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
When doing experiments.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Sometimes put the laser.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Will lock the laser.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
What does it mean to lock the laser?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Just let.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Its frequency is fixed.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
It won't float around.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Or let.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Its width.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Narrow.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
That.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
The meaning of the line width narrowing.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
That is to say.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
I have a sine now.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
That.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Your.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Is your sine a very simple sine?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Or.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Your sine.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Sine.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Or.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
There is a plane.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
The sine.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
That is to say.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
This plane.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
That is to say.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm talking about.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Right.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
This plane.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Right.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
That.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Okay.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
That's about it.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
So.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
So.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
There is a picture here.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
That is to say.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Let's measure.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
TESLA.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
This.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
When we lock the laser.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
You will find that.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
This.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
The blue dash 9.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Is.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
That is.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
When we do time.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
We just.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Anyway, just hit the light.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Hit in.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Fiber.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Then go.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
To measure its.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Line width.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Right.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
You will see that it is probably.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Maybe a few.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
A few hundred.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Or a few dozen.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Kilohertz.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
The blue dash 9.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Its width is probably.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Maybe a few dozen.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Kilohertz.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
So.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
So.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Narrow.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
It's pretty beautiful.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
But.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It's getting worse.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
This is.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
The disadvantage of TESLA laser.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
That is to say.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
You lock up.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
In fact.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Your frequency is fixed.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
But.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
The quality of your laser.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
It's getting worse.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Right.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Then you have to.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
Put it.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Line width becomes narrower.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
In fact.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
It will be quite complicated.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Then we look at another.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Red curve.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
This red curve.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Is.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
2D laser.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Then.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
When you haven't locked up.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
It's like this.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It's dash 9.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Red dash 9.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
It's.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
About a few.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Megahertz.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
So wide.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
But when we lock up.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
After.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
This red line.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
It becomes very narrow.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
It's probably a few.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
Probably.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Even less than.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
A kilohertz.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
So narrow.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Line width.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
So.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
For 2D laser.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
It may.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Our laser.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
2D laser.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
About.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
Only 20,000 to 30,000 dollars.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
So.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
So it is also.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Relative to.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
It's a lot cheaper than.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
TESLA.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
About.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
One TESLA.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
You can buy.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
About nine.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
2D laser.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Like this.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
But.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
2D laser.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
It's actually.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Its.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Light is weaker.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Correct.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Then this is another team.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
In.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Australian.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Experimental research.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Then he is.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
I just forgot.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Who asked.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
That is.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
They are using.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Crystal to do.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Then their method.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
It's not called.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
4-way missing.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Then their method.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
It's called.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
What is OPO?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Ah.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Important.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Correct.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
This is.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
This is another kind of use.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Ah.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
In the way of opening.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
To do.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
Squeeze line.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Then they.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
This.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
This picture on the left.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
You will see this black.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
This.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
This straight line.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Is the so-called.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Shot noise.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Shot noise.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I just said.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Laser light noise.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Then you will see.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
There are other.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Very messy line.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
There are red lines.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
Blue line.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Red line.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Black line.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Blue line.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Then you will see.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
There is a power here.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
That is to say.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
His power.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
From 6.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
From 6.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Microwave.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Down to.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
0.7.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Microwave.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Down to a few.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Power.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
When.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
You will see.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
His.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
Miscellaneous.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Low frequency.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
When.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Getting weaker and weaker.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Correct.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
That.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
In fact, this piece of paper.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
He.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
I don't know.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Why.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Will be like this.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Anyway, they are.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
They are a record.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
That is to say.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
It's at 280 Hz.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
That.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
That.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
In fact, we already know.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Why.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
That.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
He.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Because.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
It's his own problem.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
So there will be some.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Some.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Peak.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Noise.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Is particularly strong.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
But.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
These are not important.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
The point is.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
He can be very low.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Very low frequency.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
More than 200 Hz.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Can still.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
See.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
The effect of the noise reduction.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
As long as it is below zero.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Is.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
The effect of the reduction.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
That.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Blue line.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
With black line.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Oh, no.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
The red line and the black line.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Is.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
At low frequency.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
There are a lot of.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Classic noise.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Basic noise.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
It's hard to see.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Noise reduction.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Effect.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Especially when.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
It's very powerful.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
When.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
That.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
This.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Next.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
These are.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
That.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Is.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
