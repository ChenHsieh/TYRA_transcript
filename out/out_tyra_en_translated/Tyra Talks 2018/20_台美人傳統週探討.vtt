00:00.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome everyone to today's Taira speech, and I am the host today, Bo Xuan, and I am very happy that this is the first Taira history speech today, and the speaker today is Hong Qi Ting, who is currently a doctoral candidate for the history of Santa Barbara.

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
And now the main focus is American history, Asian American research, as well as the Cold War and Taiwan-US relations. I think these studies are quite important.

00:33.000 --> 00:42.000
And today Qiqi is going to talk about the traditional Taira people, so let's not talk too much and let Qiqi start the speech.

00:43.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello everyone, it's an honor to be here for the first time, and I feel a little sorry for everyone, because I didn't do much.

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
And my position today is that I personally hope that everyone can give me some feedback.

01:01.000 --> 01:15.000
In fact, the topic I am going to talk about today is a part of my paper, because my paper mainly wants to study the role and importance of Taiwanese Americans in Taiwan's democratization and current Taiwan-US relations.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
This topic is about the traditional Taira people, and I think it is a very important part of my paper.

01:22.000 --> 01:34.000
The reason is that the traditional Taira people are in May, the whole month is a day to commemorate the multi-ethnicity of the United States.

01:34.000 --> 01:51.000
And every May, it seems that the Jews and the Asians are all in May, and there will be a lot of commemorative activities related to the culture of the Taira people throughout the month.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
This event can be said to be the most important event in the year of the Taira community, so I think this topic is very important to my paper.

01:59.000 --> 02:11.000
It can be seen as a small fragment of how the Taira community mobilizes, organizes, and designs such activities to promote themselves internally and externally.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
From this process, we can understand how the community of Taira people is formed, so it is a very important part of my paper.

02:19.000 --> 02:34.000
Before I get to that point, I would like to mention that there is a national newspaper in the United States called the Pacific Times, which has a history of about 30 years.

02:34.000 --> 02:43.000
It is the most influential Chinese newspaper in the United States or the entire North American region.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
Their editor-in-chief asked me to write a topic like this, so I think this opportunity is very rare.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
After I finish sorting out the information, I will publish it in the Pacific Times.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
If I have time, I might turn it into English and see if I can post it in other newspapers.

03:03.000 --> 03:21.000
For example, in May, when many Taira people started to promote traditional Chinese activities, they could take this information and introduce it to members of Congress in the United States or local communities, such as high school students.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
If the audience of the article is different, the angle of discussion will be different.

03:29.000 --> 03:55.000
So my current position is that how can I get the Taira people who are organizing this event and the Taiwan Committee to review the history and think about how we can improve in the future.

03:55.000 --> 04:15.000
I have participated in two presentations as an audience, and the speaker has been talking about a very complete topic, which is his own research.

04:15.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm not sure what my argument is, so I hope that if you have any questions, you can always ask me.

04:31.000 --> 04:39.000
Because I think that way I can make my own thoughts clearer and I will know what is important and what is interesting.

04:39.000 --> 04:51.000
This way, my article will be better written, so I hope to interact more and I hope to have a lot of questions, which can be a variety of questions.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Hello, I have a question.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Zhang Yan has a question.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Okay, go ahead.

04:55.000 --> 05:04.000
So about this, I will ask a very basic question. What is the definition of Taipei people?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
That's a very good question.

05:08.000 --> 05:28.000
The definition of Taipei people is that you are a descendant of Taiwan, your parents are Taiwanese, or you are a Taiwanese immigrant.

05:28.000 --> 05:42.000
Then you have an American nationality, and your wife is American, and she marries you, and she becomes half Taiwanese American.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
Or you are the fourth generation, and your grandfather is Taiwanese.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
They are all considered Taiwanese American.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Anyway, you are the same as the black man, as long as you have a drop of blood, you are Taiwanese.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
They all count.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Then you have the right to be an American citizen, and you can be praised as a Taiwanese American.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
But there is one thing that I think must be included in it, which is your own identity.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Because this thing is also related to Taiwan's history.

06:13.000 --> 06:21.000
Although Taiwan is not mainstream, but some people think it is Chinese, it is not Taiwanese.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
And I'm talking about the Chinese, it's not that I'm Chinese, I'm Taiwanese.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Some people think he is a member of the People's Republic of China.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
I will not draw that kind of person in the range of Taiwanese American.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And the other thing I want to talk about is this holiday.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
In fact, he has, I think, behind my own research, more and more, I found that he was behind the politics with the Taiwan government.

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
The political component of the US government-Taiwan-US relationship is actually there.

06:55.000 --> 07:04.000
For example, in the eight years of Ma Ying-jeou's administration, the Taiwanese American society in the United States.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Basically, they hold a traditional week every year.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
But they didn't take money from the Taiwanese government, and they didn't ask the Standing Committee for help.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Many of the elders I'm visiting now, they just say that we don't need to take the money from the Kuomintang.

07:17.000 --> 07:27.000
Yes, and now that Tsai Ing-wen is in power, some people think, ah, forget it, we can still work with the government.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
So I think behind this, he's actually not just a very pure cultural thing.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
He also has some political identity of Taiwanese people.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
And the Taiwanese American as a very special group of people.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
When I talk about Taiwanese American, I think of Taiwanese American.

07:45.000 --> 07:55.000
Because from my research, from 1950 to 19, there are a lot of people coming from Taiwan to the United States.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
But not everyone thinks they are Taiwanese American.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
About half of the people think they are Chinese American.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
So this thing is a very important difference.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
So to answer your question, I would say that the first thing is related to blood.

08:14.000 --> 08:24.000
Your family, your gene, there is such a link between Taiwanese people.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Then you are now an American citizen.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Then another thing is identity.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
I think it must also be considered.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
So in other words, if you are actually in the Taiwanese American, identity can also be allowed in many ways, right?

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
Because it is possible that Lin Shuhao, although he is related to Taiwan,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
but he does not necessarily feel that Taiwan is his home or something like that.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
If this is also considered Taiwanese American?

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
This question depends on which context you are discussing.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
For example, Lin Shuhao, his parents, his great-grandparents seem to still be in Taiwan, right?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
So he will travel to Taiwan.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Then he will go fishing in Taiwan.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
He will go to Taiwan to eat dumplings.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Fishing is a very open event.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
He was not asked if he was Chinese or Taiwanese.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
He just came to that place because of his great-grandparents.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
So when he has a vacation, he will want to go to that place.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
I think in that context, he is Taiwanese, there is no problem.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
But if today is a very special occasion.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
For example, he was asked if he was going to play in China.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Then you have to admit that you are Chinese American and he is Taiwanese American.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
At that time, I think it is a totally different story.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
And this kind of contradiction, this kind of entanglement is actually not just Taiwanese Americans.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Taiwanese people will also face this kind of problem.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Now there are 31 meetings in Taiwan.

09:56.000 --> 10:05.000
I don't want to make any judgment.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Everyone has their own way to survive, right?

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
It's just that when he's on that occasion, he's bound to change his identity.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Then it won't be a topic for me to discuss.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
Because when I say that Taipei people are a highly political issue.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
It's because in my paper, I want to make an argument.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
That is to say, my question, my paper has a very big problem.

10:29.000 --> 10:39.000
Taiwanese Americans as a person who immigrated to the United States under a very special Taiwan-US relationship during the Cold War.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Their experience is very different from Chinese Americans.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
If you have read the book Asian American History.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
If you read Chinese American, his story, his argument is all the way from this 19th century.

10:55.000 --> 11:02.000
Chinese workers came to the United States to help the plantation workers.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Then help to build the railway.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Then in the 20th century, it was a slum movement.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Then everyone is hiding in Chinatown.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Then they all have long braids and then they eat rat meat.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Very, very different image.

11:14.000 --> 11:24.000
Then after the 1950s, the Chinese American image is that they are a group of refugees from the Communist Party of China to the free world.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Then I got to Taiwan.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Then I got to Hong Kong.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
In that sense, Taiwanese immigrants were placed in this whole line from the 19th century.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
Chinese workers, then the slum movement, then the refugees.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
To understand Taiwan in this context.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I think it's very problematic.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
Because the first thing is that in the 19th century, we didn't have anyone.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
At that time, we were still in the Qing Dynasty.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
We moved from China to Taiwan for the second time.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
We are not discussing the context of Chinese Americans.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
Then in the second to 20th century, the group of people who lived in Chinatown because of the Paihua Act.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Also with our impression, our memory is different.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Because in the 20th century, Taiwan was ruled by Japan at that time.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Most people want to immigrate.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
For example, my grandfather went to Japan to study, not to the United States.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
The United States is not the main immigration place in Taiwan.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
The United States has become the most important place for Taiwanese immigrants.

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
And even in the 1960s, the most important immigration country.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
It started after the Cold War.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
So Taiwan's immigration to the United States is actually a very modern, very cold war story.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
If you don't emphasize this, you will become a Taiwanese-American, Chinese-American.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
I think a lot of people think that if you read the textbooks, or you read the textbooks.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
A paradigm that has been established seems to be unbreakable.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
You will take it for granted.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Yes, we are Chinese-Americans.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
We are like that.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But I think this is the first thing.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
The first thing is that he simplifies the story.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
The story is not that simple.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
Second, identity in American society is a self-claim.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
You can say what you are not.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
You can say what you are.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
No one can force you to say who you are.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
This is the case in American society.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.000
So I think because we have this space, we should go even better.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
Even if Taiwan and China are in a very complicated situation in Asia,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
it doesn't mean that you are already in the United States.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
You have become a Taiwanese-American citizen in the United States.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
You have no right to say that you are a Taiwanese-American, not a Chinese-American.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
So I think behind this, this Taiwanese-American,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
he is what I want to use, my argument.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
There is a very important argument in my paper.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
I want to bring up the Taiwanese-American, independent of the Chinese-American.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
And why can this Taiwanese-American be independent of the Chinese-American story or argument?

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
In fact, it is a very special experience of Taiwanese-Americans immigrating to the United States during the Cold War.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And what is that very special experience?

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
That is, under the martial law of Taiwan, many people came to the United States in order to oppose the Kuomintang.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
Then, oh, no, it should be said that they came to the United States under the martial law of the Kuomintang.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
After they accepted a lot of liberal ideas, progressive ideas,

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
they began to oppose that authoritarian rule and then to promote Taiwan's democracy.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
The most obvious example is the Paris era.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
After the Melita incident in 1979,

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
where can those refugees like Xu Xinliang be accommodated?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Most of them came to the United States.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
Then you can also know that every time something happens,

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
money and international aid are mainly provided in the United States and Canada.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
One argument is that because of the experience of Taiwanese-Americans immigrating to the United States,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
there is a connection with the opposition to authoritarian rule.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
After you connect them together, you will find that this is very different from the Chinese-American context.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
You should not mix them together and say that they are all Chinese-American.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
Then the second one is that when studying the democratization movement in Taiwan,

15:18.000 --> 15:24.000
in fact, the role of overseas Taiwanese is not given enough attention.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
It seems to be just a side story.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
But I don't think so. I think it is actually very important.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
And this importance, especially after the Democratic Progressive Party came to power,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
I think it should be emphasized more.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Yes, I'm a little far away now.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
OK. Hello, is everyone still there?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
We are all still there.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
OK, OK, OK.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Are there any more questions?

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
I would like to ask if you are sharing the screen now or have not started yet?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I haven't started yet.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
OK.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
If you want to share the screen, you can confirm it.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Because I'm afraid you won't be able to share it.

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
OK, I'll press share first and then press my screen.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Can you see it like this?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Not yet.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But I'm already on my screen.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Now you...

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Let me think.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
My computer is now on my screen.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
Then you jump back to BlueJeans.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Then BlueJeans, you slide down from the middle.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
You should see a share screen at the bottom.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
A rectangular blue button.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Yes.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
OK.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Then...

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
You should be able to choose after you press it.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Yes.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
1 or 2?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Now we can see it.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Then you can press play.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
OK.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
OK.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm recording.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Is it recording now?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yes, yes, yes.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
OK.

17:07.000 --> 17:12.000
So the topic I'm going to talk about today is Taiwanese traditional porridge.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
My PowerPoint is actually very simple.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Just four pages.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
So you're welcome to ask any questions you have.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
My structure is also very simple.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
What I'm going to talk about is...

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
What is Taiwanese traditional porridge?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And why is it important?

17:33.000 --> 17:41.000
Before we start, I'd like to ask if anyone has participated in a traditional porridge event in the U.S.?

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
We have three people here.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Hello?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
I'm going to help with the traditional porridge next week.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Where are you going to help?

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
There's a circus troupe coming from Ann Arbor.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
Are you going to Chicago or Michigan?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
They're probably going to perform in Chicago.

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
But the elders have brought them to Ann Arbor for a one-night show.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
So there's a show in your city, too?

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Yes, there's a vacancy here.

18:21.000 --> 18:28.000
So you're going to see it and help with the venue?

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm going to help with the venue.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Oh, OK.

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
I interviewed Professor Li Xianglan from your city.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
I think he's in charge of the committee in Chicago.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
He told me about the event in your city.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
I haven't participated in it myself.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm going to participate this year.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
I'll post a link to the event in LA.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
Let's take a look at the event.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
This is the LA schedule.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
You can see from April 21st to June 16th.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
It's been over a month.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
LA is special because it has the most Taiwanese in the U.S.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So there are a lot of circus troupes here.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
If there are a lot of circus troupes, there will be a lot of shows.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
So you can compare it to Chicago.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
There are a lot of Taiwanese, but not as many as there are here.

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
So what I know now is that there's an event in Chicago.

19:42.000 --> 19:50.000
There's a local singer from Taiwan.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
There's a show from the committee.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
There's a teacher from the Taiwan Food Association.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
He's in charge of a food event.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
There are a lot of circus troupes in LA.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
So there are a lot of activities.

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
If you look at the schedule, you can see there are a few types of activities.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
The most popular one is the food tour.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
It's on May 20th in LA.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
It's in a park in Montreal Park.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It's a whole day's event.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
In addition to the food tour, there are also live performances.

20:39.000 --> 20:56.000
In the major cities I know, including LA, San Diego, Chicago, and DC,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
there are also food tours.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
In addition to food, you can also see in LA.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I think it's a special event.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
It's not just about performing, eating, and playing.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
There are also community service events.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
For example, today in LA, there's an event to clean up the LA River.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
It's to contribute to the local community.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
I also know that there's a dentist in Taiwan.

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
Some doctors provide free dental services.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
I also know that there's another thing to do with the local community.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
In many places, other than LA, there's also one in San Diego.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
When there's a bridge, they'll donate money.

21:45.000 --> 21:51.000
At the opening of the traditional week, there's a high school scholarship.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
It's not limited to Taiwanese children.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
It also includes people of other ethnicities.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
For example, in San Diego, they give six places every year.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
It's stipulated that four of them must be foreigners.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Last year, they gave an Arab.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
It seems to be a refugee.

22:11.000 --> 22:20.000
He came to the United States and applied for a scholarship to support his financial needs.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I also know that there's another one in San Diego.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
It seems to be from Syria.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
When you look at the traditional week in Taipei,

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
you'll see that it's not just about promoting Taiwanese culture.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
This is a very important goal.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
At the same time, there's also outreach.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It's connected to the local community.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
It allows the local community to know more about Taiwan.

22:49.000 --> 22:59.000
There are three different activities in the traditional week.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
I'll talk about this later.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
Let's take a look at what the activities are about.

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
Why is there a traditional week?

23:16.000 --> 23:27.000
In 1992, President Bush announced that May was the traditional month of the Asian-Taiwanese in the United States.

23:27.000 --> 23:34.000
In fact, the traditional week in Taipei is put in the context of the Asian-Taiwanese traditional month.

23:34.000 --> 23:43.000
The main purpose is for the U.S. government to praise the Taiwanese and Asians for their contributions to American society.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Why is it chosen in May?

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
May has a very important relationship with the history of the Asian-Taiwanese in the United States.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
There are two reasons for choosing May.

23:53.000 --> 24:02.000
The first reason is that the first wave of Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States in May 1843.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
The second reason for choosing May is that the cross-strait railway was completed in 1869.

24:11.000 --> 24:28.000
More and more people believe that the cross-strait railway in the United States was built by Chinese laborers.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
For example, the 101 in Taiwan was built by Taiwanese laborers.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
The 101 is our icon, but it was built by foreign laborers.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Sorry, I have a question from the audience.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
I want to ask how you define culture and what is Taiwan culture?

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
My paper also discusses relevant issues, so I want to discuss it.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
This is a question from Annie.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
This is a very good question.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
This is a very good question.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Because I actually have a question mark where I look at the end.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
So, when we get to the end, when I talk about the wrap-up,

25:10.000 --> 25:19.000
I will discuss my own observations of the activities of traditional music.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Actually, it will be there soon.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Because I only have four PowerPoint slides.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
So, I will write down my question.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
I will answer it together at the end.

25:32.000 --> 25:46.000
So, this event was chosen in May because of its contribution to American history with two Asian ethnic groups.

25:46.000 --> 25:56.000
Because of the history of Japanese and Chinese, it was decided to be held in May.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
In 1992, Asian traditional music began to be played.

26:03.000 --> 26:13.000
In 1999, during the Clinton administration, the US Congress, in order to praise Taiwanese for their contributions to the United States,

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
decided to separate Taiwanese from the United States.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
So, in May, you can choose a specific state.

26:23.000 --> 26:31.000
Now I know that a lot of people will choose the state of Mother's Day as Taiwanese American Heritage Week.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
This has become a trademark.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
It is Taiwanese American Heritage Week, not Chinese American, not Asian American.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
It has its own independence.

26:42.000 --> 26:53.000
This is very important because it is related to the organizer's outreach to the local community.

26:53.000 --> 27:02.000
When there is a Taiwanese American trademark, it can promote Taiwan and China in private.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
So, there is a diplomatic connection behind it.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
I will talk about this later.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
So, this is Taiwanese American Heritage Week.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
But there is an exception.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
I know that there are a lot of Taiwanese in D.C.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
But they did not come out of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States independently.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
Instead, they celebrated the Asian American Heritage Month together.

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
I think this is an exception.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
I don't know why they don't particularly emphasize Taiwanese American Heritage Week.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Maybe because it's in D.C.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
It's more political sensitive.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
So, they don't want to cause trouble.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
So, they put it in the context of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
It can avoid some tensions.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
But other places, other than D.C.,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
Taiwanese communities in other places, when they celebrate May,

28:00.000 --> 28:09.000
they put the Taiwanese American Heritage Month in the context of the traditional state of Taiwan and the United States.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
So, why is this important?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
There are three levels.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
For the American society,

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
the reason why they set up this month to commemorate

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
is to praise the contribution of American minorities to American society.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
In addition, they want to promote multiculturalism.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
So, for the American society,

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
this is their main position on this event.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
For the Taipei community,

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
it is an important event to establish,

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
gather, and strengthen ethnic identity.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
I want to share this.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
When I was writing this article,

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
I wanted to understand the different dynamics in different places.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
So, I visited different areas, different generations, and different positions.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Some people are just participants.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Some people have participated in many events,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and they are the main organizers.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
From the perspective of different people,

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
I wanted to understand the different meanings of this event for different people.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I found it very interesting.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Older people,

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
people who came to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
the first generation,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
when the traditional state began,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
they were the founding fathers.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
For them, this month,

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
this kind of commemorative event,

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
of course, it is important to let the mainstream society know them.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
However, because their English is not good enough,

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
it seems that the younger generation of Compare

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
is not able to fit into the mainstream society.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
How can we use the language that is familiar to the mainstream society

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
to talk about this culture,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
to talk about this tradition?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Their ability is relatively lacking.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So, when they organize this event,

30:10.000 --> 30:17.000
they tend to serve the people in their own community.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
For example,

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
when I visited the organizer in the Bay Area,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
he said,

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
his name is Cai Hejie.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
He is a second-generation American.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
He grew up in Illinois in the Midwest.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
He is very special.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
He does not speak Chinese at all.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
He often goes to Taiwan.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
He is an American,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and he is not studying Humanities.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
He studied Engineering in college,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
and now he is a physician.

30:50.000 --> 30:56.000
He is a second-generation American.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
Anyway, he is such a person.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I asked him,

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
why do you want to participate in this event?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
What is the significance of this event to you?

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
He said,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
he used to be a white person in the Central Department.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
So, he had an identity crisis when he was young.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
He felt that

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
in American society,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
either you are a white person,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
or you are not a white person.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
What kind of person is not a white person?

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
He was born in the 1970s.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
He said that

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
when he was a teenager,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
the mainstream American society

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
did not have enough nutrients

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
to tell him what kind of person is not a white person.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
He was confused.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I asked him this question

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
because I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Although their parents are Taiwanese,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
their grandparents are in Taiwan,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
but their interest in Taiwan

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
is very superficial.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
They say,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I will go back to Taiwan to see my grandpa.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Taiwan has pearl milk tea.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Pearl milk tea and stinky tofu are delicious in Taiwan.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Other than pearl milk tea and stinky tofu,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
he has zero understanding of Taiwan.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Many people do not speak Chinese.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I know a lot of people

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
who are more concerned about Taiwan.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I know a lot of people

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
who are more concerned about Taiwan.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The United States is the place

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
where they choose to settle down.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
The United States is the place

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
where they choose to settle down.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Although Taiwan has a Taiwanese

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
ethnic concept,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Taiwan is a foreign country

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
and is not important.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Taiwan is a foreign country

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
and is not important.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I know a lot of second-generation Taiwanese.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Many people are white-washed.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Many people are white-washed.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Many people are white-washed.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
When they look at the identity,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
they are more concerned about

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
their professional career.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
For example,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I am a doctor.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I have a lot to do with my community.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I have a lot to do with my community.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I don't care if I am Asian

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I don't care if I am Asian

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
or if I am white.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
or if I am white.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Ethnicity is not something they care about.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Ethnicity is not something they care about.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
There are a lot of people

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
who choose this option

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
who choose this option

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
in the Taiwanese community.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
in the Taiwanese community.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Cai Hejie is very special.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Cai Hejie is very special.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
He made me feel that

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
he made me feel that

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
he understands Taiwanese people.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
He doesn't blame them.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
He doesn't blame them.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
He doesn't blame them.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
He doesn't blame them.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
He thinks that

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Taiwanese American identity

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Taiwanese American identity

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
is important

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
and he is willing to spend a lot of time

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
and he is willing to spend a lot of time

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
on this issue.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
on this issue.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
a completes your choices

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
a completes your choices

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
doesn't matter

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
doesn't matter

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
because it is your choice.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
because it is your choice.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
because it is your choice.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
He started in Ilino

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
He started in Ilino

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
then moved to San Francisco

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
then moved to San Francisco

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
He has been participating in various activities

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
He has been participating in various activities

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
but he is more concerned about the activities of Taiwanese

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
but he is more concerned about the activities of Taiwanese

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
He even has an online website

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
He even has an online website

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
called Taiwanese American.org

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I read a lot of things

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I read a lot of things

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I think it is great

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
If you are interested

Sapporo

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Sapporo

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Now these young people

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
generation after

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
there is a big change like me

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
For example, I went to visit the organizer

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
in Portland. He said

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
that his previous activities were

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
usually held in a high school

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
and then in the auditorium of the high school

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
he felt like that

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
he was not so satisfied he felt

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
he could do better

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
so he last year and the year before

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
when the general recruitment

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
he rented a venue in the city of Portland

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Yes, but he is very advanced

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and that venue because he is a

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
mainstream society everyone wants to go

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to see the show to listen to the concert will go to that place

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
so you are holding an event in that place

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
you can use his platform to promote

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
to do a lot of promotion

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and outreach work

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
so his visibility

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
suddenly increased

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
from this example you can reflect

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
for the older generation

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
of course, on the one hand, they have their own

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
limitation and then on the other hand

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
because

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
they are not fit in

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
so it seems that one of the purposes of this event

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
is to serve their own community

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
so in the end

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
it becomes a community

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
but the new generation

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
of the younger generation

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
because of their ability to adapt to culture

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
or the ability to interact

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
with different cultures

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
so in addition to being able to

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
internalize

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
and also to build

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
this Taiwanese American identity

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
to do such a

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
cultural construction

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
it can actually outreach to the

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
mainstream society of the United States

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
so that the mainstream society of the United States can understand

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
what is the Taiwanese American Heritage Week

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
so I think

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
this is a different generation

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
they are organizing

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
such an event

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
they have a lot of different ideas

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
this is different

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
at the same time the reason is

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
different generations

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
have the ability to interpret

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
culture and have the ability to

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
interact with different cultures

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
and then it also reflects

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
different generations

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
what is the positioning of this event

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
my own observation is

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
now the young generation

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
in fact, their main ideas are

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
hoping to make the mainstream society

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
of course, because I am more leftist

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
so what is this mainstream

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I will criticize a little later

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
this is also a question mark

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
but their idea is

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
we are going to the White House

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
we are going to Union Square

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
we can let the mainstream society

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
know what we are doing

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
what is Taiwan

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
what is Taiwanese American culture

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
so there are different generations

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
will reflect a different

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
way of thinking

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
and this reflects

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
when they are organizing

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
there will be a lot of differences

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
for example, in San Diego

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
it is mainly the older generation

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
who are organizing

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
the most important thing is

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
there will be delicious Taiwanese food

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and I heard that

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
there is a mom in San Diego

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
who is very good at making zongzi

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
the zongzi will disappear

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
so she started making zongzi

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
about 3 weeks ago

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
she can make more than 1000 zongzi

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
and it seems like

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
it will be sold out in half a day

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
so the traditional week

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
they want to participate

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
because they want to visit

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
their hometown

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
to see

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
where they grew up

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
so for us

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
it is a group of Taiwanese

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
they will feel

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
so nostalgic

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I will go there

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
and share with other Taiwanese

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
how to cook

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
so for us

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
how to strengthen

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
their feelings

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
for Taiwan

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
but for the younger generation

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
of course there is

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I will go there

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
because I want to eat Taiwanese food

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I think there is a reason

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
but for the young Taiwanese

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
organizers

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
this event will be

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
how we use this occasion

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
to talk to the mainstream society

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
to discuss

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
or to promote

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
what Taiwan is

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and the importance of Taiwan

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
so I think

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I see a

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
very different place

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and the third

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I think is very important

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
this event is very important

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I interviewed

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
the director of

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
L.A.'s church

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
and I talked to him

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
about the role of the church

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
and I found

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
for example

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
in Chicago

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
every year

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
the church

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
will have two groups

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
to the U.S.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
East Coast and West Coast

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
East Coast will go to

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
10 different cities

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
to perform

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
West Coast

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
will perform

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
in different cities

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
this is the work of the church

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
and they will pay

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
to invite these groups

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
and the food and accommodation

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
of these groups

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
will be paid by the church

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
but the church

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
has a very limited budget

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
so it is impossible

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
to invite

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
for example

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Yunmeng Wuji

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
and secondly

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
they can't

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
go to too many cities

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
for example

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
more than 15 or 20 cities

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
because they can't afford

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
and when it comes to local

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
they don't really

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
have the human resources

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
to support

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
local performances

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
so the director

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
told me

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
a very important concept

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
which is the diplomatic issue

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
he told me

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
in the U.S.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
the church

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
is just an auxiliary

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
they are very grateful

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
to the U.S.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Taiwan Bridge

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
because the Taiwan Bridge

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
these groups

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
when they go to the local

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
although the church

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
will pay for the food

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
but the local

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
for example

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
celebration

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
these groups

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
are not hosted

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
because the U.S.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
network

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
is not enough

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
so you can see

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
this is not

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
like we are

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
helping the Taiwan Bridge

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
like we are

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
assisting

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
the Taiwan Bridge

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
I think it is the opposite

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
the Taiwan Bridge

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
the Taiwan Bridge

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
is very important

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
for Taiwan

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
but the church

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
is not enough

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
and they can't

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
do it well

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
so we need to rely on

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
the Taiwan Bridge

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
like I interviewed

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
a person

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
he said

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
the church

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
pays for the local

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
the local

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
they pay for the local

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
he said

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
they don't ask for money

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
from the government

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
they pay for the local

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
for example

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
this year

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
there is a cooperation

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
with the Taiwan Bridge Committee

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
but I know

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
the main

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
teacher

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
he is not

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
from the Taiwan Bridge Committee

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
he is a Taiwanese

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
living in the U.S.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
he likes Taiwan

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
he wants to help

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
the U.S.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
so he used

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
his own money

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
to pay for the local

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
everything is his own

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
so I think

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
this is what I want to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
develop

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
in Taiwan

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
like my friend

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
in Portland

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
every year

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
there is a committee

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
to discuss

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
to raise funds

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
in May

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
they bought the tickets

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
for 5 months

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
but usually

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
they need to pay

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
for the tickets

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
they usually

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
buy the most expensive

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
tickets

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
they didn't go in

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
so a group of Taiwanese

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
because it's

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
12.52pm

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
there is still

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
10-15 minutes

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
so let me remind you

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
sorry

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I can't finish

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
so I think

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I want to develop

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
but I don't know

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
where to go

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
so I want to emphasize

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Taiwan's government

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
is in a difficult situation

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
and needs Taiwan's help

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I want to emphasize

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Taiwan's organization

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
is very strong

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
so I want to

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
answer the question

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
what is the problem of culture

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I observed

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
so many different places

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
doing this

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I found a few problems

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
these three questions

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
I think they all answer

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
what is culture

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
how do you define it

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
and what is Taiwan culture

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
the second question

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I found it very interesting

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I read the Taiwan public opinion

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
in the Taiwan-US traditional week

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
just started

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
not long

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
there was a discussion

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
the Taiwan-US traditional week

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
the American people want to promote Taiwan culture

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
and write books

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
and cut paper

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
what is the difference

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
this is a very interesting question

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
this problem still exists in Taiwan

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
so we say Taiwan culture

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Taiwan is different from China

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
but where is the boundary

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
where is the boundary

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
if we are in the US

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
we want to promote Taiwan culture

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
if our agenda

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
is to distinguish Taiwan from China

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
how should we navigate

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
how should we navigate

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
to make the boundary

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
very obvious

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
so people know

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
this is different

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
my observation

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I don't think this is a good way

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
but I found

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
we don't do it

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
we don't do it

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
we don't do it

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
we don't do it

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
we don't do it

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
we don't do it

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
what is left of Taiwan culture

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
isn't Chinese culture

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
a part of Taiwan culture

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I think this is a problem

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
even in Taiwan

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
you can't make it clear

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
this continues to the US

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I saw some people

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
for example

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
they invited Taiwanese aboriginals

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
this is different from Chinese culture

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
these kinds of attempts

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
are to make the boundary

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
but my question is

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
what is the higher priority

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
what is the main agenda

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
to make the boundary

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
first

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
to make the boundary

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
is the solution the best

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
second

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
is the boundary

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
that important

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
isn't Chinese culture a part of Taiwan culture

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
second

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
this is related to culture

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I myself

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I saw a lot of

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
photos of the traditional week

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and their annual activities

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
a lot of people would record

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
a lot of times

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
I would find it funny

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I had a discussion with a friend last year

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
he was in San Francisco

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
he was in Union Square

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
he was passing by

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
he wanted to see

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
because I'm Taiwanese

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
he saw a big

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
dragon

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
with three dragons on top

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
his face was shaking

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and he left

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
he was like what is this

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Taiwanese culture

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
my second question mark

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
to promote

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Taiwanese culture

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
this kind of festival

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
you will find a lot of times

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
if the organizer is not self-aware

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
he will end up

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
repeating

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
the American

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
mainstream society

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
and the superficial

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
image of Taiwan

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
the patriotic

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
image

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Taiwan is bubble tea

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Taiwan is stinky tofu

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Taiwan is inviting aboriginals to perform

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
and inviting

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Taiwanese to sing

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Taiwanese songs

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
this is Taiwan

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
but if an organizer

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
is organizing a cultural event

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
his imagination

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I would

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I would feel

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
scary

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
because

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
you are

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
inside

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
what is this

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
what is his influence

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
what is he

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
when you are doing this

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
when you are organizing

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
does he make you know yourself better

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
or does he

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
just

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
restrict

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
your imagination

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
I think this question

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
is important

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I am not

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
from

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
many events

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
I can see

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
some hope

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
some people

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
I talked to

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
they told me

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
for example

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Dr. Tsai

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
he does a lot of

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
events

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
and he feels

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
in his events

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
he wants to

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
emphasize this

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
he wants to

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
show what is

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Taiwanese culture

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
he cares about

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
events

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
he invites people to

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
spend a lot of time

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
researching

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
what stories

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
are unknown

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
to Taiwanese

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Taiwan's latest research

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
on history and culture

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
and new discoveries

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
new debates

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
he is willing to

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
include these

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
he does not want to

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
to a superficial event

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Taiwan is stinky tofu

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Taiwan is Xiao Long Bao

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Taiwan is traditional dance

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
we drink bubble tea

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
we are Taiwanese

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
he thinks

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
this kind of

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
cultural imagination

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
is a pity

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and superficial

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
I have seen this kind of attempt

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
another attempt

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
this is Taiwanese American

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
heritage week

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
not Taiwan culture

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
heritage week

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I tried to ask them

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
this is Taiwanese American

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
heritage week

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
not Taiwan heritage week

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
how do you draw the boundary

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
and distinguish it

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
of course

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
on the one hand

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Taiwan culture is part of

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Taiwanese American

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
you do not need to

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
clearly say

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
which part is Taiwanese American

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
which part is Taiwan

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
this problem may not exist

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
for the older generation

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
this problem may not be an issue

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
on the other hand

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I heard some young people

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
willing to think about this

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
they will say yes

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
I think Taiwanese American

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
is a little different from

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Taiwan's culture

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
how should I

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
in such a cultural festival

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
to show the difference

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
they will start

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
some people

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
they were born in the United States

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
and then use English

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
to write their memories

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
of Taiwan

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
what is their imagination of Taiwan

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
draw or write

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
some short articles

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
use that way

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
to present

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Taiwanese American

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
as a very special

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
he is not Chinese American

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
he is not Taiwanese

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
a very special existence

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
to see such a common sense

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
it exists

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
to respond to

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
what is the culture

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I think I still think

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
that point

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Taiwan culture

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
how do you distinguish

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Taiwan culture from Chinese culture

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I think this will be an issue

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
the second issue

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
you can apply

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
to a bigger issue

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
when doing the creative industry

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
you have to think

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
how can I push further

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
to let

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
deeper understanding

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
or imagination about culture

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
not just to copy

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
the imaginations of the mainstream society

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
I don't know

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
if I have answered

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
your question

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
for me

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
my question is

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
I believe most people

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
can agree that

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Taiwan culture

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
even Taiwanese

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
are trying to define

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
in such a situation

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
we are in the US

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
actually abroad

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
to hold a Taiwan culture

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
promotion

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
in 1998

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
we have been promoting

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
calligraphy, pen and paper

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
xiaolongbao

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
in the next 8 years

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
we have been promoting

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
calligraphy, pen and paper

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
in the next 8 years

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
it is not stable

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
we are still

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
searching for

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
identity

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
to hold such an event

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
is it positive

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
or negative

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I would say

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
identity

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
this concept

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
is always flowing

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
so I don't think

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
it has to be

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
stable

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
but we have been

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
talking

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
there may be

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
conflicts

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
finally we found

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
a consensus

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
we all agree

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
I think

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
it is

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
so you can find

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
for example

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
indigenous people

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
you can say

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
it is politically correct

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
but it is

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
kind of

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
after 30 years

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
we have been

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
discussing

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
it has become

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
an important

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
cultural icon

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
or heritage

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
so I would say

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
identity building

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
identity

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
identity building

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
it is not

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
a consensus

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
it is

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
a process

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
a process of discussion

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
it is not

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
a clean

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
it has many

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
grey areas

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
but finally we found

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
a consensus

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
we all agree

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
there are many

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
these things will

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
continue to move forward

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
I don't know if I answered

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
your question

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
thank you

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
because of the time

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
you can

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
wrap up for 3 minutes

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
thank you

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
so

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
my point is

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
when I look at

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
a cultural

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
traditional week

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
for me

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
there are two important things

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
one is

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
three

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
why it is important

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I think

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
we should not

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
give up this opportunity

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
to introduce Taiwan to the US

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
because it is

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
not only

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
important for

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
diversity

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
it is also

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
a tool

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
to promote

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Taiwan

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
so

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
if

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I become an organizer

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
it will be

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
an important

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
part of my agenda

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
so

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
the second

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
is

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
how to

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
encourage

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
and organize

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
how to

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
gather our

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
fellow citizens

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
to have

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
more

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
interaction

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
to know

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
who we are

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I think

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
these are

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
two important things

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
the third is

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
how to help

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Taiwan to

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
promote diplomacy

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
because

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
the US is still

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
the place with the most

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Taiwanese

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
if we can do well

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I think this model

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
can be applied

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Taiwan has a lot of

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
important work

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
and meaningful

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
things to do

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
anyway

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
thank you

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
thank you

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
for the wonderful speech

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
before we end

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I want to ask

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
if there are any questions

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
we can chat

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
if there are

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
any questions

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
we can chat

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Emma left

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
but she said

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
LA and Mazu temple

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
yes

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
she also

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
invited

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
the master

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
what was his name

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
anyway

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
is it Oscar

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
yes

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
I don't know if this is a question

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
or an idea

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
when everyone

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
is promoting the traditional state

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and the theme of Taiwan

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I think

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
the biggest difficulty is

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
young people in Taiwan

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
don't want to

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
come out to help

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
rely on the old people

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
old people are pushing

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
is that enough

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I don't know

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I think my question

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
is more like

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
how to make more people

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
willing to promote this

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
instead of these Taiwanese

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I will say

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
remind everyone

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
you are sharing your Gmail

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
you can turn off

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
the sharing screen

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
luckily I didn't

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
post it on Facebook

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
remind everyone

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
you can answer

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
yes

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I think this is

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
a good question

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I talked to some elders

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
because the Taiwanese community

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
has a very important crisis

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
the elderly have retired

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
they are old

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
it's like

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
there are generations

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
of problems

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
different ideas

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
so I will say

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
young people

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
don't come

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
it's not just young people

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
it's also

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
old people

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
for example

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I can't accept

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
the elderly

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
who talk to me

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
we grew up

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
in the era of

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
martial law

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
we are the generation of

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
sunflowers

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
even if you are a

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
pro-democracy

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
you talk to me

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
like an old green man

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I can't accept

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
the anti-KMT

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
the KMT is very

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
sexist and racist

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I can't talk to them

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
will it be recorded?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
will they hear?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
hello?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
yes

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
yes

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
but

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
if you have

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
something you can't talk about

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
wave your hand

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and tell me to cut it

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I don't know if we have a name

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
the answer is

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
young people don't come

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
because

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
young people and old people

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
have different ways

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
of doing things

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I know many young people

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
they are willing to

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
do things for free

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
but they

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
will leave

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
they are not happy

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
because they don't think

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
they should be treated like this

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
so I think this problem

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
is the internal organization

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
of different generations

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
young people

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I am very busy

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
you want me to do a lot of volunteer work

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
it depends on my ability

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I have to work

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I have to write papers

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I have to do unpaid work

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
if I have good physical strength

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I don't have to worry

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
one of my worries

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I will be willing to commit more

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
but at this stage

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
there is no way

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
let alone those who have children

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
young people don't come

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I think our job is

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
to create a space

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
this space is very friendly

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
a very warm space

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
it's ok if you cannot join now

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
it's ok

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
we understand

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
but I will tell you

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
this space is always welcome

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
if you have time today

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
you can come

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
as an organizer

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I will position myself

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I am not saying

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
why don't you come

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
why don't you love Taiwan

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I think this is too harsh

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
because everyone's life agenda

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
different time points

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
their tasks are different

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
yes

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
understand

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
thank you

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
thank you Oscar and Qiqi

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
for your answers

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I want to ask

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
one last question

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
if not

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
we are ready

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
to end today's speech

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
do you have any feedback

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
let's ask if there are any questions

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
yes

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I will count to three

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
1

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
2

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
3

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
feedback

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
do you have any

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
points to add

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I have a suggestion

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I think you asked

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
a lot of questions

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
these questions

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
are actually

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
related

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
but

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I think

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
these questions can exist independently

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
so if you

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
say them all

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
like a group

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
without a specific

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
order

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
connect them all

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
actually

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
the most important question

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
you have to ask

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
is not that clear

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
so I think

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
you may have to

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
make a choice

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
these materials

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
the question you want to ask

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
at least

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
in this article

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
you may want to ask another question

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
but you can answer

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
from these materials

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
and you want to use this question

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
to ask the question of the paper

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
that's another question

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
but I think for a presentation

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
like you want to write to the newspaper

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
you may have to think about

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
a very clear question

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
and you have to give up some

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
secondary but these materials

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
can also answer the question

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
otherwise the structure

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
will not be so clear

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
there are a lot of materials

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
you have to tie up

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
the most important thing

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
very good advice

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I think

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
this research is very interesting

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
because actually

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I had a few Taiwanese friends

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
who came to the US

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
they had a meeting in the US

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
and they did business in Taiwan

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
they wanted to promote

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Taiwan's exquisite agricultural products

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
to the world

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
such as milk and coffee

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and fruit jam

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
the exquisite processing of fruit

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
of course they are very

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
recognized by Taiwan

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
but we talked about

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
what is the Taiwanese culture

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
for example

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
a group of Chinese

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
went to New York

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
and made a Chinatown

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
are these cultures

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
American culture

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
if so

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
how do we define

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Taiwan culture

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I think this is

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
a very important issue

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
of course I have no answer

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and I'm not an expert

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
but I think this kind of research

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
is very important

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
to all Taiwanese

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
so I think it's great

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I can understand

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
that kind of

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
in a hurry to cut

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
the workers

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
in a hurry to cut

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
the traditional Chinese

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Chinese characters

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I can understand

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
their anxiety

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
because you are

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
doing a political battle

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
you want to establish a

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
discourse as a weapon

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
for your political agenda

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
you have to be very careful

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
anything that can weaken your argument

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
you have to figure out a way to get rid of it

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
so I can understand their anxiety

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and their persistence

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
but

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
but I think

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I can accept

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
and I can understand

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and I think it's a process

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
when Taiwan is really established

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
these things can all come back

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
now

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
you can only let it be

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
vague

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
you don't have to mention it

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
you don't have to talk about it

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
you can talk about it

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
you can talk about it

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
assimilate

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
assimilate

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
with the English

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
family

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
family

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
family

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
family

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
family

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
family

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
family

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
family

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
process

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
as an organizer

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
as a political organizer

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
it will be

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
considered as a

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
can throw away

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
can

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
can use, can not use

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
depends on different context

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
when it's useful, you use it

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
when it's not useful, you keep it

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
no need to build a

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
unbreakable

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Taiwan culture is what

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I think you don't have to

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
set yourself to death

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
you don't have that flexibility

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
to swim in different

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
different context

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Oscar

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
seems to have a question or not

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
seems

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
no, I just think

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
this question, I also think for a long time

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
then I think

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
uh

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
should say that in my experience

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
is

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I think

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
it is more likely to

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
make Taiwan into a

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
speaking

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
uh

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
is a little bit of an

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
assimilated society

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
to let people know that Taiwanese people are

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
what people have, for example

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
for example

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
last week we just

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
held a speech

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and then our theme

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
is to put all kinds of people

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
in the picture

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
he is a Japanese

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
so he has his own

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Japanese elementary school students

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and his grandmother is Chinese

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and then his

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
anyway, there are all kinds of people

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
different races over there

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and then our theme at that time

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
is to define it as Taiwan is

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
everything

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
because we are

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
an island, it is impossible to have only one thing

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
everywhere

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
this is the influence of many cultures

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
so you see a certain

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
aspect of Taiwan, like you said

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Mazu, in fact, it is also the people of the south

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Mazu is also from Meizhou

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
that is not Taiwan, of course you can

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
seriously say that the real Taiwan is also the indigenous people

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
that you are in the indigenous people is actually from the south

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
to the Yuxin side, it is also the real Taiwan

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
that is not

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
so I mean

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
instead of going to find a

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
fact, like you just said

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
is to find a majority

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
then I think instead of

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
finding a very clear

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
subject, it is better to be very honest

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
so that everyone knows

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Taiwan is everything

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
you see is not a whole

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
and then we have

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
elements of Chinese, we have elements of Japanese

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
even the Dutch

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and Spanish

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
really

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
just an

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
impression

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I agree with this

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
this is the controversy of the textbook

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
although the KMT has been saying

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
that the KMT is going to China

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
but in fact, the KMT is hoping to

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
you can't say

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that the KMT brought in something wrong

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
right?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
How do you navigate that direction today?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
You look at the world

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
from a different angle, if you look at Taiwan

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
from a diversified perspective

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
you will find that it

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
is not just a Han society

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
it is not

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
just the history of the past

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
great China

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
made it into a

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
history written from the perspective of the Han people

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
that

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
are there any other questions?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
because I think the time

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
is actually almost

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
that

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
looks like everyone

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
should have learned a lot today

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
like me

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I heard a lot of things

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
at the end of the speech

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I want to talk a little bit

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
because I was listening to your speech

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I suddenly thought of a little story

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I started from high school

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I participated in the

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
indigenous tribe service

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I basically go there every year

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
we are in the camp

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
every time it is about a week

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
every time we go to the camp

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
there will be a show

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
and then I was

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
the first year I went up the mountain

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I was very shocked

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
because the first year we let the children

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
decide what to play

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
and then they played the theme

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I think it's amazing

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
although they are all

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
very playful

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
but you can see the context of their life

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
for example, there is a play called

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Grandpa is drunk

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
or the sister who sells incense

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
or father beats sister

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
you will go

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
although they are very

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
if they are free to play

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
they will talk about these things

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
so I thought

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
every year to hold a traditional week in Taiwan

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
is like an identity

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
a time point

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
so if you see

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
activities or slogans used

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
in this traditional week

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
more or less

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
reflects the identity of

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
our subgroup

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I think it's very interesting

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
after listening to your speech

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
when they write their own things

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
they will say

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
as long as the topic they write is

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
we let them decide

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
what to play

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
we don't care

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
let them play

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
so it can be imagined

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
that those children

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
from Taiwan National High School

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
what they can think of

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
must be the most direct theme in life

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
they can immediately think of

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
who the grandpa beats

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
or who the father is drunk

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
you can imagine

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
although you can't see

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
but these are their life

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and they are exposed to these things every day

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
this sharing is great

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
just like I just mentioned

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
a question

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
if you don't reflect

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
will you just repeat

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
what the mainstream society

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
imagines of you

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I think

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
the culture they can imagine

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
is very different

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
from the story

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
you have heard

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and I think

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
this diversity

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
should be brought out

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but I think

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I have organized

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
things

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
and when you are

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
very busy

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
sometimes you can't think

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
just like the past

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
just let it be

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
it's simple

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
there is a network

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
you can't be sure

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
whether it will be popular

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
there are all kinds of considerations

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
so I think

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
you will continue

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
the imagination of the past

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but this is very dangerous

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
because it simplifies a lot of things

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
and what's worse

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
if it just reinforces

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
it doesn't help

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
the mainstream society to understand Taiwan

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
it's harmful

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
so

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
that's it for today

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
thank you

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
thank you

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I'm looking forward to it

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I feel like

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'm the type of person who keeps talking

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
now I have more inspiration

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
keep writing

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
that's it

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
thank you for your participation

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
that's the end of the speech

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
you can leave the chat room

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
good night

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
next time I will talk about

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
the South China Sea issue

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
and the Chinese

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
