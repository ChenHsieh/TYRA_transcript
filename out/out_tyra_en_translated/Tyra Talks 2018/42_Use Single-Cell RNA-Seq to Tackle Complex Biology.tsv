0	9000	Hello, everyone.
9000	15000	I am honored to be able to introduce Dr. Sun today.
15000	23000	Dr. Sun completed her bachelor's degree from 1999 to 2013
23000	28000	in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at Taiwan University.
28000	35000	After completing her bachelor's degree from 2003 to 2005,
35000	43000	she completed her master's degree in Plant Pathology and Microbiology at the same university in Taiwan.
43000	51000	She then completed her Ph.D. degree from 2005 to 2010 at Purdue University.
51000	54000	Her major is Chemical Biology.
54000	58000	After completing her Ph.D. degree, she went to MIT to do her postdoc.
58000	68000	After four years, she went to UCSF to do her second postdoc and assistant researcher.
68000	75000	This year, she started her new job as a Senior Scientific Researcher at Genentech.
76000	80000	Today, Dr. Sun is going to talk about
80000	85000	Use Single-Cell RNA-Seq to Tackle Complex Biology.
85000	89000	Now, let's welcome Dr. Sun to give her presentation.
94000	97000	Hello, everyone. I am Dr. Sun.
97000	104000	Sorry, my voice is a bit hoarse due to my cold.
104000	111000	Today, I am going to talk in a simple and easy-to-understand way.
111000	115000	Just in case, some of you may not have a background in biology.
115000	121000	I hope you can at least learn about Single-Cell RNA-Seq.
122000	128000	Here is my personal email and LinkedIn account.
128000	132000	Although my LinkedIn account is not up to date,
132000	135000	please feel free to connect with me.
138000	143000	I will be speaking in Chinese today,
143000	148000	but I am not sure what the term is in Chinese.
149000	157000	If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
159000	165000	I don't want to make it too complicated.
165000	168000	I will be focusing on technology.
168000	171000	I am currently working at a company,
171000	176000	so I can't really talk about research projects here.
176000	182000	I will try my best to talk about the applications of this technology,
182000	184000	and the principles behind it.
184000	189000	I hope this will be helpful to those who are interested.
190000	193000	Before we get into the technology,
193000	197000	I will briefly review the biology of NTU.
199000	203000	As you may already know, our body is made up of cells.
204000	207000	Many cells form organs,
207000	211000	and eventually form organs in our body,
211000	214000	becoming a functional human body.
214000	224000	An interesting fact is that our body is composed of over 20 different types of cells.
224000	229000	You can see that their forms and functions are very different.
230000	235000	For example, there are nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells,
235000	241000	and even different types of cells in different organs.
241000	246000	Their functions and forms are very different.
248000	251000	Let's take a deeper look.
251000	255000	As you can see, our body is made up of cells.
255000	259000	Each cell has a nucleus,
259000	261000	which is a red dot.
261000	263000	In English, it's called a nucleus.
263000	265000	In Chinese, it's called a cell nucleus.
265000	269000	In this cell nucleus, there is a chromosome.
269000	274000	This chromosome is made up of our genes.
274000	278000	I think everyone has a concept of genes.
278000	281000	Genes are our genetic material.
281000	284000	Genes are our genetic material,
284000	287000	and they can determine our body functions.
287000	295000	Generally speaking, genes are basically DNA fragments.
295000	303000	They can be converted into useful molecules,
303000	308000	which can perform the functions required by our body.
308000	311000	We usually talk about gene decoding or gene encryption.
311000	322000	The main reason is that DNA is composed of a series of ATCG,
322000	327000	which is a double helix structure made up of four different genes.
327000	330000	Generally speaking, if we talk about gene decoding,
330000	335000	the sequence you get may be composed of four ATCG
335000	338000	in different ways.
338000	341000	This is our so-called gene code.
341000	347000	In molecular biology, there is a so-called central dogma.
347000	357000	It's the principle that we have this genetic material.
357000	359000	Its main structure is DNA,
359000	363000	which is transcribed into RNA.
363000	367000	RNA is further transcribed into protein.
367000	372000	Protein can perform various biological functions.
372000	375000	As time goes by,
375000	382000	the central dogma is gradually extended to more different forms.
382000	391000	We can even find more different directions from the virus or other systems.
392000	397000	Today's technology involves a discovery.
397000	402000	In the past, we thought that DNA was transcribed into RNA.
402000	407000	Later, scientists found another molecule
407000	411000	that allows RNA to reverse transcribe back to the DNA.
411000	414000	Because of the help of this molecule,
414000	423000	many related extension technologies can be built on this basis.
423000	429000	Today, we are going to talk about RNAseq.
429000	435000	In other words, transcriptome analysis,
435000	439000	or gene expression profiling,
439000	446000	we can use genes to understand human physiology.
446000	457000	This picture shows a major timeline and milestone in molecular biology and sequencing technology.
457000	463000	In 1953, the first discovery of DNA double-stranded structure was made.
463000	469000	In 1977, Sanger's DNA sequencing was developed.
469000	473000	Later, PCR technology was also developed.
473000	480000	PCR technology allows us to rapidly increase our DNA in the lab.
480000	488000	Many related technologies can be built on this basis.
488000	492000	In 1990, the Human Genome Project was launched.
492000	497000	After 13 years, the Human Genome Project was established.
497000	505000	At this stage, the sequencing cost was still very high.
505000	513000	It was difficult to operate the sequencing project in the lab.
513000	520000	In 2005, the Next Generation Sequencing was introduced.
520000	530000	Next Generation Sequencing is a next-generation sequencing technology.
530000	535000	This technology has greatly reduced the cost of sequencing.
535000	543000	More and more Genome Projects related to sequencing can be carried out more smoothly in labs.
543000	548000	Up to now, Next Generation Sequencing technology is still widely used.
548000	556000	In recent years, the Third Generation Sequencing technology has been introduced.
556000	562000	When was Single Cell RNAse developed?
562000	570000	Single Cell RNAse was first reported in 2009.
570000	575000	Single Cell RNAse is a technology that is becoming more and more mature.
575000	583000	Single Cell RNAse is a technology that is becoming more and more mature.
583000	592000	Many advanced protocols, technologies, and companies continue to develop rapidly in this field.
592000	600000	Why do we need to do Single Cell RNAse?
600000	608000	Before Single Cell RNAse, we can look at gene profiling.
608000	618000	For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.
618000	628000	For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.
628000	638000	For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.

658000	668000	For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.
668000	678000	For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.
678000	688000	For example, we need to know the difference between a normal tumor and a cancer tumor.
