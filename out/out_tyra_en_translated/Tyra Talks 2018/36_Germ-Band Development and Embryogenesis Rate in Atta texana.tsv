0	5000	All right, so today's speaker is Fang Sichun, MD.
8240	11200	So Fang Sichun is actually one of my friend
11200	15280	back to college from entomology department.
15280	20280	And he's doing PhD in University of Texas, Austin.
21840	26760	And he's going to introduce some story about ants to us.
26760	30720	So just give the time to Andy now.
31880	32720	All right.
34080	35000	Thank you, Oscar.
35000	36720	Thanks for the introduction.
36720	41720	So today I have four things that I want to share with you.
42200	46000	The main idea is to show you the embryo development
46000	49760	of one of the live callers, one of the antennae ants,
49760	51600	and we also call it live callers.
51600	54360	The species name is Ada texana.
54400	59400	And since my childhood,
59840	61880	I bet everybody watched Lion King before.
61880	64040	And this is one clip from that movie.
65560	67000	That scene was fascinating.
67000	68880	That was actually the first time I knew,
68880	70800	oh, there are some ants with a couple leaves
70800	72200	and bring them back.
72200	75120	But at that moment, I didn't know what they were doing
75120	79000	or not even saying what is the social insects.
79000	83240	So I'm going to show you
83240	88120	what are the typical, like a true social insects around us.
89440	93160	Termites, honeybees, ants, and wasps.
93160	96920	So the typical pictures for social insects
96920	100320	is that they have hierarchical level.
100320	105320	For example, they have workers, they have queens.
106640	109120	Sometimes they will have big soldiers,
109120	111240	like a larger body size.
111240	114560	And also all of the characters I mentioned,
114560	115640	they're all females.
116600	120360	For those sexual reproductive system social insects,
120360	121680	they do have males.
123120	127360	So how do we distinguish the male and the female
127360	128280	social insects?
128280	132680	Oh, by the way, termites, it's kind of awkward.
132680	135760	The sexual determination for termites,
135760	140240	it's different as honeybees, wasps, or ants.
140240	142600	And we're not going to explore too much
142600	144480	about termites today.
144480	149480	Okay, so when we talk about the sex determination
149600	153960	for use of social insects, let's take ants as the example.
154760	156720	This is the word that people will see.
156720	158760	We call the haploid diploidy.
158760	163320	So haploid means one set of chromosome
163320	166200	and diploid means like two sets of chromosome.
166200	168600	Take us human being as the example,
168640	170160	we are diploid.
170160	173480	Okay, that means we have two sets of chromosome.
173480	177640	And the way that human being decides the sex
177640	180960	is based on X or Y chromosome.
180960	183720	But the story is different in ants world.
184840	186960	For the males, for the male ants,
186960	189840	they actually only have one set of chromosome,
189840	191320	which is haploid.
191320	196240	And for the females, including queens or workers,
196240	198800	they do have two sets of chromosome.
198800	202200	So let's say if the egg got fertilized,
202200	205320	that will become a future queen or future worker,
205320	207880	which is a female, right?
207880	210840	If the egg didn't get fertilized successfully,
210840	215280	can be a trophic egg or it can be a male, right?
215280	220280	So as I mentioned that Disney influenced me a lot
220760	222240	since my childhood,
222240	225000	but actually sometimes they make some mistakes.
225000	230000	So this is the clip from the Bugs Life by Pixar Disney.
233240	235120	The left hand side,
235120	239280	that's supposed to be a male worker in that movie,
239280	240680	his name is Flick.
240680	243600	And the right hand side is the princess Ada,
244880	248720	a female version queen that Flick fall in love with.
251240	254840	One thing, the first thing Pixar made like wrongly
255680	258280	is Flick can never be a male worker.
258280	260480	There's no male worker, okay?
260480	264120	And a second, if we consider the real situation
264120	266080	in the field, talking about Ada,
266080	268120	this genus, Ada Texana,
268120	269880	the queen, the size of the queen
269880	272560	is way bigger than the worker.
272560	277560	So if we want to correct Pixar in the movie,
277720	279000	it should be like this.
279960	284280	So that's a queen and a worker, okay?
284320	286120	And what's the real situation?
287560	292000	Here is the Ada queen and here is the worker, okay?
292000	293840	So how do you decide?
293840	298840	How does the egg decide to be a queen or a worker?
299640	300560	Since both of them,
300560	303600	they are deployed like a fertilized eggs.
304520	307000	It's still a mystery, okay?
307000	312000	So here I have a simple cartoon figure to show you.
312320	316600	Question marks on the slides means
316600	318880	there's still something like the mechanism
318880	320560	that we don't know.
320560	325560	So back to 1990s, Diana Wither and other groups,
326240	330280	they thought juvenile hormone plays an important role
330280	333240	at the late level stage to determine
333240	336120	whether that individual will become a future queen
336120	337640	or just a worker.
337640	340440	The more juvenile hormone got expressed,
340480	343480	the higher possibility that individual
343480	345880	will become a queen, okay?
345880	349640	And till 2015, another group, they figured out,
349640	353320	oh, EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor receptor,
353320	356200	gene, plays another important role
356200	358040	during late level stage,
358040	361720	may involve in caste determination.
362880	367560	But the other group from Canada, Ahab's lab,
368520	373520	they published a series of paper back to 2008 and 2010,
373760	376680	and they brought up really interesting
376680	380400	and important finding as they thought
381320	384000	the caste determination may be determined
384000	387960	at a very, very early stage during oogenesis, okay?
387960	392960	Oogenesis means before the egg being laid,
393160	396800	i.e. the egg still in the ovary.
396800	398880	Due to some gene regulation,
399760	404040	their final character, like either queen or worker,
404040	407160	will be determined, okay?
408320	410840	And how about the embryo development?
410840	414800	Do people know anything about embryo development?
414800	419520	The answer is no before I start to have my PhD.
420320	424160	And that was actually quite surprising
425040	428200	because people study ants a lot.
428200	431200	For example, like fire ants, like how to kill them, right?
431200	435640	But or some interesting ecological concepts
435640	437240	or behavioral studies,
437240	441120	like ants are one of the hottest species
441120	444480	when you study insects
444480	446560	that people will just use as a material.
446560	449680	But surprisingly, we don't know too much
451360	454040	during the egg stage or the larva stage
454840	455680	or the pupa stage, okay?
455680	459840	People apparently care more about the later on stage
459840	462160	like the adult, like what's their behavior.
463040	465600	So when I look back to those references,
465600	469080	we left so many question marks, okay?
469080	472600	No matter like how many people study ants,
472600	475360	we still don't know too much about egg stage.
476560	481560	And there was the paper back to 2006
481920	486800	and they show some footage
486800	490000	of the embryo development of two ants.
490000	493320	The left-hand side, this one is Argentine ants,
493320	494760	which is the huge pest.
494760	496480	And this one is the Ferroni ants,
496480	498800	also a pest and it's quite common.
498800	500240	We also have that in Taiwan.
503480	507400	In the whole paper, there's only six figures
508280	513640	to show how does the embryo grow,
513640	518640	but to me, it's not informative enough, right?
518760	522080	Because I want to see like the start and the end.
523520	526720	Based on the figure, people thought like,
526720	530160	maybe the ants embryo development
530160	535160	is similar to Drosophila based on figure D.
535440	537720	Okay, why do people think like that way?
539080	543760	So there are three types of the embryo,
543760	545840	the insect embryos, okay?
545840	549320	Based on the size of the germ band,
549320	552480	we call it insect fate map, okay?
553400	557960	Here represents three types of the embryo,
557960	561120	long, intermediate and short, okay?
561120	563560	The color part is the germ band,
563560	568520	which will become a future embryo, a future larva, okay?
570080	571720	For the long germ band species,
571720	575440	you will have the head, thorax and abdomen part, okay?
575440	577720	If you are not too familiar with insects,
577720	581520	that's one, the three of the majority part of the body
582680	584760	of insects, head, thorax and abdomen,
584760	588360	well, and wings and legs.
588360	591520	For the intermediate germ band species like beetles,
592480	594960	at the beginning, once the egg being laid,
594960	597520	you won't be able to see the abdomen part,
597520	601960	you will see head part and part of the thorax, okay?
601960	606120	So that's the short germ band species like crickets, okay?
606120	608160	So I put a wasp here.
610200	614280	For social insects, lots of scientists,
614280	616400	they study honeybees and wasps,
616400	619400	and they compare the Drosophila,
619400	622640	one of the most famous model species
622640	624800	that people study embryo development.
624800	628240	They compare the wasp embryogenesis
628240	632720	and the honeybee embryogenesis with Drosophila,
632720	636400	and they figured out, oh, actually, they're pretty similar.
637280	641600	Those social insects, the wasps and the honeybees,
641600	644840	embryogenesis are pretty similar to Drosophila.
644840	649200	So people didn't pay enough attention to ants
649960	654960	and they just referred to, based on whatever they knew,
655040	657880	and they thought, oh, maybe ants,
657880	661840	it's similar to honeybees or wasps,
661840	664960	because they belong to the same order, okay?
664960	668480	And today, I'm going to show you that's not the truth.
668480	669960	That's not the whole story.
671400	675000	So four things I want to show you as the first,
675440	680440	well, I will talk about the ant embryogenesis,
681560	684720	but I will involve two different species,
684720	687680	except the Adatexanthum.
687680	689720	I will also include Microsaparus methi,
689720	691480	and I will explain what is the high
691480	694320	and lower agriculture mean later.
694320	695680	That's the first part.
695680	700120	And the second, I want to compare two types of eggs.
700120	701840	One is laid by the foundress,
701840	703840	one is laid by the mature queen.
703880	706840	Foundress means the new daughter queens
706840	710960	just fly out from the nest and have the mating flight
710960	715800	and start to build their own kingdom, their own colony, okay?
715800	717760	The fresh queen, okay?
717760	720440	Like the one you saw from the Pixar on the Bug's Life.
720440	721520	That's the foundress.
721520	723040	That's the virgin queen.
723040	726320	And the third part, I'm going to use
726320	730360	two genetic staining evidence to prove
730360	735360	that the ant embryogenesis is not the same
736880	739800	as honeybees or wasps.
741120	745200	And the last part, that's kind of like a side project
745200	748680	that I was lucky enough to figure out.
748680	751880	We found out some new story about the trophic egg,
751880	753960	and I will go deeper after.
753960	755680	So here's the first part.
755680	757800	The difference of embryogenesis
757840	760600	between low and high agriculture ants.
760600	763720	Here are the two species I include.
763720	766120	The Ana texana, the leaf color ants,
766120	768360	is the high level agriculture
768360	772520	based on the phylogeny tree.
772520	774440	And I will show you in the next slide.
774440	778160	And M. smithii is the low agriculture ants, okay?
778160	780320	And there are several features I want to point out
780320	782920	to show how different these two ants
782920	784440	are in different perspectives,
784440	789360	like the ecology or even the reproductive system.
789360	792120	First, Ana texana is sexual.
792120	793520	They do have the male,
793520	797840	but M. smithii, microcephalus smithii, they're asexual.
797840	800920	People also call them pathogenesis.
800920	805920	And the second feature is if you go to the fields,
806160	808280	you will figure out there are different size
808280	810160	of the workers of Ana texana.
810160	813120	There are some small workers, there are some big workers,
813120	815120	but for M. smithii,
815120	818800	they are no difference between worker size, okay?
818800	820640	They're almost identical.
820640	821960	Well, they're clonal, right?
821960	822840	They're asexual.
822840	824480	And so that's the size.
824480	826080	It's pretty similar.
826080	828800	So what is the high and low agriculture mean?
828800	833120	It's based on the position of the phylogeny tree, okay?
833120	836760	Here is the low agriculture ants,
836760	838560	the microcephalus smithii,
838560	842600	and Ana texana is the high agriculture.
843320	845680	In the fields, the low agriculture ants
845680	850680	not only use some dead leaf parts
850840	854360	or roses or branches to cultivate their fungus,
854360	856760	but also they collect caterpillar poops
856760	858640	to grow the fungus.
859760	862800	And the Ana texana, they basically cut the leaves
862800	865040	and bring the leaves back to the colony,
865040	869400	use those leaves as a nutrient to cultivate the fungus,
869400	872560	grow the fungus, and they eat the fungus.
873520	877520	So overall, we call them Antennae ants, okay?
877520	881240	Antennae ants means the ants will grow the fungus
882160	883720	in no matter what perspectives,
883720	884920	like in different ways,
884920	889200	and they eat the fungus and they live in the fungus.
889200	891120	So they are farmers, okay?
892240	894520	So when we look at the life history
894520	897200	for those two different Antennae ants,
897200	902200	they're on the two sides of the phylogeny tree.
903080	905000	We may think, oh, they're so different
905000	907400	based on their behavior, based on their ecology,
907400	909960	even their morphology, they look so different.
909960	914480	But surprisingly, they spend their egg stage,
914480	915800	it's almost identical.
915800	917280	So what does that mean?
917280	919600	That means they spend most of the,
919600	921680	I mean, sorry, they spend,
922840	926400	both of them spend about 20 days for hatching.
926400	930080	And how about those details
930080	933680	during the embryogenesis, the features, okay?
933680	936000	So the next slide shows the complete,
936000	938040	the first complete development table
938040	940760	for the Adatexana, okay?
940760	943800	From day one to day 15,
943800	946600	the eggs were from the foundresses,
946600	949200	from those nude or the queens, okay?
949200	951800	So there are lots of information here,
951800	954720	and I'm going to show you one by one,
954720	956480	explain one by one.
956480	959800	So the egg is about 300 micrometer,
960560	963720	and day two, you will see lots of nuclei
963720	965800	showed up on the surface of the egg.
965800	967920	We call it blastodon, okay?
967920	971280	Once you see that, the future embryo nuclei
971280	973720	will start to gather to the posterior part
975960	980240	of the egg and form a heart-shaped embryo, okay?
980240	983480	So first stage will be blastodon,
983480	987120	and the second stage will be the heart-shaped embryo.
987960	992960	The third stage will be the elongation stage, okay?
993040	996560	When the heart-shaped embryo, the germ band formed,
996560	1000040	the embryo will start to elongate
1000040	1004320	and form gradually day by day when it gets older.
1004320	1006280	So the elongation stage
1007360	1011560	was from day four to day eight, okay?
1011560	1013640	And insects, they're autopods.
1013640	1016560	They have axoskeletons, right?
1017000	1018760	And they have different segments.
1018760	1023760	So segmentation is the final step
1023840	1026960	that's when the embryo grows.
1028680	1033080	So day nine, you can start to see those lobes forming,
1033080	1034760	the segments forming,
1034760	1038880	and till day 12, you can see,
1038880	1040520	compared with day nine, day 12,
1040520	1043480	there are more and more lobes adding up.
1043480	1046240	Day five, it's almost like lava.
1047120	1048160	And then the next day,
1048160	1051400	or within the same day, it will hatch, okay?
1051400	1054520	That's the overall concept of embryo development
1054520	1056200	of adatexana.
1056200	1058160	How about microcephalus methi?
1059360	1060800	It's pretty similar.
1060800	1062040	Sorry, the footage is,
1062040	1064640	some of the images are kind of foggy.
1064640	1067720	That was the image I took almost three years ago,
1067720	1071800	and we are recollecting the data for M. smethi.
1071800	1075400	But on day five, you can see the heart shape,
1075400	1078080	the future embryo formed,
1078080	1080080	and then the elongation happening,
1080080	1082200	and then segmentation happening,
1083560	1088560	just as same as what you saw from adatexana, okay?
1089600	1094360	So if we look at those four stages of two ants,
1094360	1097040	of these two Antennae ants,
1097040	1100640	higher agriculture ants, adatexana,
1100640	1104120	and lower agriculture ants, microcephalus methi,
1104120	1108080	those really similar feature, okay?
1108080	1111240	So the first part, the conclusion is,
1111240	1116240	even on the ecology, ecological or behavior perspectives,
1118600	1120200	they're so different,
1120200	1123040	but when we look at their embryogenesis,
1123040	1124760	they're actually quite similar.
1126640	1127480	All right.
1128480	1133480	The second part is the differences
1133480	1138480	between the adafoundraces and the mature queen laid eggs.
1138480	1142920	So why is it interesting to compare this two?
1142920	1146840	For a long time, people who study ants found out
1146840	1150640	that for those foundraces laid eggs,
1150640	1152920	they will usually hatch faster.
1152920	1155480	Oh, sorry, not hatch faster only.
1156240	1158080	For those foundraces,
1158080	1161440	usually they will have the first broods of workers
1161440	1164520	earlier than the mature colony, okay?
1165760	1169240	But for ants, there are different stages,
1169240	1172360	egg stage, lava stage, lava stage,
1172360	1175040	pupa stage, and then worker.
1175040	1178120	We don't know which stage got speed up,
1178120	1182840	or every stage got speed up evenly, okay?
1182840	1184400	For a long time, we just know,
1184800	1186600	for those new queens,
1186600	1189720	they will have the first broods of workers faster
1189720	1192400	than the regular queen,
1192400	1195240	but we want to know more details.
1195240	1200240	So since I have the expertise in studying ants' embryogenesis,
1201840	1203040	the egg development,
1205440	1210440	I examined the eggs laid by the foundraces the past summer,
1211440	1213800	and we found out something interesting.
1214880	1218720	So I hope you still have the concept
1218720	1220880	for the whole developmental series
1220880	1222840	in your mind of Antitech Center.
1224960	1229960	If we compare the eggs laid by those foundraces
1230040	1234480	and the eggs laid by the mature queens on the same day,
1234480	1239480	we can actually see the segmentation happens
1240440	1244680	faster in the foundrace-laid eggs, okay?
1244680	1246000	This is on day nine.
1248840	1253800	Three mouse part segments, the lobe formed,
1253800	1256760	and the future thorax segments formed already
1256760	1258880	on day nine of the adenue.
1258880	1262560	Adenue means the foundrace-laid eggs, okay?
1262560	1267480	But nothing happened except the future head lobe formed
1267480	1272040	in the mature queen-laid eggs.
1272040	1273120	How about day 12?
1274000	1276000	So if we compare day 12,
1276000	1280640	we can see actually from the new adenue,
1280640	1283760	the foundrace-laid eggs, sorry, the phrase is so long.
1283760	1287800	The foundrace-laid eggs will form multiple segments
1287800	1292800	at this stage, but not the mature queen-laid eggs, okay?
1292920	1296200	But does that mean there's no gene expression
1296200	1298200	involved in segmentation at this stage?
1298200	1299840	No, that's wrong.
1299840	1304840	So even there's no obvious morphological lobes formed
1304960	1309960	from those mature queen-laid eggs embryos at this stage,
1310360	1312640	there's some conserved genes.
1312640	1316280	For example, windlass here already has the expression.
1316280	1319600	And I will go deeper for those gene expression later.
1321040	1324080	At this moment, I want to point out that
1327200	1332200	we firstly saw that actually during the egg stage,
1333400	1337720	the accelerations got speed up already, okay?
1338720	1340000	How about the larval stage?
1340000	1341160	How about the pupa stage?
1341160	1342440	That we don't know yet,
1342440	1345520	but they are different at the beginning, okay?
1345520	1350240	That means those foundraces-laid eggs got speed up
1351880	1354400	when the egg being laid.
1354400	1356480	So those are the four stages,
1356480	1359280	blastorym, heart shape, elongation, and segmentation,
1359280	1364280	and then labeled at which date each stage happened, okay?
1365760	1369760	And so why do we have to know that?
1369760	1372800	Actually, that brought some interesting concept
1372800	1377800	about maybe we should exam some aging genes
1377920	1382480	involved in elongation or segmentation at this stage.
1383080	1385160	We want to figure out what's the causation
1386160	1388720	for that acceleration, for that speed up.
1388720	1392520	It's quite interesting, and that will be our next step.
1392520	1393360	All right.
1395640	1397520	Okay, in the third part,
1397520	1402520	I want to explain the germbane type of the ants, okay?
1404320	1407560	Recall what we just discussed.
1407560	1411960	The honeybees and the wasps,
1411960	1416280	their germbane type is the same as Drosophila.
1416280	1418280	It's pretty similar to Drosophila.
1418280	1420400	Drosophila is a fruit fly, okay?
1420400	1422240	They're a long germbane species.
1422240	1427240	And I want to know whether ants has the similar germbane,
1427320	1430080	or actually ants follow different development pattern.
1432040	1435400	And when people study the germbane,
1436360	1438720	we use conserved genes, okay?
1438720	1440800	What does conserved genes means?
1440800	1445800	So conserved genes means you can see the same genes
1446520	1451520	showed up for similar purposes in different species.
1451840	1453640	In the textbook example,
1453640	1455960	people compare the hawk's genes
1455960	1460240	by fly, Drosophila, and the mouse, okay?
1460240	1462680	Both of those two very different species,
1462680	1464440	they have hawk's genes.
1464440	1469440	And they have similar principle in embryo development.
1472600	1475520	Even the outcome is totally different.
1475520	1478280	So the hawk's genes expression
1478280	1483280	involved in segmentation formation in insects, in flies,
1484080	1486920	but in mammals, in mouse,
1486920	1491920	it involves in the backbones or somites formation,
1492200	1494240	or somites formation.
1494240	1496560	Like if you consider backbone,
1496560	1501440	it's also kind of like segment-like concept, okay?
1503120	1506880	So the take-home message for the conserved genes
1506880	1511880	means, okay, no matter how different the species are,
1512520	1517120	they share the similar genes involved in similar principle.
1518800	1521680	And how do they utilize those conserved genes
1522440	1523640	in studying the germ bin?
1523640	1527120	So here is quite a little bit complicated.
1528800	1532360	I hope that can recall your high school biology
1532360	1534640	or college biology.
1535480	1540480	First, I want to say is from DNA to RNA to protein,
1541880	1546680	there are different procedures, not procedures, sorry.
1546680	1550080	So DNA will be transcribed to RNA
1550120	1552760	and then it will be translated to protein, okay?
1552760	1557520	That's how it works in the world, right?
1559000	1563400	For sometimes, not every DNA
1563400	1567680	will successfully being translated to protein.
1567680	1572680	Sometimes it will just end at the transcription step,
1572680	1575240	like they will stop at mRNA
1575240	1578440	and no more protein will be made, okay?
1578440	1581640	And sometimes, yes, you will see DNA RNA
1581640	1584680	and then find a product protein, okay?
1584680	1588040	For those genes, for those conserved genes,
1588040	1590680	which will stop at mRNA stage,
1590680	1593480	we have to use in-situ hybridization.
1595320	1599600	And for the genes will successfully
1599600	1601960	being translated to protein,
1601960	1605800	we use immunohybridization, all right?
1605800	1609160	So let me explain it slowly.
1609160	1612520	For in-situ hybridization,
1612520	1617240	we have to make the RNA probe
1617240	1620240	by using a DIC-labeled nucleotide.
1621160	1624760	So DIC-label is just like a price tag, okay?
1624760	1627280	Attached to those nucleotides.
1627280	1631720	Nucleotides are the code for your sequence,
1631720	1634400	for our DNA or RNA, okay?
1634760	1636240	What are those codes?
1636240	1641240	Those are ATCG and for DNA, AUCG for RNA.
1642720	1646160	So we assemble those RNA probe
1647320	1650360	with the DIC-labeled nucleotide.
1650360	1652120	That's the first step.
1652120	1655440	And the second step,
1655440	1660440	we treat the sample with anti-DIC antibody.
1661440	1664240	So that's another concept.
1664240	1666840	Back to your high school or college biology.
1668280	1669440	What is the antigen?
1669440	1671160	What is the antibody?
1671160	1675680	So during spring, there's lots of pollen, right?
1675680	1676840	And you will sneeze
1676840	1679240	and you will have some immunoreaction.
1680160	1681760	The reason why you will sneeze
1681760	1685600	is because those pollens you sniff in,
1685600	1687760	those are the antigen.
1687760	1690920	And your body, you have your immunosystem.
1690920	1693840	Your body will recognize that out here
1695880	1699240	as a bad thing and start to generate,
1699240	1701280	start to make antibody.
1701280	1704480	So when the next time you face the same antigen
1704480	1705600	like the pollen,
1706640	1709480	your body will have enough antibody
1711240	1712880	to make that reaction
1712880	1715760	so you can sneeze those bad things
1715760	1717800	which are pollens out, right?
1717800	1720560	The bad things that is bad to your body.
1722600	1725920	So this is the same idea.
1725920	1727800	The DIC-labeled, the DIC,
1729480	1734480	is the site that the anti-DIC antibody can bind to.
1735680	1738720	It's like making different layers of sandwiches.
1739960	1743680	And we also have the alkaline phosphatase
1744440	1747960	attached to that antibody.
1747960	1752320	And then we use chemicals, MBT and BCIP,
1752320	1754160	to make the color.
1754160	1756360	Okay, that's the reason why we can see
1757200	1759680	with this successful binding
1759680	1762840	between the DIC-labeled conjugated probe,
1762840	1765720	the RNA probe we made with the DIC,
1765720	1770720	and the successful binding of the anti-DIC antibody
1771440	1773120	attached to it,
1775080	1780040	we can, and then the next layer is the MBT-BCIP.
1780040	1784840	We can successfully see those colors, okay?
1785880	1788200	I hope I explained it clearly.
1789520	1790920	So three layers.
1790920	1794040	The first is the MRA, okay?
1794040	1797720	The MRA expression exists in the embryo at somewhere,
1797720	1799360	but how do we see that, right?
1799360	1802480	We need to see some color, right?
1802480	1804680	So we know where does it happen.
1804680	1806200	And how do we know?
1806200	1809560	First, we make the probe, the MRA probe,
1809560	1811400	to anneal with it,
1811400	1815400	and then we treat them, the antibody,
1815400	1817800	the antibody attached to a non-detect,
1817800	1822040	and we use chemicals to trigger that colorization
1822040	1823520	so we can see the color.
1823520	1824680	When we see the color,
1824680	1828720	we know where does the MRA got expressed.
1829040	1830520	That's the big story in short.
1830520	1832600	That's in-situ hybridization.
1833720	1837800	Immunohybridization, same idea.
1837800	1840720	We also treat them with different antibody.
1841840	1845240	First layer is the antigen.
1845240	1847640	You can consider as a protein.
1847640	1849840	There are some binding sites on the protein
1849840	1854600	that the antibody can recognize, okay?
1854600	1857760	So two layers in this picture.
1857760	1862760	The first antibody will bind to that protein, right?
1862920	1865600	And then we treat the sample
1865600	1867720	with a second layer antibody
1867720	1870760	which attached to a fluorescent tag
1870760	1873520	so we can see the color
1873520	1878520	after the tag got excited by the laser, okay?
1879960	1881560	Well, same idea, okay?
1881560	1884040	I hope you don't get confused at this moment.
1885040	1889040	So for in-situ hybridization,
1889040	1894040	as for those expression stops at MRA, right?
1894200	1895400	Because there's no protein.
1895400	1898640	So no protein can be reproduced
1898640	1901680	so there's no way you can use the immunohybridization
1901680	1903600	to see the colorization.
1903600	1905600	But for the immunohybridization,
1905600	1909840	since you can easily make antibody attached to the protein,
1910840	1913960	then we don't have to make the probe.
1914560	1915400	Right.
1916200	1918040	And what do I want to see?
1918040	1922080	There are two conserved genes involved in segmentation
1922080	1927080	that you can see it in even really different species.
1927480	1928720	So this is the example
1928720	1931200	for grasshopper embryo development.
1932280	1934440	Witless is the first gene.
1935560	1938000	Engrailed is the second gene.
1938000	1942000	In each segment of the insect's embryo,
1942040	1944600	witless MRA will be expressed
1944600	1947480	at the anterior part of each segment.
1947480	1951400	Engrailed protein will be translated
1951400	1956080	at the posterior part of each segment.
1956080	1958280	So in the real sample,
1958280	1961480	you will see witless, engrailed, witless,
1961480	1963040	engrailed, witless, engrailed,
1963040	1966440	just like the cartoon that I showed you, okay?
1966440	1969280	For the mouse part, for the thorax,
1969280	1972000	for the abdominal segments.
1973360	1978360	How about those expression in ants, okay?
1978440	1979720	And why is it important
1979720	1982120	to see those two genes involved in ants?
1983240	1985920	For Drosophila, for fruit fly,
1985920	1988000	those segmentation gene expression
1988000	1989920	showed up in the same time.
1991040	1994720	That's the typical feature for long-germband species.
1994720	1998040	So people study honeybee embryo development,
1998040	1999640	they see the same pattern,
1999640	2002040	those bands showed up in the same time.
2002040	2004120	Sometimes depends on the species.
2004120	2005880	Sometimes it's like 14 stripes,
2005880	2007560	sometimes like 16 stripes.
2008640	2012680	Depends on whether it's a wasp or honeybees, okay?
2012680	2017360	But if you see all the bands showed up in the same time,
2017360	2020960	that's the typical feature for a long-germband species.
2022240	2026240	But not for a short or intermediate germband species.
2027080	2029560	That's the reason why I use those two genes
2029560	2033760	to see whether ant embryo is similar
2033760	2037640	to honeybees or not, right?
2038720	2043720	So with the concept of the whole story
2044360	2049360	of the ant development pattern, the embryogenesis,
2049880	2053720	I can, we can easily figure it out
2053720	2058720	when is the proper time for us to apply those probes,
2059480	2064000	like the wingless or the engrossed antibody, right?
2064000	2068080	We definitely don't want to apply those probes
2069560	2073920	at a very early stage before any segments formed, right?
2073920	2077440	Like the heart-shaped stage, no matter how hard we try,
2077440	2079480	there's no way we can see the signal, right?
2079480	2083440	We got to apply the probes or antibody at the right time.
2084280	2087520	That's one of the important reason
2087520	2092520	why we have to know the developmental table first.
2093400	2096720	So with that idea, with that concept,
2096720	2100800	we know between day nine to day 12,
2100800	2104000	like when the segments starting to pop out,
2104000	2107720	are the good timing for us to apply those conserved genes,
2107720	2112720	probes or antibody, okay, to see the signal expression.
2112800	2117000	So for wingless on day nine, as you can see,
2117000	2120120	there's no obvious stripes formed yet,
2120120	2122480	but started by day 10,
2122480	2125120	you can see three stripes over here,
2125120	2127480	the top row and this bottom row,
2127480	2128640	there are the same data,
2128640	2131200	but just use different way
2131200	2135600	to show the bands to the audience, right?
2135600	2140400	And when the embryo gets older,
2140400	2142840	more stripes are adding up, okay?
2142840	2145400	Those are the stripes number.
2145400	2146720	Day nine, you got zero.
2146720	2149600	Day 10, we see four.
2149600	2152840	Between day 10 and day 11, we see 10.
2152840	2157480	And until day 12, we got 12, okay?
2157480	2162480	So that's the evidence to prove that those segments,
2163600	2165640	those stripes are actually adding up.
2165640	2168720	They didn't show up simultaneously.
2169560	2171400	How about the engraved?
2172680	2175320	Let me recall that wingless and engraved
2175320	2178360	will be expressed at the same time.
2179480	2180800	One is at the anterior,
2181720	2185000	one is at the posterior of the segments, right?
2185000	2187320	So we should be able to see the similar pattern
2188880	2191480	when we examine the engraved gene expression,
2191480	2192520	engraved protein.
2193840	2197240	So the day 10 embryo,
2197240	2201080	you can see there's only eight stripes, okay?
2201080	2203000	But when the embryo gets older,
2203000	2205480	the stripes number get adding up.
2205480	2208280	So that's the second evidence to show,
2208280	2212200	all right, actually embryogenesis
2214160	2215880	follow different development pattern
2215880	2219160	as other social insects, okay?
2219160	2224160	So they're actually not long-term band species, okay?
2224560	2227120	They're more similar to like tribolium,
2227120	2230640	like the beetles or the crickets.
2230640	2234160	That's a really interesting and surprising finding.
2235200	2238120	How about other social insects
2238120	2242720	that is not similar to honeybees or wasps?
2242720	2245480	Yes, we do find the evidence.
2246320	2251320	There's another wasp show a different,
2251680	2253520	show the similar pattern,
2253520	2256080	development pattern as the ants,
2256080	2259720	which is either we can call it a short-term band
2259720	2263040	or intermediate-term band development.
2263040	2266680	So the green signals are the engraved protein,
2266680	2268440	like the one you just showed.
2268440	2273440	You can see when the embryo grow from A to H,
2273440	2276200	you start to see the signal adding up.
2276200	2281200	C, you only see one band, one, yeah.
2281360	2284640	You see, well, this is the first band got formed.
2284640	2286440	It's not the actual band yet.
2286440	2288440	But D, you see like three stripes,
2288440	2290560	and E, you got more stripes,
2291560	2293880	and till H, like before,
2293880	2298360	you see like 16 stripes, 14 to 16 stripes.
2298360	2300440	Okay, and the red dots over here,
2300440	2304000	those are another different gene called VASA.
2304000	2307240	We're not going to explain too much.
2307240	2309880	I'm not going to explain VASA today.
2310400	2315200	So not just in ants, but also other social insects,
2315200	2320040	different wasps show the short-term
2320040	2323600	or intermediate-term band embryo development pattern.
2324720	2325560	All right.
2327600	2331480	So can we say that the ants
2331480	2336360	has identical development pattern as crickets,
2336400	2340080	because they're not the same as flies or honeybees?
2340080	2341400	No, we can't say that.
2342280	2347280	I used the embryogenesis figure from two papers.
2348040	2349600	First, we know, okay,
2349600	2352880	based on the adding up stripes feature,
2352880	2357040	ants are not like flies or honeybees.
2357040	2362040	But the embryo, the germ band formed completely.
2362640	2365920	Imagine the germ band is the hot dog,
2365920	2369400	and the yolk, the rest of the embryo is the bone, okay?
2371040	2374520	The ant embryo formed the hot dog first,
2374520	2378640	like completely, and then segments formed gradually.
2378640	2382320	But in the short-term band species like crickets,
2382320	2384880	you don't see the full hot dog first.
2384880	2386920	You see part of the hot dog,
2386920	2389680	and then more segments adding up.
2389880	2392600	So when the embryo gets older,
2392600	2397080	the hot dog, the germ band gets longer and longer, okay?
2397080	2402080	In ants, you see the germ band formed completely,
2402400	2404000	then segmentation.
2404000	2406440	But in crickets, well,
2406440	2411440	you don't see that four complete developed germ band.
2413000	2416480	You see the segments and the germ band elongation,
2416480	2418960	like it happens in the short-term band.
2419280	2421880	Germ band, sorry.
2421880	2424400	You see the segmentation adding up
2424400	2428520	and the germ band elongation in the same time, okay?
2428520	2431600	So we think at this moment,
2431600	2435280	based on our DAPI standing morphological data
2435280	2436960	of the development table,
2436960	2439960	and the two conserved gene expression data,
2442200	2446960	the ants' embryogenesis is more like a mixture
2447000	2452000	of long-term band and short-term band, okay?
2454080	2457280	And the next part will be the trophic egg.
2460480	2464120	So trophic egg means the nutrient, okay?
2464120	2465920	And for a long time,
2465920	2469000	for those entomologists who study ants,
2469000	2472720	trophic eggs are considered
2472720	2476240	as one of the nutrients to those babies, okay?
2477640	2481120	Here's the picture I took that the workers,
2481120	2485800	the worker of Adatexana guards those eggs,
2485800	2489600	her future sisters in the fungus garden.
2491280	2495120	Usually the workers will chop off the trophic eggs
2495120	2500120	and feed those larvae when the fungus start to grow,
2502200	2506600	I mean, in the founding colony, right?
2506640	2508720	In the founding colony,
2508720	2512040	the queen only has small piece of fungus,
2512040	2514800	so there's limited food resource.
2514800	2518120	Therefore, the queen has to lay some trophic eggs
2518120	2521360	and use those nutrients, the workers,
2521360	2524480	either the workers will use the trophic eggs
2524480	2526160	to feed those babies,
2526160	2529560	or before the first broods of workers come out,
2530760	2532880	the queen will chop off those trophic eggs
2532880	2535480	and feeds them as a nutrient,
2535520	2539880	feeds to the first broods of baby as a nutrient, okay?
2539880	2543080	And the life history trade for a fungus growing ant
2543080	2544680	is the queen lay eggs,
2544680	2549400	and also she brought a small patch of the fungus
2549400	2551480	from the mother colony
2551480	2555080	and use her feces, poops,
2555080	2556760	to cultivate the fungus.
2557840	2559760	Meanwhile, take care of those broods
2559760	2563360	and make them, help them to grow up successfully,
2563360	2566120	and those workers, once she has those workers,
2566120	2568840	enough workers, those workers will take care of her
2568840	2572920	and also start to make the fungus garden be bigger,
2572920	2574640	like this, right?
2574640	2577000	And one interesting thing that I discovered,
2577000	2580520	like luckily, a few months ago,
2580520	2585040	is we found a new type of trophic eggs, right?
2587880	2590080	So when I first look at that,
2590120	2593000	I just thought, why the eggs,
2595040	2597200	the morphology of the eggs is so different,
2597200	2598120	they're so bizarre,
2598120	2600880	it looks like two eggs attached to each other.
2600880	2604520	And then I did multiple different sampling.
2604520	2608400	I figured out, actually, here are the fertilized eggs,
2609400	2610640	like here,
2610640	2614000	and those two are the huge, massive trophic eggs
2614000	2616840	that anneal to each other,
2616840	2619760	and even deform, okay?
2620440	2623080	So I sampled, like I got more samples
2623080	2624600	from those funguses,
2626280	2631280	and we can clearly see that those funguses,
2631320	2635040	they do lay trophic eggs,
2635040	2637040	like those massive trophic eggs
2637040	2641440	and the fertilized eggs in the same time, okay?
2641440	2646120	This is not the same you can see from the mature garden.
2646120	2648320	For the mature garden,
2648320	2652120	that we have, like four or five years old garden,
2652120	2655840	those queens only lay fertilized eggs.
2655840	2660840	So only during the foundries,
2660920	2662920	only during the foundry level,
2663800	2666600	like when they start to establish the fungus garden,
2667720	2669360	you can see those trophic eggs.
2670680	2672600	And here is their cartoon figure
2672600	2676320	to show three types of eggs.
2677320	2679840	The first one is the fertilized eggs,
2679840	2682480	like regular egg, the 2N egg,
2682480	2686000	and the second is, we call it trophic A,
2686000	2688000	and the third is the trophic B.
2688000	2692240	Here's the actual figure for fertilized trophic A
2692240	2694600	and trophic B, okay?
2697960	2700360	And I'll have more footage to show you
2701680	2704120	how do I distinguish whether that egg
2704200	2707280	is a trophic A or trophic B.
2707280	2710440	So let's focus on trophic B first.
2711480	2715480	One interesting feature for trophic B is
2715480	2717840	the egg is just like a water balloon.
2717840	2719760	It's so massive.
2719760	2723680	And when you place it on their solid place,
2723680	2727840	solid surface, it will deform, okay?
2729120	2733440	And if you place it on the fungus garden,
2733760	2738360	after 24 hours, it will be liquefied or deliquent.
2738360	2739520	Okay, what does that mean?
2739520	2741200	Why is it important to see,
2741200	2744840	like, why is it interesting?
2744840	2748040	So trophic eggs, for a long time,
2748040	2750520	people just think, people think,
2750520	2754360	or observe that either the new queen
2754360	2759360	or the new workers will use them to feed the babies.
2760120	2762120	But this is the first evidence,
2762120	2765440	first discovery to see that actually
2765440	2769720	trophic B egg can also be one of the nutrients
2769720	2772080	for the fungus garden, okay?
2773400	2776640	The fungus garden started with a small patch,
2776640	2778240	like a really small piece,
2778240	2783240	when the new queen fly out from their mother colony.
2784080	2786600	And the fungus garden ants,
2786600	2789240	the fungus garden ants, the leaf collar ants,
2789240	2791960	they cannot live without fungus.
2792800	2795760	No matter how many workers they got,
2795760	2797240	once they lost the fungus,
2797240	2800040	the whole colony will just die, okay?
2800040	2803560	So it's really important to make sure
2803560	2805720	that small patch of the fungus
2805720	2808840	the queen brought out from the mother colony
2808840	2812600	can successfully be cultivated
2812600	2816000	during the first or second month, right?
2818080	2821400	Okay, so we hypothesize that
2821480	2825360	the trophic B, the egg laid by the queen
2826360	2828920	has the evolutionary benefits
2828920	2833120	to make sure the fungus garden
2833120	2837440	can obtain, receive enough nutrient.
2839960	2843560	This is another replication that we did the collection,
2843560	2845800	and you can see after two hours,
2845800	2847720	in the first footage,
2847720	2850520	you see three trophic B eggs.
2850520	2852440	After 24 hours,
2853760	2856320	we clearly see that the trophic eggs
2856320	2859360	got deliquid, liquefied, okay?
2860240	2863840	So would the egg be liquefied
2865640	2867880	by the fungus only,
2867880	2871280	or it will be liquefied just by itself?
2871280	2872760	I mean, without the fungus,
2872760	2875880	we're really interesting to know that.
2875880	2877320	The next step we did
2877320	2879600	is we put the trophic B egg
2879600	2880880	on the compost slab
2880880	2885440	in the close to 100% humidity environment.
2885440	2887840	In the petri dish they've created,
2888840	2890800	after 24 hours,
2890800	2895480	the egg will be deliquid by itself, okay?
2895480	2897600	So it proves that
2898560	2901880	this is a really nice
2902760	2904960	co-evolutionary evidence
2904960	2907680	to help the fungus,
2907680	2909400	to help the queen,
2909400	2912080	like on both parties, right?
2912080	2914040	So the queen needs the fungus,
2914040	2916360	and she will lay those trophic eggs
2916360	2920480	to help her to maintain the fungus,
2920480	2922880	to grow the fungus to be better, okay?
2922880	2927320	And the egg itself will deliquid,
2927320	2930680	so it will provide the nutrient
2930680	2933280	or the water to that small fungus
2933280	2938280	and help them to grow well at the beginning, right?
2944080	2947880	We have more image to show the difference
2947880	2949560	between the fertilized eggs,
2949560	2950720	trophic A egg,
2950720	2952320	and trophic B egg.
2952320	2953720	For the fertilized eggs,
2955040	2959560	usually the eggs will be guarded by the worker,
2959560	2963560	and after 20 days,
2963560	2965680	depends on the temperature,
2965680	2967240	or 15 days,
2967240	2970400	it will hatch to larvae,
2970400	2973240	and will grow up to worker.
2974240	2975960	And those fungus,
2975960	2979480	the mycelium cannot intrude to those eggs,
2979480	2981720	cannot harm those eggs, okay?
2983520	2984680	On bigger B,
2984680	2986320	you can see the mycelium grow
2986320	2987680	on the surface of the egg,
2987720	2990440	but the egg's still pretty good,
2990440	2991800	in a good status.
2991800	2993040	And bigger C,
2994640	2997200	you can see the egg's still really,
2998680	3000520	it's not damaged.
3000520	3003600	But how about the other two trophic eggs,
3003600	3006800	the trophic A and trophic B, okay?
3006800	3008440	For the trophic A egg,
3010160	3012360	the mycelium will start to absorb
3012360	3014240	the nutrient from inside,
3014240	3015760	and cause the dent,
3015760	3017480	and eventually it just sucked up
3017480	3019280	all the nutrient by days,
3019280	3021400	like after 13 days.
3023080	3024400	And the trophic B egg,
3024400	3027240	it will deliquest by itself, okay?
3027240	3030200	Just like the way I explained to you,
3030200	3033600	and why it is important
3035160	3039320	to help to cultivate the fungus garden.
3043280	3044120	Okay.
3044120	3048920	So besides the image evidence,
3048920	3051240	I also fixed the trophic A egg
3051240	3052440	to prove that
3056360	3058160	we have two types of trophic egg.
3059000	3061160	So for the fertilized egg,
3061160	3062000	day five,
3062000	3063960	you can see the embryo start to grow,
3063960	3065920	like during the elongation.
3066880	3068360	This is the future head lobe,
3068360	3070240	here's the future body.
3070240	3071920	But the trophic A egg,
3071920	3074080	there's only a single nuclei,
3074880	3075800	and nothing happens,
3075800	3079400	and eventually the fungus garden
3079400	3081280	will absorb the nutrient.
3085160	3086000	Okay.
3088320	3091760	The last part of my talk will be,
3091760	3094880	let's go back to those males, okay?
3096120	3098920	So I briefly explained
3098920	3101640	how does the embryo grow in ants,
3101640	3104080	and the differences between lower
3104080	3106440	and higher level agriculture ants,
3106440	3108680	and no matter how different they are,
3108680	3111600	they show the similar development pattern
3111600	3113200	of their embryos.
3113200	3118000	And also, we found out a new type of trophic eggs
3118000	3120040	that people never discovered before,
3120040	3122920	and we had the hypothesis that
3122920	3127160	trophic eggs can also be the nutrient resource
3127160	3128120	for the fungus garden,
3128120	3130760	not just for the babies, the larvae.
3131960	3135360	And one interesting we found out is,
3135360	3136880	do you remember that I mentioned
3136880	3140000	the haploid diploid of the insects?
3140000	3143200	Some haploid eggs laid by the foundresses
3143200	3147040	will become a male, okay?
3147040	3149200	But usually that won't happen
3149200	3151720	when the foundresses started
3151720	3154240	to establish the colony, right?
3154240	3157200	Because only female workers are useful
3157200	3160120	that can help her to maintain everything.
3160160	3164480	The male individual is totally useless
3164480	3165840	at that stage.
3165840	3167040	They do nothing.
3167040	3169320	They basically just waste the energy,
3170560	3174320	and also they are not helpful, okay?
3175200	3176880	Ideally, that won't happen,
3176880	3181880	but we did find a weird nanotech male
3182600	3186800	from those founding colony, okay?
3186800	3189120	And those males are really small.
3189120	3190200	We call it nanotech.
3190200	3192440	Nanotech means like lack of nutrient
3192440	3195840	and body size is really small.
3198800	3203280	We found out that they have weird,
3203280	3207720	like fairy wings.
3207720	3210480	The wings are not well-developed,
3210480	3213960	and they were just crawling around
3213960	3215840	in the fungus garden.
3215840	3220840	Once the pupa occlusion happened,
3221400	3223440	like became an adult,
3223440	3227760	the queen will kill that within 48 hours, okay?
3229120	3230360	Oops, yeah.
3230360	3232440	So here's the complete vision
3232440	3236600	for the nanotech male of Eta texana.
3237680	3240080	The morphology is totally different
3240080	3243040	as the regular female workers.
3244040	3247600	We don't know the queen can recognize
3247600	3250920	the weird nanotech male by vision
3250920	3253360	or by the smell.
3253360	3255120	More studies we have to do,
3256200	3259120	but at least one thing we can assure is
3259120	3260080	during this stage,
3260080	3263640	the egg, the larvae, or the pupa stage,
3263640	3265840	here's the nanotech, future nanotech male.
3267840	3269560	Before pupa stage,
3269560	3272360	the queen will still take care of them
3272960	3277880	as the way the queen takes care of the workers.
3277880	3282440	But once they become the weird,
3282440	3284320	crawling around male,
3285320	3286280	they'll be killed,
3286280	3289800	like literally ripped off by the queen.
3291200	3293960	So that's also a new finding
3293960	3295880	that we're excited to publish
3295880	3297320	on Insect Social
3299160	3301920	of the behavior
3303120	3305400	so the queen knows
3305400	3308800	those are not actual helpful workers
3308800	3311640	and they will just kill them.
3311640	3313280	But the stories behind them
3313280	3316560	is like how does she receive the signal,
3316560	3318120	how does she know by vision
3318120	3320000	or by other smell cues
3320000	3324840	are really interesting to do more research.
3324840	3326320	All right.
3326320	3328040	I hope you guys don't fall asleep.
3328040	3329280	It's a long talk.
3329320	3330960	And overall,
3332680	3334520	I finished the four parts.
3334520	3336880	And thanks for your listening.
3336880	3340960	And please ask me if you have any question.
3342480	3343320	Thank you.
3345600	3346960	Okay.
3346960	3349560	Thanks for Andy's talk.
3351080	3353320	Let's give him a applause first.
3353320	3354320	Thank you.
3356680	3357680	Don't look at me.
3361000	3361520	All right.
3361520	3364560	So if you have any questions,
3364560	3367360	please just go ahead and ask Andy.
3372040	3373560	How many people we have?
3374720	3376880	Now we have six, including you.
3376880	3378040	Okay.
3378040	3381280	Sorry, the talk was like too long.
3381280	3382960	I was starving.
3383080	3384080	No, I think you're fine.
3384080	3388200	But your talk is pretty kind of professional.
3389160	3391840	And even I don't understand,
3391840	3396840	I would say half of the sites
3397280	3402240	because I don't study embryo genesis.
3402240	3404920	Anyway, the development of embryos, right?
3404920	3405760	Yeah.
3409480	3411600	But actually I do have one question.
3411600	3413520	Why do we care about?
3413520	3416160	So that question,
3416160	3417120	so first let me ask,
3417120	3418640	what is the germ band though?
3420080	3423760	Oh, so the germ band means the embryo.
3425000	3426720	The embryo itself.
3426720	3427560	Okay.
3427560	3432160	So the embryo has the yolk and the future larva.
3432160	3435920	And the germ band is just like the hotdog.
3435920	3438040	And the yolk is like the bond.
3438040	3440320	The overall, the two things,
3440320	3443320	we call it an egg, right?
3445320	3446160	Yeah.
3446160	3451160	So the future larva grow from the germ band.
3451320	3453280	Okay, start with the small heart
3453280	3455280	and then start to grow bigger and bigger
3455280	3458360	and then segments and then form the future larva.
3458360	3459400	That's the germ band.
3460360	3462480	And why do we need to care the difference
3462480	3464680	between long and short germ bands?
3464680	3466760	We actually don't have to care about that.
3468040	3471560	So, no, that's not true.
3471560	3473000	So that doesn't matter.
3473000	3474200	That actually doesn't matter.
3474200	3476720	Like, okay, yeah, it's long or short.
3476720	3478760	But the reason why I want to study this
3478760	3482560	is because the very first few slides
3482560	3484720	I mentioned cast determination.
3484720	3487040	So actually at the beginning,
3487040	3489400	I really want to know what are the genes
3489400	3492240	involved in cast determination in ants
3492240	3495400	if that actually happens during early stage.
3496400	3501400	But without knowing the complete development table,
3501400	3505280	I can barely can do anything, right?
3505280	3507360	I don't have the tool.
3507360	3509640	For example, for like flies,
3509640	3511320	people know how the embryo grows.
3511320	3513600	So I can see different gene expression
3513600	3514920	at different stage.
3514920	3519000	With that knowledge, I can do some prediction, right?
3519320	3526720	So if Ahab's theory is not saying it's wrong.
3526720	3529400	I mean, if his theory is correct,
3529400	3533160	we should be able to see some gene expression
3533160	3535520	during the early embryo development.
3538040	3540520	But how do I apply those probes?
3540520	3541880	How do I apply those genes
3541880	3544240	without knowing the development table?
3544240	3547680	We can do nothing, right?
3547680	3553320	So I got to study like how does the embryo grow first.
3553320	3555440	And surprisingly, we figured out,
3555440	3559560	oh, okay, so actually they have different pattern
3559560	3562040	like other social insects.
3562040	3564440	So we divide them into different categories.
3564440	3567240	So my finding just like to point out,
3567240	3572840	oh, ants, they are more like grasshoppers,
3572840	3578960	like crickets, not like honeybees or wasps.
3578960	3580520	Okay, so that's just a step
3580520	3583320	before you can move on to your further research.
3583320	3585440	Exactly, that's the foundation.
3585440	3586480	Yes, yes.
3586480	3590720	But if you ask like why does long or short matter?
3590720	3591680	No, that doesn't matter.
3591680	3594240	It's just like a prescription, right?
3594240	3596520	Okay, okay, okay.
3596520	3598400	Got it.
3598400	3601720	All right, are there any other questions?
3601760	3605320	Hi, I have two questions.
3605320	3607600	So I'm Jason.
3607600	3610000	I'm from, I'm Jason Hong.
3610000	3613680	I'm like a physics postdoc.
3613680	3617360	So, you know, I have no prior knowledge about the ant
3617360	3622320	and like I have no limited knowledge about biology.
3622320	3627080	So I have like one pretty simple question.
3627080	3630400	So you mentioned that for male ant,
3630880	3634360	it only has like one set of chromosome
3634360	3637200	and for female, there are two, right?
3637200	3639360	So like what determines that?
3639360	3642480	So for human, we know that it's,
3642480	3644520	so you have two kind of sperm.
3644520	3647560	So one is with X and one is Y.
3647560	3654280	And like that determines the sex of your like birth.
3654280	3658920	So like what determines that in the ant colony?
3658920	3664600	Right, so the egg has a single set of chromosome.
3664600	3667960	And if the egg got fertilized,
3667960	3670960	the sperm will bring another set of chromosome
3670960	3672560	into that egg, right?
3672560	3674080	So if the egg got fertilized,
3674080	3676880	it will be a two ant individual.
3676880	3679880	Like it has two sets of chromosome.
3679880	3683120	If the egg didn't get fertilized,
3683160	3688960	it will be a male supposedly from a mature colony.
3688960	3690000	Okay, I see.
3690000	3691120	Yeah.
3691120	3698360	So even not fertilized egg can be hatched in ant egg?
3698360	3700000	Theoretically, yes.
3700000	3705760	But there's some, like you don't see that,
3705760	3709680	you don't see male ants come out from the founding colony.
3709680	3713240	Founding colony means the colony just started to grow.
3713240	3718800	You only see the male ants come out from the mature colony.
3718800	3722960	Yeah, so that's also a topic like people want to study
3722960	3724480	the reason why.
3724480	3727200	Okay, so we don't know why yet?
3727200	3727840	We don't know.
3727840	3729040	We don't know why yet.
3729040	3732560	Okay, so I have another question.
3732560	3735640	So you mentioned that for the foundress ant
3735640	3737840	and the mature queen egg,
3737840	3741120	they have a different hatch time.
3741120	3742000	Right.
3742000	3746520	Right, so also like I guess you show the data,
3746520	3751600	but I don't remember you explain why that is the case.
3751600	3755680	And is there any method we can understand why?
3755680	3762600	So is it due to chemicals or due to some biological processes?
3762600	3766920	Okay, so we don't know the real key factors
3766960	3769480	involved in that acceleration.
3769480	3774000	And for now, we guess it's because of methylation.
3774000	3778760	So, all right, let's put it in the easy way.
3778760	3782200	So when, think about you're the new mom
3782200	3784480	and you have to start your colony
3784480	3788160	and there's so many birds or frogs trying to eat you
3788160	3791320	and you got to face those pressures in the field
3791320	3795240	and start like also having babies
3795280	3797080	and start to build your nest.
3797080	3799080	So you want to do that ASAP, right?
3799080	3802160	You want to do that as soon as possible.
3802160	3807240	Yeah, and that's the reason why we think that makes sense
3807240	3812040	that those foundresses broods will grow faster.
3812040	3812960	Okay.
3812960	3817080	Right, but what's the mechanism behind this?
3817080	3821680	What's the reason for causing that speeding up process?
3821680	3823880	We don't know.
3823880	3824960	Okay.
3825000	3826360	Oh, I also...
3826360	3827400	Oh, sorry.
3827400	3828960	Oh, maybe it's okay.
3828960	3832200	So I also heard that in humans,
3832200	3836360	it's actually like the first birth song,
3836360	3841600	you will have a higher probability for like early birth.
3841600	3843160	Is that the...
3843160	3847320	I mean, that might be like a very far away,
3847320	3851040	but is that something also similar?
3851040	3852600	Oh, I have no idea.
3852600	3853800	Really?
3854000	3855480	I actually don't know.
3855480	3856520	Okay, yeah.
3856520	3858920	So I guess you can check.
3858920	3860600	I don't know what it is.
3860600	3862120	It's a legend.
3862120	3864120	It's a rumor kind of thing.
3864120	3865800	Okay, okay, cool.
3865800	3867120	I will check it.
3868880	3870760	Wait, doesn't it mean the first born
3870760	3873680	will be larger than the others?
3873680	3874720	It will be faster.
3874720	3879160	The pregnancy period is shorter.
3879160	3881160	Oh.
3881160	3882720	In what animal?
3882720	3888840	It's more like the rate for early birth is higher.
3891920	3892920	Interesting.
3892920	3895040	Yeah, I would check it.
3895040	3896040	Okay.
3896040	3898040	I haven't heard about that as well.
3901120	3902240	I'm not very sure.
3902240	3904320	So you should double check.
3904320	3905200	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3905200	3907200	But that's interesting.
3908200	3909200	All right.
3909200	3911200	So are there any other questions
3911200	3916200	or other concerns or suggestions for Andy?
3919200	3920200	All right, if not,
3920200	3923200	I'm going to stop recording this talk.
