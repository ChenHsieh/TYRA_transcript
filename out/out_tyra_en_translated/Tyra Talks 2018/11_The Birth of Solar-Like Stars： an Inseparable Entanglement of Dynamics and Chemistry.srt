00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Welcome everyone to today's TerraTalk. We are approaching the end of the year, so we may not have a speech next week.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, we are honored to invite Dr. Yang Yaolun to tell us about his doctoral research.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is now a doctoral candidate for the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
In fact, he is about to graduate.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When he was in college, he graduated from the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin, and then came to the United States to study astronomy.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:55,000
His specialties and research interests include early-phase star formation, including observations and simulations.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In his doctoral research career, he has used various telescopes such as Herschel, ALMA, and SOFIA to do his research.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What is interesting is that he is also the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What kind of event is this?

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They will regularly give speeches to the public on astronomy at the bar.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They have now grown to more than 250 people attending each time.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dr. Yang Yaolun is the host of Astronomy on Tap at UT Austin.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Today, he will talk about the topic of the birth of solar-like stars and the inseparable entanglement of dynamics and chemistry.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's welcome Dr. Yang Yaolun to give a speech.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have been involved in this project for a long time.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Over the past few years, I have been doing research on star formation at UT Austin.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am a 6th-year PhD student at UT Austin.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My main advisor is Neil Evans.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We mainly do various observations on star formation.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We use models to explain the physical and chemical phenomena observed in early star formation.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Dr. Yang mentioned SOFIA observations.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is SOFIA?

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SOFIA stands for Stratospheric Observations for Infrared Astronomy.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is an astronomical observatory for infrared.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why do we use SOFIA for infrared observation?

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Because there are a lot of water vapors in the atmosphere.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
These water vapors emit a lot of infrared rays.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When we observe on the ground, we only observe the water vapors on the earth.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, many times, we use a telescope, such as Spitzer or Hubble, to observe infrared rays.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If I remember correctly, we can avoid 95% to 99% of water vapors by using a telescope.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is SOFIA.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can see that SOFIA is a modified Boeing 747.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can see that there is a bulge in the middle section of the tail of the plane.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It is not very clear here.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It is a hole in the middle section.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A 2.7-meter telescope is placed in the hole.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When the telescope flies up, the door will open.

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is how it is observed.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Astronomers and technicians discuss how to make the observation easier to achieve and adjust the strategy in time.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is how my advisor and I are going to get on the plane.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It is very different.

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a military airport.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When you enter the airport, you will go up the stairs.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There is a B-2 bomber in the same airport.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is the inside of SOFIA.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The blue part is the instrument.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The other side of the closed cabin is the telescope.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The other side of the telescope is the mirror.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The other side is the instrument.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is a balance on the weight on both sides.

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Different instruments, telescopes, and mission operators monitor the observation on these stations.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is a very complicated task.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:06:00,000
NASA considers every flight of SOFIA as a mission.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There is a mission director.

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There is a mission briefing before departure.

58
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is the route we flew that day.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We flew from Palmdale, California, about an hour and a half north of LA.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can see that the route is very strange.

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Basically, the route is determined by each arc.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One arc is for a target.

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Here we have six or seven targets.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The longer, the longer you stay on the celestial body.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's move on to today's topic.

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Today's topic is mainly about star formation.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How do we understand the dynamics of early planetary orbits and the corresponding chemical changes?

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is a picture of our galaxy.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can see a lot of these black irregularities in the middle.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is what we call Darkland.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It has a lot of dust.

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It is also a higher density place.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It is also an area where stars are forming.

74
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If we zoom in to one of them, the Molecular Cloud,

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It is mainly a star-forming place.

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
These black areas are also the so-called dust gathering areas.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It is a place where stars form early.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If we switch to infrared light,

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can see that there are a lot of these pillars or even what we call filamentary structures.

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
These are from what we imagine as a celestial sphere on Earth.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's like a sphere in the sky, but it's not a ball or even a block here.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's more like a texture or a filamentary structure.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then through these filaments,

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The gas and dust will be pulled to the middle through this filament.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then pull to the middle and then reach a high enough density.

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then trigger the activity of this star formation.

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is when the star formation occurs.

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You will have a lot of.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Basically, the density will be from 10 to 3 or 10 to 5.

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is the mole per cubic centimeter.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It will be quickly multiplied by 10 to the power of 9 to the power of 10 to the power of 4.

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is a very large number of changes.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In the process, if you have, um.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
At the beginning, um.

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When the collapse, um.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're going to have a little bit of, uh.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The angular momentum is in the outermost part.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you have this smaller angular momentum, it's in a very small area.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's going to be a lot of rotation.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At this time, the degree of rotation is likely to make this.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The collapse of the star formation is not very effective.

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That is to say, your, uh.

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The gas becomes itself to rotate there, not to continue.

106
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Continue, uh.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's sucked into the middle of the star.

108
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In the process, there will be a lot of.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We call outflow, and then go.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Go to these, um.

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The high-speed rotation of the matter is released.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And then go in to reduce.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The angular momentum of the whole system.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You see the green ones here.

115
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The matter that looks like a jet is the outflow.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, this is a simulation.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That is, um, a simulation.

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Roughly describe that we are from a filament.

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And then slowly, uh, develop into.

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It will start with a filament, and then zoom in.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then you'll see a star.

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The early shape of the star.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The situation is a lot of molecules.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Very, very fatal molecules.

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How to be in that state.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And then, um.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Collapse and then erupt.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's what you saw in the picture just now.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This kind of outflow.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
OK, so you can see this whole process.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is very, very.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Very big change, and then, um.

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's going to take a lot, a lot, a lot.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Irregular structure.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We also found in observation.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's what it is.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can see here, this one.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The picture behind this black and white picture is.

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Uh, the distribution of molecules.

141
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is.

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then the different symbols in front of it.

143
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It means that we are directly observed.

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Early star.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Uh, where it appears.

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can see most of it.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Early stars are in, um.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
These molecules.

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Uh, it's also a more fatal place, so it's produced.

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, um.

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We can probably get one of these.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Uh, scenario is to say that you first have a lot of very fatal clouds and dust.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then through.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Um, these clouds and dust may slowly or even quickly.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Um.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It will collapse to the middle and then become.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Uh, a star or a few stars, I don't know.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So in this process, a very important thing is to say.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, this is probably a very simple one.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Uh, cartoon pattern to express the words is that we have a, uh, a core at the beginning.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We call pre-stereo core.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Simply put, it's the core before the stellar.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So it's called pre-stereo core.

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And then you start to collapse.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
These core collapse to the middle and become, uh.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Uh, in the early days, it was called pro-star.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So we called this core pro-stereo core.

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
At the same time, it may, uh.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Um.

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It produces a lot of, uh, these.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
These flow, this orange side is called the flow.

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What about the evolution?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
These substances.

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The surrounding matter is either sucked into the middle and becomes a part of the star.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or.

176
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It will be affected by a lot of feedback.

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And then it just.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just slowly, uh, dissipated.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And then the rest of you are left with a disk.

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because.

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There's still a lot of matter, um, in the middle.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The middle part of the high-speed rotation.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no way it's very direct.

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's sucked into the middle, uh, on the planet.

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So there's a disk.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What about this side?

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This disk is, um, planet.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's where the stars are produced.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So gradually, this disk will slowly evolve into, uh.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Generally, we recognize the planter system.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just like.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Our solar system, we may be somewhere here.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay, um.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So we, uh.

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There's a pretty important one.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Uh, the question is, is this.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
In the early days of this info, from this.

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When you want to produce a pro star.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Uh, it's like a process like this.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How much is his time scale?

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay, um.

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
In the pre-status evolution, it's not quite certain now.

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So basically.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Um.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If a core starts to collapse.

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Production process to become, uh.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Just from, uh.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Core pre-status.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This is probably.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
2 million years.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Relatively short.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Then it disappears from disk to disk.

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's probably 10 million years.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So.

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then one, one, for example, like our sun, our sun.

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
About 10 million years.

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So this is probably their time.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's 1% and 1%.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Then I have another question.

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Uh, that's it.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's one of these.

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Uh, how do you say this?

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
One of these processes.

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
With the limit, for example, is the model universe.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Or, for example.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Z equals 3, z equals 5.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Or something like that.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Or these things will only happen in the near future.

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So there is no difference.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm talking about the near future.

232
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, the near future is actually.

233
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's just that it happens, but it happens in the early days.

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That even has a lot of.

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
A lot of active research areas are doing the so-called first star.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's the first star that starts the earliest.

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's one of the biggest differences.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Uh.

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's in the core.

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Um.

241
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This core, a dance core, he wants to collapse.

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He doesn't need to, uh.

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It doesn't have to be dynamic.

244
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If he is, uh.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The temperature is very high, he is very.

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
His thermal motion is very strong, so he.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
His thermal pressure, he can.

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's easy to be greater than this.

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This gravity gives him this middle attraction, so.

250
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Um, when the temperature is very high, it's not easy to collapse.

251
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's why he has to be cold enough to collapse.

252
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What about in the early universe?

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Um, I should say, um.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Um, how do you make this?

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This core becomes very cold.

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Usually a very important mechanism is called, uh.

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Basically, uh.

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Your energy, uh, is absorbed by molecules, and then molecules.

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Decay.

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Decay, and then it becomes radiation.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The radiation goes out, and the energy leaves the system.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So you, you will slowly become cold.

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That molecule or.

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um.

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's just more.

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
In addition to hydrogen, these atoms are more useful for cooling.

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's relative to the early universe.

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This cool will be weaker.

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So, in the early universe, everyone will think that your core can become.

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It can grow very big, and then.

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then it's easy to form a super big quality.

272
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And so on.

273
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I believe that now we have not yet observed anything.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But there should be a lot of simulation to do this part.

275
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Ok, thank you.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ok, so, um.

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So, from an observational point of view, we want to know.

278
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey, how does this collapse happen?

279
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What kind of mold does this material go through?

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
From the outside of this core.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The outer region is transferred to the inner region.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's like in this simulation, which is simulating.

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How does this core collapse?

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And then.

285
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In the end.

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You can see that the middle of this collapse is very, very short at the beginning.

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Compared to the time after that.

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So, you can see the same thing as the previous one.

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can see that it is very irregular.

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And so it means that there may be a lot of structures in it.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Different structures, different modes.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It depends on the angle you look at.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It may be outflow.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Other places may see it as info.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So, um.

296
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
For the measurement of this info.

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We mainly want to know how this info started.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And then how he did it.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
For example, how far is he?

300
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
How big is the size scale?

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How do you start?

302
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
For example, how big does this core need to grow at what temperature?

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He will start to have info.

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How is his process?

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How fast does he increase as the radius gets smaller and smaller?

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Or even not increase, so the radius gets smaller and smaller.

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It may be slower or faster.

308
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So how did he evolve in the end?

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This rotation dominant region.

310
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's more like a disc.

311
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
An early disc.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A region like that.

313
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How did he go from the original radio motion to the rotation?

314
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, um.

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Through this view, we want to know.

316
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What is the model of this info?

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We have a way to write a very good model.

318
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
To simulate this part.

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And then there's the chemical change.

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How do you change with this info?

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll talk more about this later.

322
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's talk about it now.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then in a bigger structure.

324
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Um.

325
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This info is actually.

326
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
For our so-called initial mass function.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Very important.

328
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What is the initial mass function?

329
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a bit like.

330
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Um.

331
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We're going to build a galaxy now.

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Build a star system.

333
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
My inside.

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Various quality stars.

335
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What's the ratio?

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is called the initial mass function.

337
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There may be smaller mass stars, smaller mass stars, more.

338
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's one.

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Uh.

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Mass distribution is the initial mass function.

341
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That.

342
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But these initial mass functions are mainly refers to.

343
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Uh, already generated stars.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So we.

345
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In the early days, in the space travel, we really want to know.

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay, if we have.

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This kind of big and small.

348
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Different sizes of core.

349
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What kind of stars will these cores become?

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Between them.

351
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Core mass distribution and initial mass distribution.

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Uh, what is the mass distribution of the star?

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Change.

354
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So we hope that in the future, through this understanding, this info model can.

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Can.

356
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There are some hints that say, OK, if we have a core, it may be.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A solar mass.

358
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That may be how many percent will become.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Uh.

360
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
How much will the middle star be?

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is that what we want?

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I can go through this model.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This research.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Go to approach.

365
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Ultimately approach this problem.

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
How do we go from this blue core mass function to this?

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Dashboard, all kinds of different dashboards.

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Uh, initial mass function.

369
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The other thing is that we are now in the early days.

370
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Uh, these are also seeing a lot of binary systems.

371
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And in the general, uh.

372
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Already formed a star, we also know.

373
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Uh.

374
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Most of the stars are binary, that is.

375
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Uh, double star or more.

376
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Uh, multiple system.

377
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Then we also saw this situation in the early days.

378
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That.

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You want to know how this early star.

380
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Uh, how can it form such a binary system?

381
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Then this.

382
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This binary system is for this info or what impact.

383
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Or say, what kind of criterion do you want to reach for the mass of your info?

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What kind of threshold will trigger such fragmentation?

385
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Fragment into.

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Different 2 or 3 or more sources.

387
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So we want to know.

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Uh.

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This initial condition, what is it?

390
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
How big is it?

391
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then it is, how much is its quality?

392
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then I hope we can get to know how much.

393
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How much mass will be in the middle?

394
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
How much will be retained in the middle?

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
OK, this is another, uh, this is a very.

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The system has three, three, three stars in the middle.

397
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So we still don't know why it's like this.

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
OK, the other part is.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey, we're like this, this.

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
MWC480, this, this disk, you see a lot of this kind of structure.

401
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But in addition, we also see a lot of different.

402
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Uh, more complex, like this.

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Or this is different.

404
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Um.

405
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Uh, more large molecules of organic compounds.

406
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That, uh, we were in the early, uh.

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Uh, the core stage also saw a lot of these, uh.

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Organic chemicals, these.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Organic chemicals, because organic chemicals, ultimately, they will become.

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It will enter the interstitial atmosphere, and then it may be.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Trigger, uh.

412
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The main part of the life cycle, because these organic chemicals may be.

413
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
In addition to speaking more broadly, it may even be the first step of life.

414
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Or even the seed of life.

415
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So we want to know that in the early stage of this core evolution.

416
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
How do these chemicals change with the information?

417
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Um, the same, I'm going to do a lot of explanation in the back.

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
OK, so our goal is to find out how this information happened.

419
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Then we are in the way we are currently using it.

420
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We are, uh, trying to measure, uh.

421
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
To measure, uh.

422
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Uh, the performance of, uh.

423
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Kinematic structure is simply through his.

424
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The shape of the line to analyze that in the end, his.

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Uh, we look at this line of sight inside.

426
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What is the path of the movement of the gas?

427
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So.

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Here, if we look at it from this antenna,

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
On the left, this is a very simplified one.

430
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Core of the information.

431
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
One of the more common models is the middle of the information.

432
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The velocity is higher than the outside of the information.

433
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So you can simplify this thing.

434
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Like this picture on the right.

435
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This, uh, red is, uh.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We look at the path.

437
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Because he only has this radio motion.

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So you can, uh, you can draw a circle like this.

439
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And then they, uh.

440
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The line of sight above the two points is exactly the same.

441
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It means that you will have two, you will have two groups of gas.

442
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And then they, for you, his, uh.

443
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What is it called?

444
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Uh, the cutoff speed is the same.

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Uh, but they are in different places.

446
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Then this will cause, uh.

447
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Simplified, it will cause a double profile like this on the left.

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That.

449
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Um.

450
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Right, that's it.

451
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And then you have this middle absorption.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This is from a relatively cold gas on the outside.

453
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe it's a cold gas in front of you.

454
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And then the stronger radiation that comes in behind the absorption.

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Because you're cold in front of you.

456
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So you're easier to get excited, and then your radiation is absorbed by this colder material.

457
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You look at this.

458
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So, um, if you have a higher resolution.

459
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You can see, uh, like this, like this, if this purple area is our telescope beam.

460
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Uh, you can see the cold gas out there, but it's still moving to the center.

461
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's still falling on to the center.

462
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So, uh, this kind of, uh, cold gas will give you one.

463
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's not in, it's not in, uh, source velocity, an absorption.

464
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's a redshift because it's far away from you.

465
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And then it's going to cause this redshift, this absorption, and it's going to change like this.

466
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So this is basically the profile we want to see.

467
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
We want to measure a profile like this.

468
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And then, um.

469
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And then when you, uh, in the back, we have this in the middle.

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
There's a, um, continuous source in the middle of every collapsing star.

471
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It might be, uh, the hottest part of the disk.

472
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The temperature is very high.

473
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It might be a few thousand degrees.

474
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And then it just gives you a very strong blackbody radiation.

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So if you put it on, this radiation, this, um.

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Radiation, continuous radiation will also be absorbed by the colder material in front of it.

477
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's going to be absorbed.

478
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So in the end, you're going to get something like this.

479
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Continuous originally your continuous may be flat, but in the middle of the part.

480
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Uh, because you have a material that's far away from you, you're in this velocity, so you're going to be absorbed by a part of it.

481
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So what you actually see, uh, observation in your telescope, observation of the profile will probably look like this.

482
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Just simply add the two just now.

483
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So when you, if we're in, uh, according to this, uh, two.

484
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The front and back of the continuum, the level to correct it, uh, take the continuum away, you'll get this.

485
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
A strange one, uh, line profile is simply that you, we'll see, uh, the middle absorption is less than 0.

486
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You have two radiations less than 0.

487
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That's not really because we assume the continuum in the middle.

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Still, uh.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's the same level as other places, but it's actually partially absorbed.

490
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So, uh, we basically want to measure a line profile like this, and then analyze the line profile like this.

491
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
To understand that we, uh.

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I've seen this line of sight before.

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Uh.

494
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What is the model of the gas movement?

495
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I want to ask a question.

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hey, that.

497
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Why is that profile?

498
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That is, these profiles are not symmetrical to that.

499
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Okay, okay, this is the part I just skipped.

500
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Uh.

501
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Okay, if we go back to the two circles on the right, this picture.

502
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Um, in the middle, I write this high high temperature, which is more central.

503
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And then on both sides, which is, uh.

504
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Large radius is the place where the temperature is lower.

505
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Then you can think of it as, um, in this.

506
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh.

507
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
In your foreground, in front of you, your foreground is your red foreground material, which is red shift.

508
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's just that it's falling to the center, so it's red shift to you.

509
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But in this red shift, this part.

510
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You will have, uh.

511
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
High temperature in the back, low temperature in the front.

512
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It means that you are more like you have a cold thing in front of a hot thing.

513
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So this cold thing will absorb the back.

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The hot gas gives you the radiation.

515
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Uh, but in the blue shift part, which is on the back side of the envelope.

516
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You will, you, you don't have this situation.

517
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's just that the cold stuff is behind the hot stuff.

518
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So you don't have this kind of self-absorption.

519
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So that's why the red shift peak is lower.

520
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Then continue.

521
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Why is it the same shape over there?

522
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because the continuum is in the middle.

523
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Imagine a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1, a 1.

524
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So continue.

525
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Only in the red part.

526
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's going to be absorbed because the front of the continue doesn't have any blue shift.

527
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, I see.

528
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ok, thank you.

529
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Um.

530
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, so about 20 years ago, people started measuring this kind of profile.

531
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And then this is usually measured with a wireless telescope.

532
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That was usually used in the past.

533
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's like this.

534
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Uh, we usually think of this little ear or bigger.

535
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Maybe it's a 10 meter telescope or a 10 meter dish.

536
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Then go to measure these different molecules, and then try to measure the profile.

537
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But you can see here, the first one, in addition to the sensitivity.

538
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Uh, it's not very good.

539
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
There are a lot of different structures.

540
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
He has a lot of this kind of broad line.

541
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Or even you don't have a very obvious absorption.

542
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Even the most important thing is that you don't have less than 0.

543
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So no less than 0.

544
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The most important thing is that this absorption is very likely to be.

545
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Uh, you're in front of this source.

546
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Other completely unrelated to you.

547
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You have no way to say.

548
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Um, this absorption is not true.

549
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It belongs to what you see now.

550
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If you can see this absorption.

551
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Uh.

552
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Drop to 0.

553
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It becomes negative.

554
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You can find a way to move your telescope.

555
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And then you can say, okay, if I move away from the middle, this has a continuous source.

556
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
See if there's any change in this absorption.

557
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You can be more.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Uh, sure.

559
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Make sure that this absorption material is really associated.

560
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The key is that it really belongs to what you see.

561
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
This kind of course.

562
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So, because of the relationship between Resolution and Sensitivity.

563
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Uh, this question was broadly studied about 20 years ago.

564
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Maybe 5 to 10 years later, everyone thought, okay, it's almost done.

565
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You can't do it yourself anymore.

566
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So just wait.

567
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Um.

568
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Uh, the new generation of this Auma wireless wave array.

569
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Uh, there's no way to have a better observation result.

570
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So what is Auma?

571
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Auma is, uh.

572
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Uh, Akitama large millimeter sub array.

573
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It is a wireless wave array on the Akitama desert plateau in Chile.

574
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And then.

575
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's mainly.

576
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There should be 66 antennas.

577
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It's probably like this bigger antenna on the outside.

578
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Each antenna is a 12 meter antenna.

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There's a smaller one in the middle.

580
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Another, uh, separate array.

581
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Uh, it's 7 meters.

582
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Then it is.

583
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Uh, it's basically a collaboration around the world.

584
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The United States is NRAO.

585
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh, that's not NRAO.

586
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That's NRC.

587
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
NRC is Canada's National Research Council.

588
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And then Japan's NLJ.

589
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Europe's ESO.

590
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Taiwan is A, uh, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

591
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Uh, there's participation.

592
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And then there's Chile.

593
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And then this is open to the world.

594
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Um.

595
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Astronomers can apply to observe.

596
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That he mainly.

597
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Uh, the biggest bonus is that he can have a very, very good resolution.

598
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
His.

599
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He can see very, very small things.

600
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So basically the array is.

601
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Uh, the telescope is, uh, your resolution is proportional to the wavelength divided by.

602
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Uh, you.

603
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The diameter of your telescope.

604
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The wireless wave array is simply a mirror.

605
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Cut.

606
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Cut into a lot of little ones.

607
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Uh, a different telescope.

608
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So you can pull the two telescope very far.

609
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
As a telescope to use.

610
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So this is the biggest.

611
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This.

612
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Uh, baseline is called baseline.

613
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Simply put, his diameter can be up to 15, 15 kilometers.

614
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, it can be analyzed to a very small area.

615
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Ok, so at the beginning of this, we started with two more similar profiles that we just drew at the beginning.

616
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Like the left side, this is a.

617
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This is a, uh.

618
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Organic molecules.

619
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Uh, what is the Chinese name?

620
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The English is.

621
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Uh.

622
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This, this.

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You can see if we take it off, you can see this.

624
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Go below 0, and then you can see that his absorption is in the red.

625
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You've lost it.

626
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And then the same thing, in this other source, and then we've seen something similar, but in these two cases.

627
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
These are all relatively small, because the first one on the left is an organic molecule, so his.

628
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
He may be in those early stars.

629
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Uh, the abundance is not so high.

630
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Uh, not much, so the image is relatively weak.

631
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Then, like the one on the right, this is a relatively dark source, so it's not so high, so its absorption is relatively small.

632
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's what I'm doing, and I'm mainly using it, uh, to give another source, which is this.

633
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And then go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

634
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Uh, uh.

635
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And then go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

636
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's all about, uh, different different dust and gas.

637
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Uh, in the infographic, you can see he has a beautiful outflow, radio, you can see the beautiful outflow.

638
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It actually has two sources in the middle.

639
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So, here, we're just focusing on irs1, which is the main source.

640
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay, so when we were in alma cycle 4, we proposed, and then we got our data.

641
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It looks like this on the right.

642
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's very much like the way it was drawn before, especially this hcl plus.

643
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
This curve is basically the same as the one you saw earlier.

644
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Then you can see here, although, um.

645
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
This absorption is very wide, but you can see that he's actually in, uh, redshift.

646
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Velocity still has more absorption, which means that he's actually part of it.

647
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It comes from, um, the gas that's falling in the middle.

648
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Absorption.

649
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Um.

650
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay, so to analyze this curve, we actually need to use one.

651
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We can't just read it out of this.

652
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay, this absorption is in, maybe it's in 0.5 kilometers per second.

653
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And then you'll know.

654
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Uh, you might know there's something in 0.5 kilometers per second falling in.

655
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But you don't know if he's in the place where you're looking at this line of sight.

656
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That's because you have absorption and emission mixed together, so we have to, um.

657
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Use a very common technique in astronomy, which is ready to transfer the calculation to find a way.

658
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Um, to model the way we see it.

659
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
That's a simple way to say, uh, if I'm here every time, this is a function.

660
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's a, it's a gas.

661
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You might have radiation coming in on the left.

662
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So what about the radiation?

663
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's going to be in this gas.

664
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
He may be absorbed by the gas.

665
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You're going to become weak.

666
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Or after you've been absorbed, or you've been in this gas, it's actually very hot, so he's got some.

667
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Uh, he's got some black radiation, or he's got some of his own radiation, so he's probably going to have an emission.

668
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So, in the transition of these energies, he's probably going to be part of it.

669
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's the temperature of this gas, or, uh, it's the level population of different molecules in the inside.

670
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's probably going to turn it from a high-frequency state to a high-frequency state, and then it's going to be a high state.

671
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The high state will even put some molecules, just break up the molecules into smaller molecules, or even into atoms or even into particles.

672
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So you can do this in your mother's face.

673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And then you can go in and say, I've got a line coming in, and it's going to cause some kind of result to my gas and dust, and then you go to the end.

674
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
In the end, you put each of your mother's from the beginning to the end, and then you can know what comes out of it.

675
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Uh, radiation to the end, uh, we observed what it should look like, and then, uh, through, uh.

676
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The process of more than once, and then to get a better model to explain what we saw in front of us.

677
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So, in fact, what we do is very tedious, but it's also, um.

678
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Um, it's actually okay, it's actually not that tedious, but it's a lot of iteration, uh, a lot of iterative process.

679
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Basically, after we have a model, we can get it, we can say, okay, our, our.

680
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What does it look like? Um.

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Info this, uh, velocity should look like.

682
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
We can throw it into, uh, different radio transfer models to do, uh, here we put gas and.

683
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Separate because basically.

684
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Um, first of all, we use, uh, uh, continuous part of the rain.

685
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
To go to, uh.

686
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
To constrain this whole envelope structure, for example, this envelope.

687
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Um, his, uh.

688
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What is the density, so what changes with the radius, how much of his outflow area, his, uh, angle is, how much is his angle.

689
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Then, when we determine this envelope structure.

690
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Let's put it in and then calculate it.

691
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Okay, if we follow this structure, follow this kinematic, what should the spectrum we get look like?

692
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Okay, so, um, this is what we did before, uh, the model.

693
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Here, uh, you can see this is, uh.

694
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This is.

695
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,500
This is.

696
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
The spectrum behind this.

697
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The gray line is the spectrum, and then this is about.

698
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Uh, 2 microns, 3 microns, up to 1 millimeter range.

699
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Then.

700
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Fang, uh.

701
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The blue circle is our model, and then the red square is observation.

702
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You can see that most of us are going to fit through this, and we're going to fit our model to this observation.

703
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And then we'll get a better model to describe this envelope.

704
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
For example, like I'm drawing here, but in fact, how do we construct it like this?

705
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What is the angle of his outflow?

706
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What is the density distribution of the envelope?

707
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay, so you don't want to show off.

708
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's more like it's coming out of the outflow, and then it's coming out of the envelope.

709
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay, so, um, I mentioned earlier that we're going to take this envelope structure, and we're going to add kinematics, and we're going to figure out how to model this.

710
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Uh, but in fact, one of the very, very important, uh, factors is chemistry.

711
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So chemistry is not.

712
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Uh, well, so chemistry is not just thinking, okay, what molecules are you going to have in there, but molecules like this.

713
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Is it possible to exist in that condition?

714
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
In the atmosphere, you can see it, especially in.

715
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Um, these dense core, the density in the middle is very high, and the temperature is quite low.

716
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So it's possible to be frozen on top of these dust.

717
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
If it freezes, you, you, you, you, you can't see it in the atmosphere.

718
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So here's the different chemical abundance profile.

719
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You might be out there, you might have, uh, the radiation from other places.

720
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

721
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You might have to separate it and make it two different things, or maybe he's in there, and he'll be that ice will be frozen on the dust, or he'll be in here.

722
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It interacts with some electrically charged molecules, and then it generates other particles, and then it disappears.

723
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So you don't measure it.

724
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And in the middle of that, we're going to go to the main thing I've been doing a lot of time lately, and then we're going to say, what do we want to do?

725
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
A better abundance profile to explain our data.

726
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So, uh, basically, we need to understand this info profile.

727
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Uh, we're going to take our dust model to get density, temperature, and velocity, and then we're going to add our chemical bonus.

728
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Uh, we're going to find a way.

729
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Uh, get a hat spectrum, compare it, if you don't feel good, we'll go back and change it. So this is a very.

730
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Uh, a long process.

731
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Uh, this is us.

732
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Uh, hey.

733
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Um, uh, yeah, that's good.

734
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:48,000
My question is, um, like this, in this kind of small system, uh, that kind of info or the final outflow of the gravity distribution is all considered.

735
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Is it just normal?

736
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That matter is good.

737
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
If there's a dark matter, he can't say anything about it.

738
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It doesn't really matter.

739
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And.

740
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm not sure if it's going to be in the early universe.

741
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But at least in the modern universe.

742
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Uh, the general assumption is that dark matter is mainly in the outer galaxy.

743
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So I rarely.

744
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I heard that.

745
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Uh, dark matter will affect the evolution of these, at least in the region.

746
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So I don't think there's much of an impact.

747
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Because that's what I think.

748
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
If today, in some kind of dark matter, with their own strong interacting, then there will be some small structures.

749
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
For example, it's a clumpy phenomenon.

750
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Maybe it's possible, but I don't think I can see it.

751
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yes, it should be impossible to see.

752
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If you have a dark matter, it should be a very, very small scale.

753
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That might be something like microlensing.

754
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So, uh.

755
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So, in a system like this, it should be impossible to see.

756
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The current observation should be very far away.

757
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe there will be, but it's hard.

758
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Okay, thank you.

759
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
OK, so, uh.

760
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
This is like this, this is like me.

761
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This is our latest profit.

762
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The latest model is actually about two days ago.

763
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Uh, on the right side, uh, blue is our data.

764
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Orange is our current model.

765
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And then you see our model.

766
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Roughly captured data.

767
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
The feeling but you can see, for example, in Russian, we still miss a lot of emissions.

768
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So, uh.

769
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This is actually our status now.

770
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In the future, we should continue to do more.

771
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Uh, different tuning, and then even to understand that there is no way to make up for this part of the missing mission.

772
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And then.

773
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
To understand that it is possible to say, um.

774
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Well, of course, our current model is very, very symmetrical, so basically it is a symmetric model.

775
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That, um.

776
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
The first one is to understand that, OK, if in this very strong assumption, we have no way to make this model.

777
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Make this model better.

778
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
What if it doesn't work?

779
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
How do we break this?

780
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This assumption.

781
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And it's not going to create too much freedom.

782
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And it becomes, OK, you can say whatever you want.

783
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Um.

784
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So, uh, this is probably the main thing I'm going to do in the next month or two.

785
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And on the left side of the show, this picture is.

786
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Uh, basically, it's like.

787
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Uh, if you look.

788
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
This is a map.

789
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Then if you take the middle continuous source, it will be like this.

790
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
This dark place in the middle is the continuous source.

791
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
After being removed, it causes a very strong absorption.

792
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's like you see this very strong absorption on the right.

793
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So when you get close to it, it becomes negative.

794
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then the two bright spots up and down are because you have an outflow, so the outflow is up.

795
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Uh, up and down in this direction, so there's an outflow.

796
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Uh.

797
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Uh, the density is relatively low, so it's easier to be heated, so it's brighter.

798
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
OK, so why does this info affect this chemistry?

799
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That is to say, uh, simply put, if there's a group of gas, now it's going to come from the outside of this envelope.

800
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's travel, you're affected by the infogravity, and you can't travel to the middle.

801
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And then falling to this star or disk.

802
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It will pass through different temperatures in the middle.

803
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's getting hotter and hotter in the middle.

804
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Basically, it's getting hotter and hotter because there's a pro star in the middle.

805
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Pro star is emitting a very strong emission.

806
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, but this info can manage is determined by saying, OK, I have this group of gas.

807
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This gas will take a long time in different temperature ranges.

808
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
If it's very slow, it might take a long time in every place.

809
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Well, or even if it's in a relatively low temperature, it takes a long time.

810
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Or in a relatively high temperature, it will take a long time.

811
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That will affect, uh, at different temperatures, it will affect, uh.

812
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It should be said that at different temperatures, the chemical reaction that you can generate is different.

813
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And the time scale of each chemical reaction is different.

814
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
If you're in a low temperature, although you have a lot of low temperature chemical reactions,

815
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But if you only spend a short time in a low temperature,

816
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Then those reactions won't cause any changes to the chemical state of those molecules.

817
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So, another way to see is to say, uh, we're actually using these molecules.

818
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The radiation to track the dynamic in this envelope.

819
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Well, if we don't know where these molecules are going to be,

820
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
our interpretation is going to be incorrect.

821
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So, the other thing I was talking about earlier,

822
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
these, uh, these dynamic evolution will also affect the chemical reactions that you can produce.

823
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So, these two are a bit like interaction.

824
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's like being bundled together.

825
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's hard for you to separate one from each other.

826
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So, here's what I'm talking about.

827
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
For example, in the first question, you might have a lot of free.

828
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You know, you have a lot of deterioration.

829
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Your H will become very low.

830
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And then, in the so-called medium tension,

831
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you're going to have a lot of different chemical reactions on the surface of this dust.

832
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And that's going to cause the chemistry, the chemistry, the chemistry model.

833
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
People will tell you that this is going to produce a lot of different species.

834
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And now, when it's high temperature, when it's 100 Kelvin,

835
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
uh, you're going to have a lot of different species on top of this dust.

836
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Maybe it's because the temperature is getting higher, so it's coming out.

837
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So, it's going to affect what you're seeing.

838
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
These different bonds are going to be at different temperatures, and there's going to be different changes.

839
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So, basically, uh, in the early days, there were two.

840
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So far, we've observed that there are two different kinds of, uh, source.

841
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
One is called Hocker.

842
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You know, and then there's Warren Carpenter Molecule Source.

843
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Uh, Warren Carpenter Molecule Source is a, uh,

844
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:54,000
uh,

845
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
uh,

846
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
uh,

847
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
uh,

848
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
uh,

849
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
uh,

850
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
