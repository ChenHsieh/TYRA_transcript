0	3000	Okay, let's get started.
3000	5000	Oh, I hear the recording has started.
7000	11000	Okay, so the topic I'm going to talk about today is
11000	14000	Phylogenetic Components with Meta-Optics.
14000	17000	Because my main research background is
17000	22000	the interaction between light and matter,
22000	25000	and then, through this interaction,
25000	28000	we can further manipulate light's behavior.
28000	31000	So the main application we want to do is
31000	34000	how to reduce the size of the current
34000	36000	phylogenetic components on the market.
36000	41000	For example, transparency or bias.
41000	44000	So, what is meta?
44000	46000	I'll talk about it later.
46000	48000	The word meta-optics is actually
48000	51000	the Greek word for meta.
51000	54000	I'll talk about it later.
54000	62000	Before we get into the topic,
62000	64000	I want to share a picture.
64000	66000	I don't know if you've seen this picture.
66000	69000	This is from the ancient Roman era.
69000	71000	The picture on the left is from the ancient Roman era.
71000	75000	This is a wine cup.
75000	77000	What's amazing about this is
77000	79000	you can see that the colors are different.
79000	81000	But they are actually the same cup.
81000	84000	The color is different because
84000	88000	they found that when they put the light source outside,
88000	91000	the color of the cup is green.
91000	93000	But if they put the light source inside the cup,
93000	96000	the cup will turn red.
96000	99000	That is to say, the material on the cup is very special.
99000	102000	If you look at the cup from the perspective of reflection,
102000	103000	it is green.
103000	105000	But if you put the light source inside,
105000	108000	the color you see is transparent.
108000	111000	So after you put the light source inside the cup,
111000	113000	the color you see is red.
113000	116000	At this time, people think this is amazing.
116000	118000	They also use this kind of material
118000	121000	to make church colored glass.
121000	123000	We all know that
123000	125000	churches in Europe
125000	129000	have very beautiful colored glass.
129000	133000	Why are there so many different colors?
133000	138000	The reason is the same as the cup.
138000	142000	The principle of its operation is very similar.
142000	144000	Why does this phenomenon occur?
144000	147000	Later, people found that
147000	150000	there is a thing called localized surface plasma.
150000	152000	What does this mean?
152000	154000	Why doesn't it move?
154000	156000	They found that
156000	159000	if we have a colored light source,
159000	163000	it will interact with a metal nanoparticle.
163000	165000	After interacting with it,
165000	168000	it will accumulate some free electrons
168000	171000	on the surface of the nanoparticle
171000	174000	under the appropriate conditions.
174000	176000	These free electrons
176000	181000	will allow it to produce a similar dipole inside,
181000	184000	an H-ray dipole or a magnetic dipole.
184000	186000	Let it further produce,
186000	190000	let it radiate electrons from other dipoles.
190000	192000	Then we will see different colors.
195000	197000	When will this phenomenon occur?
197000	200000	It mainly occurs
200000	203000	when our nanoparticles
203000	206000	are smaller than the dipole of the colored light.
206000	208000	This thing will only occur.
208000	210000	So the high-angle cup,
210000	212000	the colored high-angle cup,
212000	215000	later they did a further study
215000	217000	and found that the high-angle cup
217000	221000	actually contained a lot of gold particles of different size.
221000	223000	This is gold particle.
223000	226000	The size of these metal particles
226000	228000	compared with the dipole of the visible light,
228000	231000	the visible light dipole is about 400 to 700 nanometers.
231000	234000	Compared with it, it is smaller than the size of the dipole.
234000	236000	So they thought that
236000	238000	the reason for the different color
238000	240000	may come from this
240000	243000	local surface plasmon resonance.
243000	246000	The result of localized surface plasmon resonance.
246000	248000	After this resonance,
248000	251000	what special phenomenon will we have?
251000	254000	It actually has a lot of advantages that we can control,
254000	256000	that is, we can have.
256000	258000	For example, they found that
258000	261000	this resonance has a bias with the dipole of the colored light.
261000	264000	The bias is the direction in which the electron waves resonate.
264000	267000	You can see that this picture may be more obvious.
267000	270000	For example, the color here is very colorful,
270000	271000	very beautiful,
271000	274000	there are five or six colors.
274000	276000	Here you can't see any color at all.
276000	279000	These two pictures are actually the same sample
279000	280000	color.
280000	282000	Their only difference is that
282000	285000	they changed the direction of the dipole of the colored light.
285000	288000	This red and white arrow is the direction of its dipole resonance.
288000	290000	When the direction of the dipole of the colored light
290000	292000	is along the y-axis,
292000	294000	they will see that the chip above
294000	296000	will produce different colors.
296000	298000	In fact, you can imagine that
298000	300000	the chip uses some micro-imaging technology
300000	303000	to make some metal disks
303000	306000	that are smaller than visible wavelengths.
306000	307000	Like this disk.
307000	311000	Then they change its diameter or cycle.
311000	314000	We can see different colors
314000	318000	in the reflected light part.
318000	320000	But when they turn a bias,
320000	322000	the colors are all gone.
322000	324000	So you can use it to do something.
324000	326000	For example, this thing can be used to make
326000	331000	color filters that have a bias control feature.
331000	333000	Another special thing is that
333000	335000	we used to know that
335000	336000	for example,
336000	338000	why are we so interested in this thing now?
338000	342000	For example, we know that gold is often used to make decorations.
342000	344000	For example, rings and necklaces.
344000	345000	But gold,
345000	348000	as long as we use gold to make a decoration,
348000	350000	whether I pinch it into a square,
350000	351000	a circle,
351000	352000	or a ring,
352000	354000	its color is yellow.
354000	355000	But like I just said,
355000	356000	if we put this gold,
356000	358000	all the particles here are gold,
358000	361000	but they are at a very small scale.
361000	364000	If its scale is smaller than the wavelength,
364000	365000	we can find that
365000	368000	as its size changes,
368000	370000	the colors we see are different.
370000	373000	This is very different from the optical phenomenon
373000	376000	that we see on the object.
376000	378000	The main reason for this is because
378000	381000	of the localized surface plasma.
384000	385000	The next feature is that
385000	389000	if the two metals are very close together,
389000	391000	there is a very small nano gap
391000	394000	between the two metal particles,
394000	396000	there will be a very strong near-field coupling.
396000	398000	The two of them will interweave each other.
398000	400000	This interweaving will make them
400000	405000	a bit like the simple electronics we learned before.
405000	407000	It's like the feeling of end-to-end power generation.
407000	410000	Because its scale is very small,
410000	414000	the more end-to-end power it can accumulate,
414000	417000	the stronger the near-field power generation it produces.
417000	418000	If it is very close,
418000	419000	the interweaving between the two
419000	422000	will cause it to have a stronger field enhancement.
423000	425000	Finally, this resonance
425000	429000	has a lot to do with the surrounding environment.
429000	432000	It is very sensitive to the environment.
432000	433000	That is to say,
433000	436000	if the surrounding environment's resolution changes,
436000	438000	its resonance wavelength,
438000	441000	which is the color we saw in the original factory, will change.
441000	443000	For example, this stick now,
443000	445000	if it is in the air,
445000	446000	I see blue.
446000	448000	But if I put it in the water
448000	449000	and look at it again,
449000	451000	it may turn red.
451000	453000	This feature
453000	454000	is also used by some people
454000	457000	to say that we can do some sound sensing.
458000	461000	It is based on the change in color
461000	463000	to judge what is the object
463000	465000	in the surrounding environment.
468000	469000	OK.
469000	473000	After introducing the Localized Surface Plasma,
473000	474000	I will tell you
474000	476000	what is Metamaterial.
476000	477000	As I said,
477000	478000	the word Meta
478000	480000	comes from Greek.
480000	482000	It means the same in English.
482000	486000	Metamaterial is a kind of material.
486000	488000	It has some features.
488000	491000	These features are not found in natural materials.
491000	493000	We call it Metamaterial.
493000	494000	Simply put,
494000	497000	we can use the shape of it
497000	500000	or the distance between the particles
500000	502000	to change its optical properties.
502000	503000	These are called Metamaterial.
503000	505000	Why do we have these features?
505000	506000	It should be said that
506000	508000	we need to produce Metamaterial properties.
508000	510000	What is the strict condition?
510000	511000	As I said,
511000	513000	we generally know that natural materials
513000	515000	are composed of atoms.
515000	517000	For example, CO2, H2O.
517000	518000	Because we know that
518000	521000	the distance between them is very small.
521000	524000	If I take the surface plasma as 500 nm,
524000	526000	which is about the surface plasma of green light,
526000	527000	as an example,
527000	528000	these two
528000	531000	have a very, very big difference in their magnitude.
531000	533000	So its optical properties
533000	536000	are mainly determined by this molecule or atom.
536000	538000	For example, gold is AU.
538000	540000	No matter how I rub it,
540000	541000	it is yellow.
543000	544000	Metamaterial is what I just said.
544000	546000	If we now put the distance
546000	548000	or size between the particles
548000	549000	to be reduced to the original size,
549000	551000	which is the level of the magnetic field,
551000	553000	which is about Lambda over 4 to Lambda over 10,
553000	555000	at this magnitude,
555000	558000	we can use man-made methods
558000	562000	to change the optical properties of the material itself.
562000	564000	Then we can further manipulate
564000	567000	some of the behavior of light or electromagnetic waves.
567000	571000	This can be produced by the resonance
571000	575000	at the magnitude of the magnetic field.
575000	578000	By using this method to manipulate light,
578000	580000	we call it metamaterial.
580000	582000	It is mainly triangular.
582000	584000	Although my structure is very small,
584000	587000	its thickness in the z-direction can be very thick.
587000	589000	My very thick is only compared with the surface plasma of green light.
589000	592000	For example, it can be one or two microns.
595000	596000	Let me ask you a question.
596000	599000	10 to 100 microns?
599000	601000	No, 1 to 10 microns is fine.
601000	603000	It can be several microns.
604000	608000	So 10 nanometers to 100 micrometers is fine.
610000	613000	The magnitude I'm talking about here is a bit broad.
613000	616000	Mainly because the example I gave earlier is visible light.
616000	618000	But the advantage of this thing is that
618000	620000	my work plasma may not necessarily be visible light.
620000	623000	I can even be a microwave wave.
623000	628000	So 10 micrometers is Terahertz?
628000	630000	100 microns.
630000	632000	If it is 100 microns,
632000	637000	it should be 3 Terahertz.
637000	639000	If I'm not mistaken.
639000	641000	It's about the range of Terahertz.
641000	643000	It's far away.
643000	645000	So its work plasma can be very broad.
648000	652000	Here is a very special example.
652000	654000	The metamaterial I just mentioned.
654000	658000	When I first saw this phenomenon,
658000	660000	there was no such word as metamaterial.
660000	662000	It's called left-hand material.
662000	664000	Why is it called left-hand material?
664000	666000	Because they found that
666000	669000	the structure of man-made
669000	672000	can control the behavior of light.
672000	677000	We know that the characteristic of light transmission
677000	680000	mainly comes from the refractive index of the ring.
680000	682000	So they thought,
682000	684000	is it because of the refractive index?
684000	686000	Metamaterial is used to manipulate
686000	688000	the refractive index of the ring.
688000	690000	That's why it affects the behavior of light.
690000	692000	Here is a schematic diagram.
692000	695000	We used to study chemistry in high school.
695000	697000	If a cup is an empty cup,
697000	699000	the air refractive index is 1.
699000	701000	If I put a chopstick here, it will be straight.
701000	705000	If I put a refractive index of 1.3 in it,
705000	707000	it's probably water.
707000	709000	We know that because of the refractive index,
709000	712000	it looks like the chopstick is broken.
712000	716000	But if we put a negative refractive index in it,
717000	720000	the chopstick we see at this time will look like this.
720000	722000	This is actually just an experiment.
722000	724000	This is not the result of the experiment.
724000	726000	Another interesting thing is that
726000	728000	if we have this negative refractive index,
728000	730000	we usually know that the beam of light will be full.
732000	734000	In other words, the beam of light is orange here.
734000	736000	If it is a beam of light,
736000	739000	it is along N1sinθ1 and N2sinθ2.
739000	741000	So it keeps refracting.
741000	743000	But if the material in the middle
743000	745000	is a negative refractive material,
745000	748000	the beam of light and the beam of refractive light
748000	752000	will be located on both sides of the beam.
752000	755000	This makes them very interested.
755000	757000	That is to say,
757000	759000	is it true that because of these characteristics,
759000	761000	we can create some real
761000	764000	boundaries that naturally cannot exist,
764000	766000	and then achieve some
766000	769000	light and snow characteristics that we can't imagine at all?
769000	770000	This kind of negative refractive index,
770000	771000	I am trying to prove it here.
771000	773000	But in fact, there is already an experiment to prove
773000	775000	that this thing is really feasible.
775000	778000	But I didn't put their experiment results here.
780000	782000	It is to prove that by
782000	785000	properly designing the size of this material,
785000	790000	or the elements of the material itself,
790000	794000	they can achieve the negative refractive index phenomenon.
796000	799000	I think I can skip here.
800000	802000	Next, I will talk about
802000	804000	the Metamaterial I just mentioned.
804000	805000	I just said it can be very thick,
805000	807000	it can be three-dimensional.
807000	809000	But in fact, our main purpose is to
809000	811000	control the light.
811000	814000	Can we further reduce the element?
814000	815000	They want to say,
815000	818000	if I make Metamaterial only one layer,
818000	820000	because I just said that Metamaterial can be many layers,
820000	821000	it means that it can be very thick.
821000	823000	If I only have one layer,
823000	825000	can I achieve the same effect?
825000	827000	This one-layer Metamaterial,
827000	829000	they call it Metasurface.
829000	833000	A surface that is the same as a general surface.
833000	835000	Yes, so it's called Metasurface.
835000	837000	Here is an example.
837000	839000	For example, I now have a metal stick.
839000	842000	After I inject a electromagnetic wave into it,
842000	844000	because this magnitude is much smaller
844000	846000	than the injected light wave field,
846000	848000	so I can directly use the concept of
848000	849000	injecting electromagnetic waves to
849000	851000	see the result of this resonance.
851000	852000	So if my injected light wave field
852000	854000	vibrates along this direction,
854000	857000	I can theoretically accumulate positive and negative electrons
857000	860000	at both ends of the stick.
860000	861000	This accumulated positive and negative electron
861000	863000	can make us equivalent to an electrode.
863000	865000	After this electrode vibrates,
865000	868000	another electromagnetic wave will be radiated.
868000	870000	If we take a closer look at this structure
870000	872000	of penetrating light waves and phase light waves,
872000	874000	under a fixed wavelength,
874000	875000	it is obvious that
875000	877000	if the length of the stick changes,
877000	878000	just like I just said,
878000	880000	because this material,
880000	882000	this Metasurface or Metamaterial,
882000	884000	has a lot to do with its
884000	886000	resonance characteristics and size.
886000	888000	So when I make the length longer
888000	889000	or shorter,
889000	892000	we can see that its resonance wave
892000	894000	will gradually be flattened.
894000	895000	At this time,
895000	897000	if I look at a fixed wavelength,
897000	900000	its magnitude or phase
900000	902000	can be changed.
902000	904000	A point that everyone is very concerned about
904000	905000	is the phase.
905000	906000	Is this a simulation?
906000	907000	Yes, this is a simulation.
907000	909000	Both of these are simulations.
910000	913000	If we can manipulate the phase,
913000	915000	we can further manipulate
915000	917000	the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave,
917000	921000	which is the characteristics of its transmission.
921000	923000	For example, if I now have a
923000	926000	sample substrate,
926000	929000	and I record a flat wave,
929000	931000	if I put some of the
931000	934000	Metasurface nanostructure on the surface,
934000	936000	because its size is different,
936000	939000	the phase deviation they feel
939000	940000	will be different.
940000	942000	The different phase deviations
942000	944000	will make the phase delay
944000	947000	of the original wave
947000	948000	different,
948000	950000	which means that after the original interference,
950000	953000	they can reconstruct
953000	954000	another wave front.
954000	955000	And this wave front
955000	957000	is completely different from the Metasurface.
957000	959000	Although this magnitude is less than
959000	960000	the Metasurface wavelength,
960000	962000	we can control the electromagnetic wave
962000	964000	characteristics
964000	967000	with the Metasurface nanostructure.
967000	970000	Here are some examples of applications.
970000	972000	This is probably
972000	974000	to say that
974000	976000	we can not only manipulate the electromagnetic wave
976000	978000	government and phase,
978000	980000	in fact, the wavelength and deviation
980000	982000	can be manipulated
982000	984000	by Metasurface.
984000	985000	For example, they can
985000	987000	do some optical image
987000	989000	or do some deviation conversion,
989000	992000	which I will introduce later.
992000	995000	Here is a very simple image
995000	997000	that is, why this thing
997000	999000	can be so interesting
999000	1001000	and help us to design some
1001000	1004000	flat optical components.
1004000	1006000	I use the simplest one before
1006000	1008000	is our deflection law
1008000	1009000	to explain to you.
1009000	1011000	For example, if we used
1011000	1013000	Hagen's principle to explain
1013000	1014000	the deflection of this thing,
1014000	1016000	that is, if I have two materials
1016000	1017000	in the space now,
1017000	1021000	the deflection rate is N1 and N2 respectively.
1021000	1024000	After the deflection wave comes in,
1024000	1027000	every point on this interface
1027000	1031000	is reflected by the deflection light,
1031000	1033000	I can think of it as a
1033000	1035000	two-point light source.
1035000	1037000	So here is a little bit gray,
1037000	1039000	gray and white dots,
1039000	1040000	round dots.
1040000	1044000	I just split it
1044000	1046000	into a very small point
1046000	1048000	in each space.
1048000	1050000	This small point is reflected by the deflection light
1050000	1052000	and interacts with the deflection light.
1052000	1054000	I think of it as a two-point light source.
1054000	1056000	The deflection wave
1056000	1058000	coming out of the point light source
1058000	1059000	will be a circle.
1059000	1061000	This circle will eventually
1061000	1063000	reconstruct another deflection wave in the original factory.
1063000	1065000	Because each of them
1065000	1067000	has the same surface,
1067000	1069000	the phase coming out of their radiation
1069000	1071000	has no delay.
1071000	1074000	So their
1074000	1076000	original transmission
1076000	1078000	will be as flat as the deflection light,
1078000	1080000	which is the tradition.
1080000	1082000	How did they explain this thing
1082000	1084000	with Higgins before?
1084000	1086000	When I am now in the diagonal direction,
1086000	1088000	you can see that the red part
1088000	1092000	is the wave front.
1092000	1094000	This wave front
1094000	1097000	touches the time on this interface
1097000	1099000	will be different.
1099000	1102000	It will first touch the point on the left.
1102000	1104000	So after the point on the left is touched by the light,
1104000	1106000	it will be regarded as the first
1106000	1108000	two-point light source
1108000	1110000	to start radiation.
1110000	1112000	Then this point is touched.
1112000	1114000	But because it is slower to be touched,
1114000	1116000	it will produce
1116000	1118000	this radiation slower.
1118000	1120000	In this way,
1120000	1122000	to the end here.
1122000	1124000	Because the time they were touched
1124000	1126000	is different, we can think of it as
1126000	1128000	their radiation
1128000	1130000	is different.
1130000	1132000	So you can see that the shape of the radiation
1132000	1134000	produced by them is different from here.
1134000	1136000	The radiation is getting smaller from left to right.
1136000	1138000	This will cause
1138000	1140000	the wave front to be oblique.
1140000	1142000	Bing Jie, Zhang Yang has a question.
1142000	1144000	He has a question.
1144000	1146000	He said
1146000	1148000	Transmittance's light source
1148000	1150000	is mainly a design decision.
1150000	1152000	What about Resonance's Q-factor?
1152000	1154000	How high and low can it be now?
1156000	1158000	This thing?
1158000	1160000	How high can the Q-factor be?
1160000	1162000	How is it determined?
1162000	1164000	Q-factor
1164000	1166000	has a lot of things.
1166000	1168000	It will be affected by a lot of things.
1168000	1170000	First of all, the most intuitive
1170000	1172000	is its loss.
1172000	1174000	Because the material I designed here
1174000	1176000	is made of metal.
1176000	1178000	The metal in the visible light,
1178000	1180000	or the part outside the mirror,
1180000	1182000	after it has been resonance,
1182000	1184000	because of the dipole,
1184000	1186000	we can think of it as
1186000	1188000	a movement of free current.
1188000	1190000	This part will cause
1190000	1192000	The second thing that will affect it
1192000	1194000	is the loss of the original radiation.
1194000	1196000	In theory, we divide it into two categories.
1196000	1198000	One is Intrinsic.
1198000	1200000	One is Extrinsic.
1200000	1202000	Intrinsic is the heat radiation
1202000	1204000	that the material itself produces.
1204000	1206000	The other is the loss of the original radiation
1206000	1208000	caused by the original radiation.
1208000	1210000	I classify both of them as the part of the loss.
1210000	1212000	This part will reduce my Q-factor.
1212000	1214000	The other part is whether my cavity
1214000	1216000	is strong enough.
1216000	1218000	Because my current structure
1218000	1220000	is based on the loss of the original radiation.
1220000	1222000	So even if there is a shock
1222000	1224000	on it,
1224000	1226000	I can think of it as a movement of free current.
1226000	1228000	But this movement of free current
1228000	1230000	cannot be perfect
1230000	1232000	because this cavity is not very strong.
1232000	1234000	If I want a very strong cavity,
1234000	1236000	in theory, we should have
1236000	1238000	almost 100% reflectivity on both sides.
1238000	1240000	At this time, my Q-factor can be very high.
1240000	1242000	But because of my current structure,
1242000	1244000	I just wait for it to accumulate
1244000	1246000	and let it accumulate radiation on both sides.
1246000	1248000	But this cavity is not that strong.
1248000	1250000	So my Q-factor will be reduced.
1250000	1252000	These factors
1252000	1254000	result in the
1254000	1256000	Plasmon Resonance
1256000	1258000	produced by this kind of metal.
1258000	1260000	Its Q-factor will not be too high.
1260000	1262000	As far as I know,
1262000	1264000	if it is made of metal,
1264000	1266000	without considering
1266000	1268000	any cavity,
1268000	1270000	that is, without considering any mirror,
1270000	1272000	that is, the perfect mirror in this system,
1272000	1274000	its Q-factor
1274000	1276000	can only reach a few hundred.
1276000	1278000	This is already the highest.
1278000	1280000	But usually it is only a few tens.
1284000	1286000	He said he understood.
1286000	1288000	OK, thank you.
1288000	1290000	Then,
1290000	1292000	if I have the
1292000	1294000	nanoparticle I just talked about,
1294000	1296000	I am now
1296000	1298000	in the same direction.
1298000	1300000	But because of my nanoparticle,
1300000	1302000	each nanoparticle has a different size.
1302000	1304000	The size is different,
1304000	1306000	just like what I just showed in this picture.
1306000	1308000	Under the same wavelength,
1308000	1310000	the phase delay
1310000	1312000	felt by each different size will be different.
1312000	1314000	At this time,
1314000	1316000	it works as if
1316000	1318000	each particle,
1318000	1320000	although they both feel the
1320000	1322000	electromagnetic wave,
1322000	1324000	but after their resonance,
1324000	1326000	the radiation phase will also be delayed.
1326000	1328000	This is very interesting.
1328000	1330000	It allows us to achieve
1330000	1332000	transparency.
1332000	1334000	In theory,
1334000	1336000	I am transparent.
1336000	1338000	But if I design the structure
1338000	1340000	appropriately above,
1340000	1342000	I can see that it is written out.
1342000	1344000	I can use
1344000	1346000	Momentum's picture to explain it.
1346000	1348000	I don't think it needs to be explained.
1348000	1350000	Basically, it is the phase delay.
1350000	1352000	Here is a simple experiment result.
1352000	1354000	If I design a stick
1354000	1356000	of different lengths on the surface,
1356000	1358000	you can see that
1358000	1360000	Can you go back to the page
1360000	1362000	and explain Momentum? I don't quite understand.
1366000	1368000	Momentum, in theory,
1368000	1370000	we know that its K
1370000	1372000	is 2π除λ.
1372000	1374000	If I have
1374000	1376000	different structures here,
1376000	1378000	in theory, I can equate it to
1378000	1380000	each structure
1380000	1382000	can provide a
1382000	1384000	horizontal momentum.
1384000	1386000	How does this horizontal momentum decide?
1386000	1388000	This horizontal momentum is determined by
1388000	1390000	2π除λ.
1390000	1392000	What does this λ mean?
1392000	1394000	This λ of 2π除λ
1394000	1396000	means that my structure
1396000	1398000	has a phase delay
1398000	1400000	from 0 to
1400000	1402000	the minimum length of 360 degrees.
1402000	1404000	That is, I can see it as a
1404000	1406000	pixel of light.
1406000	1408000	A pixel of light.
1408000	1410000	If a pixel of light is λ,
1410000	1412000	we know that its K is 2π除λ.
1412000	1414000	Because I have a
1414000	1416000	phase change of T,
1416000	1418000	I can equate it to
1418000	1420000	the horizontal momentum of
1420000	1422000	2π除λ on this
1422000	1424000	surface.
1424000	1426000	And these two
1426000	1428000	Momentum boxes
1428000	1430000	can let us see through the light.
1430000	1432000	These two boxes
1432000	1434000	are obviously in this direction.
1434000	1436000	This is why we can
1436000	1438000	achieve the phenomenon of
1438000	1440000	paranormal penetration.
1442000	1444000	This is a
1444000	1446000	simple experiment result.
1446000	1448000	After designing different
1448000	1450000	lengths of sticks on the
1450000	1452000	surface, if my light
1452000	1454000	is perpendicular to the light,
1454000	1456000	I want to see if it can
1456000	1458000	reflect back in the opposite direction.
1458000	1460000	This is the result of the experiment.
1460000	1462000	This is the result of the calculation.
1462000	1464000	The curve of different colors represents
1464000	1466000	different angles of light.
1466000	1468000	Black is when the light
1468000	1470000	is perpendicular to the light,
1470000	1472000	and white is when the light
1472000	1474000	is perpendicular to the light.
1474000	1476000	The reflection angle is
1476000	1478000	about 45 degrees.
1478000	1480000	This proves that we
1480000	1482000	give it a horizontal momentum
1482000	1484000	in the horizontal direction.
1484000	1486000	Why don't I see through the light here?
1486000	1488000	Because the structure of this design
1488000	1490000	has a thick metal at the bottom.
1490000	1492000	This thick metal helps
1492000	1494000	us block all the light.
1494000	1496000	So we only see the reflected light.
1496000	1498000	Why do we only see the reflected light here?
1498000	1500000	You can also see that
1500000	1502000	when the light is perpendicular to the light,
1502000	1504000	if you look at the scattering,
1504000	1506000	you can see that the light
1506000	1508000	is perpendicular to the light.
1512000	1514000	Let me ask you a question.
1518000	1520000	What wavelength is the light
1520000	1522000	reflected?
1522000	1524000	The working wavelength is
1524000	1526000	about 780 nm.
1526000	1528000	This is the boundary between
1528000	1530000	the reflected light and the reflected light.
1532000	1534000	After doing this demo,
1534000	1536000	we also want to demonstrate
1536000	1538000	that its efficiency can be very high.
1538000	1540000	You can see that the efficiency of the calculation
1540000	1542000	can be more than 90%.
1542000	1544000	The experimental beam is also 80%.
1544000	1546000	I'm talking about the time when the reflection was recorded.
1546000	1548000	So why do we have to choose this wavelength?
1548000	1550000	Because the inter-beam scattering
1550000	1552000	is at 550 nm,
1552000	1554000	so if we use gold to make
1554000	1556000	the inter-beam scattering,
1556000	1558000	its resonance will never happen before 550 nm.
1558000	1560000	Because the loss is too big.
1560000	1562000	So the farther we work from 550 nm,
1562000	1564000	in theory, its efficiency can be better.
1564000	1566000	Of course, this is just the characteristic of the material itself.
1566000	1568000	Other factors also affect
1568000	1570000	its efficiency, such as
1570000	1572000	structural design.
1572000	1574000	This is the final optimization result.
1578000	1580000	I want to share with you
1580000	1582000	most of my work.
1584000	1586000	The first part is that we want to use aluminum
1586000	1588000	to make a visible Metasurface,
1588000	1590000	and then make some
1590000	1592000	flat components.
1592000	1594000	The other part is that
1594000	1596000	we want to make a transparent mirror.
1596000	1598000	Why do we want to make a transparent mirror?
1598000	1600000	Because what I just said is
1600000	1602000	that the most important thing
1602000	1604000	about Metasurface now
1604000	1606000	is that it can greatly reduce
1606000	1608000	the size of the components
1608000	1610000	we can buy on the market.
1610000	1612000	For example,
1612000	1614000	the simplest
1614000	1616000	and most impressive
1616000	1618000	is the iPhone
1618000	1620000	or our smartphone
1620000	1622000	camera lens.
1622000	1624000	After the iPhone 6,
1624000	1626000	you can find that
1626000	1628000	its body is actually very thin,
1628000	1630000	but its lens protrudes a piece.
1630000	1632000	This is because
1632000	1634000	when the body becomes thin,
1634000	1636000	it has to maintain
1636000	1638000	the resolution of the image
1638000	1640000	it takes
1640000	1642000	.
1642000	1644000	This premise
1644000	1646000	will cause it to
1646000	1648000	not be able to greatly reduce
1648000	1650000	the size of the mirror.
1650000	1652000	It has to insert a lot of different mirror groups
1652000	1654000	and stack them up,
1654000	1656000	so that the image produced after taking pictures
1656000	1658000	will be clearer,
1658000	1660000	so that some contrast and color difference can be eliminated.
1660000	1662000	I will introduce this later.
1662000	1664000	I don't know if I have enough time,
1664000	1666000	so I may be a little faster.
1666000	1668000	In fact, if you
1668000	1670000	take a look at the
1670000	1672000	current direction of the
1672000	1674000	battery wave,
1674000	1676000	we call it bias.
1676000	1678000	In fact, whether it is
1678000	1680000	the linear bias of the y-direction
1680000	1682000	or the linear bias of the x-direction,
1682000	1684000	or when it rotates,
1684000	1686000	it produces a circular bias.
1686000	1688000	No matter what the bias is,
1688000	1690000	I can split its positive and negative
1690000	1692000	into three components, x, y, and z.
1692000	1694000	I can easily stack
1694000	1696000	these three components
1696000	1698000	in the same way.
1698000	1700000	I should say that I can split
1700000	1702000	any bias light into these three components.
1702000	1704000	So our future design
1704000	1706000	will be based on this logic.
1706000	1708000	Bias is actually quite useful
1708000	1710000	in life.
1710000	1712000	For example, 3D images are the most common.
1712000	1714000	If you go to see a 3D movie,
1714000	1716000	it will give you a 3D glasses.
1716000	1718000	These 3D glasses are
1718000	1720000	what the left eye sees
1720000	1722000	and what the right eye sees.
1722000	1724000	Its bias is also perpendicular to each other.
1724000	1726000	When it causes this illusion,
1726000	1728000	the image you see will look like a 3D.
1728000	1730000	So why do you see
1730000	1732000	that the image is foggy when you take off your glasses?
1732000	1734000	Because your two eyes
1734000	1736000	detect the image of two biases at the same time.
1736000	1738000	Or
1738000	1740000	we often see that
1740000	1742000	some people who play photography
1742000	1744000	will know that
1744000	1746000	they will put some filters related to bias
1746000	1748000	in front of the lens,
1748000	1750000	which can shoot some light
1750000	1752000	on some slower
1752000	1754000	or stronger surface
1754000	1756000	to make
1756000	1758000	them more clear.
1758000	1760000	Or
1760000	1762000	do some
1762000	1764000	biological or chemical molecules detection.
1764000	1766000	Because some biological or chemical molecules
1766000	1768000	will take the initiative
1768000	1770000	to bias
1770000	1772000	the bias of the light.
1772000	1774000	Different molecules
1774000	1776000	have different angles of bias.
1776000	1778000	Some are big and some are small.
1778000	1780000	Some people use this thing
1780000	1782000	to make chemical molecules
1782000	1784000	detection.
1784000	1786000	What are the
1786000	1788000	most common
1788000	1790000	ways to manipulate
1790000	1792000	bias on the market?
1792000	1794000	Let me give you three examples.
1794000	1796000	The first one is linear bias.
1796000	1798000	For example,
1798000	1800000	if there is a dirty battery,
1800000	1802000	the battery factory is messy.
1802000	1804000	If you want to turn it into a pure
1804000	1806000	battery factory,
1806000	1808000	for example,
1808000	1810000	the battery factory is a
1810000	1812000	horizontal wire.
1812000	1814000	If the battery factory is along this wire,
1814000	1816000	it will be absorbed.
1816000	1818000	The volume of the battery
1818000	1820000	will be penetrated.
1820000	1822000	So it uses this method
1822000	1824000	to filter out the bias it doesn't want.
1824000	1826000	This is what I found on the Internet.
1826000	1828000	You can buy it on the market.
1828000	1830000	Because we need to effectively
1830000	1832000	absorb all the light in the x-direction.
1832000	1834000	So its thickness must be thick enough.
1834000	1836000	Usually this thickness is about a millimeter.
1836000	1838000	This diameter is one inch.
1838000	1840000	This diameter is half an inch.
1840000	1842000	Another one is that after we produce
1842000	1844000	linear bias, we want to do
1844000	1846000	a rotation of bias light.
1846000	1848000	For example, the linear bias of the
1848000	1850000	green light is 45 degrees.
1850000	1852000	If I want to rotate it to negative 45 degrees,
1852000	1854000	we will use 1 in 2 waves.
1854000	1856000	The main thing is that this material
1856000	1858000	itself can provide different
1858000	1860000	phase differences
1860000	1862000	in the x- and y-directions,
1862000	1864000	so that when the light penetrates,
1864000	1866000	the bias of the x-direction
1866000	1868000	slowly slows down,
1868000	1870000	and the y-direction slowly speeds up,
1870000	1872000	so that the x- and y-directions
1872000	1874000	of the green light are in the positive direction
1874000	1876000	respectively.
1876000	1878000	After coming out, it will become
1878000	1880000	a negative and a positive,
1880000	1882000	and then use this method to rotate it.
1882000	1884000	Because it has to accumulate
1884000	1886000	enough bias delay,
1886000	1888000	so its thickness must be thick enough.
1888000	1890000	Or to produce linear bias light.
1890000	1892000	This is to give the
1892000	1894000	x- and y-dimensions
1894000	1896000	an additional bias delay,
1896000	1898000	so that the angle of the bias delay
1898000	1900000	is large enough that the
1900000	1902000	x- and y-directions of the x- and y-directions
1902000	1904000	are exactly 90 degrees.
1904000	1906000	Then it can become the original bias light.
1906000	1908000	It also has to have enough bias delay,
1908000	1910000	so its thickness must also be very thick.
1910000	1912000	What are the benefits of using linear bias light?
1912000	1914000	We don't need to use the thickness of
1914000	1916000	the minimiter level,
1916000	1918000	we can produce any bias light we want.
1918000	1920000	For example, we provide a
1920000	1922000	design method called
1922000	1924000	Geometry Faced Metasurface,
1924000	1926000	which is a superimposed interface that combines
1926000	1928000	the positions of the x- and y-directions.
1928000	1930000	What does this mean?
1930000	1932000	For example, if I have a stick now,
1932000	1934000	I record a right-handed light
1934000	1936000	and look at the penetration of the left-handed light.
1936000	1938000	At this time, because the
1938000	1940000	bias light of the penetrating light
1940000	1942000	is different from the recorded light,
1942000	1944000	so I call it conversion efficiency.
1944000	1946000	We can see that the conversion efficiency is here.
1946000	1948000	Then I look at the x- and y-directions of the
1948000	1950000	bias light, and I will see a value.
1950000	1952000	At this time, if I rotate it
1952000	1954000	a theta angle, this theta angle is
1954000	1956000	the angle with the y-axis.
1956000	1958000	We will find a very magical thing
1958000	1960000	that its efficiency will hardly change,
1960000	1962000	and its
1962000	1964000	position will change to 2 theta.
1964000	1966000	Then,
1966000	1968000	as long as I let it rotate
1968000	1970000	at the same angle
1970000	1972000	on this surface,
1972000	1974000	I can make
1974000	1976000	its position change from 0
1976000	1978000	to 2π.
1978000	1980000	Every time I rotate a theta angle,
1980000	1982000	its bias delay will become 2 theta.
1982000	1984000	Another interesting point is that
1984000	1986000	if the same structure,
1986000	1988000	the direction of my rotation is exactly the same,
1988000	1990000	but at this time I turn into a left-handed light
1990000	1992000	and look at the penetration of the right-handed light.
1992000	1994000	At this time, I will find a
1994000	1996000	more interesting thing,
1996000	1998000	its bias delay can reach 360 degrees,
1998000	2000000	but it is from 0 to 360 and becomes
2000000	2002000	0 to negative 360.
2002000	2004000	This thing can help us design
2004000	2006000	some components that can be manipulated by bias.
2006000	2008000	For example, if you look at it with the right-handed light,
2008000	2010000	it will become a focal penetration.
2010000	2012000	If you look at it with the left-handed light,
2012000	2014000	it will become a scattered penetration.
2014000	2016000	In other words, I can combine
2016000	2018000	many different optical functions
2018000	2020000	on the same optical component,
2020000	2022000	and its
2022000	2024000	magnitude is very thin.
2024000	2026000	The thickness of this metal is only
2026000	2028000	50 nanometers,
2028000	2030000	so it is much smaller
2030000	2032000	than the previous
2032000	2034000	50 nanometers.
2034000	2036000	This is what we are talking about,
2036000	2038000	because its magnitude is very small,
2038000	2040000	so the concept we propose here is that
2040000	2042000	we can integrate all the different chips
2042000	2044000	on the same sample.
2044000	2046000	Then after I enter the color light,
2046000	2048000	I hit different chips
2048000	2050000	and the reflected light can produce a different fragrance.
2052000	2054000	Compared with the general traditional components,
2054000	2056000	I want to produce the original light,
2056000	2058000	for example, I at least need a
2058000	2060000	linear light,
2060000	2062000	a linear polarizer,
2062000	2064000	and a quarter wave,
2064000	2066000	to produce the original light.
2066000	2068000	But now if I only use our metasurface,
2068000	2070000	my thickness only needs about
2070000	2072000	dozens of nanometers to complete
2072000	2074000	this thing.
2074000	2076000	Let me tell you
2076000	2078000	why we use aluminum,
2078000	2080000	because I just mentioned that gold,
2080000	2082000	because its intervention coefficient is around 500 to 550 nanometers,
2082000	2084000	so it is impossible
2084000	2086000	to work on the entire optical spectrum.
2086000	2088000	Silver can work on the entire optical spectrum,
2088000	2090000	but there is a big disadvantage of silver,
2090000	2092000	which is that it is very easy to oxidize,
2092000	2094000	so the components cannot last long.
2094000	2096000	So we choose aluminum here.
2096000	2098000	Here is a demo for everyone,
2098000	2100000	that is to say,
2100000	2102000	we use LISO to pattern
2102000	2104000	some different aluminum sticks
2104000	2106000	of different lengths and sizes,
2106000	2108000	and its color will change drastically.
2108000	2110000	This is its tradition.
2110000	2112000	Indeed, its resonance can
2112000	2114000	expand from 400 nanometers of blue light
2114000	2116000	to 750 nanometers of red light.
2118000	2120000	Here is the design of the component.
2120000	2122000	I won't talk about it.
2122000	2124000	Simply put, we optimized
2124000	2126000	its structure dimension
2126000	2128000	so that it can produce the highest
2128000	2130000	work efficiency.
2130000	2132000	Next, I will tell you
2132000	2134000	how to use the same component
2134000	2136000	to achieve the production
2136000	2138000	of any parameter.
2138000	2140000	First of all,
2140000	2142000	after I design a stick here,
2142000	2144000	as I just said,
2144000	2146000	I make it rotate
2146000	2148000	in the direction of change.
2148000	2150000	I can let it produce 0 to 2π
2150000	2152000	and I can produce an abnormal reflection.
2152000	2154000	The interesting thing about this abnormal reflection
2154000	2156000	is that my rotation angle is fixed,
2156000	2158000	so if I enter the color light
2158000	2160000	at this time,
2160000	2162000	it will produce an abnormal reflection
2162000	2164000	of the right light here.
2164000	2166000	Conversely, if I enter the color light
2166000	2168000	and it is the right light,
2168000	2170000	it will produce an abnormal reflection
2170000	2172000	of the left light,
2172000	2174000	but it is on the other side
2174000	2176000	and it is already achieved.
2176000	2178000	If I enter a linear parameter light,
2178000	2180000	which is horizontal,
2180000	2182000	I mean the x-parameter light.
2182000	2184000	Because the x-parameter light
2184000	2186000	can be regarded as the addition of
2186000	2188000	the right light and the left light,
2188000	2190000	so it can let me produce
2190000	2192000	the left and right parameters at the same time.
2192000	2194000	So I use a simple rotation
2194000	2196000	to achieve the adjustment of the original parameter light
2196000	2198000	if I enter the color light as a linear parameter light.
2198000	2200000	How do I produce any linear parameter light?
2200000	2202000	We introduce another
2202000	2204000	parameter light that looks exactly the same as it,
2204000	2206000	but the rotation direction of the structure is opposite.
2206000	2208000	The first group of rotation is clockwise,
2208000	2210000	and the second group of rotation is counterclockwise.
2210000	2212000	In this case,
2212000	2214000	when I enter a linear parameter light,
2214000	2216000	I can achieve the reflection of
2216000	2218000	the right and left parameters at the same time on the same side.
2218000	2220000	Then I make a spatial parallelism
2220000	2222000	between the two of them.
2222000	2224000	This parallelism will make a difference
2224000	2226000	in the position between the two of them.
2226000	2228000	This difference in the position
2228000	2230000	can be determined by this d.
2230000	2232000	As mentioned earlier,
2232000	2234000	the difference in the position
2234000	2236000	can be equal to 2πd divided by Lx.
2236000	2238000	Lx is the length.
2238000	2240000	So you can see that the difference in the position
2240000	2242000	can be changed by the change in d.
2242000	2244000	So after the two of them interfere with each other,
2244000	2246000	they can be multiplied into
2246000	2248000	different linear parameters.
2248000	2250000	For example, if d is 0,
2250000	2252000	it means that the difference in the position
2252000	2254000	between the two original parameters is 0.
2254000	2256000	At this time, their reflection light
2256000	2258000	will also be an x-parameter light.
2258000	2260000	It's a bit like a mirror.
2260000	2262000	If I let its d
2262000	2264000	be designed to
2264000	2266000	have a difference in the position
2266000	2268000	of π,
2268000	2270000	it will become a y-parameter light.
2270000	2272000	That is, Lx's reflection light will become y.
2272000	2274000	In this way, I can make it
2274000	2276000	a positive 45-degree linear light
2276000	2278000	or a negative 45-degree linear light.
2278000	2280000	So it's all reflected.
2280000	2282000	Now there's no way to do the refraction.
2282000	2284000	Isn't it just a projection?
2284000	2286000	We can do projection here,
2286000	2288000	but the efficiency of projection will be very low.
2288000	2290000	Because I just said that the loss of metal is relatively large.
2290000	2292000	So our demo here is mainly reflected.
2292000	2294000	The work I will do later will be projected.
2294000	2296000	But our material will be converted from metal
2296000	2298000	to electrolyte.
2298000	2300000	OK, good, continue.
2300000	2302000	Then here is its SEM map.
2302000	2304000	That is, we integrate
2304000	2306000	the six samples together.
2306000	2308000	Then the optical system.
2308000	2310000	Here is a test result.
2310000	2312000	We usually use
2312000	2314000	this POSCALISphere
2314000	2316000	to show
2316000	2318000	what the
2318000	2320000	refraction of light
2320000	2322000	is.
2322000	2324000	In fact, this map is very simple to see.
2324000	2326000	If this map is the earth,
2326000	2328000	its north pole represents the purest right-axis light.
2328000	2330000	The south pole is the purest left-axis light.
2330000	2332000	The four points on the equator
2332000	2334000	represent the
2334000	2336000	linear light.
2336000	2338000	The four points in the east, west, south and north
2338000	2340000	represent the purest
2340000	2342000	x, y, positive 45
2342000	2344000	and negative 45-degree linear light.
2344000	2346000	And these three maps are based on
2346000	2348000	the experiment results of these three
2348000	2350000	green light wavelengths.
2350000	2352000	The black dots are the theoretical results
2352000	2354000	of ideal prediction.
2354000	2356000	And the
2356000	2358000	black dots with colors
2358000	2360000	are the results of our experiment measurement.
2360000	2362000	It can be said that they are almost very match.
2362000	2364000	Some may have some miscalculations,
2364000	2366000	but they are still quite close to our theoretical prediction results.
2366000	2368000	Then it proves that we can
2368000	2370000	achieve different equilibrium states
2370000	2372000	based on our experimental results.
2400000	2402000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2430000	2432000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2520000	2522000	This is an acoustic-optic modulator.
2551000	2555000	We want to design a different structure,
2555000	2559000	and make it a stick-length.
2559000	2563000	So the resonance will only be produced
2563000	2566000	when the polarity of the infrared light is along the length.
2566000	2568000	That's when I see the image.
2568000	2570000	If I rotate the polarity of the light,
2570000	2572000	the image will disappear.
2572000	2574000	When the white light comes in,
2574000	2577000	I hope to see RGB in the original.
2577000	2579000	If I rotate the polarity of the light,
2579000	2581000	I will see different images.
2581000	2584000	I skip the design principle.
2584000	2586000	This is a sample picture.
2586000	2588000	This is the experiment result.
2588000	2590000	If the white light comes in,
2590000	2592000	I can see the RGB pattern in the original.
2592000	2594000	The same is reflected.
2594000	2596000	If I slowly rotate the polarity of the light,
2596000	2598000	I will see that the image will disappear.
2598000	2600000	This is the first part of
2600000	2605000	making a polarity-dependent holographic image.
2605000	2608000	The second part is the lens.
2608000	2614000	The lens is widely used in our daily life.
2614000	2616000	For example, a microscope or a camera lens.
2616000	2620000	The main thing is to focus on the lens.
2620000	2624000	There are several big problems with the lens.
2624000	2626000	One of them is the difference between the two.
2626000	2632000	The difference is the light coming in from different angles.
2632000	2634000	It will be focused in different places.
2634000	2636000	If I want to make a full-color image,
2636000	2638000	there will be a big difference.
2638000	2640000	The difference is that the light comes in from different angles,
2640000	2643000	but it will be focused in different places.
2643000	2646000	This makes it impossible for us to make a full-color image.
2646000	2648000	In order to satisfy this problem,
2648000	2651000	they will stack two lenses together
2651000	2653000	to compensate for the difference in color.
2653000	2655000	They can be focused at the same point
2655000	2657000	in different places.
2657000	2659000	This makes it possible to make a full-color image.
2659000	2662000	This is why we can't make full-color images.
2662000	2664000	Because they have to stack many lenses together
2664000	2666000	so that they can be focused at the same point
2666000	2668000	in different places.
2668000	2670000	Theoretically, if you add one more lens,
2670000	2672000	you can only make a full-color image.
2672000	2675000	For example, if I want to make a full-color image,
2675000	2678000	you can imagine that I need at least ten or twenty lenses.
2678000	2680000	It may not be enough.
2680000	2682000	Here is a picture.
2682000	2686000	Why is the lens of our smart phone so thick?
2686000	2689000	Because it has a lot of different lenses in it.
2689000	2692000	In order to satisfy the compensation of the difference in color,
2692000	2696000	the picture we take will not have distortion.
2696000	2698000	Or the color will not run away.
2698000	2700000	It's the same as what you see with your eyes.
2702000	2705000	This is why we want to use MetaServer as a lens.
2705000	2707000	I just mentioned that we used to use metal.
2707000	2710000	We want to make a high-efficiency lens.
2710000	2711000	If I use metal,
2711000	2713000	all the examples I just mentioned can only be reflective.
2713000	2715000	On the other hand, if I want to make a penetrative lens,
2715000	2718000	I have to convert it into an anodized material.
2718000	2720000	Anodized material does not have a distortion rate,
2720000	2723000	so there will be no heat loss when it is compensated.
2723000	2724000	Without heat loss,
2724000	2730000	it can greatly reduce the efficiency of work.
2730000	2732000	Here is a history.
2732000	2734000	This may also be skipped.
2736000	2738000	First of all, we use GetInNitro as a material.
2738000	2740000	It has a high enough distortion rate in visible light.
2740000	2742000	We want to use anodized material to make MetaService.
2742000	2747000	The prerequisite is that its distortion rate is at least greater than 2.
2747000	2750000	Because anodized material is not like metal,
2750000	2751000	it has a free electron accumulation.
2751000	2754000	So its resonance must rely on the displacement current.
2754000	2756000	If the displacement current has resonance,
2756000	2758000	it means that the distortion rate itself
2758000	2761000	must be large enough to compare with the surrounding environment.
2761000	2763000	Only then can it produce a strong enough displacement current
2763000	2765000	to produce anodized material accumulation.
2765000	2767000	At least, as far as I can see,
2767000	2769000	if compared with air, it is at least 2.
2770000	2771000	Similarly, we use PPFace,
2771000	2773000	which is the MetaService of GeometryFaceFace,
2773000	2775000	which is the rotating method I just mentioned,
2775000	2776000	to adjust its anodization.
2776000	2777000	Why do we need to adjust its anodization?
2777000	2778000	Because we are going to make a focal length.
2778000	2779000	To make a focal length means that
2779000	2781000	I am now inserting a plane light into it.
2781000	2783000	The light in different positions
2783000	2786000	will feel that its anodization delay is different.
2786000	2788000	It can only reach the same point.
2788000	2790000	So this is the anodization distribution
2790000	2794000	that I have to satisfy in different structures in the space.
2795000	2797000	Then this is the final design result.
2797000	2799000	If I insert an experiment,
2799000	2803000	this is the experimental electronic microscope photo.
2803000	2806000	This is the MetaService Lens we designed.
2806000	2808000	We call it MetaLens.
2808000	2810000	In order to detect its anodization,
2810000	2812000	when we insert a light into it,
2812000	2813000	this ultraviolet transceiver
2813000	2815000	will focus on a certain point in a certain space.
2815000	2818000	We use a flat platform at the back
2818000	2821000	to detect how good its anodized light band is.
2821000	2822000	It can be seen that
2822000	2826000	when we match it to its anodized surface,
2826000	2829000	we can see a very beautiful green highlight.
2829000	2831000	I inserted a green light and laser at this time.
2831000	2834000	If I move away from it, it will not focus.
2835000	2836000	In addition to the green light,
2836000	2837000	we can also do different things.
2837000	2838000	How far is the distance?
2838000	2840000	How far can it move?
2840000	2841000	You mean this stage?
2841000	2842000	Yes.
2842000	2844000	The stage we bought at that time was quite high.
2844000	2846000	It can move up to 7mm.
2847000	2849000	What about its step size?
2849000	2852000	Its step size can be up to 500nm.
2852000	2853000	OK.
2853000	2854000	Yes.
2854000	2855000	Thank you.
2855000	2856000	Go on.
2856000	2857000	Not only the green light,
2857000	2858000	we can also do red, blue, and green.
2858000	2860000	Just change its size.
2860000	2861000	Just like what I just said.
2861000	2862000	Because it also has a resonance.
2862000	2864000	The resonance depends on its size.
2864000	2865000	Yes.
2865000	2867000	Next, in addition to doing positive focal length,
2867000	2869000	we can also do oblique focal length.
2869000	2871000	It's the same on a flat surface.
2871000	2872000	But this thing
2872000	2874000	is very difficult to do in traditional optical anodizing.
2874000	2875000	Because traditional optical anodizing
2875000	2877000	is mainly done by hand
2877000	2880000	to achieve the surface frequency I want.
2880000	2884000	Anodizing is a glass with a curve.
2884000	2885000	Different thicknesses
2885000	2887000	will cause different fragmentation.
2887000	2889000	If I want to use traditional anodizing
2889000	2890000	to do oblique focal length,
2890000	2891000	you can imagine that
2891000	2892000	this curve
2892000	2895000	will become a curve on one side.
2895000	2897000	This is very difficult
2897000	2899000	in terms of technology.
2899000	2901000	Our technology is very simple.
2901000	2902000	I just need to change
2902000	2904000	the distribution of the surface structure
2904000	2906000	and move its center
2906000	2907000	to the left a little bit
2907000	2909000	or to the right a little bit.
2909000	2911000	Then I can do oblique focal length.
2911000	2912000	For example, this picture.
2912000	2913000	Yes.
2913000	2915000	This is the experiment result.
2915000	2917000	You can see that red, blue, and green are focused.
2917000	2918000	The dotted line
2918000	2922000	refers to the position of the lens.
2922000	2924000	The focal length is in the upper right corner.
2924000	2926000	We designed it in the upper right corner.
2926000	2927000	We proposed an application for this.
2927000	2929000	If we integrate all of them
2929000	2930000	on the same chip,
2930000	2931000	it's the same because it's very small.
2931000	2932000	So we can easily
2932000	2934000	integrate them all together.
2934000	2935000	At this time,
2935000	2936000	after I insert a wide-screen light source,
2936000	2937000	I will see different colors
2937000	2939000	with different color distribution.
2939000	2941000	I can use it to divide the light.
2941000	2942000	For example,
2942000	2945000	this is our sample photo.
2945000	2946000	If I insert a red light now,
2946000	2948000	I can see that it focuses in the upper right corner.
2948000	2949000	It's the same sample.
2949000	2951000	If I insert a green light now,
2951000	2952000	I can see that it focuses
2952000	2954000	in the upper left and lower right.
2954000	2955000	If I insert a blue light,
2955000	2956000	it focuses in the lower left.
2956000	2958000	If I insert three wavelengths at the same time,
2958000	2960000	I can see the effect of dividing the light.
2960000	2962000	The biggest application of this
2962000	2964000	is on CMOS.
2964000	2966000	CMOS is a very important component
2966000	2969000	in the current image sensor.
2969000	2970000	Traditionally,
2970000	2973000	a micro lens must be made.
2973000	2975000	It must be focused first
2975000	2976000	and then go through a filter
2976000	2978000	and then go through a detector.
2978000	2980000	Because the detector can't distinguish colors,
2980000	2982000	that's why it has to put a filter here.
2982000	2983000	That's the reason.
2983000	2985000	It must first determine
2985000	2987000	that this filter can only receive blue light.
2987000	2989000	So it has to put a blue light filter here
2989000	2991000	to filter out the white light in front,
2991000	2993000	red light and green light.
2993000	2994000	This causes
2994000	2996000	the red light and green light
2996000	2998000	of this part to be wasted
2998000	2999000	and pushed back and forth.
2999000	3001000	But for our sample,
3001000	3003000	we can put all the white light in
3003000	3005000	and put all the red light here,
3005000	3006000	green light in the middle,
3006000	3007000	and blue light on the other side.
3007000	3008000	We can effectively use
3008000	3010000	all the energy of the green light
3010000	3014000	to greatly increase its S-N ratio.
3014000	3015000	The other biggest advantage
3015000	3016000	is what I just said.
3016000	3018000	Our thickness is only 600 nanometers.
3018000	3020000	Traditionally, it's about 1 to 10 microns.
3020000	3021000	So we can shrink down
3021000	3025000	its physical dimension.
3025000	3027000	Another thing we want to do
3027000	3030000	is to eliminate the color difference.
3030000	3031000	As I just said,
3031000	3032000	different wavelengths
3032000	3035000	will focus on different positions.
3035000	3038000	This is the work of people in the past.
3038000	3039000	This is our work.
3039000	3040000	Traditionally,
3040000	3042000	different wavelengths of green light
3042000	3044000	would focus on different positions in the space.
3044000	3046000	So it's hard to make a full-color image.
3046000	3050000	After some special designs,
3050000	3051000	we provide different color compensation
3051000	3053000	in different positions
3053000	3055000	to create a white light focus point.
3055000	3057000	We're just doing a demo here.
3057000	3059000	So we're using a metal part
3060000	3063000	to do a reflective demonstration.
3063000	3064000	This is the design principle.
3064000	3065000	I won't talk about it.
3065000	3066000	I'll just show you the result.
3066000	3068000	This is the sample photo.
3068000	3071000	This is the measurement result.
3071000	3073000	This is the calculation result.
3073000	3074000	You can see that
3074000	3075000	my wavelength has changed
3075000	3077000	from 1.2 microns to 1.65 microns.
3077000	3078000	Basically, its focal length
3078000	3080000	hasn't changed at all.
3080000	3082000	If I do a different
3082000	3085000	transparent measurement,
3085000	3086000	you can see that
3086000	3088000	when the green light wavelength changes,
3088000	3089000	its focal length
3089000	3091000	remains at the same position.
3091000	3093000	If I compare it with
3093000	3094000	traditional Meta Lens
3094000	3095000	or other traditional Lens,
3095000	3097000	in the same wavelength,
3097000	3100000	its deviation is quite large.
3100000	3101000	So it proves that
3101000	3105000	we can completely eliminate color difference.
3105000	3106000	This is another example.
3106000	3108000	I'll skip it.
3108000	3109000	Another example is
3109000	3110000	what we just talked about.
3110000	3111000	The biggest use of transparency
3111000	3113000	is when we want to make a full-color image.
3113000	3115000	Reflectivity is actually very capable of making a full-color image.
3115000	3117000	So our work here
3117000	3119000	is to make a transparency
3119000	3120000	with high efficiency
3120000	3121000	to eliminate color difference
3121000	3124000	and further apply it to make a full-color image.
3124000	3126000	This is what we just talked about.
3126000	3127000	Why can we use
3127000	3129000	the material of the interface
3129000	3132000	to adjust the fragrance?
3132000	3133000	Mainly because
3133000	3135000	there is a big difference in reflectivity.
3135000	3136000	So it can produce
3136000	3138000	a cavity-like resonance inside.
3138000	3139000	So different wavelengths
3139000	3140000	can produce different
3140000	3143000	resonance.
3143000	3144000	Different wavelengths
3144000	3146000	can produce different fragrance delay.
3147000	3148000	This is our photo.
3148000	3151000	Our studio is located in the visible light.
3151000	3154000	So the refractive wavelength range is from 400 to 640.
3154000	3155000	We can actually eliminate it to 660.
3155000	3157000	But because of the deviation here,
3157000	3159000	I only show it to 640.
3159000	3161000	The last is to make a full-color image.
3161000	3164000	After I use a photo to come in,
3164000	3167000	we use our metalance to eliminate color difference.
3167000	3168000	We want to be able to
3168000	3171000	make a full-color image analysis.
3171000	3173000	This is a full-color photo
3173000	3176000	we made with our transparency.
3176000	3177000	You can see that
3177000	3179000	even the white or yellow
3179000	3181000	colors are very clear.
3181000	3183000	Compared with the original photo,
3183000	3185000	there is not much difference in color.
3185000	3186000	This proves that
3186000	3188000	we can eliminate color difference
3188000	3190000	in the entire refractive wavelength range
3190000	3192000	and make a full-color image application.
3192000	3193000	That's about it.
3193000	3195000	Sorry, I talked a little too fast.
3195000	3197000	Because the time is a bit delayed.
3197000	3199000	This is my report today.
3199000	3201000	Thank you everyone.
3201000	3204000	I don't know if there are any questions.
3205000	3207000	If I talk too fast later.
3211000	3213000	I think it's good.
3213000	3215000	Yeah, no problem.
3215000	3217000	Can you hear me?
3217000	3219000	Yes, we can hear you now.
3229000	3231000	My question is
3231000	3233000	Basically, your device
3233000	3236000	is roughly scaled as
3236000	3239000	the working frequency.
3239000	3241000	Basically, right?
3241000	3244000	Yes, it's smaller than the frequency.
3244000	3246000	I mean, it should have the same effect.
3246000	3248000	If today you want
3248000	3250000	the wavelength of your work
3250000	3251000	to be doubled,
3251000	3253000	basically, the length
3253000	3256000	is scaled to be about 2.
3256000	3258000	So the area is about 4.
3258000	3260000	No, no, no.
3260000	3262000	It's not a linear scale.
3262000	3264000	It's not a linear scale?
3264000	3265000	No, it's not.
3265000	3267000	Because of the resonance.
3267000	3269000	So it's different from the material.
3269000	3271000	For example,
3271000	3273000	this thing is very intuitive.
3273000	3275000	For example.
3277000	3279000	For example, I just talked about
3279000	3281000	this thing.
3281000	3283000	For example, if we produce resonance,
3283000	3285000	we can think of it as
3286000	3288000	the resonance here.
3288000	3290000	So if you say
3290000	3292000	the wavelength of my work
3292000	3293000	is doubled,
3293000	3295000	in theory, the length should be doubled.
3295000	3297000	The premise of this thing is
3297000	3300000	that the resolution of the structure itself does not change.
3300000	3301000	Oh.
3301000	3303000	But now I have different wavelengths.
3303000	3305000	The resolution of the material will change.
3305000	3306000	So its equivalent wavelength,
3306000	3308000	the effective lambda
3308000	3310000	is actually lambda over n.
3310000	3313000	This n is also the wavelength function.
3313000	3314000	Oh, yeah.
3314000	3317000	Yes, so it's not a linear scale.
3318000	3321000	Now for this kind of material,
3321000	3323000	can you do it in
3323000	3325000	millimeter wave
3325000	3327000	or infrared
3327000	3329000	and deep IR
3329000	3331000	device?
3331000	3333000	Yes, it can be Terahertz or microwave.
3333000	3335000	On the contrary, the most people do microwave.
3335000	3337000	Now there are several American companies
3337000	3339000	established to do this principle
3339000	3340000	are doing microwave.
3340000	3342000	Because microwave is easy to do
3342000	3344000	and the loss is super low.
3344000	3347000	Then the military use is the widest.
3347000	3349000	And its materials are basically
3349000	3351000	for example, aluminum
3351000	3353000	or some silicon base.
3353000	3355000	This kind of cheaper and easy to make material
3355000	3356000	can be done, basically.
3356000	3357000	Yes, that's right.
3357000	3359000	So the metal part
3359000	3361000	is actually quite long,
3361000	3363000	but why the metal part
3363000	3364000	has not been commercial product
3364000	3365000	The main reason is here.
3365000	3368000	Because metal is not yet silicon
3368000	3370000	part fabrication compatible.
3370000	3372000	So why do we want to do
3372000	3373000	gallium nitride later?
3373000	3374000	That's the reason.
3374000	3375000	Because gallium nitride
3375000	3377000	is at least a semiconductor company.
3377000	3379000	Now the current manufacturing can be compatible.
3380000	3381000	Let me tell you
3381000	3382000	why I want to ask this question.
3382000	3384000	Maybe you can think about it.
3384000	3386000	Because we are looking for
3386000	3388000	Terahertz absorber,
3388000	3390000	but it has to be very, very
3390000	3392000	low radioactivity.
3392000	3394000	So we have a very, very big
3394000	3396000	material limit.
3396000	3398000	So we are looking for
3398000	3400000	material limit is very, very big.
3401000	3402000	We can't use some
3402000	3404000	very fancy elements, you know.
3406000	3408000	So if you can do this thing,
3408000	3410000	it should be usable.
3410000	3412000	And it's quite sophisticated.
3412000	3414000	What do you think your Terahertz
3414000	3416000	needs?
3416000	3418000	We need it to be
3418000	3420000	able to adjust its optical quality
3420000	3421000	in Terahertz.
3421000	3422000	Not only optical quality,
3422000	3424000	but also the quality of EM wave.
3424000	3426000	But all the materials it uses
3426000	3428000	have to be very low radioactivity.
3428000	3430000	In other words,
3430000	3432000	its natural isotope has to be very low.
3432000	3434000	So we don't have
3434000	3436000	many materials we can use.
3436000	3438000	But if you can use some pure elements,
3438000	3440000	such as silicon,
3440000	3442000	or aluminum, or some
3442000	3444000	not alloy, or that kind of
3444000	3446000	super heavy metal, or super heavy metal,
3446000	3448000	you can do it.
3448000	3450000	That's a very good choice.
3450000	3452000	For example, can you accept gold and copper?
3452000	3454000	Copper, yes, gold and copper.
3454000	3456000	But what do you want to use?
3456000	3458000	For example, silver, or something weird
3458000	3460000	that you can't read Chinese, that's not OK.
3460000	3462000	If it's Terahertz,
3462000	3464000	gold and copper
3464000	3466000	can be used.
3466000	3468000	These are very common materials.
3468000	3470000	On the other hand,
3470000	3472000	Terahertz is less likely to see
3472000	3474000	electrolytes, because electrolytes
3474000	3476000	in Terahertz's resolution
3476000	3478000	doesn't seem to be able to reach
3478000	3480000	such a high value.
3480000	3482000	Because usually
3482000	3484000	in the natural world,
3484000	3486000	the refractive index of electrolytes
3486000	3488000	will become smaller as the wavelength increases.
3488000	3490000	So it's visibility
3490000	3492000	will be the highest,
3492000	3494000	and then slowly decay.
3494000	3496000	So in my mind,
3496000	3498000	I haven't seen anyone
3498000	3500000	use electrolytes in Terahertz,
3500000	3502000	such as silicon, or gallium nitride,
3502000	3504000	or germanium, not germanium,
3504000	3506000	but silicon nitride,
3506000	3508000	this kind of electrolyte material
3508000	3510000	to make Terahertz components.
3510000	3512000	There's a lot of metal,
3512000	3514000	like I said, a lot of copper and gold.
3514000	3516000	OK, thank you.
3516000	3518000	You're welcome.
3518000	3520000	Ian, you just mentioned
3520000	3522000	radioactivity.
3522000	3524000	What kind of radioactivity do you mean?
3524000	3526000	Do you mean the radiation
3526000	3528000	response in space?
3528000	3530000	No, I mean the radioactivity
3530000	3532000	of the material itself.
3532000	3534000	Like bananas have beta decay,
3534000	3536000	something like that.
3536000	3538000	Oh, OK.
3538000	3540000	So the radioactivity
3540000	3542000	will be higher in space?
3542000	3544000	Yeah, if you want to use
3544000	3546000	something that's at the bottom
3546000	3548000	of the elemental cycle,
3548000	3550000	it won't work.
3550000	3552000	The reason why it won't work
3552000	3554000	is because...
3554000	3556000	Because it will naturally
3556000	3558000	have the same value
3558000	3560000	and then it will easily decay.
3560000	3562000	Then the decay will release
3562000	3564000	particles, and the particles
3564000	3566000	will affect the quality
3566000	3568000	of the material.
3568000	3570000	I didn't quite understand
3570000	3572000	what kind of material
3572000	3574000	do you usually use
3574000	3576000	in the microwave range?
3576000	3578000	Aluminum or gallium nitride?
3578000	3580000	No, if it's microwave,
3580000	3582000	the most common thing
3582000	3584000	is copper, because
3584000	3586000	copper can print
3586000	3588000	the pattern they want
3588000	3590000	directly.
3590000	3592000	So the pattern they print
3592000	3594000	is like the nanostructure
3594000	3596000	of the microwave.
3596000	3598000	Because the wavelength of the microwave
3598000	3600000	is dozens of millimeters,
3600000	3602000	or even centimeters.
3602000	3604000	So it's easier to make?
3604000	3606000	Yeah, it's easier to make.
3606000	3608000	And what they print
3608000	3610000	is a large area.
3610000	3612000	You can stick it
3612000	3614000	on the wall of your house.
3614000	3616000	Oh, I see.
3616000	3618000	Are there any other materials
3618000	3620000	that can do the same thing?
3620000	3622000	Well,
3622000	3624000	the most common metal
3624000	3626000	is
3626000	3628000	gallium nitride.
3628000	3630000	No, not copper.
3630000	3632000	It's gallium aluminum.
3632000	3634000	These three are the most common.
3636000	3638000	Oh, thank you.
3638000	3640000	And if it's...
3640000	3642000	No, you go first.
3642000	3644000	Yeah, and if it's
3644000	3646000	gallium aluminum,
3646000	3648000	there are a lot of choices.
3648000	3650000	For example,
3650000	3652000	as long as it's high enough.
3652000	3654000	So silicon,
3654000	3656000	gallium nitride,
3656000	3658000	silicon nitride,
3658000	3660000	titanium oxide,
3660000	3662000	and gallium phosphide.
3662000	3664000	But gallium phosphide has adsorption,
3664000	3666000	so the effect may not be as good.
3668000	3670000	You have a video
3670000	3672000	where the light hits
3672000	3674000	the left and right
3674000	3676000	of the picture.
3678000	3680000	Oh.
3682000	3684000	This one?
3684000	3686000	Yeah.
3686000	3688000	This one?
3688000	3690000	No, the first one.
3690000	3692000	The first one.
3692000	3694000	The one you just showed.
3694000	3696000	Yeah.
3696000	3698000	Oh, so how efficient is it?
3698000	3700000	If you
3700000	3702000	hit the light directly,
3702000	3704000	if it's linearly polarized,
3704000	3706000	it will turn left and right.
3706000	3708000	This one,
3708000	3710000	in practice...
3710000	3712000	Let me see.
3716000	3718000	In practice, it's about
3718000	3720000	30% to
3720000	3722000	50%
3722000	3724000	efficient.
3724000	3726000	OK.
3726000	3728000	And this is its wavelength.
3728000	3730000	Yeah, the next one is the wavelength.
3732000	3734000	In theory,
3734000	3736000	we expect it to be 70% or so.
3736000	3738000	But after we published this,
3738000	3740000	there was one thing
3740000	3742000	that we didn't consider.
3742000	3744000	When we calculated this,
3744000	3746000	we knew that aluminum oxidizes easily.
3746000	3748000	So when it oxidizes,
3748000	3750000	there will be 3 to 5 nanometers of aluminum oxide on the surface.
3750000	3752000	This will affect its resonance and reduce its efficiency.
3752000	3754000	So this picture is actually talking about this.
3754000	3756000	This is someone else's work.
3756000	3758000	He's talking about pure aluminum.
3758000	3760000	If I design it,
3760000	3762000	its resonance is this high.
3762000	3764000	And after the aluminum oxidizes,
3764000	3766000	it will slowly turn right a little bit.
3766000	3768000	Then the efficiency will drop a little bit.
3768000	3770000	This is also seen in our experiment.
3770000	3772000	Indeed, our simulation
3772000	3774000	hopes that its peak is here.
3774000	3776000	But our experimental result
3776000	3778000	is to turn right,
3778000	3780000	and then to fall down.
3780000	3782000	So at that time,
3782000	3784000	there was speculation that the efficiency of this result could not be so high.
3784000	3786000	It's because when we calculated it,
3786000	3788000	when we optimized the structure,
3788000	3790000	we didn't consider the influence of aluminum oxidization.
3790000	3792000	The question I want to ask is
3792000	3794000	if
3794000	3796000	I'm sorry, I'll ask it again.
3796000	3798000	If the positive light
3798000	3800000	keeps reducing
3800000	3802000	the energy,
3802000	3804000	in the end,
3804000	3806000	it will become
3806000	3808000	a single light
3808000	3810000	or several lights.
3810000	3812000	Then it will have to
3812000	3814000	reflect
3814000	3816000	these two lights
3816000	3818000	at the same time
3818000	3820000	Will there be some
3820000	3822000	state of entanglement?
3822000	3824000	Or you don't care about this?
3824000	3826000	We don't care about this.
3826000	3828000	But what you're talking about is
3828000	3830000	actually
3830000	3832000	what I want to do next.
3832000	3834000	Because
3834000	3836000	now the most common
3836000	3838000	entanglement following source
3838000	3840000	is to use BBO,
3840000	3842000	this kind of non-linear crystal
3842000	3844000	to produce entanglement of
3844000	3846000	linear light.
3846000	3848000	But it's linear light.
3848000	3850000	So I actually thought about this thing at that time.
3850000	3852000	If I am now a linear light entanglement,
3852000	3854000	both are H plus V
3854000	3856000	entanglement,
3856000	3858000	I put the light through this source.
3858000	3860000	What is H plus V?
3860000	3862000	The state of H plus V.
3862000	3864000	H is horizontal, V is vertical.
3864000	3866000	It's the entanglement of X and Y.
3866000	3868000	If I turn the green light
3868000	3870000	into the state of H plus V entanglement,
3870000	3872000	can I have
3872000	3874000	spatial entanglement at the same time?
3874000	3876000	Or does it become hyper-entanglement?
3876000	3878000	I'm not sure about this.
3878000	3880000	But I actually wanted to do this thing at that time.
3880000	3882000	Because I'm not sure
3882000	3884000	whether it's H or V.
3884000	3886000	So after it comes in,
3886000	3888000	I can't be sure
3888000	3890000	whether it runs to the left
3890000	3892000	or to the right.
3892000	3894000	Because if it's H,
3894000	3896000	the left is the right.
3896000	3898000	If it's V, the left is the left.
3900000	3902000	I think this thing
3902000	3904000	is likely to be established.
3904000	3906000	Because this kind of element
3906000	3908000	has already been done.
3908000	3910000	We mainly use laser light,
3910000	3912000	which is a bunch of photons
3912000	3914000	to integrate with this structure.
3914000	3916000	If I only have single photons now,
3916000	3918000	it has already been proven that
3918000	3920000	it will also work.
3920000	3922000	In the case that single photons
3922000	3924000	will also work,
3924000	3926000	entanglement should be established.
3926000	3928000	It should have a chance
3928000	3930000	to happen.
3930000	3932000	So what I'm going to do
3932000	3934000	is to use entanglement photons
3934000	3936000	to transfer to the spin
3936000	3938000	of quantum dot.
3940000	3942000	So you're doing quantum light.
3942000	3944000	Yes.
3944000	3946000	And then
3946000	3948000	what I'm going to do
3948000	3950000	is what I just said.
3950000	3952000	But now
3952000	3954000	the entanglement is
3954000	3956000	vertical and horizontal.
3956000	3958000	Yes.
3958000	3960000	If this can be done
3960000	3962000	with left and right entanglement,
3962000	3964000	it should be...
3964000	3966000	Yes, you do it first.
3966000	3968000	And then after you're sure,
3968000	3970000	you should think about it.
3970000	3972000	Before I came here,
3972000	3974000	I...
3976000	3978000	Are there any other questions?
3980000	3982000	OK.
3982000	3984000	Everyone has no questions.
3984000	3986000	Audience.
3986000	3988000	OK.
3988000	3990000	Thank you, Ping Jie.
3990000	3992000	Thank you.
3992000	3994000	You have a good grasp of time.
3994000	3996000	Actually,
3996000	3998000	I talked a little too fast.
3998000	4000000	Anyway,
4000000	4002000	if you have any questions later,
4002000	4004000	you can tell me.
4004000	4006000	Yes.
4006000	4008000	If you really did it in the end,
4008000	4010000	will you continue to do this
4010000	4012000	in Caltech?
4012000	4014000	I didn't do this in Caltech.
4014000	4016000	OK.
4016000	4018000	You can ask Cai Ding Ping later.
4018000	4020000	Yes.
4020000	4022000	Because if this is done,
4022000	4024000	then...
4024000	4026000	We should...
4026000	4028000	We are planning to do this
4028000	4030000	recently.
4030000	4032000	But...
4032000	4034000	OK.
4034000	4036000	Yes.
4036000	4038000	Have you come up with a good approach?
4038000	4040000	Or do you already have some approaches?
4040000	4042000	Just what you just said about BBO.
4042000	4044000	It can only produce linear light.
4044000	4046000	Yes.
4046000	4048000	It can only produce linear light.
4048000	4050000	Yes.
4050000	4052000	If it can produce...
4052000	4054000	Because if you want to produce
4054000	4056000	spin,
4056000	4058000	you have to use circular polarizer.
4058000	4060000	Yes.
4060000	4062000	So...
4062000	4064000	Yes.
4064000	4066000	That's what we are thinking about.
4066000	4068000	No problem.
4068000	4070000	OK.
4070000	4072000	OK.
4072000	4074000	That's all for today.
4074000	4076000	Thank you.
4076000	4078000	Thank you.
4078000	4080000	Bye bye.
