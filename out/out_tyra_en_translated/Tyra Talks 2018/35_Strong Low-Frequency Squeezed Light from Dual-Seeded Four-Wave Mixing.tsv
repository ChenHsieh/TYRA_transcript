0	9000	Hello everyone, my name is Wu Mengchang, and I am a student at Mata University.
9000	16000	What I want to talk about today is about 4-way mixing and squeeze light.
16000	22000	If you have any questions at any time, you can ask, just turn on your microphone.
22000	33000	My field is in the field of atomic physics, which is relatively low-energy physics.
33000	44000	Our research unit is JQI, which is the United States Department of State.
44000	52000	It is a rather special institution, which is under the Department of Commerce in the United States.
52000	58000	Although they don't sound like they are doing this kind of specialized research,
58000	63000	they have actually won four Nobel Prizes in atomic physics.
63000	68000	So it's a pretty special national standard.
68000	71000	My instructor is Paul Leitz.
71000	77000	Our main source of research funding is from the Air Force in the United States.
77000	85000	At the beginning, I want to let everyone know what squeezing means.
85000	111000	We want to compress all the information into a better measurement.
112000	116000	After watching the video, let's get down to business.
116000	121000	The experiment we are doing now is using laser light.
121000	126000	The characteristic of laser light is that it is a coherent state.
126000	129000	What is a coherent state?
129000	133000	I don't know if you've heard of it.
133000	136000	I'm sure you've heard of the non-coherent principle.
137000	141000	The non-coherent principle tells us that we can't...
141000	149000	We used to think that the results of delta x and delta t must be greater than h-bar.
149000	158000	We can imagine that our laser light has a so-called non-coherent property.
158000	165000	Non-coherent property means that it has its government amplitude and its horizontal axis.
165000	171000	Both of these can't be measured very accurately in practice.
171000	174000	That is to say, it has its limits.
174000	180000	You can see that when our laser light is in coherent state,
180000	183000	Basically, it's always in coherent state.
183000	187000	When it's in coherent state, you'll see its...
187000	192000	Its FN or phase fluctuation is actually...
192000	194000	Its result is in...
194000	203000	That is to say, the curve on the left represents the line that meets the non-coherent principle.
203000	207000	Mathematically, we know that when your delta...
208000	213000	My y-axis is delta e, and my x-axis is delta phi.
213000	216000	If these two variables are in the minimum value,
216000	222000	When the two are equal, they are actually in their so-called minimum value.
222000	227000	Laser light is when these two values are equal.
227000	231000	Then it presents such a coherent state.
231000	236000	So what is Squeeze state?
236000	239000	Squeeze state means that you can...
239000	245000	That is to say, we don't need to measure all the information of laser light very accurately.
245000	249000	We can say that we just need to measure the phase very accurately.
249000	253000	Or we can measure our government very accurately.
253000	256000	When you see that your phase is measured very accurately,
256000	260000	In fact, it still meets its non-coherent principle.
261000	265000	Then it will lead to the inaccuracy of your government.
265000	267000	It will become very large.
267000	271000	Then your phase can be measured very accurately.
271000	274000	So a while ago, probably the year before last,
274000	277000	Isn't there a gravity wave measurement experiment?
277000	284000	It is to use this Squeeze light to throw away your impurities.
284000	287000	I will talk about quantum impurities.
287000	290000	Because you are in coherent state.
290000	295000	Then go to the limits of quantum mechanics.
295000	300000	Then push it to compress it so that you can measure the phase very accurately.
300000	305000	Then they may have a so-called interferer.
305000	309000	Then the interferer can measure the phase of something.
309000	312000	If the gravity wave passes over the earth,
312000	320000	Then you can measure the phase of this gravity wave.
320000	322000	There will be some changes.
322000	325000	As long as you have a way to enter this Squeeze state,
325000	331000	You can let a certain frequency of the phase be able to measure it very accurately.
331000	335000	Because the gravity wave passes through like this,
335000	337000	So its frequency will be very weak.
337000	340000	If you are very weak, your impurities will be very strong.
340000	344000	You need to have a way to get rid of this impurity.
344000	348000	Then measure to the phase you want.
351000	354000	But what we did in the experiment,
354000	357000	We did another one.
357000	360000	We are so-called Two-Mode Squeezing.
360000	362000	Two-Mode Squeezing is to say,
362000	368000	I'm producing two intangles of light.
368000	373000	That is to say, I now have some special light and non-linear effects.
373000	377000	Then produce two intangles.
377000	379000	What about these two intangles?
379000	383000	Some of their signals are exactly the same.
383000	386000	So if I input a light,
386000	388000	That light is called Probe.
388000	390000	Then it will produce its oscillation.
390000	392000	It uses a Twin Beam.
392000	395000	These two lights have each other.
395000	398000	For example, there is quantum co-relative.
398000	401000	That is, quantum co-relative.
401000	403000	Quantum co-relative.
403000	408000	So when I can put these two lights together,
408000	414000	I can get another one called Intensity Difference.
414000	418000	That is to say, I can let my Intensity Difference,
418000	426000	to measure the noise of this two-mode intensity is the lowest.
426000	429000	This may be a bit abstract.
429000	432000	I'll show you some data later.
432000	436000	If you don't quite understand, you can ask me again.
439000	443000	The preliminary introduction is,
443000	450000	I spent 20 minutes to introduce what happened.
450000	454000	I have introduced the background knowledge needed at the beginning.
454000	458000	If no one has any questions, I will continue.
458000	460000	OK.
460000	463000	How do we make this?
463000	464000	Excuse me.
464000	466000	You just said that the intangles,
466000	470000	How is it produced?
470000	477000	Is it also produced by something?
477000	481000	Is it produced by intangles?
481000	483000	We don't use intangles.
483000	486000	We use Rubidium Vapor.
486000	489000	Rubidium is a 2A group.
489000	493000	The Rubinium Nitrate.
493000	495000	Rubinium Nitrate.
495000	499000	We will hit a very strong laser beam.
499000	505000	This strong laser beam will have a non-linear interaction with a very weak beam.
505000	509000	Then produce another conjugate,
509000	513000	another intangle beam.
513000	516000	How are they produced?
516000	518000	I will introduce a little later.
518000	522000	How do they produce this twin beam?
522000	526000	I want to talk about 4-Way Missing.
526000	528000	4-Way Missing.
528000	532000	Total is 4 beams.
532000	535000	But we only put 2 beams in.
535000	538000	Then 3 beams will be produced.
538000	541000	There will be a more detailed explanation of the pattern later.
541000	543000	How is this produced?
543000	545000	Thank you.
545000	548000	Can I ask a question?
549000	553000	What is 4WM?
553000	555000	4 is 4.
555000	558000	W is 4-Way Missing.
558000	562000	Or translated into Chinese,
562000	565000	it is 4-Way Missing.
565000	567000	4-Way Missing.
567000	571000	I should say that it is the abbreviation of this.
571000	574000	My standard abbreviation.
574000	579000	Does it mean that 4 waves are mixed together?
579000	581000	Yes.
581000	583000	But you only have 2 beams.
583000	588000	I will show you a picture of the conjugate later.
588000	591000	Then everyone will be confused.
591000	595000	Did you just say that these 2 beams are added or subtracted?
595000	598000	Added.
598000	602000	Because they are...
602000	606000	Actually, they said that the intensity of the beam is 1.
606000	609000	Then the intensity of the beam will have a magnification ratio.
609000	613000	The magnification ratio is G.
613000	616000	So the light coming out is G.
616000	620000	Then the other conjugate beam is G-1.
620000	624000	So they even put that...
624000	626000	Originally it was Coherent State.
626000	628000	If it has a magnification effect,
628000	630000	it will become Thermal State.
630000	634000	That is to say, it is no longer the original laser beam.
634000	636000	It is a very messy light.
636000	639000	After the two conjugates are subtracted,
639000	644000	you will see the effect of the twin.
644000	646000	They become very messy together.
646000	648000	But when they are subtracted,
648000	653000	they will see that they are actually very beautiful and become messy together.
653000	655000	OK, thank you.
655000	656000	May I ask a question?
656000	660000	So what is the power of these laser beams?
660000	665000	My pump power is about 750mW.
665000	666000	It's quite big.
666000	670000	Of course, it can't be compared to super fast light.
670000	673000	We are continuous wave.
673000	676000	OK, you also answered my second question.
676000	678000	Sorry, let's continue.
678000	683000	The result we did is...
683000	688000	There is a relatively influential improvement.
688000	693000	Our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.
693000	699000	When you want to look at the magnification compression,
699000	701000	the lower the frequency,
701000	705000	the greater the interference in other environments.
705000	707000	For example, you walk over there.
707000	709000	Or you have a call coming in.
709000	714000	These may have some interference in your system.
714000	719000	Then it will cause you to be unable to see the so-called squeeze light at a very low frequency.
719000	722000	That is, the compression of the magnification.
722000	727000	Even if there is a car driving on the main road,
727000	729000	it will have a great impact.
729000	735000	So our lab is doing experiments in such a deep basement.
735000	738000	Our result is...
738000	742000	Anyway, our previous records have always been in the range of Kilohertz.
742000	749000	In recent years, we have broken through the following three orders.
749000	754000	From Kilohertz down to about 1,000 times to a few Hertz.
754000	758000	You can see the effect of the magnification compression.
758000	764000	Especially like the gravitational wave measurement I introduced at the beginning.
764000	768000	It must be seen at a very low frequency.
768000	775000	Because theoretical mathematicians have calculated the magnitude of the gravitational wave.
775000	780000	So if you can only see the squeeze light of Kilohertz,
780000	785000	you can't use it to do these gravitational wave measurements.
785000	789000	So in the past ten years,
789000	799000	this squeeze light has been developed in such a way that it can still have this effect at a very low frequency.
799000	804000	In the future, it will be possible to measure the gravitational wave.
804000	809000	In the result of our experiment,
809000	813000	there will be some applications in image processing.
813000	818000	Because you want to see if you can pass the image through a very weak light.
818000	822000	Then maybe you can do some biological experiments.
822000	824000	A lot of low light hits your sample.
824000	828000	Then you can get rid of these impurities.
828000	830000	Then you can see the signal very clearly.
830000	835000	So it has some applications in biology.
835000	838000	Then it can even do some correction.
838000	842000	And it's a quantum correction.
842000	845000	Then I will continue to introduce it later.
845000	848000	This is our 4-way missing.
848000	853000	So on the right, we are.
853000	856000	This is our wafer cell.
856000	858000	I drew the picture like this.
858000	861000	The length of this wafer cell is about two centimeters long.
861000	869000	Then the diameter is about an inch.
869000	871000	Anyway, it's a very small cell.
871000	875000	Then you put a very strong pump beam in.
875000	880000	Then the strength of this pump beam is about 450 mW.
880000	887000	Then it will interact with the other very weak beam.
887000	889000	Then you look at the link map on the left.
889000	892000	There are a lot of links in it.
892000	895000	But we only care about the link that we will call.
895000	899000	This lambda type link.
899000	903000	It should be quite common to do quantum computing.
903000	906000	There may be something very famous in quantum computing.
906000	908000	It's called EIT.
908000	911000	Slow light storage technology.
911000	914000	Basically, it's quite similar to that.
914000	917000	For example, you hit a very strong pump beam.
917000	919000	Very strong pump beam.
919000	922000	Then it will interact with your probe beam.
922000	924000	Then this very strong pump beam.
924000	928000	It also interacts with the ground state on the other side.
928000	932000	Then because of energy conservation.
932000	937000	So it releases the fourth conjugate beam.
937000	940000	So you only hit two beams in.
940000	943000	But in a continuous operation.
943000	947000	It actually acts like there are four waves interacting with each other.
947000	950000	Two of the four waves are the same pump beam.
950000	954000	So this pump beam is at the same time as these two ground states.
954000	959000	What you want to see is that.
959000	962000	In addition to energy conservation.
962000	966000	It actually has to meet the other momentum conservation.
966000	970000	Then we usually don't talk about momentum conservation.
970000	972000	We also talk about phase matching.
972000	977000	In other words, this wave pump beam.
977000	980000	In addition to interacting with the probe beam.
980000	981000	The momentum inside.
981000	985000	That is to say, the pump beam and the probe beam have a very small angle.
985000	987000	About 0.3, 0.4 degrees.
987000	991000	Then we have four waves.
991000	995000	So the total momentum of this pump beam.
995000	996000	There will be two.
996000	999000	Then it will produce another conjugate beam.
999000	1001000	So it's in the other direction.
1001000	1002000	Then you see.
1002000	1005000	When you have any phase fluctuation.
1005000	1008000	Or any frequency fluctuation.
1008000	1011000	It has to meet this.
1011000	1014000	Momentum energy conservation rate.
1014000	1019000	So any fluctuation has to make it consistent.
1019000	1022000	So this is a bit.
1022000	1025000	This is a more general way to explain.
1025000	1028000	Because they have to be energy conservative.
1028000	1029000	Momentum conservation.
1029000	1032000	So any fluctuation.
1032000	1035000	The fluctuations must be consistent.
1035000	1037000	In order to meet this condition at the same time.
1037000	1040000	That's how it produces the twin beam.
1040000	1044000	This is some of our experimental conditions.
1044000	1046000	Then you will see this delta.
1046000	1047000	Big delta.
1047000	1050000	This big delta is about 1.3GHz.
1050000	1053000	It's a pretty far detune.
1053000	1056000	Because of our experiment.
1056000	1058000	In fact, our entire group is called.
1058000	1060000	Laser cooling and tracking.
1060000	1063000	Our group is called.
1063000	1069000	Laser cooling and tracking team.
1069000	1070000	Research team is like this.
1070000	1073000	One of us.
1073000	1075000	Our big boss is.
1075000	1076000	We have a big boss.
1076000	1078000	Then there are four teachers below.
1078000	1080000	Then I did this.
1080000	1083000	The only thing is to do it with heat source.
1083000	1086000	This heat source is about 120°C.
1086000	1087000	We have to heat it up.
1087000	1089000	Then let it become a vapor.
1089000	1091000	So at the beginning, someone just asked.
1091000	1093000	Are we using crystal or what?
1093000	1095000	We are not using crystal.
1095000	1096000	If you use crystal.
1096000	1100000	There are other.
1100000	1102000	Also doing.
1102000	1105000	Or doing that kind of twin beam.
1105000	1107000	In fact, they are doing single mode.
1107000	1110000	Anyway, crystal can also be used to do that.
1110000	1111000	Squeeze line.
1111000	1113000	But.
1113000	1116000	Anyway, some principles are still a bit different.
1116000	1118000	We might use.
1118000	1123000	K3 is the third stage.
1123000	1127000	If it is crystal, it may be K2.
1127000	1131000	There are some differences in nature.
1131000	1132000	That's right.
1132000	1133000	Then the next one is.
1133000	1134000	We are several.
1134000	1137000	This one is about ten years ago.
1137000	1139000	Experimental results.
1139000	1141000	That.
1141000	1142000	You will see that.
1142000	1143000	Ten years ago.
1143000	1145000	We actually used TESAFA laser.
1145000	1147000	To do this experiment.
1147000	1148000	That.
1148000	1149000	TESAFA laser is.
1149000	1152000	Its feature is that it is very expensive.
1152000	1154000	That's about.
1154000	1155000	One or two decades ago.
1155000	1156000	We.
1156000	1158000	Buy a TESAFA.
1158000	1159000	About.
1159000	1160000	More than 200,000 dollars.
1160000	1161000	Then now it is more than 200,000.
1161000	1162000	Or its.
1162000	1163000	Power becomes stronger.
1163000	1164000	That's right.
1164000	1165000	You see.
1165000	1166000	The company is doing this experiment.
1166000	1168000	You need to have one.
1168000	1169000	Very expensive.
1169000	1170000	TESAFA laser.
1170000	1171000	More than 200,000 dollars.
1171000	1172000	This.
1172000	1175000	This is not practical at all.
1175000	1176000	So.
1176000	1177000	We started to develop.
1177000	1178000	Cheaper.
1178000	1179000	Then again.
1179000	1180000	It is a dilutable.
1180000	1182000	Laser light source.
1182000	1183000	That's it.
1183000	1186000	What about the TESAFA laser we used at the beginning?
1186000	1187000	Go again.
1187000	1190000	When doing this low-frequency quantization.
1190000	1191000	There is a.
1191000	1192000	Ah.
1193000	1196000	Should I talk about this first?
1196000	1198000	Experimental map.
1198000	1199000	What does it mean?
1199000	1200000	That is.
1200000	1203000	Here you will see the blue line here.
1203000	1206000	The blue line here is the so-called shot noise.
1206000	1207000	Then I just started.
1207000	1208000	Not to say.
1208000	1209000	Laser light.
1209000	1210000	It is coherent state.
1210000	1211000	What about coherent state?
1211000	1212000	In fact.
1212000	1214000	One of its features is that.
1214000	1215000	Its impurities.
1215000	1216000	Will not change.
1216000	1219000	According to the frequency of your measurement.
1219000	1220000	That is to say.
1220000	1221000	You are measuring.
1221000	1223000	You are now inserting a light.
1223000	1224000	This.
1224000	1225000	This picture has pink.
1225000	1226000	This light.
1226000	1227000	Insert.
1227000	1228000	Then you use this photodial.
1228000	1229000	To detect this.
1229000	1231000	Then send it in.
1231000	1233000	Spectrum analyzer.
1233000	1234000	That is.
1234000	1235000	Spectrum.
1235000	1236000	Spectrum analyzer.
1236000	1237000	That.
1237000	1239000	This spectrum analyzer will tell you.
1239000	1240000	This.
1240000	1244000	How much is the impurity of the frequency of this light?
1244000	1246000	If you insert this light.
1246000	1247000	It's a laser.
1247000	1248000	It's a coherent state.
1248000	1249000	Its impurities.
1249000	1250000	Its impurities.
1250000	1251000	Will not change.
1251000	1253000	According to the frequency of your measurement.
1253000	1255000	Just like this blue light.
1255000	1256000	The blue.
1256000	1258000	The curve is like this.
1258000	1260000	We insert a light.
1260000	1262000	Then use a beam splitter.
1262000	1264000	Divide this light into half.
1264000	1266000	Then divide it into half.
1266000	1268000	Then subtract these two.
1268000	1271000	Then do the measurement of this impurity.
1271000	1273000	Then why do these two subtract?
1273000	1274000	Because.
1274000	1275000	You can also.
1275000	1276000	You can only measure one light.
1276000	1277000	That is.
1277000	1279000	You can also get a similar answer.
1279000	1281000	It's just the impurity power.
1281000	1282000	If you measure one light.
1282000	1284000	The impurity power will be halved.
1284000	1286000	If you measure two lights.
1286000	1288000	The impurity power will be doubled.
1288000	1289000	That's it.
1289000	1290000	There is another one.
1290000	1292000	The reason we want to divide it into two lights.
1292000	1293000	That is.
1293000	1295000	In fact, although the laser light is a coherent state.
1295000	1297000	But it's in the low frequency.
1297000	1299000	There are all kinds of impurities.
1299000	1300000	Will come in.
1300000	1302000	If you don't use two lights.
1302000	1303000	If you don't use two lights.
1303000	1305000	You can't put those.
1305000	1307000	The so-called classical impurity.
1307000	1309000	Or the technical impurity.
1309000	1310000	Eliminate it.
1310000	1311000	So you have to use.
1311000	1312000	Use one light.
1312000	1313000	Divide it into two.
1313000	1315000	Then do the subtraction.
1315000	1317000	Then measure the impurity.
1317000	1318000	This is the so-called.
1318000	1319000	I will talk about it later.
1319000	1321000	It is the so-called shot noise.
1321000	1323000	It's called the mega shot.
1323000	1324000	Its frequency.
1324000	1326000	It should always be flat.
1326000	1328000	This is a.
1328000	1330000	Our field is a very.
1330000	1331000	Ah.
1331000	1333000	I didn't know this was a common thing before I came in.
1333000	1334000	Then now.
1334000	1336000	Okay, this is the coherent state.
1336000	1338000	The impurity must be.
1338000	1339000	The so-called.
1339000	1341000	The so-called two-color frequency has changed.
1341000	1343000	So it's the so-called shot noise.
1343000	1345000	What about the red light?
1345000	1347000	This is what I just produced.
1347000	1349000	Glow beam.
1349000	1351000	I am not.
1351000	1352000	I am now.
1352000	1354000	To be more specific.
1354000	1356000	The setting of our experiment is to say.
1356000	1359000	I hit a pump beam.
1359000	1360000	Then.
1360000	1363000	Hit another glow beam.
1363000	1364000	Then these two.
1364000	1366000	Intensity.
1366000	1367000	The pump beam.
1367000	1370000	Its intensity is about 10,000 times as strong as the glow beam.
1370000	1371000	Yes.
1371000	1374000	Then it goes through this non-linear.
1374000	1375000	Element.
1375000	1377000	The element plus.
1377000	1378000	After the effect.
1378000	1380000	It will produce this glow beam.
1380000	1382000	This glow beam is amplified.
1382000	1383000	Yes.
1383000	1385000	Then it will also produce another one.
1385000	1387000	Conjugate beam.
1387000	1388000	So they are a twin.
1388000	1391000	Then after these two lights are cut off.
1392000	1393000	I call it.
1393000	1394000	Intensity.
1394000	1395000	Difference.
1395000	1396000	Squeezing.
1396000	1398000	Or in other words, it is squeeze.
1398000	1400000	In other words, it is squeeze light.
1400000	1401000	Then these two lights.
1401000	1403000	That is to say.
1403000	1404000	We will.
1404000	1406000	To control the light of this input.
1406000	1409000	Then let the power of the output light.
1409000	1411000	With these two lights.
1411000	1414000	The power of these two shot noise lights is exactly the same.
1414000	1415000	Then you will see.
1415000	1416000	When we.
1416000	1418000	If I have the so-called.
1418000	1420000	Squeeze light.
1420000	1421000	Squeeze light.
1421000	1423000	My two intensity.
1423000	1424000	Difference.
1424000	1427000	This is weaker than my shot noise.
1427000	1428000	Sorry.
1428000	1429000	Let me ask.
1429000	1432000	So the frequency of your four lights should be.
1432000	1434000	What is the range?
1434000	1435000	Because.
1435000	1438000	So the frequency below you should be.
1438000	1440000	The frequency of the big noise.
1440000	1441000	Right?
1441000	1442000	Ah.
1442000	1444000	It should not be called big noise.
1444000	1445000	Because these two.
1445000	1447000	The frequency of these two lights is different.
1447000	1448000	Yes.
1448000	1449000	You look at the left picture.
1449000	1450000	Have you seen this cross-section?
1450000	1451000	Yes.
1451000	1453000	So you have two pink lights.
1453000	1456000	Is it a wave of visible light?
1456000	1457000	He.
1457000	1459000	In fact, he is a distant infrared light.
1459000	1461000	Light of 795nm.
1461000	1462000	Ah.
1462000	1463000	Yes.
1463000	1464000	So that.
1464000	1465000	That is also right.
1465000	1467000	A few hundred terahertz.
1467000	1468000	Right?
1468000	1469000	Yes.
1469000	1470000	So you.
1470000	1471000	So you just.
1471000	1474000	The next page.
1474000	1475000	That one.
1475000	1476000	Um.
1476000	1478000	The following frequency is kilohertz.
1478000	1480000	Is it the difference between the two?
1480000	1481000	My.
1481000	1482000	The problem is.
1482000	1483000	Is.
1483000	1484000	The frequency on both sides.
1484000	1485000	You.
1485000	1486000	You want to see.
1486000	1487000	You.
1487000	1488000	You have a side wave now.
1488000	1489000	Correct.
1489000	1491000	Then this side wave has a side wave frequency.
1491000	1492000	Right?
1492000	1493000	But I.
1493000	1494000	I am now.
1494000	1495000	I.
1495000	1496000	I'm talking about.
1496000	1497000	These noise.
1497000	1498000	To do.
1498000	1499000	Negative analysis.
1499000	1500000	Of.
1500000	1502000	Noise frequency.
1502000	1503000	Not to say.
1503000	1505000	My whole side wave.
1505000	1506000	What is the frequency?
1506000	1507000	Not this frequency.
1507000	1508000	But this noise.
1508000	1509000	He has his own frequency.
1509000	1510000	He has.
1510000	1511000	So.
1511000	1512000	So you just.
1512000	1513000	Your next page.
1513000	1514000	The noise.
1514000	1515000	Your next page.
1515000	1516000	Spectrum is.
1516000	1517000	These noise.
1517000	1518000	Spectrum.
1518000	1519000	Not the light itself.
1519000	1520000	Spectrum.
1520000	1521000	Yes.
1521000	1522000	That is.
1522000	1523000	His noise.
1523000	1524000	Just make sure.
1524000	1525000	Um.
1525000	1526000	Good.
1526000	1527000	Thank you.
1527000	1528000	Continue.
1528000	1529000	Because like.
1529000	1530000	Light.
1530000	1531000	Light has his.
1531000	1532000	His distribution.
1532000	1533000	So.
1534000	1535000	Anyway, he.
1535000	1536000	He actually.
1536000	1537000	Anyway, he.
1537000	1538000	He.
1538000	1539000	There will be a.
1539000	1540000	Distribution of noise.
1540000	1541000	That.
1541000	1542000	If it is.
1542000	1543000	His distribution of noise.
1543000	1544000	That is to say.
1544000	1545000	His frequency.
1545000	1546000	The noise.
1546000	1547000	The power should be the same.
1547000	1548000	This.
1548000	1549000	That.
1549000	1550000	Uh.
1550000	1551000	Here.
1551000	1552000	For missing noise.
1552000	1553000	That is.
1553000	1554000	I.
1554000	1555000	I do.
1555000	1556000	Intensity difference.
1556000	1557000	When.
1557000	1558000	The noise.
1558000	1559000	That.
1559000	1560000	Uh.
1560000	1561000	Db to.
1561000	1562000	Units.
1562000	1563000	Every three db is.
1563000	1564000	Cut in half.
1564000	1565000	That is.
1565000	1566000	So that means.
1566000	1567000	You look at this.
1567000	1568000	Red.
1568000	1569000	This.
1569000	1570000	Blue.
1570000	1573000	The 8db that is.
1573000	1575000	Every three db is cut in half.
1575000	1577000	These 3db is half.
1577000	1578000	Another half.
1578000	1579000	So, the rest of the 8th.
1579000	1580000	is.
1580000	1581000	About.
1581000	1582000	10 percent.
1582000	1583000	The noise only.
1583000	1584000	That is.
1584000	1585000	If i originally had.
1585000	1586000	This.
1586000	1587000	This.
1587000	1588000	The noise of the laser beam.
1588000	1589000	If i was 1.
1589000	1590000	That red.
1590000	1591000	The noise of this kernel.
1591000	1592000	Only left.
1592000	1593000	Original.
1593000	1594000	Only 17%.
1594000	1595000	That is.
1595000	1596000	Its noise is.
1596000	1597000	In fact, it is very weak.
1597000	1598000	That's right.
1598000	1599000	The focus here.
1599000	1600000	Is to say.
1600000	1601000	You can see that.
1601000	1602000	Hey.
1602000	1603000	At low frequency.
1603000	1605000	There are some small peaks here.
1605000	1607000	In fact, this small peak is.
1607000	1608000	This.
1608000	1609000	Very expensive.
1609000	1610000	There is a very stupid.
1610000	1613000	The disadvantages of the TESLA-5 laser.
1613000	1615000	Because it has cavities inside.
1615000	1617000	That this cavity will.
1617000	1619000	Causing it to have these resonance.
1619000	1620000	The noise comes out.
1620000	1621000	So.
1621000	1623000	When you are at low frequency.
1623000	1625000	Will be affected by these cavities.
1625000	1627000	You can't see it.
1627000	1628000	Very low frequency.
1628000	1630000	The compression of quantum noise.
1630000	1631000	That's right.
1631000	1632000	Let's say.
1632000	1633000	Ah.
1633000	1634000	We are.
1635000	1636000	When doing experiments.
1636000	1637000	Sometimes put the laser.
1638000	1639000	Will lock the laser.
1639000	1640000	What does it mean to lock the laser?
1640000	1642000	Is to make its frequency fixed.
1642000	1644000	Will not float around.
1644000	1645000	Or.
1645000	1647000	Is to make its bandwidth narrow.
1647000	1649000	The meaning of narrow bandwidth.
1649000	1650000	That is to say.
1650000	1651000	I have a sine now.
1651000	1654000	Is your sine a very simple sine?
1654000	1655000	Or is your sine.
1655000	1656000	Sine or.
1656000	1658000	There is a flat sine.
1658000	1659000	That is to say.
1659000	1660000	This flat.
1660000	1662000	That's what I'm talking about.
1662000	1663000	Right.
1663000	1664000	This is flat.
1664000	1665000	Correct.
1665000	1666000	Ah.
1667000	1668000	Ah.
1668000	1669000	Probably like this.
1669000	1670000	So.
1670000	1671000	So.
1671000	1672000	There is a picture here.
1672000	1673000	That is to say.
1673000	1674000	Let's measure the TESLA-5.
1674000	1675000	More than 200,000 dollars.
1675000	1676000	TESLA-5 laser.
1676000	1677000	When the line width.
1677000	1678000	You will find that.
1678000	1680000	This blue dash 9.
1680000	1681000	Is.
1681000	1682000	That is.
1682000	1683000	When we do experiments.
1683000	1684000	We just.
1684000	1685000	Anyway, just hit the light.
1685000	1686000	Hit in.
1686000	1687000	Fiber.
1687000	1688000	Then go.
1688000	1689000	To measure its.
1689000	1690000	Line width.
1690000	1691000	Correct.
1691000	1692000	You will see that it is probably.
1692000	1693000	Maybe a few.
1693000	1695000	Hundreds or dozens of kHz.
1695000	1696000	Ah.
1696000	1697000	The blue dash 9.
1697000	1698000	Its width is probably.
1699000	1700000	Maybe dozens of kHz.
1700000	1701000	So.
1701000	1702000	So narrow.
1702000	1703000	It's pretty beautiful.
1703000	1704000	But.
1704000	1706000	When we lock up the laser.
1707000	1708000	It becomes.
1708000	1709000	More noisy.
1710000	1711000	This is.
1711000	1712000	The disadvantage of TESLA-5 laser is.
1712000	1713000	You lock up.
1713000	1714000	In fact.
1714000	1715000	Your.
1715000	1716000	Your frequency is fixed.
1716000	1717000	But.
1717000	1718000	The quality of your laser.
1718000	1719000	Is getting worse.
1720000	1721000	Correct.
1721000	1722000	Then you have to put it.
1723000	1724000	Line width becomes narrower.
1724000	1725000	In fact.
1725000	1727000	It will be quite complicated.
1727000	1728000	Then we look at another.
1728000	1729000	Red curve.
1730000	1731000	This red curve is.
1731000	1732000	The red line is.
1732000	1733000	2G TESLA.
1734000	1735000	Then you haven't locked up.
1735000	1736000	It's like this.
1736000	1737000	It's dash 9.
1737000	1738000	Red dash 9.
1738000	1739000	Is.
1739000	1740000	About a few.
1740000	1741000	Megahertz.
1741000	1742000	So wide.
1742000	1743000	But when we lock up.
1743000	1744000	After.
1744000	1745000	This is the red line.
1745000	1746000	It becomes very narrow.
1748000	1749000	It's probably a few.
1749000	1750000	Probably.
1750000	1751000	Even less than.
1751000	1752000	A kHz.
1752000	1753000	So narrow.
1753000	1754000	Line width.
1754000	1755000	So.
1755000	1756000	For 2G TESLA.
1756000	1757000	It may be.
1757000	1758000	Our TESLA.
1758000	1759000	2G TESLA.
1759000	1760000	Probably.
1760000	1761000	So.
1761000	1762000	Relative to.
1763000	1764000	Compared with TESLA.
1764000	1765000	It's a lot cheaper.
1765000	1766000	Probably.
1766000	1767000	One TESLA.
1767000	1768000	You can buy.
1768000	1769000	About nine.
1769000	1770000	2G TESLA.
1770000	1771000	Like this.
1772000	1773000	But 2G TESLA.
1773000	1774000	It's actually.
1774000	1775000	Its.
1775000	1776000	Light is weaker.
1776000	1777000	Correct.
1777000	1778000	Then this is another team.
1778000	1779000	In.
1779000	1780000	Australian.
1780000	1781000	Experimental research.
1781000	1782000	Then he is.
1782000	1783000	I just forgot who asked.
1783000	1784000	Is.
1784000	1785000	They are using.
1785000	1786000	Crystal.
1786000	1787000	To do.
1787000	1788000	Then their method.
1788000	1789000	Not called.
1789000	1790000	O.
1790000	1791000	P.
1791000	1792000	O.
1792000	1793000	O.
1793000	1794000	P.
1794000	1795000	O.
1795000	1796000	What is it?
1796000	1797000	Important.
1797000	1798000	Correct.
1798000	1799000	This is.
1799000	1800000	Another way to use.
1800000	1801000	To do.
1801000	1802000	Squeeze line.
1802000	1803000	Then they.
1803000	1804000	This.
1804000	1805000	This picture on the left.
1805000	1806000	You see this black.
1806000	1807000	This.
1807000	1808000	This straight line.
1808000	1809000	The so-called.
1809000	1810000	Shot noise.
1810000	1811000	Shot noise.
1811000	1812000	I just said.
1812000	1813000	Laser light noise.
1813000	1814000	Then you see.
1814000	1815000	There are other.
1815000	1816000	Very messy line.
1816000	1817000	There are red lines.
1817000	1818000	Blue line.
1818000	1819000	Red line.
1819000	1820000	Black line.
1820000	1821000	Blue line.
1821000	1822000	Then you see.
1822000	1823000	There is a power here.
1823000	1824000	That is to say.
1824000	1825000	His power.
1825000	1826000	From 6.
1826000	1827000	From 6.
1827000	1828000	Microwave.
1828000	1829000	Down to.
1829000	1830000	0.7.
1830000	1831000	Microwave.
1831000	1832000	Down to a few.
1832000	1833000	Power.
1833000	1834000	When.
1834000	1835000	You see.
1835000	1836000	His.
1836000	1837000	Miscellaneous.
1837000	1838000	Low frequency.
1838000	1839000	When.
1839000	1840000	Getting weaker and weaker.
1840000	1841000	Correct.
1841000	1842000	That.
1842000	1843000	In fact, this piece of paper.
1843000	1844000	He.
1844000	1845000	I don't know.
1845000	1846000	Why.
1846000	1847000	Will be like this.
1847000	1848000	They are.
1848000	1849000	A record.
1849000	1850000	That is to say.
1850000	1851000	They can.
1851000	1852000	Do.
1852000	1853000	Squeeze line.
1853000	1854000	Then.
1854000	1855000	It's under 280 Hz.
1855000	1856000	That.
1856000	1857000	That.
1857000	1858000	In fact.
1858000	1859000	We already know.
1859000	1860000	Why.
1860000	1861000	Correct.
1861000	1862000	Then he.
1862000	1863000	Here because.
1863000	1864000	It's also his own problem.
1864000	1865000	So there will be some.
1865000	1866000	Some.
1866000	1867000	Peak.
1867000	1868000	Noise.
1868000	1869000	Is particularly strong.
1869000	1870000	Of course.
1870000	1871000	These are not important.
1871000	1872000	The point is.
1872000	1873000	He can be very low.
1873000	1874000	Very low frequency.
1874000	1875000	More than 200 Hz.
1875000	1876000	Can still.
1876000	1877000	There is.
1877000	1878000	The effect of compression.
1878000	1879000	That.
1879000	1880000	Blue line.
1880000	1881000	With.
1881000	1882000	Not.
1882000	1883000	The red line and the black line.
1883000	1884000	Is.
1884000	1885000	At low frequency.
1885000	1886000	Because there are a lot of.
1886000	1887000	Classic noise.
1887000	1888000	Basic noise.
1888000	1890000	It's hard to see.
1890000	1891000	Noise compression.
1891000	1892000	Effect.
1892000	1893000	Especially.
1893000	1894000	When he.
1894000	1895000	When the bubble is very strong.
1895000	1896000	Correct.
1896000	1897000	That.
1897000	1898000	This.
1898000	1899000	Next.
1899000	1900000	These are.
1900000	1901000	That.
1901000	1902000	Is.
1902000	1903000	Go.
1903000	1904000	To.
1904000	1905000	Next weekend.
1905000	1906000	To go to California.
1906000	1907000	The meeting.
1907000	1909000	The main content of the report.
1909000	1910000	Correct.
1910000	1911000	That.
1911000	1912000	Is.
1912000	1913000	Our.
1913000	1914000	For missing.
1914000	1915000	Setup.
1915000	1916000	Is.
1916000	1917000	The device of time.
1917000	1918000	We have a.
1918000	1919000	Second-level thunderstorm.
1919000	1920000	That.
1920000	1921000	Second-level thunderstorm.
1921000	1922000	Is very cheap.
1922000	1923000	Not very cheap.
1923000	1924000	Is about.
1924000	1925000	$20,000 to $30,000.
1925000	1926000	Then we put.
1926000	1927000	Part of the light.
1927000	1928000	Out.
1928000	1929000	Then.
1929000	1930000	Double pass LN.
1930000	1931000	Then.
1931000	1932000	Why.
1932000	1933000	Double pass LN.
1933000	1934000	Because.
1934000	1935000	This LN.
1935000	1936000	Is.
1936000	1937000	About 1.5GHz.
1937000	1938000	He will put.
1938000	1939000	Light frequency.
1939000	1940000	Shift.
1940000	1941000	1.5GHz.
1941000	1942000	That.
1942000	1943000	You put it.
1943000	1944000	Reflect it again.
1944000	1945000	After coming back.
1945000	1946000	You will get.
1946000	1947000	About.
1947000	1948000	3GHz.
1948000	1949000	Shift.
1949000	1950000	That.
1950000	1951000	3GHz.
1951000	1952000	Shift.
1952000	1953000	With me.
1953000	1954000	The front.
1954000	1955000	This connection.
1955000	1956000	You see.
1956000	1957000	Pink.
1957000	1958000	This is my original light.
1958000	1959000	Pump beam.
1959000	1960000	Pump beam.
1960000	1961000	That.
1961000	1962000	I double pass LN.
1962000	1963000	Then I got.
1963000	1964000	Pump beam.
1964000	1965000	Then.
1965000	1966000	We can start.
1966000	1967000	Experiment.
1967000	1968000	But.
1968000	1969000	This is just my.
1969000	1970000	In fact.
1970000	1971000	Pump beam.
1971000	1972000	Generate.
1972000	1973000	The way.
1973000	1974000	Then we put.
1974000	1975000	Part of the light.
1975000	1976000	Out.
1976000	1977000	That.
1977000	1978000	Part of the light.
1978000	1979000	Is.
1979000	1980000	To lock the laser.
1980000	1981000	That.
1981000	1982000	This is.
1982000	1983000	Variation.
1983000	1984000	Spectroscopy.
1984000	1985000	One.
1985000	1986000	Locking the laser.
1986000	1987000	Light wave.
1987000	1988000	The way.
1988000	1989000	That.
1989000	1990000	You may.
1990000	1991000	More often.
1991000	1992000	But.
1992000	1993000	It's another way.
1993000	1994000	But.
1994000	1995000	In fact, this way.
1995000	1996000	Variation.
1996000	1997000	Spectroscopy.
1997000	1998000	Is.
1998000	1999000	Very easy.
1999000	2000000	That.
2000000	2001000	It's very simple.
2001000	2002000	You can go.
2002000	2003000	Your laser beam.
2003000	2004000	That.
2004000	2005000	Light wave.
2005000	2006000	Make it.
2006000	2007000	Very low.
2007000	2008000	Low to.
2008000	2009000	Hundreds of.
2009000	2010000	Hundred hertz.
2010000	2011000	Right.
2011000	2012000	That.
2012000	2013000	It's pretty good.
2013000	2014000	The way.
2014000	2015000	That.
2015000	2016000	If you have any questions.
2016000	2017000	You can.
2017000	2018000	You can continue to ask.
2018000	2019000	Anyway.
2019000	2020000	We put this.
2020000	2021000	Locking.
2021000	2022000	Signal.
2022000	2023000	Send it back.
2023000	2024000	Secondary laser.
2024000	2025000	Control current.
2025000	2026000	Then you can.
2026000	2027000	Its.
2027000	2028000	The thread of the laser.
2028000	2029000	Shorten it.
2029000	2030000	That.
2030000	2031000	In fact.
2031000	2032000	These are not difficult.
2032000	2033000	This experiment.
2033000	2034000	Probably.
2034000	2035000	If you want to set it up.
2035000	2036000	Probably.
2036000	2037000	As long as.
2037000	2038000	One.
2038000	2039000	Month.
2039000	2040000	You can set it all up.
2040000	2041000	Right.
2041000	2042000	That.
2042000	2043000	Like our group.
2043000	2044000	A lot.
2044000	2045000	Doing PTC.
2045000	2046000	That.
2046000	2047000	Probably.
2047000	2048000	More than three or four years.
2048000	2049000	Not necessarily.
2049000	2050000	Right.
2050000	2051000	So this experiment.
2051000	2052000	Relatively.
2052000	2053000	Very.
2053000	2054000	Very.
2054000	2055000	Very simple.
2055000	2056000	Then we.
2056000	2057000	After the laser is locked.
2057000	2058000	We're going to take.
2058000	2059000	Another one.
2059000	2060000	Light.
2060000	2061000	There are about 30.
2061000	2062000	Minimum.
2062000	2063000	Light.
2063000	2064000	Put it in.
2064000	2065000	Amplifier.
2065000	2066000	This amplifier.
2066000	2067000	Also.
2067000	2068000	Relatively.
2068000	2069000	Very cheap.
2069000	2070000	This amplifier.
2070000	2071000	Only.
2071000	2072000	$3,000.
2072000	2073000	Right.
2073000	2074000	So.
2074000	2075000	The whole laser system.
2075000	2076000	Less.
2076000	2077000	Less than $30,000.
2077000	2078000	Right.
2078000	2079000	So.
2079000	2080000	For.
2080000	2081000	Taiwan.
2081000	2082000	Want to do this experiment.
2082000	2083000	Actually.
2083000	2084000	Is.
2084000	2085000	It's very likely.
2085000	2086000	That is to say.
2086000	2087000	You don't have to.
2087000	2088000	Spend $270,000.
2088000	2089000	To send.
2089000	2090000	One.
2090000	2091000	One.
2091000	2092000	You can do this experiment.
2092000	2093000	Right.
2093000	2094000	Then you usually have to do.
2094000	2095000	Non-linear.
2095000	2096000	Light-emitting experiments.
2096000	2097000	You usually need.
2097000	2098000	Very strong laser light.
2098000	2099000	Of course.
2099000	2100000	Very strong laser light.
2100000	2101000	Then the light source is good.
2101000	2102000	Then you will use.
2102000	2103000	Laser.
2103000	2104000	But.
2104000	2105000	We don't need it now.
2105000	2106000	We just need a.
2106000	2107000	Diode laser.
2107000	2108000	This magnifier.
2108000	2109000	This magnifier is called.
2109000	2110000	Tap Amplify.
2110000	2111000	You can get it.
2111000	2112000	Like.
2112000	2113000	Like the old TESLA.
2113000	2114000	The same strong light.
2114000	2115000	Is.
2115000	2116000	The light of 2W.
2116000	2117000	Right.
2117000	2118000	Then we put.
2118000	2119000	Just now.
2119000	2120000	The light of our double-paste LED.
2120000	2121000	This is called.
2121000	2122000	Probe.
2122000	2123000	Hit in.
2123000	2124000	Our.
2124000	2125000	Lubidium cell.
2125000	2126000	Then there is.
2126000	2127000	120 degrees C.
2127000	2128000	So high temperature.
2128000	2129000	Then combine.
2129000	2130000	This magnifier.
2130000	2131000	Tap Amplify.
2131000	2132000	This magnifier.
2132000	2133000	The light released.
2133000	2134000	Then actually.
2134000	2135000	I just said.
2135000	2136000	This magnifier.
2136000	2137000	This magnifier.
2137000	2138000	It is.
2138000	2139000	2W.
2139000	2140000	Output.
2140000	2141000	But.
2141000	2142000	In fact.
2142000	2143000	We really send in.
2143000	2144000	Only 750 mW.
2144000	2145000	0.75W.
2145000	2146000	Light.
2146000	2147000	0.75W light.
2147000	2148000	In fact.
2148000	2149000	It's enough for us to do experiments.
2149000	2150000	Then why.
2150000	2151000	Will lose so much.
2151000	2152000	In fact.
2152000	2153000	In fact.
2153000	2154000	We.
2154000	2155000	Is.
2155000	2156000	Most of them.
2156000	2157000	Their difficulty is.
2157000	2158000	This magnifier.
2158000	2159000	Although.
2159000	2160000	Only 3000.
2160000	2161000	But.
2161000	2162000	The light coming out.
2162000	2163000	Is a square light.
2163000	2164000	You can't.
2164000	2165000	Take it to do experiments.
2165000	2166000	Then you.
2166000	2167000	You have to.
2167000	2168000	Do some shaping.
2168000	2169000	These shapes.
2169000	2170000	Is.
2170000	2171000	From our high school.
2171000	2172000	Those light.
2172000	2173000	Is.
2173000	2174000	One-third.
2174000	2175000	Plus one-third of Q.
2175000	2176000	Plus one-third of F.
2176000	2177000	This light.
2177000	2178000	Concept.
2178000	2179000	You know.
2179000	2180000	How to put this.
2180000	2181000	Square light.
2181000	2182000	Form it.
2182000	2183000	Into.
2183000	2184000	A.
2184000	2185000	High-spin.
2185000	2186000	Correct.
2186000	2187000	So.
2187000	2188000	After the formation.
2188000	2189000	We.
2189000	2190000	Put the light into Fiber.
2190000	2191000	Like this.
2191000	2192000	Then come out.
2192000	2193000	Only about 750 mW.
2193000	2194000	Then these two lights.
2194000	2195000	Pump.
2195000	2196000	Plus pull.
2196000	2197000	Then there will be pull.
2197000	2198000	Conjugate.
2198000	2199000	That is.
2199000	2200000	This is our tradition.
2200000	2201000	Do.
2201000	2202000	That.
2202000	2203000	Pull and missing.
2203000	2204000	Then do.
2204000	2205000	Their.
2205000	2206000	Intensity difference.
2206000	2207000	Correct.
2207000	2208000	That.
2208000	2209000	The point is.
2209000	2210000	The point is.
2210000	2211000	How to do it.
2211000	2212000	Very low quality.
2212000	2213000	Magnifier.
2213000	2214000	Magnifier.
2214000	2215000	Then you will see.
2215000	2216000	This way.
2216000	2217000	Same.
2217000	2218000	This.
2218000	2219000	Dash 9.
2219000	2220000	Red Dash 9.
2220000	2221000	Is.
2221000	2222000	Shot noise.
2223000	2224000	Blue Dash 9.
2224000	2225000	Also shot noise.
2225000	2226000	But these two lights.
2226000	2227000	The.
2227000	2228000	Power.
2228000	2229000	Is different.
2229000	2230000	Red Dash 9.
2230000	2231000	This total power.
2231000	2232000	Is.
2232000	2233000	About.
2233000	2234000	130.
2234000	2235000	That.
2235000	2236000	About 130 mW.
2236000	2237000	That.
2237000	2238000	Blue.
2238000	2239000	Dash 9.
2239000	2240000	Its light.
2240000	2241000	About.
2241000	2242000	Only 17 mW.
2242000	2243000	That.
2243000	2244000	These two lights.
2244000	2245000	Why.
2245000	2246000	I want to do this comparison.
2246000	2247000	That is to say.
2247000	2248000	You see.
2248000	2249000	When its high frequency.
2249000	2250000	When dozens of TOS.
2250000	2251000	You see.
2251000	2252000	The quantum noise you see.
2252000	2253000	To say.
2253000	2254000	Is.
2254000	2255000	Quite consistent.
2255000	2256000	But when it's low frequency.
2256000	2257000	It's different.
2257000	2258000	Why.
2258000	2259000	Because.
2259000	2260000	You think about it.
2260000	2261000	That is to say.
2261000	2262000	When your light.
2262000	2263000	Getting weaker and weaker.
2263000	2264000	In fact.
2264000	2265000	It is.
2265000	2266000	When it's low frequency.
2266000	2267000	It will have a lot of.
2267000	2268000	classical.
2268000	2269000	Noise.
2269000	2270000	Or some.
2270000	2271000	Technical noise.
2271000	2272000	That.
2272000	2273000	You think about it.
2273000	2274000	Ah.
2274000	2275000	I just didn't say.
2275000	2276000	One thing.
2276000	2277000	Is.
2277000	2278000	What is vacuum.
2278000	2279000	Vacuum.
2279000	2280000	It is.
2280000	2281000	Powerful.
2281000	2282000	That.
2282000	2283000	Remember.
2283000	2284000	That is.
2284000	2285000	Simple harmonic.
2285000	2286000	Oscillation.
2286000	2287000	Didn't I tell you.
2287000	2288000	What.
2288000	2289000	N plus.
2289000	2290000	One-half.
2290000	2291000	H8.
2291000	2292000	Omega.
2292000	2293000	That is.
2293000	2294000	That.
2294000	2295000	SHM.
2295000	2296000	The energy.
2296000	2297000	That.
2297000	2298000	When N is equal to 0.
2298000	2299000	When vacuum.
2299000	2300000	There is still a power.
2300000	2301000	That.
2301000	2302000	When there is this energy.
2302000	2303000	It has its noise.
2303000	2304000	And.
2304000	2305000	Especially.
2305000	2306000	It is also a coherent state.
2306000	2307000	So.
2307000	2308000	When.
2308000	2309000	You don't have any light.
2309000	2310000	It is also a coherent state.
2310000	2311000	Because it is a very pure.
2311000	2312000	Very pure.
2312000	2313000	Coherent state.
2313000	2314000	Otherwise.
2314000	2315000	You just think about it.
2315000	2316000	When your power is getting weaker.
2316000	2317000	When it gets weaker.
2317000	2318000	Is it.
2318000	2319000	When it comes to the end.
2319000	2320000	Is it to be confined to vacuum.
2320000	2321000	When.
2321000	2322000	It.
2322000	2323000	There can't be any other noise.
2323000	2324000	Hello.
2324000	2325000	I have a question.
2325000	2326000	Okay.
2326000	2327000	You ask.
2327000	2328000	Um.
2328000	2329000	That is.
2329000	2330000	Although these four lines are different.
2330000	2331000	But he actually has a complete.
2331000	2332000	That is.
2332000	2333000	His four lines.
2333000	2334000	In the end at that.
2334000	2335000	Low frequency.
2335000	2336000	All over again.
2336000	2337000	That.
2337000	2338000	It looks a bit like.
2338000	2339000	That is.
2339000	2340000	You can still excite a lot.
2340000	2341000	Vacuum.
2341000	2342000	The mold is there.
2342000	2343000	That.
2343000	2344000	I have always had a question from the beginning.
2344000	2345000	Because I was just thinking.
2345000	2346000	Listen to see if you will speak.
2346000	2347000	But I really want to ask now.
2347000	2348000	That is.
2348000	2349000	Why do you use high temperature.
2349000	2350000	That is.
2350000	2351000	Not high temperature cavity.
2351000	2352000	Just use high temperature.
2352000	2353000	That.
2353000	2354000	That.
2354000	2355000	Medium gas.
2355000	2356000	If you make it.
2356000	2357000	Cloud.
2357000	2358000	Will it be suppressed?
2358000	2359000	This.
2359000	2360000	This.
2360000	2361000	This.
2361000	2362000	This.
2362000	2363000	This.
2363000	2364000	This.
2364000	2365000	This.
2365000	2366000	This.
2366000	2367000	This.
2367000	2368000	Listen to sure to that.
2368000	2369000	I think.
2369000	2370000	That is, ah.
2370000	2371000	The one.
2371000	2372000	Pro memory element.
2372000	2373000	Is there one easy way.
2373000	2374000	Erm.
2374000	2375000	The sensor you.
2375000	2376000	Sense...
2376000	2377000	Essence...
2377000	2378000	That's the sensor lightning.
2378000	2379000	It can hold thepot.
2379000	2380000	It can hold pot.
2380000	2381000	I.
2381000	2382000	Yeah.
2382000	2383000	The projector.
2383000	2384000	To the power to the power.
2384000	2385000	To the light source.
2385000	2386000	The crow.
2386000	2387000	The camera, the night...
2387000	2388000	You kinda.
2388000	2389000	The lighting, right.
2389000	2390000	Camera and настро the light.
2390000	2391000	The lighting and the smoke.
2391000	2392000	So.
2392000	2393000	The light sources.
2393000	2394000	The destination.
2394000	2395000	And the plus.
2395000	2396000	Is also the usual Three...
2396000	2397000	The.
2397000	2398000	Resolution.
2398000	2399000	Is your.
2399000	2400000	Resolution.
2400000	2401000	The bandwidth.
2401000	2402000	Low.
2402000	2403000	This will move backwards.
2403000	2404000	Keep moving backwards.
2404000	2405000	Keep moving backwards.
2405000	2406000	So if I can adjust it to a few hertz.
2406000	2407000	When.
2407000	2408000	Then you'll be in.
2408000	2409000	In.
2409000	2410000	About one or two hertz.
2410000	2411000	You'll see this.
2411000	2412000	One over F.
2412000	2413000	The noise.
2413000	2414000	So.
2414000	2415000	So.
2415000	2416000	So this.
2416000	2417000	It doesn't really matter.
2417000	2418000	That.
2418000	2419000	That's your resolution.
2419000	2420000	Is related.
2420000	2421000	Oh.
2421000	2422000	With your resolution.
2422000	2423000	With your resolution.
2423000	2424000	The bandwidth.
2424000	2425000	Is related.
2425000	2426000	Okay.
2426000	2427000	Okay.
2427000	2428000	Okay.
2428000	2429000	Okay.
2429000	2430000	Okay.
2430000	2431000	Okay.
2431000	2432000	Okay.
2432000	2433000	So.
2433000	2434000	So you can see.
2434000	2435000	The red line.
2435000	2436000	At low frequency.
2436000	2437000	Its value.
2437000	2438000	The noise.
2438000	2439000	Is only up to.
2439000	2440000	One point.
2440000	2441000	One point five kilohertz.
2441000	2442000	When the blue line.
2442000	2443000	This.
2443000	2444000	This.
2444000	2445000	This will be.
2445000	2446000	One kilohertz.
2446000	2447000	That's the one.
2447000	2448000	That.
2448000	2449000	That.
2449000	2450000	The Australian.
2450000	2451000	The Australian.
2451000	2452000	Paper.
2452000	2453000	That paper.
2453000	2454000	Is.
2454000	2455000	Is the same effect.
2455000	2456000	That is to say.
2456000	2457000	When your.
2457000	2458000	Your light source.
2458000	2459000	Getting weaker and weaker.
2459000	2461000	When your seed light is getting weaker and weaker.
2461000	2463000	It's getting closer and closer to your.
2463000	2464000	Coherent state.
2464000	2465000	It is.
2465000	2466000	Shut noise limit.
2466000	2467000	But.
2467000	2468000	Is.
2468000	2469000	Coherent state.
2469000	2470000	The real coherent state light.
2470000	2471000	No other.
2471000	2472000	Other classical noise.
2472000	2474000	Because any classical noise.
2474000	2475000	Will.
2475000	2476000	Disturb your.
2476000	2477000	The.
2477000	2478000	Squeeze light.
2478000	2479000	Yes.
2479000	2481000	So when our light is getting weaker and weaker.
2481000	2482000	We can see.
2482000	2483000	More.
2483000	2484000	Better.
2484000	2485000	Low frequency.
2485000	2486000	The.
2486000	2487000	The light is getting weaker and weaker.
2487000	2488000	That.
2488000	2489000	That.
2489000	2490000	This.
2490000	2491000	This looks like nothing.
2491000	2492000	Because.
2492000	2493000	Because only.
2493000	2494000	Only.
2494000	2495000	One kilohertz.
2495000	2496000	Only.
2496000	2497000	Then we.
2497000	2498000	Let's look at another way.
2498000	2499000	That is to say.
2499000	2500000	We.
2500000	2501000	This.
2501000	2502000	Is.
2502000	2503000	The.
2503000	2504000	The.
2504000	2505000	The.
2505000	2506000	The.
2506000	2507000	The.
2507000	2508000	The.
2508000	2509000	The.
2509000	2510000	The.
2510000	2511000	The.
2511000	2512000	The.
2512000	2513000	So its.
2513000	2515000	The more its coherent effect is.
2515000	2516000	It's.
2516000	2517000	The amplification efficiency is.
2517000	2518000	What you hit a.
2518000	2519000	You.
2519000	2520000	You've got a probion.
2520000	2521000	In.
2521000	2522000	This.
2522000	2523000	Atomic substance.
2523000	2525000	It will produce 25 atomic.
2525000	2527000	The 25 light particles.
2527000	2529000	That is to say, its magnification ratio is 25 times.
2529000	2530000	Yes.
2530000	2531000	Then you want to see.
2531000	2532000	That is to say.
2532000	2533000	When my.
2533000	2534000	My game.
2534000	2536000	The bigger it is.
2536000	2537000	That means.
2537000	2539000	The seed I need is getting weaker.
2539000	2540000	That's what I need.
2540000	2541000	When the seed is getting weaker.
2542000	2543000	I can see it.
2543000	2545000	Even lower and lower and lower.
2545000	2546000	A few hundred hertz.
2546000	2547000	I can.
2547000	2549000	I can see the effect of the light particle.
2549000	2550000	Yes.
2550000	2551000	That.
2551000	2552000	That this.
2552000	2553000	This is already us.
2554000	2556000	About two or three years ago.
2556000	2557000	The result of the cause.
2557000	2559000	But our boss insisted at that time.
2559000	2560000	Is.
2560000	2561000	No.
2561000	2562000	There's nothing to publish.
2562000	2563000	Yes.
2563000	2564000	That.
2564000	2565000	Recently.
2565000	2566000	China has a.
2566000	2567000	The research result is that they have.
2567000	2568000	Down to 700 hertz.
2568000	2569000	About.
2569000	2570000	700 hertz.
2570000	2571000	Then.
2571000	2572000	Send it out.
2572000	2573000	But then.
2573000	2574000	Our result.
2574000	2575000	The result we want to publish is.
2575000	2576000	We have.
2576000	2577000	Down to about.
2577000	2578000	About.
2578000	2579000	The result is 10 hertz or so.
2579000	2580000	That is.
2580000	2581000	We.
2581000	2582000	We have.
2582000	2583000	One order.
2583000	2584000	Another order.
2584000	2585000	Another order.
2585000	2586000	Going down.
2586000	2587000	That.
2587000	2588000	That is.
2588000	2589000	Here is what I want to share.
2589000	2590000	That is.
2590000	2591000	Actually.
2591000	2592000	Sometimes, there is.
2592000	2593000	It takes some luck.
2593000	2594000	Yes.
2594000	2595000	Some ideas are very sudden.
2595000	2596000	Yes.
2596000	2597000	So.
2597000	2598000	Was.
2598000	2599000	One day last year.
2599000	2600000	I went to my boss's office and said.
2600000	2602000	Why don't we add the second one?
2602000	2603000	Come in.
2603000	2604000	That is.
2604000	2605000	There was only one light coming in.
2605000	2606000	Then.
2606000	2607000	Pro 1.
2607000	2608000	Country 1.
2608000	2609000	Then.
2609000	2610000	Why don't we add the second one?
2610000	2611000	Yes.
2611000	2612000	The boss said.
2612000	2613000	Because the second one is added.
2613000	2614000	It will become.
2614000	2615000	It's like doing another experiment.
2615000	2616000	That is.
2616000	2617000	Our lab is not just doing this.
2617000	2618000	Do another experiment.
2618000	2619000	Is.
2619000	2620000	Take.
2620000	2621000	Two.
2621000	2622000	Pumping.
2622000	2623000	Then.
2623000	2624000	Form a.
2624000	2625000	So-called single mode.
2625000	2626000	Squeeze.
2626000	2627000	That is.
2627000	2628000	Anyway, it's another experiment.
2628000	2629000	It's a bit.
2629000	2630000	A little comparison.
2630000	2632000	It seems to become that kind of experiment.
2632000	2633000	But.
2633000	2635000	After the boss finished explaining.
2635000	2636000	Anyway.
2636000	2637000	Just try it.
2637000	2638000	No difference.
2638000	2639000	That is.
2639000	2640000	Take a.
2640000	2641000	This.
2641000	2643000	Maybe a few minutes or a few hours.
2643000	2644000	To try it.
2644000	2645000	Then.
2645000	2646000	I saw that.
2646000	2647000	A different result came out.
2647000	2648000	That is.
2648000	2649000	Our record is like this.
2649000	2650000	Pushed down another order.
2650000	2651000	To.
2651000	2652000	Nearly 10 Hz.
2652000	2653000	That is.
2653000	2654000	So.
2654000	2655000	Good.
2655000	2656000	Hey.
2656000	2657000	This video should be the last one.
2657000	2658000	That is.
2658000	2659000	Anyway, we are now.
2659000	2661000	Which one is your latest result?
2661000	2662000	Ah.
2662000	2663000	All.
2663000	2664000	All.
2664000	2665000	That is.
2665000	2666000	This result is used.
2666000	2667000	We hit two lights.
2667000	2668000	Go in.
2668000	2669000	That is.
2669000	2670000	I just.
2670000	2671000	I only showed.
2671000	2672000	The experiment in the front.
2672000	2673000	Only.
2673000	2674000	The first light.
2674000	2675000	Pumping.
2675000	2676000	With pumping.
2676000	2677000	Do.
2677000	2678000	Interaction only.
2678000	2679000	That.
2679000	2680000	All the following data.
2680000	2681000	Are two lights.
2681000	2682000	That is.
2682000	2683000	Most of the data.
2683000	2684000	Are two lights.
2684000	2685000	I.
2685000	2686000	Use a beam splitter.
2686000	2687000	You all.
2687000	2688000	Can you all see my shoulder?
2688000	2689000	That is.
2689000	2690000	Oh, yes.
2690000	2691000	This is the beam splitter.
2691000	2692000	Divide it.
2692000	2693000	Will divide.
2693000	2694000	Half of the light.
2694000	2695000	Finished.
2695000	2696000	Yes.
2696000	2697000	You have the second probing.
2697000	2698000	After the second probing comes in.
2698000	2699000	It will produce another.
2699000	2700000	Conjugate.
2700000	2701000	That is.
2701000	2702000	That.
2702000	2703000	Then you will see.
2703000	2704000	Hey.
2704000	2705000	Our experiment result is.
2705000	2706000	When your.
2706000	2707000	Ah.
2707000	2708000	This red line.
2708000	2709000	Are all shot noise.
2709000	2710000	But I am from.
2710000	2711000	100 kHz.
2711000	2712000	Draw to.
2712000	2713000	1 Hz.
2713000	2714000	That is.
2714000	2715000	That red line.
2715000	2716000	Is shot noise.
2716000	2717000	That.
2717000	2718000	Blue line.
2718000	2719000	Is.
2719000	2720000	That.
2720000	2721000	Oh.
2721000	2722000	I will talk about it later.
2722000	2723000	That is.
2723000	2724000	Anyway.
2724000	2725000	Blue.
2725000	2726000	These blue lines and black lines.
2726000	2727000	Are our new.
2727000	2728000	Our new experiment result.
2728000	2729000	That.
2729000	2730000	This picture.
2730000	2731000	Just want to tell you.
2731000	2732000	A phenomenon.
2732000	2733000	That is.
2733000	2734000	We.
2734000	2735000	In practice.
2735000	2736000	That is.
2736000	2737000	We.
2737000	2738000	We.
2738000	2739000	Before.
2739000	2740000	Break through to a few hundred Hz.
2740000	2741000	That.
2741000	2742000	Break through to a few hundred Hz.
2742000	2743000	The main.
2743000	2744000	The limit is.
2744000	2746000	It has a background noise.
2746000	2747000	That.
2747000	2749000	Where did the background noise come from?
2749000	2750000	From this pump.
2750000	2752000	After this pump is hit.
2752000	2753000	We are using.
2753000	2754000	A beam splitter.
2754000	2755000	Filter it.
2755000	2756000	But it still has.
2756000	2757000	Its.
2757000	2758000	Correlation.
2758000	2759000	Not so pure.
2759000	2760000	So it will have.
2760000	2761000	So-called leakage.
2761000	2762000	That leakage.
2762000	2763000	Will.
2763000	2764000	Will pollute your.
2764000	2765000	Probe and.
2765000	2766000	Conjugate.
2766000	2767000	Will cause.
2767000	2769000	You will see this green line.
2769000	2770000	The green line is.
2770000	2771000	We put.
2771000	2772000	Probe in.
2772000	2773000	Blocked.
2773000	2774000	So we only have.
2774000	2775000	We.
2775000	2776000	We can't measure anything.
2776000	2777000	But wrong.
2777000	2778000	You still have to measure.
2778000	2779000	This.
2779000	2780000	Green line.
2780000	2781000	What is this green line?
2781000	2782000	It's your pump.
2782000	2783000	The leakage.
2783000	2784000	Run to your probe.
2784000	2785000	And.
2785000	2786000	Conjugate in.
2786000	2787000	So.
2787000	2788000	So.
2788000	2789000	So this.
2789000	2790000	Limits us.
2790000	2791000	Our technology.
2791000	2792000	That is to say.
2792000	2793000	We could.
2793000	2794000	Our original technology is.
2794000	2795000	From a few kHz.
2795000	2796000	Then.
2796000	2797000	Compressed to a few hundred kHz.
2797000	2798000	That.
2798000	2799000	Why can't.
2799000	2800000	Compressed down.
2800000	2801000	Because.
2801000	2802000	We have a background here.
2802000	2803000	Pump.
2803000	2804000	Flash.
2804000	2805000	Pump.
2805000	2806000	Light.
2806000	2807000	Will pollute.
2807000	2808000	Your.
2808000	2809000	Green beam.
2809000	2810000	That.
2810000	2811000	Of course.
2811000	2812000	The story is not like this.
2812000	2813000	But anyway.
2813000	2814000	We just go.
2814000	2815000	Just.
2815000	2816000	I don't know why.
2816000	2817000	I just put that.
2817000	2818000	Adjusting that light.
2818000	2819000	I don't know why.
2819000	2820000	Then.
2820000	2821000	Adjusting.
2821000	2822000	That pump.
2822000	2823000	It becomes weak.
2823000	2824000	And then.
2824000	2825000	To measure this.
2825000	2826000	It turned out to be.
2826000	2827000	I made the angle bigger.
2827000	2828000	Just like this.
2828000	2829000	Make the angle bigger.
2829000	2830000	That.
2830000	2831000	Pump's leakage.
2831000	2832000	Will become.
2832000	2833000	Gray line.
2833000	2834000	So beautiful.
2834000	2835000	So low.
2835000	2836000	So.
2836000	2837000	We.
2837000	2838000	Just like this.
2838000	2839000	As long as we make the angle bigger.
2839000	2840000	Then.
2840000	2841000	You will see the black line.
2841000	2842000	Then.
2842000	2843000	That squeeze light.
2843000	2844000	Will.
2844000	2845000	Drop to about 10 kHz.
2845000	2846000	That.
2846000	2847000	Anyway.
2847000	2848000	This.
2848000	2849000	This.
2849000	2850000	This.
2850000	2851000	This.
2851000	2852000	This.
2852000	2853000	This.
2853000	2854000	This.
2854000	2855000	This.
2855000	2856000	This.
2856000	2857000	This.
2857000	2858000	This.
2858000	2859000	This.
2859000	2860000	This.
2860000	2861000	So.
2861000	2862000	I mean.
2862000	2863000	This.
2863000	2864000	This experiment.
2864000	2865000	That is.
2865000	2866000	Blue.
2866000	2867000	Red.
2867000	2868000	This blue line is all.
2868000	2869000	Shot noise.
2869000	2870000	That red line is to say.
2870000	2871000	We only hit one light.
2871000	2872000	Then.
2872000	2873000	We.
2873000	2874000	We put Probeam.
2874000	2875000	Put.
2875000	2876000	Put it.
2876000	2877000	A little lower.
2877000	2878000	Let Probeam and Country Creeper.
2878000	2879000	The pump is the same.
2879000	2880000	Then.
2880000	2881000	To measure the squeeze light.
2881000	2882000	Then.
2882000	2883000	It's so scary.
2883000	2884000	Right.
2884000	2885000	Then if we hit two lights in.
2885000	2886000	After.
2886000	2887000	This.
2887000	2888000	This.
2888000	2889000	This.
2889000	2890000	You don't have to lock the laser at all.
2890000	2891000	The laser is not locked at all.
2891000	2893000	But you can also lock the laser.
2893000	2895000	After you lock the laser.
2895000	2896000	Your laser line.
2896000	2898000	From a few megahertz to.
2898000	2900000	About a few hundred hertz.
2900000	2901000	Or kilohertz.
2901000	2902000	Then you will see.
2902000	2904000	Just that one.
2904000	2905000	One light.
2905000	2906000	Will become.
2906000	2907000	You.
2907000	2908000	You can see.
2908000	2909000	Better.
2909000	2910000	Magnetic field effect.
2910000	2911000	But.
2911000	2912000	Two lights.
2912000	2913000	Still more.
2913000	2914000	More perfect.
2914000	2915000	Then we can even do it.
2915000	2916000	About.
2916000	2917000	Six hertz.
2917000	2918000	This is our current.
2918000	2919000	Then.
2919000	2920000	Then this is of course.
2920000	2921000	We still have some.
2921000	2922000	Dust in the air.
2922000	2923000	Fall into your.
2923000	2924000	Light path.
2924000	2925000	Will interfere.
2925000	2926000	Your beam.
2926000	2927000	So we will.
2927000	2928000	Do some.
2928000	2929000	Cover it.
2929000	2930000	Then you can.
2930000	2931000	Make it beautiful.
2931000	2932000	I don't know.
2932000	2933000	You can make it very low.
2933000	2934000	Like this.
2934000	2935000	Yeah.
2935000	2936000	That.
2936000	2937000	This is.
2937000	2938000	Can go back to the next one.
2938000	2939000	The next one.
2939000	2940000	Hey.
2940000	2941000	Method 1.
2941000	2942000	Method 2.
2942000	2943000	In fact.
2943000	2944000	I just saw you.
2945000	2946000	Because you are.
2946000	2947000	There's an ice.
2947000	2948000	Split.
2948000	2949000	So.
2949000	2950000	For example.
2950000	2951000	Your method 1.
2951000	2952000	With method 2.
2952000	2953000	Probe.
2953000	2954000	The total energy is the same.
2954000	2955000	I think so.
2955000	2956000	Is it right?
2956000	2957000	Yes.
2957000	2958000	Yes.
2958000	2959000	That is to say.
2959000	2960000	Your method 1.
2960000	2961000	Your terminal.
2961000	2962000	Maybe.
2962000	2963000	The terminal is.
2963000	2964000	10 microwatt.
2964000	2965000	That method 2 is.
2965000	2966000	Five.
2966000	2967000	Five microwatt.
2967000	2968000	Yeah.
2968000	2969000	Yeah.
2969000	2970000	What's that?
2970000	2971000	Physics.
2971000	2972000	Principles.
2972000	2973000	Physics.
2973000	2974000	Principles.
2974000	2975000	Can you explain.
2975000	2976000	It's in.
2976000	2977000	Let him.
2977000	2978000	This.
2978000	2979000	Is it so different?
2979000	2980000	Why?
2980000	2981000	Because I think.
2981000	2982000	Method 1.
2982000	2983000	Method 2.
2983000	2984000	His.
2984000	2985000	This.
2985000	2986000	Angle.
2986000	2987000	It should be harder.
2987000	2988000	The same.
2988000	2989000	I.
2989000	2990000	I mean.
2990000	2991000	That is to say.
2991000	2992000	Why can he.
2992000	2993000	That is to say.
2993000	2994000	Causing.
2994000	2995000	Such a big difference now.
2995000	2996000	Yeah.
2996000	2997000	Do you know?
2997000	2998000	This method 1.
2998000	2999000	That is.
2999000	3000000	I hit the light.
3000000	3001000	The terminal.
3001000	3002000	The terminal is 1.
3002000	3004000	And then after this magnification.
3004000	3005000	After the ring.
3005000	3007000	The light coming out is G.
3007000	3008000	Right?
3008000	3009000	That's my country.
3009000	3010000	This curve.
3010000	3011000	It's G minus 1.
3011000	3012000	Because he doesn't have a terminal.
3012000	3014000	So his power is G minus 1.
3014000	3015000	For him.
3015000	3017000	There has always been a power difference.
3017000	3018000	That's the E.
3018000	3020000	The difference of that terminal.
3020000	3021000	But.
3021000	3023000	Your frequency.
3023000	3024000	If Zhang Yuan.
3024000	3025000	Piao.
3025000	3026000	Piao.
3026000	3027000	That is to say.
3027000	3029000	If you don't fix its frequency in the laser.
3029000	3030000	Your.
3030000	3032000	When your frequency is floating.
3032000	3033000	Your game.
3033000	3035000	Your magnification.
3035000	3037000	The magnification ratio is always floating there.
3037000	3040000	So you will get a different magnification ratio.
3040000	3041000	At different times.
3041000	3043000	As a result.
3043000	3045000	You will have additional noise.
3045000	3046000	Yeah.
3046000	3047000	But method 2.
3047000	3048000	That is to say.
3048000	3049000	You hit.
3049000	3050000	0.5 in.
3050000	3052000	He came out G times 0.5.
3052000	3053000	That.
3053000	3055000	His country can be 0.5 times.
3055000	3056000	G minus 1.
3056000	3057000	Right?
3057000	3058000	But.
3058000	3059000	Your other light.
3059000	3060000	It's also the opposite.
3060000	3062000	There is also a G generation.
3062000	3064000	That you originally here.
3064000	3065000	G minus 1.
3065000	3066000	With your G.
3066000	3067000	Add up like this.
3067000	3069000	The power difference on both sides.
3069000	3070000	It's zero.
3070000	3072000	No matter how your frequency floats.
3072000	3073000	Your.
3073000	3074000	Total.
3074000	3075000	Power difference.
3075000	3077000	All the same.
3077000	3078000	You.
3078000	3079000	You have.
3079000	3080000	You have understood.
3080000	3081000	I'm not talking about this point.
3081000	3082000	There is.
3082000	3083000	But I'm thinking.
3083000	3084000	That is.
3084000	3086000	You do this experiment today.
3086000	3088000	The main purpose.
3088000	3089000	Is to get.
3089000	3090000	You.
3090000	3091000	The last.
3091000	3092000	This is produced.
3092000	3093000	Conjugate.
3093000	3094000	This is a perfect.
3094000	3095000	Conjugate.
3095000	3096000	Not.
3096000	3097000	Ah.
3097000	3098000	Not.
3098000	3099000	I just.
3099000	3100000	Let me.
3100000	3101000	Because.
3101000	3102000	We.
3102000	3103000	We here.
3103000	3104000	This.
3104000	3105000	Conjugate.
3105000	3107000	There will be a power difference.
3107000	3108000	Then.
3108000	3109000	I just want to put this.
3109000	3110000	The power difference.
3110000	3111000	Eliminate it.
3111000	3112000	Then you can see.
3112000	3113000	At.
3113000	3114000	Very low frequency.
3114000	3115000	I can still see.
3115000	3116000	That is.
3116000	3117000	You.
3117000	3118000	Also.
3118000	3119000	At the time of input.
3119000	3120000	Already.
3120000	3121000	The so-called classical noise.
3121000	3122000	Already.
3122000	3123000	Eliminate it.
3123000	3124000	This classical.
3124000	3125000	Or the mechanical noise.
3125000	3126000	Because it will be.
3126000	3127000	You.
3127000	3128000	You two.
3128000	3129000	Pro beam.
3129000	3130000	Pro 1 and Pro 2.
3130000	3131000	Both.
3131000	3132000	The same classical noise.
3132000	3133000	Then you.
3133000	3134000	The same.
3134000	3135000	As soon as you go in.
3135000	3136000	Already.
3136000	3137000	Already.
3137000	3138000	Eliminated.
3138000	3139000	So you come out.
3139000	3140000	Also very clean.
3140000	3141000	There are two.
3141000	3142000	Enlarged.
3142000	3143000	Total power.
3143000	3144000	It's exactly the same.
3144000	3145000	Even your frequency.
3145000	3146000	Your laser light.
3146000	3147000	Did not shrink.
3147000	3148000	His.
3148000	3149000	His.
3149000	3150000	Total power.
3150000	3151000	Always fixed.
3153000	3154000	Correct.
3154000	3155000	It's a bit hard to imagine.
3155000	3156000	But.
3156000	3157000	Oh.
3157000	3158000	Can.
3158000	3159000	This.
3159000	3160000	Continue.
3160000	3161000	No, it's.
3161000	3162000	Okay.
3162000	3163000	You.
3163000	3164000	You continue to finish.
3164000	3165000	No.
3165000	3166000	Actually.
3166000	3167000	I'm almost done.
3167000	3168000	That is to say.
3168000	3169000	We.
3169000	3170000	This time is.
3170000	3171000	There is no.
3171000	3172000	Capacity inside.
3172000	3173000	Like I just said.
3173000	3174000	Some.
3174000	3175000	Opio.
3175000	3176000	Capacity.
3176000	3177000	So the light they emit.
3177000	3178000	Not.
3178000	3179000	Multi-spatial mode.
3179000	3180000	So it can't be used.
3180000	3181000	Image processing.
3181000	3182000	Correct.
3182000	3183000	Then.
3183000	3184000	We are almost ready now.
3184000	3185000	We are even.
3185000	3186000	Below 10 Hz.
3186000	3187000	We can all see this.
3187000	3188000	Volume noise reduction.
3188000	3189000	What is this?
3189000	3191000	What is the importance of this?
3191000	3192000	I'll tell you later.
3192000	3193000	Correct.
3193000	3194000	Then.
3194000	3195000	We will now.
3195000	3196000	That is.
3196000	3198000	Low frequency noise reduction.
3198000	3199000	Can only do.
3199000	3200000	About 6 Hz.
3200000	3201000	The main reason is.
3201000	3202000	We still have other.
3202000	3203000	Laboratory.
3203000	3204000	Light.
3204000	3205000	Light table.
3205000	3206000	Or what.
3206000	3207000	Stability.
3207000	3208000	The problem.
3208000	3209000	Correct.
3209000	3210000	Then we have this laser.
3210000	3211000	For missing.
3211000	3212000	Squeeze line.
3212000	3213000	It is.
3213000	3214000	Portable.
3214000	3215000	It is.
3215000	3216000	It's not a big one.
3216000	3217000	It's a diode laser.
3217000	3218000	Then again.
3218000	3219000	Compared to.
3219000	3220000	It's a lot cheaper.
3220000	3221000	Correct.
3221000	3223000	You can do it for $30,000.
3223000	3224000	Then.
3224000	3225000	We.
3225000	3226000	We will use it later.
3226000	3227000	Do.
3227000	3228000	Image experiment.
3228000	3229000	Then this image experiment.
3229000	3230000	That is to say.
3230000	3231000	We will have a mask.
3231000	3232000	This.
3232000	3233000	A mask.
3233000	3234000	Will put a laser beam.
3234000	3235000	Use a.
3235000	3236000	A mask.
3236000	3237000	Block it.
3237000	3238000	Then.
3238000	3239000	It will produce.
3239000	3240000	A.
3240000	3241000	Totoro.
3241000	3242000	Conjugate Totoro.
3242000	3243000	Then this is.
3243000	3244000	Conjugate.
3244000	3245000	So they.
3245000	3246000	Go.
3246000	3247000	Turn it.
3247000	3248000	About 180 degrees.
3248000	3249000	Something like that.
3249000	3250000	Then they cut each other.
3250000	3251000	You can see this.
3251000	3252000	Image.
3252000	3253000	The.
3253000	3254000	This.
3254000	3255000	This is called imaging.
3255000	3256000	That is.
3256000	3257000	Quantum quality imaging.
3257000	3258000	That.
3258000	3259000	Because.
3259000	3260000	You.
3260000	3261000	If you can't.
3261000	3262000	In all frequencies.
3262000	3263000	When you see this quantum noise.
3263000	3264000	That is to say.
3264000	3265000	If you are in low frequency.
3265000	3266000	When.
3266000	3268000	If there is a lot of physical noise.
3268000	3269000	Then you.
3269000	3270000	When you are doing.
3270000	3271000	Image experiment.
3271000	3272000	You are.
3272000	3273000	Open the shutter.
3273000	3275000	So open the camera shutter.
3275000	3276000	It is to put all.
3276000	3277000	Frequency.
3277000	3278000	Noise.
3278000	3279000	Collect it all.
3279000	3280000	So you are in low frequency.
3280000	3282000	If you can't see the quantum noise.
3282000	3284000	It will destroy your whole image.
3284000	3285000	So.
3285000	3286000	Our previous.
3286000	3287000	The.
3287000	3288000	Can't do it.
3288000	3289000	This.
3289000	3290000	This imaging.
3290000	3291000	The main difficulty is that.
3291000	3292000	We can't do it in low frequency.
3292000	3293000	This.
3293000	3294000	The quantum noise.
3294000	3295000	That is to say.
3295000	3296000	That.
3296000	3297000	Another application is.
3297000	3298000	Absolute correction.
3298000	3299000	That.
3299000	3300000	That is to say.
3300000	3301000	If this.
3301000	3302000	The light.
3302000	3303000	Is coming in one by one.
3303000	3304000	That.
3304000	3305000	It.
3305000	3306000	Once enlarged.
3306000	3307000	Double.
3307000	3308000	Ten times the light.
3308000	3309000	That.
3309000	3310000	You will see probing.
3310000	3311000	That.
3311000	3312000	The same.
3312000	3313000	Also.
3313000	3314000	The same.
3314000	3315000	The same number of.
3315000	3316000	The light comes out.
3316000	3317000	So you.
3317000	3318000	This.
3318000	3319000	Dictator A.
3319000	3320000	And the following dictator.
3320000	3321000	They must.
3321000	3323000	The same light.
3323000	3324000	And so.
3324000	3325000	The time.
3325000	3327000	The position must be the same.
3327000	3328000	So when.
3328000	3329000	The above.
3329000	3330000	The dictator.
3330000	3331000	Receive my.
3331000	3332000	When the light.
3332000	3334000	It will tell you the following.
3334000	3335000	I received one.
3335000	3337000	Did you receive one?
3337000	3338000	Correct.
3338000	3339000	If I received.
3339000	3340000	100.
3340000	3341000	I told the other party.
3341000	3342000	I received 100.
3342000	3343000	You.
3343000	3344000	If you only received.
3344000	3345000	97.
3345000	3346000	That's when.
3346000	3347000	Your quantum efficiency.
3347000	3348000	It's only 97%.
3348000	3349000	Correct.
3349000	3350000	So.
3350000	3351000	That is to say.
3351000	3352000	The traditional quantum.
3352000	3353000	The traditional.
3353000	3354000	Calibration.
3354000	3355000	The proof is.
3355000	3356000	I have.
3356000	3357000	In addition.
3357000	3358000	Another.
3358000	3359000	Dictator.
3359000	3360000	That this dictator.
3360000	3361000	I already know.
3361000	3362000	What is its efficiency.
3362000	3363000	Then I compare the two.
3363000	3364000	I can compare.
3364000	3367000	What is my relative efficiency.
3367000	3370000	What is the relative quantum conversion efficiency.
3370000	3371000	So.
3371000	3372000	If you have one.
3372000	3373000	Already know.
3373000	3374000	And then know the relative.
3374000	3375000	Then you know.
3375000	3376000	This.
3376000	3377000	Calibration after.
3377000	3378000	What is the result.
3378000	3379000	But.
3379000	3380000	This.
3380000	3381000	The way is to say.
3381000	3383000	I don't have to know the above.
3383000	3384000	Or the following.
3384000	3385000	Quantum efficiency.
3385000	3386000	I can all.
3387000	3388000	Get.
3388000	3389000	Absolute.
3390000	3391000	Calibration.
3391000	3392000	That quantum efficiency.
3393000	3394000	Correct.
3394000	3395000	That is.
3395000	3396000	We can use.
3396000	3397000	To do.
3397000	3398000	To make up.
3398000	3399000	So.
3399000	3400000	That's about it.
3401000	3402000	Thank you all.
3403000	3404000	If.
3404000	3405000	Any questions.
3405000	3406000	Welcome to ask.
3409000	3410000	Does anyone have a question?
3411000	3412000	Hello.
3412000	3413000	Hi.
3414000	3415000	Do you want to ask first?
3415000	3416000	You ask first.
3416000	3417000	You ask first.
3418000	3419000	I actually.
3420000	3421000	Because you just mentioned that.
3421000	3422000	Gravitational wave.
3422000	3423000	Is this LIGO?
3423000	3424000	Yes.
3424000	3425000	But I think this thing.
3425000	3426000	Than.
3426000	3428000	It's a hundred times better than LIGO.
3428000	3429000	I think.
3429000	3430000	Okay, I'll say it like this.
3430000	3431000	In fact, there is no.
3431000	3432000	LIGO.
3432000	3433000	They are an international.
3433000	3434000	Many countries' plan.
3434000	3435000	So I think.
3435000	3436000	We use a very simple way.
3438000	3439000	I immediately thought of one.
3439000	3440000	Application.
3440000	3441000	That's it.
3441000	3442000	LIGO.
3442000	3443000	Its frequency.
3443000	3444000	In fact, it is much higher than here.
3445000	3446000	That's a lot higher.
3446000	3447000	The reason is that he can only do that.
3447000	3448000	Ah.
3448000	3449000	If you do that.
3449000	3450000	He can only measure.
3450000	3451000	It's close to the earth.
3451000	3452000	It's also the red.
3452000	3453000	Reddish.
3453000	3454000	Smaller.
3454000	3455000	Gravitational wave.
3455000	3456000	So he can only measure.
3456000	3457000	The so-called contemporary universe.
3458000	3459000	The occurrence of phenomena.
3459000	3460000	For example.
3460000	3461000	Planet collision.
3461000	3462000	Black hole collision.
3462000	3463000	Those.
3463000	3464000	For cosmology.
3464000	3465000	Or high-energy physics.
3465000	3466000	Very interesting.
3466000	3468000	Is the ancient gravitational wave.
3468000	3470000	Then they happened a long time ago.
3470000	3471000	Then it has been.
3471000	3472000	Very big.
3472000	3473000	Very big.
3473000	3474000	Redshifted.
3474000	3475000	To.
3475000	3476000	Very low frequency.
3476000	3477000	Yes.
3477000	3478000	Then this thing can be used.
3478000	3479000	Yes.
3479000	3480000	That is to say.
3480000	3481000	Now.
3481000	3482000	I know China.
3482000	3483000	Japan.
3483000	3484000	India.
3484000	3485000	They are all developing.
3485000	3486000	Just like LIGO.
3486000	3487000	Of.
3487000	3488000	This kind of interference.
3488000	3489000	Ah.
3489000	3490000	We.
3490000	3491000	This method is.
3491000	3492000	Twin beam.
3492000	3493000	Of course.
3493000	3494000	LIGO.
3494000	3495000	They hope to be single mode.
3495000	3496000	Just a single light.
3496000	3497000	Um.
3497000	3498000	But we can also do that experiment.
3498000	3499000	No problem.
3499000	3500000	Yes.
3500000	3501000	But the other point is.
3501000	3502000	LIGO.
3502000	3503000	They only want your wave.
3503000	3504000	Not.
3504000	3505000	Ah.
3505000	3506000	1024.
3506000	3507000	No meter.
3507000	3508000	It seems that as long as you are not that wave.
3508000	3509000	They.
3509000	3510000	They don't want it.
3510000	3511000	Anyway.
3511000	3512000	You.
3512000	3513000	All their devices are for.
3513000	3514000	1024.
3514000	3515000	That wave.
3515000	3516000	So.
3516000	3517000	Our 795 wave.
3517000	3518000	It's far from them.
3518000	3519000	So they don't want it.
3519000	3520000	But actually.
3520000	3521000	Basically physics.
3521000	3522000	There is no difficulty.
3522000	3523000	So you can only.
3523000	3524000	As long as you find.
3524000	3525000	That frequency.
3525000	3526000	The light source.
3526000	3527000	It's OK.
3527000	3528000	I tell you.
3528000	3529000	You can check an experiment.
3529000	3530000	There is an experiment called LISA.
3530000	3531000	L.I.S.A.
3531000	3532000	That is a.
3532000	3533000	LIGO in space.
3533000	3534000	I think that thing.
3534000	3535000	May be for this.
3535000	3536000	It's very.
3536000	3537000	Is.
3537000	3538000	It's suitable for use.
3538000	3539000	But.
3539000	3540000	This.
3540000	3541000	I think I.
3541000	3542000	It's more important to do it first.
3542000	3543000	So.
3543000	3544000	Of course.
3544000	3545000	Of course.
3545000	3546000	They.
3546000	3547000	They care.
3547000	3548000	I don't care.
3548000	3549000	Oh.
3549000	3550000	OK.
3550000	3551000	I think it's very good.
3551000	3552000	Thank you.
3552000	3553000	Thank you.
3553000	3554000	Hey.
3554000	3555000	I want to ask.
3555000	3556000	It's your last one.
3556000	3557000	Uh.
3557000	3558000	In the next one.
3558000	3559000	So.
3559000	3560000	Do you want to do it?
3560000	3561000	Like a single-ray experiment?
3561000	3562000	So.
3562000	3563000	You like this.
3563000	3564000	The setup is very similar to that.
3564000	3565000	Red capital.
3565000	3566000	H.O.M.
3566000	3567000	The experiment.
3567000	3568000	Do you want to do that?
3568000	3569000	Or you.
3569000	3570000	Actually.
3570000	3571000	This is just a demo.
3571000	3572000	I want to tell you.
3572000	3573000	How did he.
3573000	3574000	His.
3574000	3575000	His.
3575000	3576000	His.
3576000	3577000	His.
3577000	3578000	His.
3579000	3580000	His idea is to make it.
3580000	3581000	With respect to.
3581000	3582000	That is to say.
3582000	3583000	It.
3583000	3585000	The two are unknown.
3585000	3589000	The two emitted efficiency are indecisive.
3589000	3590000	So.
3590000	3591000	It's like I give you a ball.
3591000	3592000	I said at the same time.
3592000	3593000	Give one ball to another person.
3593000	3596000	Then you two can interact with each other.
3596000	3600000	Do some coexistence cornets.
3600000	3602000	The co-efficient of yourselves.
3602000	3603000	This.
3603000	3604000	This is a demo.
3604000	3606000	But the real garbage has grown this way.
3606000	3610000	He gave it to the patient.
3610000	3613000	Then test its co-efficient relationship.
3613000	3614000	Get.
3614000	3616000	The so-called quantum quantum.
3616000	3617000	That one.
3617000	3618000	Dictator's quantum efficiency.
3618000	3619000	Then we.
3619000	3620000	This experiment should.
3620000	3622000	To get a.
3622000	3623000	Very.
3623000	3626000	The reason to use low-quality quantum compression is because.
3626000	3627000	We.
3627000	3628000	To be with.
3628000	3630000	The national standard group.
3630000	3632000	The already known co-efficient should be compared.
3632000	3633000	Then.
3633000	3634000	Then I.
3634000	3635000	The boss gave me the goal.
3635000	3636000	That is.
3636000	3637000	As long as we can get.
3637000	3639000	Below 1 kilohertz.
3639000	3640000	That.
3640000	3642000	1 kilohertz is about the same as 200 hertz.
3642000	3644000	But we keep doing it like this.
3644000	3645000	Keep doing it to 10 hertz.
3645000	3646000	So.
3646000	3647000	We will become.
3647000	3648000	Any.
3648000	3649000	Almost any frequency.
3649000	3650000	We can.
3650000	3652000	Just do the quantum correction.
3652000	3653000	Correct.
3655000	3658000	That question is.
3658000	3659000	Is.
3659000	3662000	Maybe it has nothing to do with what I did.
3664000	3665000	Hello.
3665000	3666000	I didn't understand.
3666000	3667000	Say it again.
3668000	3670000	Oh, that's your question.
3670000	3672000	Ah, actually, I don't understand it either.
3672000	3673000	Because.
3673000	3674000	Because we.
3674000	3675000	We are just very simple.
3675000	3676000	To measure his.
3676000	3677000	Co-efficient.
3677000	3678000	Then go to his.
3679000	3680000	That.
3680000	3682000	Dictator's quantum efficiency.
3682000	3683000	That's it.
3683000	3684000	No.
3684000	3685000	Nothing else to do.
3685000	3687000	Oh, no.
3687000	3688000	Because of that.
3688000	3689000	Hey.
3689000	3690000	You just said this.
3690000	3692000	This experiment.
3692000	3693000	Then.
3693000	3694000	From this.
3694000	3695000	With.
3695000	3696000	This has nothing to do with China.
3696000	3698000	There is an experiment called Hong.
3698000	3700000	I know you said that Hong.
3700000	3701000	Right.
3701000	3702000	HOM.
3702000	3703000	Yes.
3703000	3704000	That.
3704000	3705000	I look like.
3705000	3706000	Is.
3706000	3707000	Should be.
3707000	3708000	Conceptually very similar to that.
3708000	3709000	Right.
3709000	3710000	Yes.
3710000	3711000	But we.
3711000	3713000	Mainly to measure his quantum.
3713000	3714000	Is.
3714000	3715000	Not.
3715000	3716000	Measure his.
3716000	3717000	Yes.
3717000	3718000	I understand.
3718000	3719000	Yes.
3719000	3720000	Hello.
3720000	3721000	Hey.
3721000	3722000	I want to ask a question.
3722000	3723000	Uh.
3723000	3724000	Is.
3724000	3725000	You produce here.
3725000	3726000	Uh.
3726000	3727000	This is your program here.
3727000	3728000	This.
3728000	3729000	Conjugate disease.
3729000	3730000	They.
3730000	3731000	After production.
3731000	3732000	They are still.
3732000	3733000	They are coherent.
3733000	3734000	Uh.
3734000	3735000	No.
3735000	3736000	They are thermal.
3736000	3737000	This is a coherent disease.
3737000	3738000	Still.
3738000	3739000	Squeeze.
3739000	3740000	Uh.
3740000	3741000	Just.
3741000	3742000	Only.
3742000	3743000	Proceed.
3743000	3744000	Is.
3744000	3745000	Coherent disease.
3745000	3746000	It produces.
3746000	3747000	Is.
3747000	3748000	Thermal disease.
3748000	3749000	Is.
3749000	3750000	The noise.
3750000	3751000	Is.
3751000	3752000	Coherent disease.
3752000	3753000	Hundreds of times.
3753000	3754000	Is.
3754000	3755000	It is.
3755000	3756000	Very.
3756000	3757000	A.
3757000	3758000	Thermal noise.
3758000	3759000	Is.
3759000	3760000	That is.
3760000	3761000	He.
3761000	3762000	He.
3762000	3763000	Than the original.
3763000	3764000	Coherent.
3764000	3765000	Coherent disease.
3765000	3766000	About.
3766000	3767000	About.
3767000	3768000	15.
3768000	3769000	TB.
3769000	3770000	Is.
3770000	3771000	2.
3771000	3772000	5.
3772000	3773000	Square.
3773000	3774000	So.
3774000	3775000	So.
3775000	3776000	Big.
3776000	3777000	So.
3777000	3778000	Probing.
3778000	3779000	These two lights.
3779000	3780000	Reduce.
3780000	3781000	That is to say.
3781000	3782000	They are magnified at the same time.
3782000	3783000	They are.
3783000	3784000	Quantum.
3784000	3785000	Co-related.
3785000	3786000	Then.
3786000	3787000	When I.
3787000	3788000	Although it is 2.
3788000	3789000	5.
3789000	3790000	Square.
3790000	3791000	More.
3791000	3792000	Magnification.
3792000	3793000	But when the two.
3793000	3794000	After reduction.
3794000	3795000	We are.
3795000	3796000	Get a.
3796000	3797000	Very.
3797000	3798000	Clean.
3798000	3799000	Intensity.
3799000	3800000	Difference.
3800000	3801000	Squeeze light.
3801000	3802000	This is.
3802000	3803000	Coherent.
3803000	3804000	Still.
3804000	3805000	Magnification.
3805000	3806000	Light.
3806000	3807000	Is.
3807000	3808000	Also.
3808000	3809000	Thermal.
3809000	3810000	OK.
3810000	3811000	Then.
3811000	3812000	The reason is because.
3812000	3813000	You are using.
3813000	3814000	Atom.
3814000	3815000	That is.
3815000	3816000	It has a lot of.
3816000	3817000	3D scattering.
3817000	3818000	Just.
3818000	3819000	Because.
3819000	3820000	As long as you magnify.
3820000	3821000	Should say.
3821000	3822000	Any.
3822000	3823000	This non-linear magnification.
3823000	3824000	After magnification.
3824000	3825000	Is.
3825000	3826000	Thermal disease.
3826000	3827000	OK.
3827000	3828000	That is.
3828000	3829000	But.
3829000	3830000	Second harmonic.
3830000	3831000	Or.
3831000	3832000	General.
3832000	3833000	Forward mixing.
3833000	3834000	Is it?
3834000	3835000	I actually don't know.
3835000	3836000	Their.
3837000	3838000	OK.
3838000	3839000	Second harmonic.
3839000	3840000	Is it?
3840000	3841000	I don't think so.
3841000	3842000	Maybe.
3842000	3843000	Because they are.
3843000	3844000	Second harmonic.
3844000	3845000	Can also be used.
3845000	3846000	Just like.
3846000	3847000	Some.
3847000	3848000	Do.
3848000	3849000	They are.
3849000	3850000	What frequency.
3850000	3851000	To use.
3851000	3852000	Second harmonic.
3852000	3853000	To.
3853000	3854000	Create the next frequency.
3854000	3855000	Higher frequency.
3855000	3856000	That.
3856000	3857000	Is.
3857000	3858000	It must be.
3858000	3859000	Laser beam.
3859000	3860000	To do some experiments.
3860000	3861000	If it is not.
3861000	3862000	Laser beam.
3862000	3863000	Then.
3863000	3864000	It's useless.
3864000	3865000	So.
3865000	3866000	Second harmonic.
3866000	3867000	I think it should be.
3867000	3868000	Coherent beam.
3868000	3869000	Yes.
3869000	3870000	It should be.
3870000	3871000	Your probe and conjugate.
3871000	3872000	Is thermal.
3872000	3873000	Yes.
3873000	3874000	But I.
3874000	3875000	This is.
3875000	3876000	Power magnification.
3876000	3877000	I guess.
3877000	3878000	Second harmonic.
3878000	3879000	It.
3879000	3880000	Its power is still.
3880000	3881000	Conservation.
3881000	3882000	Still forward.
3882000	3883000	But.
3883000	3884000	You put.
3884000	3885000	Probe and conjugate.
3885000	3886000	You will.
3886000	3887000	Get one.
3887000	3888000	Is amplitude.
3888000	3889000	Squeeze the light.
3889000	3890000	Is it?
3890000	3891000	Is.
3891000	3892000	You can't.
3892000	3893000	Conjugate.
3893000	3894000	Is.
3894000	3895000	You can't.
3895000	3896000	Amplitude.
3896000	3897000	Is.
3897000	3898000	Its intensity.
3898000	3899000	Difference.
3899000	3900000	OK.
3900000	3901000	Yes.
3901000	3902000	Then.
3902000	3903000	I have a question.
3903000	3904000	Is.
3904000	3905000	Your.
3905000	3906000	Weak.
3906000	3907000	Is.
3907000	3908000	There is an experiment.
3908000	3909000	Is.
3909000	3910000	You put.
3910000	3911000	Probe.
3911000	3912000	Seed.
3912000	3913000	Seed.
3913000	3914000	Intensity.
3914000	3915000	Strengthening.
3915000	3916000	And.
3916000	3917000	Angle.
3917000	3918000	Yes.
3918000	3919000	Then.
3919000	3920000	You said there.
3920000	3921000	Will.
3921000	3922000	Is.
3922000	3923000	The frequency.
3923000	3924000	Will.
3924000	3925000	Go down.
3925000	3926000	Why.
3926000	3927000	Because.
3927000	3928000	Because.
3928000	3929000	I.
3929000	3930000	I have to have a seed.
3930000	3931000	I.
3931000	3932000	I need to have a seed.
3932000	3933000	Come in.
3933000	3934000	That is.
3934000	3935000	You.
3935000	3936000	You see.
3936000	3937000	Method 1.
3937000	3938000	After I come in.
3938000	3939000	Then.
3939000	3940000	If I have a seed.
3940000	3941000	Not.
3941000	3942000	Cohesive state.
3942000	3943000	Low frequency.
3943000	3944000	Not.
3944000	3945000	Cohesive state.
3945000	3946000	Because.
3946000	3947000	You.
3947000	3948000	Your laser is low frequency.
3948000	3949000	In fact.
3949000	3950000	There are many.
3950000	3951000	Other impurities come in.
3951000	3952000	Do.
3952000	3953000	The effect of low frequency.
3953000	3954000	When the effect.
3954000	3956000	My AOM has given him another impurity.
3957000	3958000	And.
3958000	3959000	There are more.
3959000	3960000	More.
3960000	3961000	Very scary impurities.
3961000	3962000	Like this.
3962000	3963000	But.
3963000	3964000	More than 10 dB.
3964000	3965000	Yes.
3965000	3966000	So.
3966000	3967000	When you.
3967000	3968000	You.
3968000	3969000	You hit this light.
3969000	3970000	Getting weaker and weaker.
3970000	3971000	When.
3971000	3972000	These ancient.
3972000	3973000	Impurities.
3973000	3974000	Will be.
3974000	3975000	Non-linear.
3975000	3976000	Take it.
3976000	3977000	Take it.
3977000	3978000	Take it.
3978000	3979000	Cut off.
3979000	3980000	That is.
3980000	3981000	These ancient impurities.
3981000	3982000	Not with you.
3982000	3983000	The power is.
3983000	3984000	It's a.
3984000	3985000	It's a non-linear way.
3985000	3986000	Cut off.
3986000	3987000	Cut off.
3987000	3988000	When vacuuming.
3988000	3989000	You don't have any impurities.
3989000	3990000	Because vacuuming is.
3990000	3991000	Cohesive state.
3991000	3992000	So.
3992000	3993000	It has a non-linear.
3993000	3994000	Take it.
3994000	3995000	Into a.
3995000	3996000	A.
3996000	3997000	Cohesive state.
3997000	3998000	Effect.
3998000	3999000	Oh.
3999000	4000000	I mean.
4000000	4001000	Just.
4001000	4002000	Ancient impurities.
4002000	4003000	Will not be.
4003000	4004000	Will not be magnified.
4004000	4005000	Then.
4005000	4006000	Quantum impurities.
4006000	4007000	Will be magnified.
4007000	4008000	Ah.
4008000	4009000	I mean.
4009000	4010000	Ancient impurities.
4010000	4011000	You can use.
4011000	4012000	Reduce the power.
4012000	4013000	Green it off.
4013000	4014000	OK.
4014000	4015000	Yes.
4015000	4016000	That.
4016000	4017000	Quantum way.
4017000	4018000	You can't.
4018000	4019000	Green it off.
4019000	4020000	OK.
4020000	4021000	Yes.
4021000	4022000	Then.
4022000	4023000	Uh.
4023000	4024000	The last question.
4024000	4025000	It's.
4025000	4026000	It's.
4026000	4027000	Now these.
4027000	4028000	This.
4028000	4029000	Dicephyl laser.
4029000	4030000	With.
4030000	4031000	Dial laser.
4031000	4032000	To compare.
4032000	4033000	It's.
4033000	4034000	It's.
4034000	4035000	Who is it?
4035000	4036000	Uh.
4036000	4037000	It's.

4074020	4075020	Your corners.
4075020	4076020	Girl.
4076020	4077020	Yet.
4077020	4078020	Don't assume it.
4078020	4079380	Because that's partner.
4079380	4080380	Web-site.
4080380	4081380	Okay.
