00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome everyone to today's TARA speech. First of all, welcome everyone to listen to Huang Kun-hsieh to tell us about Python to play with particles physics experiment.

00:16.000 --> 00:29.000
TARA is an online platform. Our goal is to use a free and cross-border way to connect young people all over the world who are engaged in research.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
We can quickly share each other's results and ideas. We have a website and a fan group. The name of our fan group is Project TARA.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
You can find us on Facebook.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Let me introduce today's speaker. Today's speaker is Huang Kun-hsieh.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
It's quite interesting. When I was preparing to introduce the speaker, I did a little calculation. I think we have known each other for 10 years.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Huang Kun-hsieh studied at the University of Taiwan Physics Department and the University of Taiwan Physics Institute.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
When he was in the doctor's class, he went to the University of Kyoto. During this period, he was engaged in the study of micro-needle telescope.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
Later, he did T2K at the University of Kyoto. So Huang Kun-hsieh can be said to be a micro-needle expert.

01:17.000 --> 01:28.000
After Huang Kun-hsieh got his doctorate, he went to Bell Institute to do hardware development. He is now a post-doctorate researcher.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
The topic he will talk to us today is to use Python to play the particle physics experiment.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
An example of using a convolutional neural network to correct gamma-ray energy measurement.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
Without further ado, let's give a round of applause to welcome Huang Kun-hsieh.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
Sorry, I forgot to say one thing. Please mute your microphone if you don't want to speak in the speech.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
But when you want to applaud, you have to turn on the microphone so that our speaker can feel your enthusiasm.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Let's welcome Huang Kun-hsieh.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Thank you for the introduction. I have been a speech therapist for a long time.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
I am very happy that you gave me the opportunity to speak here today.

02:12.000 --> 02:20.000
Actually, my speech was shot in Taiwan.

02:20.000 --> 02:29.000
So I'm sorry. If you have been to Taiwan, you may have heard the same thing over and over again.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
My name is Huang Kun-hsieh. I am a post-doctorate student at Taiwan University.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
I am currently working on a project called Bell 2.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I am currently doing a particle physics experiment.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I am studying the field of particle physics.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
In the particle physics experiment, you may take a lot of data.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
If you take data, you may need to do data analysis.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
If you do data analysis, it is a very good language.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
If you want to download it, you can download it here.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
This is my own photo.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
I am currently doing post-doctoral research at Taiwan University.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
I am currently doing research in the field of particle physics.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
I also like to use my voice.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
What is my research?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
The screen you are sharing is your PowerPoint.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It's not the part you play. You may have to re-share it.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Then choose that.

03:32.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, okay. Let's do it again.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Is there such a thing?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Choose the screen.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yes.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yes?

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
Okay.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
What I'm doing now is in a Japanese studio.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
There is an organization called KK.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
If you want to listen to Japanese, it's Koe-nen-ruki-kasoku-ken-kyu-kiko.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's simply called KK.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
There is such a big research device called Bell 2.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's a detector.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Mainly, we use Python to simulate and analyze.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
There is also some data storage.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And even push the data to the whole world.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
Because we have Google Earth that pushes the data to the whole world.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
They will provide their computing resources.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Then I will talk about how to push the data to the whole world.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
The first thing to talk about is particle physics.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm sorry.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Because the data I prepared is scientific.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Some people may not know what particle physics is.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
So let's talk about what particle physics is.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
At the beginning, for example, water molecules.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You must have heard of water molecules.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
High school physics should have heard of water molecules.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
There will be atoms in it.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Atoms will have electrons and the nucleus inside.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Electrons are the so-called basic particles.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
In addition, you will find neutrons and neutrons in the nucleus.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Neutrons and neutrons are composed of quarks.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
In fact, the most basic discovery is that there are electrons and quarks.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
To form the universe we see in our daily lives.

05:29.000 --> 05:38.000
Particle physics is to study the interaction between these basic particles and their group.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
And how to form the law of the universe.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
How do we study particle physics?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We usually do one thing.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
We will use the accelerator to accelerate the particles to a very fast speed.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
For example, like this animation.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
Let the particles and the antiparticles accelerate to a very fast speed.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Then there will be a collision in the middle.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
After we let it collide, it will produce a new one.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
We rarely see this example in the current universe.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
It's a more unfamiliar example.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
In our daily lives.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
It's not like that kind of thing.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
We rarely see this kind of thing in the current universe.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
So we study these new examples.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
And see what their interaction is like.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Neutrons are one of them.

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
In fact, we have a lot of large-scale particle physics experiments.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
There are many large-scale physics experiments in the world.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
The first is the collision experiment.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
For example, if you have heard of similar LHC.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
What kind of experiments are there under LHC?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
The biggest three experiments are actually four.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The biggest four experiments are CNS, ATLAS.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
The other experiment is not included.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
CNS, ATLAS, and LHC-B.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
In addition, our protagonist today is BELL-2.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It is also a collision experiment.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
It's about electrons.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
It's about electrons and positive electrons.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
That is, positive electrons.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Electrons are negative electrons.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Positive electrons are negative electrons.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
It's a collision experiment.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
There are also other kinds of experiments.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
For example, T2K, which I used to participate in.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And then the pressure back in China.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Or SNOPLUS in Canada.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
There are other examples.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
For example, alpha in LHC.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Alpha in SNOPLUS.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
And the Koto experiment in Japan.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I am very happy.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
When we received the number on April 26th.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
BELL-2 is the first operation.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
This is a report at the time.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
This is the release press.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
And the first collision event.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
That's why we're doing BELL-2 experiments.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Please give me three minutes.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
At the beginning, the BELL-2 detector.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Actually, it's a detection of B particles.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
B particles are rare in the universe.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
We will learn about CP-Violation.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
That is, the universe is not uniform.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
With other new physics.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
What is the universe not uniform?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
If the universe is not uniform.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
It will be with us.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
That's why we only have materials now.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Related to our universe.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I have a YouTube video.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Please take a look.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know if YouTube is okay.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Wait a minute, I'll play it again.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
This is the theory of the Big Bang.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
The universe after the Big Bang.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
At the time of the Big Bang.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Matter and antimatter.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
It should be the same level.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Now there's only matter in the universe.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Other antimatter has disappeared.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Matter and antimatter.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
There should be a difference.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
So they say.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
In addition to the difference between the electron box and the symmetry.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
There should be other differences.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Other differences are called CP-Violation.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Now known as the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It was a revolutionary theory.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Which introduced a model that contained six quarks.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Even though only three quarks were known at the time.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
In 2001.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
The Bell experiment successfully measured CP-Violation.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
In B meson decays.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
As predicted by the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
There are six quarks.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Three or four quarks.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Three or four quarks decays.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
They should have.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Matter and antimatter.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
An asymmetry.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Later in the Bell experiment.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
It was confirmed.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Now it's more accurate.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
In 2008.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
30 years after their theory paper was published.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Professor Kobayashi.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And Professor Masukawa.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Won the Nobel Prize in Physics.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Experimental confirmation of the Kobayashi-Masukawa Theory.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
By the Bell and Babar experiments.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Greatly contributed to their Nobel Prize.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
It's easy to get the Nobel Prize.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Electrons and neutrons.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Accelerate to the light.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Let them collide.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Then they will.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
If the antimatter is converted to the electron.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
They will produce.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Other kinds.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Heavier particles.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
This annihilation.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Transforms the electron and positron.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Into a pair of B mesons.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Which consists of bottom quarks.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Two B mesons.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
B mesons.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
These two B mesons.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Will decay.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Because they have a lot of life.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
They will decay.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Into other kinds.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Other kinds of particles.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Usually negative.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
In your detector.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Measure their decay.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
After the example.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Then calculate.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It should be B mesons.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Particles then pass through.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
The central drift chamber.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Here they ionize the gas.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Which fills the detector.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
In this way.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
A particle's trajectory and momentum.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Is obtained.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Next comes the top counter.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
And the aerogel rich counter.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
A charged particle.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Emits Cherenkov radiation.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
When it enters these detectors.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
The timing and pattern information.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Of the detected Cherenkov radiation.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Tells us what kind of particle it is.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Then there is an electromagnetic calorimeter.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
This detector precisely measures.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
The energy of photons.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Electrons.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
The outermost detector.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Is the long living neutral.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And muon detector.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
It detects muons.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Which penetrate most of the detector.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And neutral chaos.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Which cannot be measured.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
With the inner detectors.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It does not have an electrolyte.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Because the light does not have an electrolyte.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
So it is in the middle.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Before it touches the ECL.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
From the point of collision.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Before it touches the ECL.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
It will not be detected.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Why is the ECL detected?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Because it is denser.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So it is easier for light.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
It is easier to produce a reaction.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It will be here.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
After the reaction.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It will be broken down into many kinds.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
These electrons.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
In the crystal.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It will glow in the crystal.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
This crystal.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Will add a light sensor.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Photosensor.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You can look at the photosensor.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Its energy size.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
The light on both sides.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The intensity of the light.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
The intensity of the gamma radiation.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
All the detectors.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
This is the most important thing today.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
If you want to go in.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I have a link here.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You can go back and see for yourself.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
This is the history of the universe.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
At the beginning of the big explosion.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
The universe is very hot.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
The universe is very cold.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Relatively cold.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
In the primordial universe.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
We have a lot.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
There will be a lot in the universe.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
In real life.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
In the cold universe.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
There are many strange examples.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
In the universe.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Our accelerator.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Super KKB.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
He knows.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
What we are not familiar with now.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Strange examples.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
It often appeared in the universe.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
These examples.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
We can understand.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
From the past to the present.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
What happened.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
There may be some.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Strange behavior.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
The universe.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Only matter.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Still very mysterious.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
OK.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
CP violation.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Not familiar with the universe.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
In 1960.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
These two people.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Not discovered.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
In the K-on ring.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Found in the K-on ring.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Found in the K-on ring.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Xiaoling and Yichuan in 1973.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
They.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Established.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Three quarks era.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Six quarks.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
In the standard model.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Six quarks.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
But.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
We will.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
B quark decay.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
There will be a CP violation.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
In 1980.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
These two people.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
There will be a CP violation.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
In the K-on ring.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
OK.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
You may not know.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Simply put.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Quarks and.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Quarks.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
In fact, most of the quarks are the same.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
In addition to.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
They are not the same.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
They are not the same.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Correct.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
These two.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Charge and parity.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Quarks and quarks.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Different.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Quarks and quarks.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
There is another.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
In addition to these two properties.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Other different properties.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Will be called by us.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
CP violation.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
For example, like life.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Or like.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Decay branching ratio.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Only here.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
B quark situation.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Of course there are other CP violations.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
That kind.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Only here.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Life or decay ratio.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
What is B quark?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
What is B quark?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
This is from the website.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Take it over.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
B quark.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It is actually a B and a D.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
To constitute.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
It has B 0 and B 0 bar.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
It has B plus and B minus.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Now the universe is.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
The left side is more material.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The right side is less anti-material.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Of course now.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
B quark is very rare.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Then.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
How do we measure.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
CP violation in B quark.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
For example, life.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
After the confrontation.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
They will fly in the same direction.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
B quark and B quark.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Will fly in the same direction.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The longer the life, the longer the flight.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
The shorter the life, the shorter the flight.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
That is.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Use this to measure B quark or B quark.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Life difference.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Of course there are some decay modes.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
B is more.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
But this.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
At the same time to verify.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
They should be.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It's different in life.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
OK.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It has a lot of new physics.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
For example, like.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Some of you may have heard of.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Maybe it's too difficult.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
There will be some.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Intermediate particles.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
It may not be.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
The example we know.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
So it will be different.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
And the other one is.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Of course it's not just.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
This is.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Yan Yong is also.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Researched.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
His research is.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Direct detection.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
The method.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
B quark.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
It's also direct detection.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
OK.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Physics is over.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
You should be blind.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Then.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
It's more interesting to talk about this.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Because I am.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Most of them are.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
People who do software.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
So the next thing.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Should be more.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Talk about software.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And some examples.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
For example, like.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
You know this is.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Our Bell 2 detector.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's actually.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Its channel number is very amazing.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
There may be one.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
One million pixels.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
That.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
You have a million pixels.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Then every time the collision occurs.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Then there will be a lot of B.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
The event is to remember.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Of course, in addition to B.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
There are a lot of background events.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
So add up.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Very, very much.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Then our data size.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Then of course this is.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
You are in the inside of the FPGA.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Then put this one million.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
After throwing away the things you don't want.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Then the data size.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
The size is probably one megabyte.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Then the trigger rate is your event rate.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
If the accelerator is running.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Probably.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Maximum is 30.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
30 kilohertz.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Like this.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
This is the maximum.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Of course, it's not that high now.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
The maximum is like this.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
So the maximum data rate is probably.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
34 gigabytes per second.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Of course, there are only two or three gigabytes now.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
When running now.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Because we are not so high now.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
That is to run.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
The accelerator is not fully operational yet.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
It's not fully operational yet.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
So it's not as much as 30 gigabytes.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Then there are probably only two or three gigabytes.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
A lot.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
That.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
But in fact, two or three gigabytes.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Then add some of your simulation.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
The data produced is actually a lot.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Then this page here.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It's like this.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
How much data does it have?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
That's it.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
The data is about 30 times a year.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Petabyte.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Up to 50 petabytes.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
That's the data.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
If you don't change the simulation.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
It's probably 50 petabytes.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
That's the experiment.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
If you add the simulation.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
It's about 200.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
You can see that Google is about 98.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Then Google's search is 98.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Then Facebook Upload is 180.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Then Google's Internet Archive is 11.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
11 bytes.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Petabyte.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
It should be petabyte.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I forgot how to read it.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Then you can know that Bell can actually be with.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Google, Facebook.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Their data can be compared.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
It means it's really big.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Of course, it's bigger.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
We're really doing big data.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Then the following words are talking about.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's more in-depth.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Because we're big data.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
We need a set of processes.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
To analyze our data.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
This is how we do it.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Analyze the structure of our data.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Where do we put it?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Then we save it.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
The data format is called MDST.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
It's called Mini Data Summary Table.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
We want to start with this MDST.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
There are a lot of unorganized files in MDST.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
For example, we just saw that.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
There's no track in detail.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
There's something else.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
There's this one in ECL.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
That's it.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
We haven't sorted it out yet.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Particle or something.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Actually turn it into a particle.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Or something.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
We haven't sorted it out yet.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
We've introduced a module chain.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
There's a data store.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
These are a few things.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
We're basically.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
We're input data.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Put it in the data store.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Then put it in the data store.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
We'll use the module.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Then use a path first.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Then put in what you need.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Put it in.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
It's called a module.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
It has different functions.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
It's actually written in C14.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
It's written in C14.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
It's what you just did.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
What's the track?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Then make it an example.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
The example we see.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Then this path.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
How to put this module in.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
We use Python to do it.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
There's something else.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
After we're done.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
We output data.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
We have a root.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Our own format.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
We'll develop a root format.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
We can also use Python.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Analyze this root file.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
An example like this.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
For example.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
We're done with the experiment.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
We're going to put the NDST.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
For example, module 1 is low.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
NDST.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
And then the particle list.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
Take it out.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
There's a track in there.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
We'll put it in.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Turn it into a proton.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Or turn it into an electron.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Then there's a particle list.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And then put that.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Some particles.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
For example, I'm going to make it a bmeson.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
bmeson will change.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Many kinds.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
It's his daughter's particle.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Then put these daughter's particles together.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Then combine it into bmeson.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Then there will be a new bmeson.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
That's right.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Then we'll make some more choices.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It's bmeson.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
The bmeson he made.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
The quality is with us.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
The bmeson we know is too far away.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
So we don't want this bmeson.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Just make some choices.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
And then write it out at the end.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
It becomes a root file.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
The function of Python is.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
The first aspect is.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Build this path.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Build this module chain.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And then the other one is.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
You're in the back of the root file.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
You can use PyRooter to analyze.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Or use other packages.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Python packages for free.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
What packages can be used?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
I'll talk about it later.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Two more pages.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Let's start with what Rooter is.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
If you're interested in what Rooter is.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Rooter is.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
It's a way to do data storage.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Data analysis.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
In Hynology Physicist.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Hynology Physicist.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
You can go to his website.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I'll write some.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Installation instructions here.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
The most important thing is.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Although it is written in C++.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
You can also use C++ to do it.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
But you can integrate with the other languages.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Such as Python and R.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Python is much more resourceful than R.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So it's better to use Python.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
If you don't want to use C++.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
There's a choice here.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You want to use.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
You want to use Rooter.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Then Rooter is in C++.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You still use Python Rooter.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
It's Python by default Rooter.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Then there's another option.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
For example.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Rooter on NuPy.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Interface between Rooter.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Numerical Python.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Then there's another one.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Rooter Pandas.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
You can put Rooter's file format.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Write it into Pandas DataFrame.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
The easier one is.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Rooter Pandas.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Rooter NumPy.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
You know it doesn't have.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
It can also be used.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
But I'm more used to Rooter Pandas.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
With Rooter.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I like Rooter.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I use Rooter most often.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Then we build.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
In fact, many people started to use Rooter Pandas.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
There are some here.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
It's the same installation instructions.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
If you are interested.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
You can install Rooter Pandas.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
The installation method I wrote.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I've tried it myself.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Of course, there are other suggestions.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
For example, PIP.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I've tried PIP.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I can't install it.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I think I can install it.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
For example.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Then.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Like LHC.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Those experiments.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
The four experiments.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
We actually started.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Use Jupyter Notebook to start training.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
It's our new energy.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
To write analysis programs.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
We call it StarKit.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
It's usually three days.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
There will be three days in about four months.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
We'll have a meeting in four months.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
The meeting is held once.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Then everyone gathers to have a meeting.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
For new energy.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
In the first three days of the collaboration meeting.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Then there will be a training.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Called StarKit Workshop.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Then there will be a meeting for three days.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
In fact, everyone sits down.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Then teach the new energy.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
How to do our direct analysis.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Data processing.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Then we use Jupyter Notebook.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
To do this thing.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
You can see Jupyter Notebook.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
Its characteristics are unmistakable.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
You can see it directly.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
For example.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
If you use Lulupandas.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
You can make it into a table.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Then count, min, etc.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
If you draw a picture.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
You can keep it on top.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Then it's easier for people to see.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Of course, this is actually production.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
You may not need to use Jupyter Notebook.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
The big advantage of Jupyter Notebook.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
If you are.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Teaching.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Or some.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
After the root analysis.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
After.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
If you want to call the picture again.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It will be better.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
There are some.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
This picture is.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
How to do software training in high-performance.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Basic C++.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Basic Data Science.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Programming.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
For example, RootData.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Python, Git.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Then there are some training.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
For example, Advanced Root.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Then there are others.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Then even someone.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I want to write NVIDIA.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
OpenCL.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
CUDA or OpenCL.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
There are some.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
The right side is the training course.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
For example, like Bell 2 training course.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
With Atlas CNX HCB.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Then there are some advanced training courses.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
For example, I went to INFN last year.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
SDC School.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
That is.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
After you finish learning.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
But.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Everything is a little bit like this.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Then.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
There is.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Here is also possible.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Software people may be more interested.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Maybe it has nothing to do with physics.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I am also participating in this area.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
In the Bell era.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Is.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
K1K.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
About ten years ago.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
We are using Cluster.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Central Cluster.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Provide everyone Central Cluster.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Then everyone comes in.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Calculate.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
But Bell 2.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
It is obvious.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Its accelerator.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Already 50 times.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
So it will.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It will be more even rate.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Backlight rate will be more.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Even rate.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Will be more.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So of course.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
There is a lot of backlight.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Then we need more.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
CPU and memory.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
If it is only K1K.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Maybe you only give him money.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Then ask him to pay for it.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Maybe not.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
But we have 25 countries.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Then 100 institutes.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
100 institutions participate in this experiment.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Then each institution.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
A little machine to do it.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
But each institution.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It may have different Cluster.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Then it may have different grades.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Even some institutions.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
It may be from Amazon.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Or Google.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Then buy their Cloud Service.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
That's all right.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Then we are very welcome.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
They do this thing.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Then we need to say.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
There are two important things.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
So we have to find a way.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
For example, everyone.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Still want to log in.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
K1K Cluster.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Then we can put the job.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Is what we need to calculate.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
We spread all over the world.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Is within these 100 institutions.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
What they provide.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
What each institution provides.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Calculation resources.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Then of course they are.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Their resources are different.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
For example, some Cluster.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Then of course.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Our information will also spread all over the world.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Then here.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Then we say.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
How do we do it?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
There is a software.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Then from LCCB.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
This experiment.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
LCCB developed this experiment.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Our opponent developed it.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Then called Dirac.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Called Distribute Infrastructure.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
With Remote Agent Control.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
When he developed it.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
He also considered.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Everyone will use different things.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
It's very simple.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
User Interface.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Then you are below.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
All kinds of Cloud Cluster.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
If you are interested.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
GitHub is here.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
If you look at it yourself.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
GitHub is here.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Then everyone will notice.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It's all written in Python.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
In GitHub.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
100% is Python.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
I plug my mouth.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Kun Xian's speech.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
The link of the video.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
I put it on the side.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
The place to chat.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
There is a link.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
If you want to see those webpages.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Go back and look at the webpages.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
I just didn't copy it.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
You can go and see.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Build Dirac.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Build is.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Bring LCCB Dirac.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Then put your database in.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
This way.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
The picture on the left.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Data transmission.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Data transmission.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Green is successful.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Red is a failure.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
You can see the Japanese team.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
To the United States has been a failure.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I don't know what happened.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Have been a failure.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Other places are successful.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
More.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The prototype is a success.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
The ratio of failure.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Basically we are.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
We did the experiment.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
After.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Because we are at the end.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Will save a copy.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Then we will.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Push to the United States.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
BNL.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Blue Heaven.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
In New York.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
There is a copy.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Experimental data.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
There are some others.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Do you have 100 institutes?

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
100 institutes.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Every institute.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
There are a few more.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
A few more.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
There will be a total of three.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
After we do the experiment.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
We will put two copies of data.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Push out to BNL.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
With other sites.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
So every site will have.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Their own.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Data copy.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Of course.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
This is actually the data of the experiment.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
For example, the simulation.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Put it on BNL.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Or put it on KK.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Put it on other sites.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
For example, Taiwan also has.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
In the computer.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
We also provide resources to them.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
There is also a storage unit.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
It will be stored there.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Then.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
For example, I submitted a job.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
I may need a certain file.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
He will go to the database.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I submitted a job.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
This job.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
For example, Italy.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
This is a job in Italy.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
For example.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
In Bologna.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
In Bologna.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
He will look for nearby.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
For example, I want a file.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Where is the file in the database?

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Where is it?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
He will look for nearby.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Nearby storage unit.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
See if he has it.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
This is pretty much the case.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
This time frame.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Time relationship.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I do not speak in great detail.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
It is probably such a frame.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
To do the analysis.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
OK, then the last thing is.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
To support.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
The spirit of implementation.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
So I say.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
A case of NNW.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
In fact, in the high-end.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
We also started to try.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Now we continue to learn to do it.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
This is the first thing.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Then it is just mentioned.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
EHOMEDIC CHROMETER.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
This.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
You can see that it is in.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
It shines here.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Then it is the same.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
After the gamma ray hits in.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
It will be decomposed.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
This is a CSI crystallization.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
CSI crystallization.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Then the decomposition will shine.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Of course.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
It is impossible that only one will shine.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
This is BELL VR.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Everyone is interested.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
You can download it.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
The download is here.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
VR.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
It has VR.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
For example.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
A gamma ray runs in.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Then it will.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
It will decompose a lot of things.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Run out.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Of course it decomposes a lot of things.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
It can not only be in one ECL.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
It is distributed in several ECLs.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
This VR is really interesting.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
That.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Yes.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
You can download it.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Then.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
For example.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
A gamma ray runs in.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It will decompose.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Then decompose into other things.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Then.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
This is CSI.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
It is our luminous body.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Then it will be divided.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Then here.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Because.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
This luminous body will shine.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
It actually supports the structure.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
For example, like steel.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Aluminum plate.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Then it will not shine.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
So you can't measure it here.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Because it may be outside.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Lack of energy.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
It is anyway.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Electrolytes in matter.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Loss of energy.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
This is called CSI leakage.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Then it may leak to the back.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
In fact, there will be a leak.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
What is it actually?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
For example, like this.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
The simulation is actually like this.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
A gamma ray comes in from the right.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Then there will be a lot at the back.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Leakage.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Leakage out.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
The structure will also have some.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Leakage.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
What will this cause?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
For example, there is a mode.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
It is called B plus to low plus.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I do not know.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Anyway, the back will become.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
A lot of gamma rays.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Then there is a pi plus.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Anyway, I remember a lot of gamma rays.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Then we are from this.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
A lot of gamma rays and pi plus.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Then we combine it into B plus.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Of course, our B plus.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
The energy of its low mass.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Is from this pi plus.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Combined with a lot of gamma rays.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Then we.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
If there is a leakage.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
You will find that OK.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
B plus energy.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
It will not be a good one.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
That is.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
For example, like the standard.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Standard distribution is not.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
It will be like this.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
This curve is like this.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
It will have a tail here.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
It has a lot of low energy places.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Event here.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Because it is inaccurate.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
It will have leakage there.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
That.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
This problem appears.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Let's take a look.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
What is ECL?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
ECL is like this.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Eight thousand.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Arranged mess.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I think it's hard to do.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
So let's do something simple at the beginning.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Do something simple at the beginning.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
30x30.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Crystal array.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
30x30.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Because this is my special.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
It is done by PyCon.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Then this simulation.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
If you are interested, you can take a look.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
Here.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
For everyone.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
If we measure the energy.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
In fact, it is the energy of each individual crystal.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Then put it together.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Just add it up like this.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Is that OK?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
This is the traditional way we measure energy.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
OK.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
After the gamma ray hits.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It has energy for each crystal.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Measure the energy.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Then we measure the energy of each crystal.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
All add up.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
This is the way we measure energy.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Like this.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
But it will leak.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
For example, like this.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
The gamma ray hits in.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Hit here.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Some leaked.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
It will become OK.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Energy is gone.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
For example, we hit.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Gamma ray energy.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Is 200mEV.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Then we hit 10,000 times.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Then we measure the energy.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
How is the energy of the gamma ray?

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Its distribution will be like this.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Yes.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Of course, there are also 200.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Most of the words.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Will not reach 200.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Even some words.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
150, 125.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
It will not be able to measure all.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Measure the energy.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Is not accurate.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Measure the energy is not accurate.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
How to do it?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Just add it up.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Not good enough.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Then we.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
This question.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Is a return question.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Your true energy is 200.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Then your prediction.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Is.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Your prediction.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
You want to measure now.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
How much is the energy?

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Is a return question.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Yes.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
But now you have total.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Other crystal patterns.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
In fact, I thought later.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
A method is.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
For example, you go to see alone.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
The energy distribution of the crystal.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Then this is.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Gamma ray energy.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Is a crystal.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Slightly to the right.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Its energy distribution.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
It's a little different.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Then we suspect.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Is not hit in the middle.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
The energy distribution.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Will be different from the middle.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Then he measured.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
The degree of leakage.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Should be different.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
This is.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Our energy distribution.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Pattern.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Is a picture.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
The picture inside.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
The picture inside is different.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
For example, people are different.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Animals are different.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
If the distribution is different.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
That means.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Energy will be different.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
That's simple.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
That's OK.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Then we.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
There should be.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
There should be a way to do this.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Then we think of.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
CNN.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
If you have time.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
You can go to see.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Course.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
CNN.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I think.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
The most detailed should be him.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
CNN.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Different patterns on the map.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Find some characteristics.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Then use the machine learning method.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Find the characteristics of the machine.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Then do it.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
This is the actual simulation.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Result.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Hit the energy here.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
There is a pattern here.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
If you have learned.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Machine learning.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Our target is.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Y2.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Usually use this.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Y2.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
What we want to do.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
We want to predict.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
How much is the real energy?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
We use.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
This energy.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Put it at the bottom.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Total energy.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
We just.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Put it on top of the energy.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Y2 is like this.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
The advantage of doing this is.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
If you look at the front.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Because it is less than 200.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Between 0 and 1.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Between 0 and 1.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Our prediction.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Prediction is the result of our CNN.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Then we put the prediction.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Divided by our Dtotal.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
You can get our.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
The energy predicted by CNN.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
The loss function.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Prediction minus Y2.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
If you know.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
What is CNN?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
If you want to know what CNN is.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
You can also ask me in person.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Our neural network.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
The structure is like this.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I'm sorry.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Because I put it directly.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Production neural network.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Put it in the simulation.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
It's a bit too complicated.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
After the image.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
We use.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
I want to.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
My idea is to use that.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Google has one.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
There is a competition called Imagine.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
There is a.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
The method of Inception.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
He used.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
He used parallel.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Then use three different sizes.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
3x3, 5x5, 7x7.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Then start to layer by layer.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
I only use one layer.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Inception, I only use one layer.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Use this method.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Find characteristics.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Is different.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Size of things.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Why do I.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
This 30x30 also uses this method.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Because this method is actually.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Use real ECL method.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I'm sorry.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Use it directly.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Then at the end.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Then pull it.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Then convolution.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Below.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Then pull it flat.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Then get it at the end.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Use Sigma function.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
My target function.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
My target is limited to 0 to 1.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Then do it at the end.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
If you go.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
I'm going to hit 4000.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I'm going to hit 10,000.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
10,000.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
4G EV.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
4000 EV Gamma Ray.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I originally got.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
The energy distribution should be like this.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Red like this.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Very ugly with a big tail.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Now it's green.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I feel.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
You see the middle is back to 4000.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It seems a little bigger.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Although the tail is still there.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
But there are tails on both sides.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Not so long.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Then the last result here.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Although a little bad.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Because I didn't go all the way.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
OK.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
This is.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
The picture on the left is.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
How much is the real energy?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
From 500 to 5000.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Then.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
The axis is your real.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Total energy minus your true energy.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Then divided by your true energy.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
The more absolute value.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
It means that you make more mistakes.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Absolute value means that you make more mistakes.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Then we are in high energy.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Not bad.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
You can see.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Up to 2000.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
It's almost the same as the original method.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Low energy is a little worse.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Sorry.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
I didn't finish persuading.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Really want to persuade.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
More than a week.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Then you can persuade it.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I didn't optimize it.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
I didn't optimize it.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I didn't optimize it.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Low energy is not very good.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Then on the right.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
If you look at it.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
It will have that.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
This peak will have an rns.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Mean square root.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
nse or nse.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Sorry, rns.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Assuming you are normal distribution.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Then look at it.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Uh.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Sigma is its rns.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Then look at rns.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Then look at rns.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Red is the original method.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Green is my method.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Green is OK.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
High energy is better than them.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Low energy is not very good.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
This is my temporary persuasion.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Sorry.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Simple CNN is still not good enough.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
We are.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
I did a lot of modifications in private.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
For example, the target function has been modified.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
When there are some patterns.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
We split it into several.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Neural network to train separately.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Then put it together at the end.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
This is another way.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
We hope to use this method.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
To solve the real.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Fail2 problem.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Of course, there are other problems.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
For example, every csi crystal.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Assuming.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
This simulation is the same.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
But in fact.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Fail's csi crystal.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
There are more than 100.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Although 8000.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
There are more than 100.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
There are more than 100.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Then there is.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
The shape is not like 2D.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Weird distribution.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It is 3D.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
It is also 2D.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
It is also 2D.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
But it is a cylinder distribution.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Then there are some.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
There are some.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
For example.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Or.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
There are some.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Weird gamma rays.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
That thing.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Need to overcome.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So we have a long way to go.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Thank you for your participation today.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
If you use neural network.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
If you use neural network.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Google DeepGin.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Can put the wolf.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Can put the wolf.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Or put the little flower.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
There are some references today.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
There are some references today.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
You can take a look.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
If it's just Bell.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Bell 2's predecessor.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
It also has open data.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
You can play if you are interested.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Bell 2 is also planning.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Open data.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
It's a pity.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
There is not so much open data.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
That's it.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Thank you Kun Xian.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Thank you Kun Xian.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Thank you Kun Xian.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Does anyone have any questions?

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Does anyone have any questions?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
What is that?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
More than 100 kinds of CSI.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
More than 100 kinds of CSI.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Is it different in ratio.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And there are impurities and so on.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Is it different in ratio.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Is it different in ratio.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Is it different in ratio.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
It's a little different.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
So what is it with him.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
The ratio of CSMI is different.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
The ratio of CSMI is different.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's all the same.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's all the same.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
But it's a little different.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
But it's a little different.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
But it's a little different.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
But it's a little different.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Hello.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Hello.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I want to ask a question.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I just saw you write.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
When you are in TransCNN.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Your loss function is used.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
That is.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
That is the ratio.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
MSE.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Is there any special reason?

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Is there any special reason?

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Because intuitively.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I think you want energy.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I think you want energy.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Not the ratio.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Not the ratio.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Not the ratio.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
It's a good idea.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
It's a good idea.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
It's a good idea.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Thank you.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Thank you.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Thank you.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Thank you.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Thank you.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000

Sorry. Are there are other?

56:49.160 --> 56:50.240
I heard that you will have the

56:50.240 --> 56:52.240
Ooooo.

56:52.880 --> 56:54.880
Ooooo.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.880
Ooooo.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.880
Ooooo.

56:58.880 --> 57:00.880
Ooooo.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.880
Ooooo.

57:02.880 --> 57:04.880
Ooooo.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.880
Ooooo.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.880

57:08.880 --> 57:10.880
Ooooo.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.880
Ooooo.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.880
Ooooo..

57:15.380 --> 57:17.380
Like the middle finger and keon.

57:17.380 --> 57:19.380
Like the middle finger and keon.

57:19.380 --> 57:21.380
Like the middle finger and keon.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.380
No, no. They are similar.

57:23.380 --> 57:25.380
Middle finger and electron.

57:25.380 --> 57:27.380
They are obviously different in pose shapes.

57:27.380 --> 57:29.380
Or gamma ray.

57:29.380 --> 57:31.380
Middle finger and gamma ray have different pose shapes.

57:31.380 --> 57:33.380
They can be divided by pose shapes.

57:33.380 --> 57:35.380
Because one is fully battery.

57:35.380 --> 57:37.380
Because one is fully battery.

57:37.380 --> 57:39.380
And the other is

57:39.380 --> 57:41.380
Hedronic shower.

57:41.380 --> 57:43.380
I'm sorry for those who

57:43.380 --> 57:45.380
don't have time to make examples.

57:45.380 --> 57:47.380
One is Hedronic shower and the other is Hedronic shower.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.380
I've heard of it.

57:49.380 --> 57:51.380
So that's how they can be divided.

57:51.380 --> 57:53.380
So that's how they can be divided.

57:53.380 --> 57:55.380
If both are gamma ray

57:55.380 --> 57:57.380
and you say this is backlight gamma ray

57:57.380 --> 57:59.380
and this is signal gamma ray.

57:59.380 --> 58:01.380
Of course, if it's Hedronic shower,

58:01.380 --> 58:03.380
it can be divided.

58:03.380 --> 58:05.380
Just look at it and you'll know.

58:05.380 --> 58:07.380
Just look at it and you'll know.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.380
Just look at it and you'll know.

58:09.380 --> 58:11.380
Anyone else have questions?

58:11.380 --> 58:13.380
Anyone else have questions?

58:17.380 --> 58:19.380
Let me talk about it again.

58:19.380 --> 58:21.380
We'll post this video

58:21.380 --> 58:23.380
We'll post this video
