Q&A SESSION

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everyone, welcome to today's TAIRA speech.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today's speech topic is very special and I like it very much.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The speaker is Liu Junlin.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He is going to talk about LATEX and DINNER today.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I will briefly introduce the speaker today.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The speaker got a doctorate in electrical engineering from Caltech this year.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
His main field of research is digital signal processing and statistical signal processing.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is a brief introduction of the speaker.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Without further ado, let's welcome the speaker to talk about today's speech tool.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please turn on the microphone and let's clap together.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's start the speech.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We'll leave the time to Junlin.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I need to turn on the microphone.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can turn it on, I'll turn it off.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then I'll turn it on here.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, thank you.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you for the invitation from TAIRA.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am honored to give a special academic speech today.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Today's speech topic is mainly about LATEX.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Another tool called TIKZ and DINNER.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How to use these three tools in academic reports.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Before talking about this topic, I want to mention why I want to talk about this topic.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
First of all, when I received the invitation, I also thought about whether to talk about my special research topic.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thinking about it later, I think it's too professional.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It may not be useful to everyone.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then I turned to talk about some tools in the academic world that I have a little experience with.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
These three tools.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
By the way, let me share my experience with these tools.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Next is my speaker.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The speaker will first do a brief introduction.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then I will focus on these three tools.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then show some of the presentations I made.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Presentations made with these three tools.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Finally, a little summary.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Before starting the whole talk, I want to show you a picture.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I believe everyone should have at least a little experience in academic research.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In fact, academic research can be divided into several stages.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Suppose you want to do academic research.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
First of all, you need to have the most primitive research idea.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
According to this idea, you have to make a corresponding plan.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For example, how much funding to apply for, how many students to receive, and how large your lab needs.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
After these things, you are responsible for managing people or managing the progress of the plan.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
After having people or progress, you may need to design experiments and collect data.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then make a corresponding conclusion based on your data.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The last step, I personally think it is a very important step.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When you have the results of your research,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You may have to publish it to the appropriate conference and magazine.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Make the right oral report and promote your results to let others know.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I believe that many research topics are related to this research cycle.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The topic of my report today is related to this research cycle.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I'm not going to share with you how to find new research topics.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not going to teach you how to do research.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Of course, it has nothing to do with the following topics.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Of course, it has nothing to do with my research topics.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The topic of my report today is related to the sixth topic,

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Publication and Presentation.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It has a little bit to do with these two topics.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But I'm not going to teach you how to write a paper or how to do oral expression.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is another topic.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My main focus today is to show you a picture.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This picture...

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because of copyright issues, I didn't put the original picture on the screen.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll just put a copy and I'll show it to you.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
After I click on it, I have to change to share, right?

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This one.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't know if you can see this picture.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you know Ph.D. Comics, it's actually a...

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When you read the textbook, you can draw a picture like this.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll show you.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is a pretty close ecology in the academic world.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When you finish writing the paper, you show it to the boss.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The boss will change it for you for the first, second, and sixth time.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Or later...

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
According to what he wrote, I don't know how many times.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
49 times, right?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is actually something that happens quite often in the academic world.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because everyone wants to adjust the quality of the paper to be very perfect.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
After it's very perfect, it will be sent to the magazine

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
or find a way to try to publish it.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In this case, you can see that this student is in great pain.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The reason for the pain is actually...

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There are several reasons.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The first one is that he changed it back and forth many times.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can see that the file name is different every time.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Suppose you look at this Revision 8, Common File.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you know what the boss changed?

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You probably can't tell.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You don't know what the boss did just by looking at the file name.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's another one. You can look at the photo.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He also wrote a track change.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
After you open the file, he might say,

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, what did he change in this file?

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But if I want to compare this Revision 18 with Revision 2,

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it should be quite difficult in this situation.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm actually using this comic as a motivation today.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We can use LaTeX to deal with this situation more effectively.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It won't be so painful to change the paper.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going back to the original...

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is my story.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
My report today is mainly focused on LaTeX.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I believe that everyone has a little background on LaTeX.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Someone calls it LaTeX.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I personally like to call it LaTeX.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Because the word LaTeX has another meaning.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's actually a text layout system.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I will introduce a tool called TIKZ later.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's actually a interface that can display images in LaTeX.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Finally, I mentioned what Beamer is.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's mainly used to make videos.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, then...

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay, then I won't talk too much nonsense.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll just go straight into what LaTeX is.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
LaTeX is actually the most primitive version.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's called TeX.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was actually designed and published by Professor Donald Knuth.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a layout system.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The so-called layout system means that

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
it designs the text you want to type

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
with a text file.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Then, through the layout system,

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it can design the font size and distance of the text

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and then prepare it into a final version of the file.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the so-called layout system.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The version of TeX is very interesting.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can see it's a strange number.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
There's actually a story behind it.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Professor Knuth was quite confident in the text he wrote.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So he felt that the text he wrote had very few bugs.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So if someone found a bug,

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
he would give a corresponding check as a reward.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Then when TeX was revised,

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the number would be added,

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
but the way it was added was not the usual software,

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
which is to add 1 and add 2.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's the number of decimal places after pi.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is the current version.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The little story is that

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
if Knuth can't maintain it in the future,

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the final version will be changed to pi.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So it's still a prime number.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then it might become pi at some point.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is the TeX system.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What we often use in LaTeX

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is to add some additional instructions to TeX.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
These instructions allow us to

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
efficiently arrange a file.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
For example, in a academic document,

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
it usually has a title and author.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Then you may want to control the size of the page.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You have to add a password.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
LaTeX will wrap these functions

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
into some very simple applications,

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so you don't have to worry about

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
what the format of the title, author, and password is.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You just need to focus on what your content is.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you have any questions,

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let me ask you here.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You turned on your microphone,

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
that is, your speaker.

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So if everyone is talking, you can hear it.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not sure if you turned it on or not.

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, right.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, that should be fine.

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, yes, I just muted it.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, I'll move on to the next page.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sure you all have experience with LaTeX.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll just quickly talk about it here.

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
LaTeX mainly inputs a text file

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and then goes through some layout systems.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
After going through the layout system,

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you can output the final file.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Usually, the text file name is .tex.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
After going through the layout system,

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
there are a lot of different options here.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I just mentioned .tex and LaTeX.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There are other different ones later.

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They are used for different layout situations.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The final result of the layout

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
may be this kind of different file names.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The most common is to arrange the file into a PDF file.

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is the LaTeX system,

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
which is the most basic concept.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, in the next page,

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll briefly introduce

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the basic structure of a LaTeX file.

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'd like to ask

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
if you think this is too simple.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You may think it's too simple.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you all have experience.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, no.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No?

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So do I need to explain a little more?

197
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I said no, no.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Does that mean you need to skip it?

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I think it's just right.

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's it.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's talk about it quickly.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay, let's talk about it quickly.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
A standard LaTeX file is probably...

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
First, it will have a command

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
called document class start.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Then the GuaHu part will specify

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
whether I want this file to be an article,

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
a report, or a book.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It will first define

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the approximate size of this file.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then usually after this document class,

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
there will be a part of the area

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
called use package.

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That is to say, this file,

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
some of the commands it will need,

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
for example, more complicated math,

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
or some special font,

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
or some other functions,

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
such as if there is a hyperlink,

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
or some special color,

223
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
or drawing.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
These enhanced functions

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
are usually introduced with this use package.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is the second part of this file.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The next part is that

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
these commands will specify

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
what the title of this file is,

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and then its author,

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the author's name at the back,

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and then the date of this file.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's very simple to use.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You just type in this command

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and change this part to say

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
what the title is,

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
what the author's name is,

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and what the date is.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This part is usually called preamble.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The real file starts

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
with the beginning document,

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the end document.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The latex command is

244
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that most of the commands

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
are processed by the beginning and end.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The beginning means

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that I am now at the beginning of a certain environment,

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and the end is the end of this environment.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So from the 10th and 15th lines,

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
this means that

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
between the 10th and 15th lines,

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will describe the content of this file.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
After defining the file,

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
we can see that the 11th line

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is a command called makeTitle.

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This command means that

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
based on the title author date I specified earlier,

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I will make a corresponding

259
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
title shape.

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The important part of this part is that

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
when you do this,

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you don't have to worry at all

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
about how big the title font is,

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
how big the author font is,

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
or how much the date font should be.

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This part of the latex

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
will help you

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to arrange it according to the specified command.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So all you have to do is

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
focus on your content.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
For the 12th to 14th lines,

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will simply show an example.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It can arrange some mathematical parameters.

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Here I use a command called

275
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
beginAlign and endAlign

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to insert a mathematical value

277
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
with a whole width.

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This command will also add a

279
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
function number behind the function.

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This is a very simple one.

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Of course, there are a lot of commands behind it.

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't want to mention so many time factors.

283
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is a standard example.

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Next, I will show you that

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
if you are really interested in

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
making real latex files,

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
there are some that I have used,

288
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and there are some editors

289
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
or some interfaces that I recommend.

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There are usually two types of editors.

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is a type of editor

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that I call Latex Specific.

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This type of editor

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
will automatically

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
compile the compiled file

296
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and sometimes compile the PDF

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
to the same interface.

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So you can

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
click some quick buttons at the same time

300
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and you can quickly see

301
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the contents of the compiled file.

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Then there are often used

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
text maker, text studio, textworks, etc.

304
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I just had a discussion with the host

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
that there are some web page interfaces

306
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
such as Overleaf or ShareLatex.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
These interfaces mean that

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you don't need to install anything at all.

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Your stuff is stored in the remote server.

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
As long as you open the web page, you can edit it.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You don't have to worry about

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
which editor to use to edit it.

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It has done a good job of compatibility.

314
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
As long as you focus on the content of the file,

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the format of the file

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
will automatically arrange it for you.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This is one type.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I call it Latex Specific.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There is another type.

320
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I call it General.

321
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Basically, as long as you can open the text file,

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
you can do this.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I often use things like

324
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Vim, Emacs, etc.

325
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I personally like to use Sublime Text.

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You can also use Windows Notebook.

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It depends on your preference.

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
As long as you can open the text file,

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you can edit and save it.

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
As for the layout system,

331
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
if you use a single board Latex,

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you need to install a larger system.

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This system includes

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
the editing interface I mentioned earlier.

335
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I often use things like

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TechLive, MiKTX, or MacTek.

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
These are used separately.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TechLive can be used for Windows or Linux.

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
MiKTX is mainly used for Windows.

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is mainly used for Mac.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
After editing,

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
you can choose

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
which PDF monitor you want.

344
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There are many different choices.

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is mainly to give you an overview.

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What are the most basic Latex tools?

347
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How do we make a simple text file?

348
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What is the content?

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The first is the background.

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Next, I will introduce the main focus of this talk.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I think everyone will be more interested in this.

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But if you come to listen,

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
you should already have a good understanding of Latex.

354
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So for this picture,

355
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you might think it's acceptable.

356
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The meaning of this picture is

357
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Latex vs Word.

358
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Horizontal represents the complexity of processing files.

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Y-axis represents the time you need.

360
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The meaning of this picture is

361
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
when your file is very small,

362
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
maybe only one page,

363
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
or one or two pages,

364
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
not much content,

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
maybe only text,

366
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
when it's simpler,

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
in this case, you can use Word

368
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
to make this file in a very short time.

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But when your file is very large,

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
for example, you want to write a journal paper,

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you want to write a book,

372
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
some problems will arise.

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
At present, I still don't know

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
how to use Microsoft Word

375
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
to effectively solve these problems.

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But Latex has a corresponding method.

377
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Here, I would like to say

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that I will compare Word and Latex.

379
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I personally use Latex more often,

380
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
so I might be a little biased.

381
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I might think Latex is better.

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The same function,

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Word may also be able to achieve.

384
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you want to discuss with me,

385
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
please feel free to interrupt me.

386
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The first point I want to discuss

387
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
is the difficulty of mathematical editing.

388
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If you use Microsoft Word,

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the tool you often use

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
may be called a square editor.

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Some people may think that

392
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
the square editor is too ugly.

393
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They will use tools like MathType.

394
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
These tools are mainly

395
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
used to edit the square editor with a mouse.

396
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So you need to use a mouse

397
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to click here and there

398
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
to select some up and down icons,

399
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
to select some root numbers,

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
some special mathematical symbols.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't say this is not good.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is an input method.

403
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But if you use Latex,

404
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
suppose you want to input the following symbol,

405
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you can use Word at all.

406
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You don't have to leave the keyboard.

407
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Just input these symbols with the keyboard

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and you can output the following mathematical equation.

409
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You may think

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
how to convert this equation

411
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
to these strange symbols.

412
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This actually depends on

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
your familiarity with Latex.

414
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
For example,

415
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Begin and Align

416
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
means that I inserted a row of wide mathematical equations.

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The input method

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
is actually quite similar to the way we read.

419
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's the same from left to right.

420
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If I need a square,

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I will enter a square.

422
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If I need the initial a,

423
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I will enter an a.

424
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This command means

425
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I want the initial a in mathematics.

426
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's very similar to the way

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
to input words in mathematics.

428
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I need an initial u, initial c, initial v,

429
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and then a right square.

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This symbol means up and down,

431
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and then up and down plus 1.

432
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So this command

433
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
is not the final result,

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but in terms of reading,

435
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it's actually quite in line with people's reading habits.

436
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's the same from left to right.

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Another advantage I use is

438
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
when Latex is in the array,

439
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
you can add blanks and arrays at will.

440
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So you can put a very complex mathematical equation

441
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
with very effective arrays.

442
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can insert an array or a blank

443
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
to make it easier to read.

444
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So like me,

445
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
this equation represents this part.

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Then according to the following

447
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
different structures of this mathematical equation

448
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
to make a relative array.

449
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So when you want to change the mathematical equation,

450
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you can also easily go back

451
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to the relative Latex part

452
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to change its original code.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is my personal experience.

454
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The first advantage is that

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the mathematical equation is very easy to input.

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let's pause for a moment.

457
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you have any questions?

458
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I want to...

459
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I guess I should turn this on.

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Then you can turn it on.

461
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's okay.

462
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Then I'll just use your side to talk.

463
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's okay.

464
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I want to share something with you.

465
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's a powerpoint plug-in.

466
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's called Iguana Text.

467
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll post it in the chat room for everyone to see.

468
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's actually...

469
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Because you mentioned that

470
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the Microsoft equation is an editor.

471
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's actually very ugly.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So someone developed a powerpoint plug-in.

473
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
In fact, all the mathematical equations

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
are still using Latex code.

475
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Basically, it's also

476
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
what the author shared on the screen.

477
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It just happens to be a plug-in

478
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that can be placed directly in your powerpoint.

479
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So it's beautiful.

480
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This Iguana Text

481
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
is a very, very advanced

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Microsoft equation editor.

483
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So I'll post it in the chat room

484
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and share it with you.

485
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Thank you for sharing.

486
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Because I...

487
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
My computer is actually Linux.

488
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So it's...

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Iguana Text can't be installed at all.

490
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It can be installed, but...

491
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's very painful.

492
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's very painful.

493
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So I'm just...

494
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm not familiar with this aspect of the plug-in.

495
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Okay, so this is...

496
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I personally think the first advantage is

497
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
to edit in a mathematical way.

498
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Okay, what about the second part?

499
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is a personal experience

500
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
of sharing.

501
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That is to say,

502
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
when you need to deal with

503
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
a very large file,

504
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
suppose you want to write a doctor's thesis,

505
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and then suppose your research results

506
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
are very rich,

507
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
you write up to 500 pages.

508
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes, write a 500-page doctor's thesis.

509
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If you have Word experience,

510
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
that is, you open a 500-page Word file,

511
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
what will happen?

512
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I haven't really opened it myself,

513
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
but I've heard people share their experience

514
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that usually this situation is...

515
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
First of all, when you open the file,

516
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it will be very, very slow

517
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
because it needs to scan all 500 pages.

518
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Then next,

519
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
if you have some text blocks in the middle,

520
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
some blocks you pulled yourself,

521
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
it will be slower

522
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
because it needs to load these blocks.

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay, but for our purpose,

524
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
these steps are not necessary.

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
We just need to change

526
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
a paragraph in our text.

527
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So the focus of our focus

528
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
should be to pick this paragraph

529
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and then modify it.

530
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
After that,

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
that is, to do this,

532
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
it should not need to be loaded

533
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
into other blocks.

534
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If it's Word,

535
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't know yet

536
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
how to avoid this problem.

537
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Suppose you have a 500-page thesis.

538
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If it's LaTeX,

539
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it can use a...

540
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's a bit like writing a word.

541
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Suppose you write a thesis,

542
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
you can use a file called

543
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Thesis.txt for your thesis.

544
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Under this file,

545
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
you separate the different content.

546
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You may need to separate a file,

547
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Introduction a file,

548
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Topic 1 separate a file.

549
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Under Topic 1,

550
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
you can have your own Introduction,

551
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
your own introduction,

552
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
your own translation.

553
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That is to say,

554
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
you make your file

555
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
a system plan.

556
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Distribute different content

557
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
into different files.

558
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The advantage of this is that

559
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
if I want to change

560
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Example 1 of Topic 1,

561
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I just need to open this file

562
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and make a relative modification.

563
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't need to

564
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
load all the files.

565
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
This is the first advantage.

566
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The second advantage is

567
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
if I want to see

568
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
the result of this part of the translation,

569
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I can translate this

570
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Thesis.txt file,

571
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
but I can put

572
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
these unnecessary ones,

573
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
such as

574
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Example 1,

575
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Introduction,

576
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Topic 2,

577
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Topic 3,

578
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Conclusion,

579
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I can just block it.

580
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I have a simple version.

581
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Thesis.txt only has

582
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Example 1 in Topic 1.

583
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I only do translation

584
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
for this file.

585
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So I can see right away that

586
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I changed this thing,

587
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and it will look like this

588
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
in the real file.

589
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So this can reach

590
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
a very large file,

591
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
we make it a system partition,

592
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
then we can edit

593
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
a small file,

594
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
and we can see

595
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
the result of the editing very quickly.

596
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
This is my personal opinion

597
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the second advantage of LaTeX.

598
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Next is

599
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
to continue to the next one.

600
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The third advantage

601
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
is the compatibility problem.

602
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
If you often use

603
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Microsoft Word,

604
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
you may still remember

605
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
about ten years ago

606
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
there was a

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dock version

608
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
to DockX version

609
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
a pain period.

610
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Dock version is mainly

611
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I think DockX version

612
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
is Office 2007

613
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Word 2007 plus

614
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
about ten years ago.

615
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Anyway,

616
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
there is this pain period.

617
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Before that,

618
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
it was all DOC version.

619
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Like this file format change

620
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
there will be some

621
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
some trouble.

622
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Suppose you wrote a paper

623
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
twenty years ago,

624
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
you may now

625
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
the format will run out.

626
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
This thing,

627
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
especially in the academic world

628
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
it should not be allowed.

629
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Suppose you have a picture

630
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
you run out

631
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
then your data will run out.

632
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So it's very troublesome

633
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
to maintain anything.

634
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Microsoft has such

635
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
DOC to DOCX

636
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
history.

637
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So it's hard to guarantee

638
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
DOCX may be changed

639
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to other formats.

640
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's hard to say.

641
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So this is a

642
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
history of Word.

643
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Another one is

644
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
even if you use the same file

645
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
you use DOCX.

646
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
If you use different versions of Word

647
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
it may run out a bit.

648
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Maybe its line

649
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
or font will be a bit

650
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
not the same as your original edit.

651
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Suppose some people don't have Word

652
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
they use Pages or LibreOffice

653
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
it may be different.

654
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This is the same

655
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
in academic papers

656
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
a very disadvantageous phenomenon.

657
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Another one is

658
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
you may use different computers

659
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
different operating systems

660
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Windows, Mac.

661
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
This file

662
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
may not be able to run

663
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
in other operating systems.

664
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If you use LaTeX

665
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
its editable file

666
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
is actually Word.

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So Word

668
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
you can run a lot of things.

669
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You can run a notebook

670
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and Mac, Linux

671
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
all can be run.

672
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The final file is PDF

673
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
almost every platform can support PDF.

674
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
There are a lot of software

675
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
you can use.

676
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
This is my

677
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
third advantage

678
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
from my experience.

679
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The file format is Word

680
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and there is no DOC, DOCX

681
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
or other problems.

682
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Next I will

683
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Is there any questions?

684
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
All right.

685
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Next I will look at

686
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
one of my personal experiences.

687
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Look at the picture on the left.

688
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I will draw it roughly.

689
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Suppose you have a paper

690
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
you are writing a journal paper.

691
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This box represents

692
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
one of your pictures

693
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
it is Figure 1.

694
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Then you are in the text

695
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
in the paragraph

696
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you need to mention Figure 1.

697
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Then in a certain place

698
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
you need to mention 20%

699
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
this number.

700
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Then in another place

701
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you need to mention

702
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
X equals 10

703
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
this message.

704
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Then this 20%

705
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and X equals 10

706
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
it may actually be

707
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
one of the Figure 1

708
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
some data points

709
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the conclusion.

710
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I use red here

711
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
means

712
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
red means

713
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
my experiment data.

714
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The file is here

715
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
there is no problem

716
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Word or LaTeX

717
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
can reach this function.

718
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Now suppose there is a situation

719
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
suppose your boss is not satisfied with Figure 1

720
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
he is not satisfied with the parameters

721
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
he thinks you change the parameters

722
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
to see if these numbers

723
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
become more effective.

724
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So in some cases

725
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
you may need

726
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
after you finish writing the paper

727
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
you need to update your data.

728
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Maybe you need to run again

729
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
run to a new set of data.

730
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
In terms of updating

731
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
in concept

732
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
the red part

733
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
needs to be updated together.

734
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Because you run a new result

735
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
your Figure content changes.

736
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So this Figure 1

737
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it

738
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
you may also

739
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
in the process of text editing

740
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
this Figure 1 becomes Figure 2.

741
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So this

742
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
this

743
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
this

744
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Figure 1 also needs to be relatively modified.

745
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This number

746
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
needs to be modified

747
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
according to your experiment data.

748
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
If you use Word

749
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you can think about

750
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
if you use Word

751
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
how to achieve this?

752
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Maybe you just

753
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
run MATLAB again

754
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
generate another picture

755
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and then

756
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
after the picture is generated

757
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
you put the picture back

758
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
back to Figure 1

759
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
put the picture back

760
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
then you have to remember

761
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
you need to change 20%

762
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
you may now become 15%

763
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and now X may not be 12

764
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
X may become 12

765
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So

766
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
a job

767
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
you need to change Figure 1

768
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
at the same time you have to pay attention

769
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
you have to change 20%

770
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
with X

771
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
all these things need to be changed.

772
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
When your file is complicated

773
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
this thing will appear

774
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
more times.

775
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So if it appears

776
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
100 times

777
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
then you change 95

778
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
you have 5 forgotten to change.

779
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Then your data is wrong.

780
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay, then LaTeX has a solution

781
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
that is

782
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
first you can use

783
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Label and Reference

784
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to update

785
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
your Figure numbers.

786
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If you use LaTeX

787
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
to write paper

788
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
this value should be used often.

789
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
This is my own

790
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
experience

791
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that is

792
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
20% and X is 10

793
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
These two data points

794
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
are actually related to Figure 1.

795
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So before you use LaTeX

796
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
you can

797
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
when you write MATLAB

798
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you generate two text files at the same time

799
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
output 20% and X is 10

800
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
that is, the city directly input these two numbers

801
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
it is for two different files

802
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
when you write paper

803
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you directly include these two files

804
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
right

805
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
so you

806
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
when you write a file

807
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you have to pay attention

808
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
that is

809
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
what value

810
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
is related to what

811
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
then put all these things

812
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
together

813
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
then it is convenient to update

814
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
this is one of my

815
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
experience

816
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because

817
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I also studied for a while

818
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
then I found out that

819
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
LaTeX has this

820
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
quite convenient function

821
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that

822
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
the last one I

823
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
this picture I

824
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
showed you before

825
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that is

826
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
final.doc

827
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
that is

828
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
if you use Word

829
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you will keep changing

830
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and then

831
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
change the name

832
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
then you may track

833
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
do not know how

834
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
this can track

835
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
but it may be

836
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
very difficult to say

837
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the difference is very far

838
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
version to track

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
that if LaTeX, then

840
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
first I have to state that

841
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
LaTeX itself

842
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
it does not provide

843
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that is the file tracking function

844
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
it needs to add some other

845
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
software

846
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
then

847
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I often use my own

848
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
software called GIT

849
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that if you have written

850
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that is

851
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
a relatively large software

852
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
project

853
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
project

854
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
GIT is actually a management

855
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
that is

856
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
a program code

857
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
version control system

858
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
it can control

859
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
that is to say

860
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
this program code

861
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
at what time

862
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
by which

863
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
program designer changed

864
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
what part of who changed

865
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
then

866
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
these changes

867
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
it will have a relative record

868
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
then

869
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
between different users

870
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
to do

871
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
these changes

872
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
record

873
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
it integrated

874
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
in the same project

875
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
so

876
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
this

877
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
GIT is actually

878
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
a pretty

879
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I personally think

880
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
pretty great invention

881
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
because it can

882
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
like that

883
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
software engineering

884
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
some super big project

885
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
it can use

886
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
a lot of people together

887
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
that is

888
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
a lot of engineers

889
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
to do the same software

890
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
then it can ensure that

891
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
different engineers

892
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
will not change

893
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
other engineers

894
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the result

895
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
so

896
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
that

897
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
this function

898
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
it actually

899
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
needs to use

900
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
LaTeX file

901
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
plus GIT

902
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
to achieve

903
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
that

904
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I only simply list

905
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
a few keywords

906
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
if you use

907
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
GIT

908
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
this software

909
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
to monitor

910
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
that is

911
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
LaTeX file

912
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
file

913
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
change

914
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
text

915
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
you wait

916
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
to come up

917
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and say

918
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
you can control

919
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that is

920
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
your file

921
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
at what time

922
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
to change

923
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
what place

924
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you

925
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
usually

926
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
commonly modified

927
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
that is

928
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
you add text

929
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
or delete text

930
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
then

931
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
right

932
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
then GIT

933
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
has a feature

934
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
that is

935
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
every time you modify

936
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
you can do

937
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
something like

938
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
change block

939
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it can

940
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
send a simple report

941
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
that

942
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
in this version

943
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
which file was changed

944
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
then

945
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
you can do

946
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
very detailed

947
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
so

948
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
that

949
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
with this feature

950
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
you do not have to

951
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
that

952
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
change content

953
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
it forced

954
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
because

955
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
this is not easy

956
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
to read

957
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that

958
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
use GIT

959
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
can also be

960
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
very easy to

961
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
reply to the changes

962
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
before

963
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
then

964
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
you can do

965
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
a lot of people

966
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
in this

967
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
cooperation

968
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
that

969
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
this is

970
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
my personal experience

971
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
that

972
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
finally show you

973
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
that

974
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I mentioned

975
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
the first five

976
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
advantages

977
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that

978
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
probably

979
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
the second

980
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
with

981
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
this

982
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
with this

983
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
second

984
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
and the fourth

985
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
is my personal experience

986
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that

987
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
good

988
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
later if

989
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
we use more advanced

990
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
there are some other

991
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
features

992
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
like

993
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
we can

994
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
write a paper

995
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
in

996
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
is to use

997
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
reference

998
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
when

999
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
it can

1000
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
automatically

1001
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
help you

1002
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
form a format

1003
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
automatically

1004
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
help you

1005
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
arrange

1006
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that

1007
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
you write

1008
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
paper

1009
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
you want to

1010
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
change

1011
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
that

1012
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
good

1013
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
that

1014
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
this is mainly

1015
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that I

1016
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
currently

1017
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
include the

1018
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
part of

1019
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
that

1020
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you have any

1021
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
questions

1022
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
or want to

1023
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
discuss

1024
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
it

1025
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is very

1026
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
welcome

1027
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that

1028
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I will

1029
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
continue

1030
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
good

1031
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that

1032
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
next

1033
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I want to

1034
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
discuss

1035
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
a called

1036
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
TIKZ

1037
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm sorry

1038
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I have a

1039
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
small problem

1040
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
that

1041
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
you said

1042
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
you can

1043
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
output

1044
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
a certain

1045
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
or a certain

1046
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
number

1047
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
when

1048
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
that

1049
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
side I do not

1050
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
understand

1051
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
you say

1052
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I can

1053
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
picture

1054
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
picture, then

1055
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I can

1056
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
understand

1057
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
that I

1058
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
output a

1059
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
picture

1060
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and then

1061
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I just

1062
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
reference

1063
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
to that

1064
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
picture

1065
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and then

1066
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
feature

1067
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
will not

1068
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
change

1069
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
but you

1070
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
is to produce

1071
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
a picture

1072
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
you are using

1073
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
tools like

1074
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
MATLAB

1075
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
or something like

1076
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that

1077
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
you are using

1078
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
RR

1079
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
RR

1080
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
good

1081
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
that should

1082
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
also be

1083
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
the same

1084
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
meaning

1085
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
good

1086
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I mean

1087
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that

1088
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
because

1089
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
this is just

1090
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
a reference

1091
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
picture

1092
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
if my

1093
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
feature 1

1094
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
is a

1095
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
long

1096
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
picture

1097
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I did not

1098
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
draw

1099
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
then this

1100
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
20%

1101
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
represents

1102
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
that

1103
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the second

1104
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
data point

1105
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
is the first

1106
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
data point

1107
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
of 20%

1108
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it represents

1109
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
this

1110
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
question

1111
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and then

1112
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
in the file

1113
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I

1114
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
especially

1115
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
use

1116
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
a number

1117
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
20%

1118
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
to

1119
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
represent

1120
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
is

1121
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
particularly

1122
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
emphasize

1123
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
this picture

1124
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
of a

1125
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
feature

1126
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
like this

1127
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
here

1128
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
integrated

1129
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
that is to say

1130
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
when you output

1131
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
this picture

1132
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
this picture

1133
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
has included

1134
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
20%

1135
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
of this information

1136
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
in the

1137
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
inside

1138
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Oh

1139
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
right

1140
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that

1141
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
good

1142
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
so now if you want

1143
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
to update data

1144
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
you run

1145
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
the experiment

1146
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
20%

1147
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
becomes 15%

1148
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
in this picture

1149
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
looks like

1150
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
15%

1151
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
but you

1152
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
you become

1153
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
you have to go back

1154
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
to your paper

1155
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
part of

1156
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
the 20%

1157
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
manually changed

1158
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
to 15%

1159
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
so

1160
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
your

1161
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
figure

1162
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
is not a

1163
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
that it actually

1164
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
contains another

1165
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
thing I do not know

1166
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
what this

1167
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
is called

1168
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
because this

1169
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I have not used

1170
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
but your

1171
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
figure is not a

1172
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
example of a

1173
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
.eps

1174
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
such a file

1175
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I

1176
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
look at

1177
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
my back

1178
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
there is no

1179
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
case

1180
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh

1181
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I

1182
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
that

1183
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
but I can

1184
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
that I

1185
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
take as an example

1186
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
suppose

1187
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
now this is

1188
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
what I want

1189
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
to be

1190
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
good

1191
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
then

1192
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
he

1193
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
he is

1194
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
this strange

1195
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
picture

1196
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and then

1197
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
suppose

1198
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I wrote

1199
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
later

1200
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
when I

1201
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
specifically

1202
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
mentioned

1203
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
that

1204
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
this function

1205
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
is the lowest

1206
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
point

1207
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
is the lowest

1208
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
point

1209
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
0.2

1210
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I

1211
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that

1212
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
now

1213
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
suppose you

1214
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
teach

1215
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
you to run

1216
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
another picture

1217
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
this function

1218
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
of the picture

1219
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
that you become

1220
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
you later

1221
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
in that

1222
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
article

1223
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
when you

1224
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
do not

1225
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
0.2

1226
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
this place

1227
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
you have to

1228
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
follow your

1229
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
picture

1230
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
to do

1231
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
relative

1232
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
modification

1233
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that

1234
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
OK

1235
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
?

1236
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I guess

1237
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I guess

1238
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
his question

1239
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
should be

1240
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that

1241
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I will mention

1242
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the next section

1243
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I personally

1244
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
prefer to

1245
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
use

1246
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
latex

1247
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
to

1248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
draw

1249
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that

1250
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
of course

1251
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I know a lot of users

1252
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
will save

1253
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
EPS

1254
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
right

1255
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that I just

1256
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
mentioned the

1257
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
problem is

1258
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that he

1259
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
is with you

1260
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
picture

1261
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
is not

1262
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
directly

1263
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
related

1264
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
so

1265
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
should be

1266
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
said

1267
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
if you are

1268
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
in the

1269
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
picture

1270
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
this

1271
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
can achieve

1272
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
this thing

1273
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
but I

1274
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
want to mention

1275
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
that

1276
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
latex

1277
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
can also

1278
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
do

1279
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
control

1280
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
these

1281
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
things

1282
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
that

1283
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I

1284
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
want to

1285
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
say

1286
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
this page

1287
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
is that

1288
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
you

1289
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
file

1290
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
some

1291
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
part of

1292
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
the data

1293
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
with

1294
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
some other

1295
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
other

1296
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
other

1297
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
part of

1298
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
the data

1299
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
they are

1300
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
related to each other

1301
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
that if

1302
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
you

1303
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
are writing

1304
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
files after

1305
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
you did not

1306
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
put this thing

1307
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
into consideration

1308
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
that you have to

1309
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
manually update

1310
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
figure 1

1311
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
manually update

1312
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
this 20%

1313
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and manually

1314
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
update this

1315
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
three parts

1316
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
because you

1317
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
write files

1318
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
when you did not

1319
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
pay attention

1320
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
to you

1321
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
is to write

1322
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
separately

1323
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
when you

1324
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
update

1325
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you become

1326
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
because you

1327
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
know that the

1328
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
red part

1329
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
is actually

1330
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
these data

1331
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
points these

1332
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
values are

1333
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
related to each

1334
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
other

1335
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so if you

1336
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
have this

1337
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
concept, then

1338
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
you can

1339
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
put

1340
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
figure 1

1341
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
these

1342
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
or these

1343
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
values

1344
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
are output

1345
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
into three

1346
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
different files

1347
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
figure 1

1348
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
maybe you

1349
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
figure 1.

1350
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
EPS

1351
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
is a file

1352
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and then this

1353
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
20%

1354
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
you may

1355
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
output

1356
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
a data

TXT

1359
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and then

1360
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
this place

1361
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
you may output

1362
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
a data

1363
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000

TXT

1365
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
and then this

1366
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
data 1 and

1367
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
data 2

1368
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
you have to

1369
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
use your

1370
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
MATLAB

1371
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
or R to

1372
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
generate

1373
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
when you

1374
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
are drawing

1375
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
a good calculation

1376
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
at the same time

1377
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
you put

1378
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
20%

1379
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and 10%

1380
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
it out

1381
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
output

1382
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
into two

1383
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
TXT

1384
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
EPS

1385
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and then you

1386
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
input data

1387
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
1.

1388
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
TXT

1389
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and data

1390
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
2.

1391
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
TXT

1392
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
so

1393
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
this is

1394
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ok

1395
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I know

1396
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
this is

1397
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
a personal

1398
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
use

1399
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think this

1400
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
is very practical

1401
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and if you

1402
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
want to change

1403
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
a lot of things

1404
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
at once

1405
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
you have to

1406
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
remember this

1407
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
thing

1408
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I

1409
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
wrap up

1410
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
a little bit

1411
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
now this

1412
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
20%

1413
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
but

1414
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
when I do

1415
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
figure 1

1416
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I do

1417
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
another thing

1418
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
called

1419
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
data 1

1420
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
equals

1421
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
20

1422
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
measure

1423
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
right

1424
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
thank you

1425
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
ok

1426
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
this is mainly

1427
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
practical

1428
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
and

1429
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
this

1430
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
doesn't seem

1431
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
to have a book

1432
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
talking about

1433
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
this

1434
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
this is

1435
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
more of a

1436
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
writing habit

1437
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
here

1438
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
to remind

1439
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the distance

1440
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
is

1441
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
time

1442
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I

1443
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
will

1444
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
talk about

1445
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
TIKZ

1446
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and

1447
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Beamer

1448
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
TIKZ

1449
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
is a

1450
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
language

1451
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
that can

1452
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
draw a

1453
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
picture

1454
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and

1455
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it can

1456
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
directly

1457
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
do the

1458
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
drawing

1459
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
in

1460
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Lighttime

1461
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
and

1462
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I

1463
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
personally

1464
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
like it

1465
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
because

1466
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
this is a

1467
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
basic introduction

1468
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
so I

1469
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
jump to

1470
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
some basic

1471
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
things

1472
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
that

1473
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I

1474
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
just

1475
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
mentioned

1476
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
is the

1477
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
EPS file

1478
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
so I

1479
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
think you

1480
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
have some

1481
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
basic

1482
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
knowledge

1483
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
of the

1484
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
file

1485
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
basically

1486
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
a

1487
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
file

1488
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
can be

1489
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
classified

1490
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
as a

1491
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
quantity

1492
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
file

1493
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
or

1494
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
a

1495
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
dot

1496
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
file

1497
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
a

1498
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
quantity

1499
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
file

1500
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
different

1501
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
lines

1502
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
different shapes

1503
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
different words

1504
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and their

1505
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
color they

1506
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
are stored

1507
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
information

1508
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
so when you

1509
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
enlarge the

1510
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
picture

1511
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
when it

1512
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
can be

1513
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
based on

1514
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
these

1515
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
shapes

1516
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
colors

1517
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
to do

1518
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
the same

1519
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
proportion

1520
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
so you

1521
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
will not see

1522
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
these

1523
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
sentence

1524
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
phenomenon

1525
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that

1526
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
dot

1527
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
picture

1528
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
means that

1529
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
that

1530
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
special

1531
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
academic report

1532
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
academic research

1533
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
it

1534
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
actually

1535
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
quantity picture

1536
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
is a better

1537
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
choice

1538
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
because

1539
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
back to the

1540
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
beginning

1541
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
is that you

1542
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
have to do

1543
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
academic report

1544
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
you have to

1545
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
say that

1546
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
the precise

1547
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
and concise

1548
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
is that

1549
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
you describe

1550
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
things to be

1551
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
precise

1552
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
like this

1553
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
is not

1554
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
acceptable

1555
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
like this

1556
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
is not

1557
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
acceptable

1558
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
for

1559
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
this

1560
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
setting

1561
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
you may

1562
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
standard

1563
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Latex may

1564
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
be less used

1565
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
because most of the

1566
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
blocks may still

1567
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Matloft

1568
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
paste well

1569
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
output into

1570
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
EPS

1571
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and then add

1572
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
in

1573
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that

1574
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
TIKZ

1575
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
this

1576
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
reading kit

1577
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
it is

1578
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
such

1579
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
a process

1580
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it

1581
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
is called

1582
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
a begin

1583
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and then

1584
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
TIKZ

1585
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
this

1586
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
way is

1587
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
it draws a

1588
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
point it

1589
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
designated

1590
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
coordinates

1591
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
such as

1592
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
the

1593
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
seventh line of

1594
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
this instruction

1595
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
means that

1596
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I start

1597
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
at the

1598
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
coordinates

1599
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
negative

1600
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
0.50

1601
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
has been drawn

1602
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
to 0.50

1603
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
so I

1604
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
have drawn

1605
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
this line

1606
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and then

1607
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
this bar

1608
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
arrow

1609
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
means that

1610
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I want to draw

1611
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
a line

1612
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and then the

1613
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
arrow is

1614
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
the second

1615
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
this instruction

1616
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
means that

1617
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm at

1618
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
1.50

1619
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
this coordinate

1620
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I want to put

1621
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
a node

1622
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and then the

1623
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
node content is

1624
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
X

1625
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
so I have

1626
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
a X

1627
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
here

1628
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and then

1629
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
this node

1630
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
is to

1631
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
the right

1632
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
of this

1633
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
coordinate

1634
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
node

1635
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
is to

1636
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
put a

1637
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
text

1638
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
instruction

1639
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and then

1640
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the middle

1641
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
number can

1642
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
specify that

1643
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I want to ask

1644
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
your arrow

1645
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
symbol is

1646
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
which line

1647
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
is the first line

1648
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
of the middle number

1649
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
right

1650
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
so your arrow

1651
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
is this

1652
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
is drawn

1653
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
is

1654
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a

1655
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
so

1656
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
the seventh line

1657
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
is only to draw

1658
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
arrow

1659
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
that the eighth line

1660
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
is to draw

1661
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
X

1662
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
that

1663
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
nine and ten

1664
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
this line

1665
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
is that it can

1666
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
combine the

1667
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
instruction

1668
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I can draw

1669
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
arrow

1670
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
while drawing

1671
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
text

1672
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
this means that

1673
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
from 0.5 to

1674
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
0.5

1675
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
draw a

1676
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
arrow

1677
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
after

1678
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I put a

1679
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
node

1680
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and this node

1681
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is in

1682
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
this

1683
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
0.5

1684
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
above

1685
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I want to draw

1686
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
a Y

1687
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
right

1688
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
so I can draw

1689
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
X axis

1690
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and Y axis

1691
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and then

1692
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
some other

1693
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
people like to say

1694
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I can draw

1695
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
a rectangle

1696
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
rectangle

1697
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
is to say

1698
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I specify

1699
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
four

1700
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
four points

1701
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I draw

1702
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
from this

1703
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
negative one

1704
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
negative one

1705
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
this point

1706
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
to positive one

1707
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
this is

1708
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
two relative

1709
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
points and then

1710
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I want to draw a

1711
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
rectangle

1712
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and then this

1713
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
instruction means that

1714
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I want to draw a

1715
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
circle

1716
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and then this

1717
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
0.0 is the

1718
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
circle

1719
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and then the

1720
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
radius is

1721
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
one

1722
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
and then

1723
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
green means

1724
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
that I want to

1725
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
draw it

1726
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
in green

1727
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
that 14-16

1728
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
instruction means

1729
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
that I want to

1730
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
draw it

1731
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
in green

1732
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
and then

1733
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it is

1734
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
this

1735
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
curve

1736
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
right

1737
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
big and

1738
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
dash

1739
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
it means

1740
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
a rough curve

1741
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and then

1742
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
these things

1743
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
mean

1744
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
the point

1745
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
so I

1746
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
specify some

1747
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
points

1748
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
that

1749
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
point

1750
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
here

1751
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I use

1752
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
a cartoon to

1753
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
represent

1754
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
cartoon

1755
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
means

1756
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
that

1757
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
the front

1758
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
is the

1759
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
point

1760
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
so I

1761
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
use

1762
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
degree to

1763
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
represent

1764
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and then the

1765
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
second point

1766
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
is the

1767
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
radius

1768
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
so I

1769
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
equal to

1770
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
90

1771
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
equal to

1772
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
this point

1773
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
start

1774
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and then draw

1775
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
a line

1776
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
to the

1777
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
angle is

1778
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
210

1779
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and then draw

1780
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
the angle

1781
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
is 330

1782
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
and then this

1783
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
cycle is

1784
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
back to

1785
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
the original

1786
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
point

1787
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
so I have

1788
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
to mention

1789
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
here is that

1790
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
you use this

1791
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
set of tools

1792
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
you can be very

1793
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
precise to draw

1794
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
the picture

1795
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
you want

1796
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
because of

1797
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
these numbers

1798
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
you can see

1799
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
it is

1800
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
this circle

1801
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
it with this

1802
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
square is

1803
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
cut

1804
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
you can imagine

1805
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
if you draw

1806
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
this picture

1807
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
with PowerPoint

1808
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
you can draw

1809
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
that square

1810
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
and circle

1811
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
cut

1812
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
may be

1813
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
you need to adjust

1814
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
quite a long

1815
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
should be able to draw

1816
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
but to adjust

1817
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
quite a long

1818
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
because you specify

1819
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
this axis

1820
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
you can also

1821
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
ensure that

1822
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
this triangle

1823
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
is the inner

1824
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
circle

1825
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and you can be sure

1826
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
that this point

1827
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
on the circle

1828
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
so

1829
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
simply put

1830
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I want to say

1831
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that you use

1832
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
this set of

1833
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
TIKZ

1834
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
is very

1835
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
precise drawing

1836
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
you can draw

1837
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
the picture

1838
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
very precisely

1839
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
so

1840
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
this comparison

1841
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I skip

1842
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
because of

1843
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
time

1844
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
so

1845
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
next I will

1846
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
introduce

1847
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
called

1848
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
PGF

1849
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
PLOT

1850
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
it is actually

1851
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
based on

1852
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
TIKZ

1853
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
a set of

1854
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
drawing

1855
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
package

1856
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
yes

1857
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
it is

1858
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
mainly

1859
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
it can draw

1860
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
like this

1861
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
picture

1862
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and it

1863
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
has a very good

1864
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
compatibility

1865
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
with

1866
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
LaTeX

1867
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
and

1868
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
it

1869
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
is also

1870
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I thought

1871
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
it

1872
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
because it is

1873
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
text

1874
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
so you can

1875
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
simply say

1876
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
you draw a picture

1877
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
you can

1878
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
ensure that

1879
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I changed the picture

1880
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
where

1881
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
this may

1882
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
use

1883
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Office

1884
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
autofocus may be

1885
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
quite difficult

1886
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
because

1887
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
like you

1888
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
to adjust the position

1889
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
you just adjust a pixel

1890
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
you may be in

1891
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Word

1892
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
is more difficult to see

1893
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
the change

1894
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
but if you use

1895
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
the text

1896
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
you use this

1897
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TIKZ

1898
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
to track the

1899
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
words you can

1900
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
see the

1901
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
change in

1902
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
this

1903
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
because of time

1904
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
so I'll show you

1905
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
a simple

1906
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
example

1907
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
is good

1908
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
this is also my

1909
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
experience

1910
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
here

1911
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
if you want to

1912
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
draw a picture

1913
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and paste it

1914
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
into the paper

1915
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
usually

1916
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
the workflow is

1917
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I first use

1918
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Meta

1919
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
or Python

1920
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
or

1921
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
suppose to

1922
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
write a

1923
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
script

1924
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
after writing it

1925
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
out of the

1926
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
corresponding

1927
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
picture

1928
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
and then save it

1929
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
as a

1930
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
.

1931
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
After saving the

1932
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
picture file

1933
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
you put the

1934
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
picture file

1935
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
into the

1936
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
file

1937
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
so it's

1938
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
like this

1939
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
this picture

1940
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
actually has

1941
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
some problems

1942
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
if you are

1943
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
large enough

1944
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
it has some

1945
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
problems

1946
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
the first

1947
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
problem is

1948
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
that these

1949
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
words are too

1950
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
small

1951
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
but the

1952
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
size of the

1953
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
words

1954
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
depends on

1955
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
the ratio of

1956
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
your picture

1957
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
if you put

1958
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
the picture

1959
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
into the

1960
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
picture file

1961
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
some words

1962
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
look fine

1963
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
but if you

1964
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
put it

1965
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
too large

1966
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the words

1967
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
look too

1968
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
small

1969
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
so it's

1970
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
not easy

1971
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
to read

1972
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
this also

1973
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
tells us that

1974
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
the size of the

1975
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
words

1976
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
is related

1977
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
to the

1978
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
file

1979
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
so

1980
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
controlling

1981
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
the

1982
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
size of

1983
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the

1984
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
words

1985
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
should be

1986
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
handled

1987
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
in

1988
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
a

1989
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
systematic

1990
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
way

1991
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
the second

1992
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
problem is

1993
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
that

1994
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
for some people

1995
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
it's

1996
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
too

1997
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
systematic

1998
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
so

1999
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
it should

2000
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
be handled

2001
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
in a

2002
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
systematic way

2003
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
because it

2004
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
depends on

2005
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
the

2006
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
ratio of

2007
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
the

2008
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
word

2009
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
and

2010
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the

2011
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
ratio

2012
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
of

2013
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the

2014
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
picture

2015
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
and

2016
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
the

2017
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
word

2018
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
so

2019
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
if you

2020
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
use

2021
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
the

2022
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
original

2023
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
workflow

2024
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
you

2025
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
have to

2026
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
manually

2027
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
input

2028
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
the

2029
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
word

2030
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and

2031
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
manually

2032
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
input

2033
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
the

2034
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
word

2035
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and

2036
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
manually

2037
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
input

2038
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
the

2039
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
word

2040
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and

2041
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
manually

2042
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
input

2043
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
the

2044
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
word

2045
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and

2046
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
manually

2047
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
input

2048
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
the

2049
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
word

2050
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
and

2051
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
manually

2052
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
input

2053
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
the

2054
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
word

2055
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and

2056
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
manually

2057
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
input

2058
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
the

2059
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
word

2060
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and

2061
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
finally

2062
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
your

2063
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
application

2064
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
file

2065
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and

2066
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
you

2067
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
need to

2068
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
decipher

2069
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
that

2070
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
word

2071
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
and

2072
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
eventually

2073
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
you

2074
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
need to

2075
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,520
decipher

2076
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,000
that

2077
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
word

2078
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and

2079
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
eventually

2080
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
you need to

2081
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
decipher

2082
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
the

2083
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
word

2084
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and

2085
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
encode

2086
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
that

2087
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
word

2088
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and

2089
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
use

2090
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
decrease

2091
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the

2092
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
word

2093
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and

2094
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
字

2095
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,840
ok

2096
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,840
you need to adjust the size of the image

2097
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,840
and the font

2098
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,840
of course you need to adjust the

2099
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,840
initialization of the line

2100
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
this is

2101
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
you need to make relative adjustments

2102
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,840
according to your file

2103
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
ok

2104
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
this

2105
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,840
I personally recommend this workflow

2106
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,840
because when you want to run another image

2107
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,840
you just need to change the raw data

2108
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,840
you run it again

2109
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,840
you don't need to change the image

2110
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
you just need to change the raw data

2111
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
so this data will

2112
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,840
be like running another image

2113
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,840
you don't need to worry about the size of the word

2114
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,840
or the group of the equation

2115
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,840
or anything else

2116
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,840
ok

2117
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
this is my recommended workflow

2118
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,840
so this is my personal experience

2119
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,840
ok

2120
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
10 minutes left

2121
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
ok

2122
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
I don't have much left

2123
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,840
ok

2124
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,840
for binger

2125
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,840
ok

2126
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,840
I will talk about binger

2127
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,840
binger

2128
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
is actually

2129
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
based on LaTeX

2130
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,840
it is a system that can be used for projection

2131
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,840
like this image

2132
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,840
is made by binger

2133
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
binger

2134
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,840
I personally think the advantage is that

2135
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
it has some

2136
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,840
pre-defined themes and colors

2137
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,840
and these themes and colors

2138
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840
are very suitable for academic reports

2139
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,840
academic speeches

2140
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,840
and

2141
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
these files

2142
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
are all PDF files

2143
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,840
so compatibility is not a problem

2144
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,840
and of course it also has some other advantages

2145
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
and these advantages are mainly

2146
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,840
overlap with LaTeX and TRKG

2147
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
ok, next I want to show you

2148
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
an example

2149
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
let me show you this image

2150
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,840
like this

2151
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
let me play it again

2152
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,840
ok

2153
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
I may choose the wrong window

2154
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,840
because I seem to have two windows

2155
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
this one?

2156
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
this one?

2157
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,840
yes

2158
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,840
oh, this one, I know this one

2159
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
oh, this one, yes

2160
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,840
this is

2161
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,840
binger

2162
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
has built-in format

2163
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,840
and

2164
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
there are different names

2165
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
such as

2166
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
Ann Arbor

2167
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
or something

2168
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,840
there are a lot of names

2169
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
this means that

2170
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
if you go to the projection

2171
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,840
to configure its

2172
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
shape

2173
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
so you can see that

2174
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
some projection

2175
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,840
it will have some

2176
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,840
footnotes

2177
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,840
and

2178
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
some footnotes

2179
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
may be on the left and right

2180
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
so it can choose

2181
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,840
binger's theme

2182
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
and this theme

2183
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,840
will control the configuration of the projection

2184
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
after choosing the theme

2185
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,840
you can choose

2186
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,840
binger's color

2187
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
what kind of color I want to use

2188
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
like this

2189
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
like this may be

2190
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,840
red

2191
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,840
red

2192
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,840
and maybe

2193
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,840
some are yellow

2194
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,840
some are gray

2195
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,840
and so on

2196
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,840
so

2197
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,840
binger has

2198
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,840
a lot of choices

2199
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,840
to do

2200
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,840
ok

2201
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
this is

2202
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
to show you

2203
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
binger has some

2204
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,840
themes and colors

2205
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
ok

2206
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
if you want to use binger

2207
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
to make a projection

2208
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
actually

2209
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
this page

2210
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,840
the corresponding code is very simple

2211
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
these lines

2212
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,840
if you want to produce a binger code

2213
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,840
you just

2214
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
produce a binger slide

2215
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,840
you just use

2216
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
begin friend

2217
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,840
end friend

2218
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
to deal with it

2219
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,840
and put a

2220
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,840
big quotation mark

2221
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,840
put the binger you want to put in the middle

2222
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
put the title you want to put in the middle

2223
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,840
and in the middle

2224
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,840
you just need to focus on

2225
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,840
what your content is

2226
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
so like my front page

2227
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
I mainly put this

2228
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
prince

2229
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
put a prince

2230
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,840
like this

2231
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,840
so

2232
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
like this

2233
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,840
uh

2234
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,840
uh

2235
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
like this header

2236
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,840
or that

2237
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
footer

2238
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
I don't have to worry

2239
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
binger will automatically

2240
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,840
fill these in for you

2241
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
and

2242
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
this information

2243
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
is actually

2244
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
a professional projection

2245
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,840
because the audience

2246
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,840
must know

2247
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
who you are

2248
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
what page you are in

2249
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,840
what is the topic you want to report

2250
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,840
ok

2251
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
then I will skip it quickly

2252
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,840
then

2253
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
here are some details of binger

2254
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,840
it has some built-in

2255
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
like a block

2256
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
you can choose

2257
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
and you can also make

2258
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,840
many different columns

2259
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,840
because of the time factor

2260
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,840
I skipped

2261
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,840
binger can do the same

2262
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,840
is to

2263
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,840
change pages

2264
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
some effects

2265
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,840
like this

2266
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,840
same

2267
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,840
same video

2268
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,840
I can control

2269
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,840
in the first page

2270
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,840
I want to appear

2271
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,840
some words

2272
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,840
in the second page

2273
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
appear other words

2274
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,840
third

2275
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,840
then in another page

2276
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,840
appear other words

2277
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
like this

2278
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,840
that means

2279
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
in the first page

2280
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,840
to the last page

2281
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,840
I have to appear

2282
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,840
this

2283
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,840
on-site 1 to end

2284
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,840
this line

2285
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,840
and then

2286
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
I jump to the next page

2287
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,840
this is the result of the second page

2288
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,840
the second page

2289
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
it will appear

2290
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
on-site 2

2291
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,840
then

2292
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,840
at the same time

2293
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
on-site 2 and 3

2294
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
right

2295
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,840
that

2296
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,840
if I jump to the next page

2297
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
when the third page

2298
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
it should

2299
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,840
appear

2300
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
this

2301
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
because

2302
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,840
I have to appear

2303
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
on-site 1 to the last page

2304
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
then

2305
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,840
this page

2306
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
middle

2307
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
this should disappear

2308
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
so it will become

2309
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
this

2310
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
right

2311
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
binger

2312
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,840
it can also do

2313
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
some

2314
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
here

2315
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
is

2316
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,840
it used

2317
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,840
many different

2318
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
videos

2319
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,840
to do

2320
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,840
similar animation

2321
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
effect

2322
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,840
but

2323
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,840
animation

2324
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
here

2325
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
is not as good

2326
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
as

2327
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
powerpoint

2328
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
powerpoint

2329
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
can also

2330
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
binger animation

2331
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
is relatively

2332
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
simple

2333
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
I think it is relatively simple

2334
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
but

2335
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
if we want to do

2336
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
academic reports

2337
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
in fact, I think

2338
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
this is a good thing

2339
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
when the mosquitoes

2340
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
jump around

2341
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
in fact, your

2342
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
your readers

2343
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
will be a little

2344
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,840
confused

2345
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,840
like this

2346
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,840
right

2347
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,840
good

2348
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
that

2349
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,840
this is mainly

2350
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
I briefly introduce

2351
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
binger

2352
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
that

2353
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
time factor

2354
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
I quickly

2355
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
show some

2356
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
of my own

2357
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
presentation

2358
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
like this

2359
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
this is a

2360
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
poster

2361
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
and this is

2362
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
made with

2363
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,840
LaTeX

2364
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
and TI-KZ

2365
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
and

2366
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
its original file

2367
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,840
is actually very large

2368
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
seems to be

2369
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
its width

2370
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,840
seems to be

2371
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,840
64 inches

2372
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,840
and

2373
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,840
the length

2374
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
seems to be

2375
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
more than 30 inches

2376
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
and

2377
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,840
because of

2378
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
its

2379
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
so I just

2380
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
output a

2381
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,840
pdf file

2382
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,840
that

2383
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
during the

2384
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,840
production process

2385
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,840
I directly

2386
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,840
pdf file

2387
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
it

2388
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
so

2389
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,840
the resolution

2390
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,840
is very

2391
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,840
very high

2392
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,840
so

2393
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,840
this is actually

2394
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,840
a poster

2395
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
right

2396
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
that

2397
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
that

2398
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
what kind of

2399
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
restrictions

2400
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,840
are all

2401
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,840
drawn with

2402
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,840
TI-KZ

2403
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
very

2404
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
spectacular

2405
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,840
very spectacular

2406
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,840
right

2407
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,840
that

2408
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,840
can be drawn

2409
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,840
right

2410
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
so

2411
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
so

2412
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
some people say

2413
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,840
LaTeX

2414
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,840
is very

2415
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,840
plain

2416
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
it is

2417
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
very

2418
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
simple

2419
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
right

2420
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
right

2421
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
so

2422
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
the application

2423
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
is very

2424
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
simple

2425
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,840
it is

2426
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,840
so

2427
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
just

2428
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,840

01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,480
就是

2783
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,480
就是

2784
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,480
就是

2785
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,480
所以我想我

2786
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,480
所以我想我的問題是

2787
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,480
所以我想我的問題是

2788
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,400
就是

2789
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,400
就是

2790
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,400
那麼花多久的時間

2791
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,400
譬如假設你要做出

2792
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,400
你今天這個style就好了

2793
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,400
大概花了多久的時間

2794
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,800
製作出這個東西

2795
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,800
或者說你的learning curve是多陡

2796
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,600
好

2797
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,720
我誠實回答

2798
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,600
我誠實回答

2799
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,880
就這一整期的影片

2800
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,880
就這一整期的影片

2801
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,240
我大概

2802
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,240
厲害

2803
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,240
認真做

2804
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,400
因為我之前

2805
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,360
就有什麼慢些少增多增

2806
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,480
那認真的做只是

2807
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,480
人生畢業

2808
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,480
那我大概花了三到四天吧

2809
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:56,480
對

2810
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,480
那當然有一些投影片是那種

2811
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,480
像這一頁投影片我是

2812
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,480
我是就直接做

2813
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,480
所以我就是那個code

2814
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,480
直接複製過來這樣

2815
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,480
然後對

2816
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,480
有一些是現成的

2817
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
那

2818
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,480
多陡的話我覺得

2819
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,480
我可以跟你分享一下我的經驗

2820
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,480
就是我

2821
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,480
第一次用Latex的話

2822
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,480
大概是

2823
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,480
我十二年前

2824
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,480
我第一次用Latex

2825
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,480
那

2826
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,480
當時是好像有

2827
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,480
有一個作業要

2828
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,480
打那個就是解答吧

2829
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,480
打Solution

2830
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,480
然後他就是請我們用Latex

2831
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,480
來打這樣

2832
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,480
那當時我算是第一次

2833
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,480
接觸Latex然後當時我會的功能

2834
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,480
就是把字打出來

2835
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,480
把方程式打出來

2836
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,480
大概就這樣

2837
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,480
然後連

2838
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,480
可能還有基本的reference

2839
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,480
就是說

2840
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,480
方程式1

2841
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,480
文件裡面引用方程式1

2842
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,480
方程式1這樣

2843
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,480
那插入圖片其實那個時候還不太會

2844
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,480
所以我大概十二年前

2845
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,480
大概就是文字打出來的程度

2846
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,480
大概我想一下

2847
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,480
大概我

2848
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,480
我八年前就是

2849
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,480
我有一群朋友就說我們就是有分組報告

2850
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,480
就說大家

2851
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,480
幾個朋友就說那我們都

2852
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,480
要不要都用Latex來打這樣

2853
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,480
當時就是強迫自己

2854
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,480
因為有通財壓力

2855
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
所以就是

2856
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,480
某一門課的所有報告

2857
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,480
都用Latex打

2858
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,480
那當時我自己的經驗就是

2859
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,480
可以把文字打出來

2860
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,480
可以把方程式打出來

2861
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,480
那還會插入一些圖這樣

2862
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,480
那可是圖還是

2863
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,480
簡單的就是

2864
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,480
當時還是用PNG的圖

2865
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,480
對然後就是插入圖

2866
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,480
OK那之後就是我上

2867
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,480
授班之後呢

2868
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,480
我就想說

2869
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,480
聽說這個東西對

2870
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,480
寫Paper很有用那是不是要認真

2871
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,480
學一下這樣

2872
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,480
我當時授班的時候就是我假設

2873
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,480
如果有書面報告就會

2874
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,480
盡量就是

2875
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,480
把它整理成用Latex

2876
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,480
把它整理成一份文件

2877
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,480
然後

2878
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,480
把一些圖片啊或者是

2879
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,480
重要的方程式推導過程

2880
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,480
把它打成一份Latex文件

2881
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,480
然後

2882
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,480
在那個之後我才

2883
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
還會比較多其他功能就是什麼插入

2884
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,480
除了插入圖片之外

2885
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,480
可能還會

2886
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,480
把圖片做裁剪

2887
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,480
或者是插入表格表格

2888
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,480
裡面再插入圖片

2889
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,480
對就是我覺得

2890
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,480
Learning curve是

2891
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,480
根據你手頭上的project

2892
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,480
去決定的

2893
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,480
如果你手頭上的project就是只要

2894
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,480
把字打出來的話那其實

2895
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,480
沒有到非常的困難

2896
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,480
你大概只要知道你

2897
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,480
怎麼把數學方式打出來

2898
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,480
Latex就會排

2899
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,480
排出一個還

2900
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,480
OK的文件給你看這樣

2901
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,480
那如果你後面要進行更多的調整的話

2902
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,480
你就必須要去學一些

2903
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,480
其實我蠻多資訊都是Google來的

2904
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,480
就是如果你

2905
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,480
可以把你的問題

2906
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,480
用英文描述去Google

2907
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,480
通常會找到答案

2908
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
有時候會有些線

2909
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,480
你直接複製貼上

2910
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,480
好我不知道

2911
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,480
這樣可能回答有點太長

2912
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,480
反正簡短的回答就是說

2913
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,480
我花蠻多時間的

2914
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
我博班也是

2915
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,480
都在處理

2916
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,480
Latex這些格式

2917
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,480
做投影片之類的

2918
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,480
所以花時間

2919
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,480
然後

2920
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,480
取決於你手上的project

2921
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,480
那我個人是覺得做出這些結果

2922
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,480
還蠻有成就感的

2923
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,480
對

2924
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,480
不知道這樣有沒有回答到很多問題

2925
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,480
對

2926
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,480
那這樣說好了就是說如果你有想要

2927
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,480
做出什麼

2928
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,480
畫面的話

2929
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,480
你也可以跟我討論這樣

2930
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,480
對

2931
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,480
因為有時候是

2932
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,480
我想要做出某個畫面可是我不知道

2933
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
對你的指令是什麼

2934
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,480
或是說我不知道要怎麼做出

2935
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,480
這個

2936
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,480
舉例來說像我聽到這一頁

2937
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,480
假設我要做出這個結果

2938
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,480
PowerPoint可能就很簡單

2939
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,480
我就是拉三個文字方塊

2940
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,480
然後字放進去

2941
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,480
那如果是beamer的話你可能

2942
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,480
必須要知道下面這些指令這樣

2943
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,480
可是這種東西就是說

2944
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,480
你知道之後你以後就記得了

2945
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,480
然後使用起來就是會

2946
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,480
就是你看到這個圖

2947
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,480
你就知道OK

2948
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,480
所以我就必須要放這些指令才會出現這個結果

2949
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,480
所以這個有時候也是

2950
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,480
取決於你的

2951
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,480
有沒有遇到這個問題

2952
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,480
然後熟悉度怎麼樣這樣

2953
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,480
當然就是

2954
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,480
有任何問題歡迎跟我討論

2955
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,480
對

2956
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,480
感謝

2957
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
不客氣不客氣

2958
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,480
很高興有人可以

2959
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,480
討論

2960
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,480
比如說就像大概你的12年前

2961
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,480
我可以做出一個Document

2962
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,480
然後裡面有一些方程式

2963
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,480
插幾個圖就插幾個EPS圖

2964
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,480
我還沒有辦法像你剛剛講的

2965
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,480
做出那個

2966
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,480
就有raw data跟

2967
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,480
bigger style的那個東西

2968
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,480
這個我主要是個人使用經驗

2969
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,480
那

2970
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,480
我覺得你加EPS

2971
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,480
有它的方便性

2972
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,480
因為你的圖就是EPS嘛

2973
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,480
直接插入

2974
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,480
你只要稍微調一下它的大小就可以了

2975
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,480
那這個有它的方便性在

2976
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,480
我一剛開始也都是這樣做的

2977
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,480
那

2978
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,480
就是我

2979
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,480
有點是

2980
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,480
做越多事情我會發現就是

2981
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,480
每個工具都有

2982
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,480
它的各自一些限制

2983
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,480
那

2984
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,480
所以我目前是用這樣的workflow

2985
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,480
對

2986
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,480
如果初學者我還是還蠻建議

2987
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,480
就是直接用EPS把圖放進去

2988
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,480
這樣方便

2989
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,480
可是這樣就會被嫌棄說那個

2990
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,480
像你剛剛講的

2991
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,480
字太小

2992
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,480
這件事情我被嫌了大概100遍

2993
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,480
好這個我也可以稍微

2994
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,480
做經驗分享

2995
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,480
我在換這個workflow之前呢

2996
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,480
我有

2997
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,480
另外一個就是workflow假設

2998
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,480
這個是1這是2.0

2999
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,480
我有一個1.5workflow

3000
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,480
就是

3001
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,480
存檔的時候不要直接存EPS

3002
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,480
你像MATLAB可以存

3003
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,480
FIG檔

3004
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,480
我不知道RR可不可以

3005
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,480
就是某一種文

3006
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,480
某一種圖檔

3007
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,480
它是可以再被載入

3008
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,480
然後再重新調格式的

3009
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,480
像說如果是MATLAB的話它有一個檔案叫做

3010
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,480
FIG檔

3011
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,480
然後這個檔案呢你可以

3012
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,480
再被MATLAB載入之後

3013
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,480
它跟MATLAB產生圖是

3014
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,480
完全一樣的

3015
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
就它會把這些

3016
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,480
格式啊字啊全部都是

3017
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,480
儲存起來存到那個FIG檔

3018
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,480
裡面

3019
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,480
那所以我的workflow

3020
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,480
1.5就是

3021
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,480
除了存PNG

3022
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
EPS之外我還會存一個FIG檔

3023
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,480
然後

3024
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,480
1.5的workflow就是說

3025
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,480
假設字太小我就打開FIG檔

3026
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,480
調這個字的大小

3027
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,480
再存成一次EPS

3028
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,480
對

3029
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,480
那這個算是

3030
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,480
workflow 1.5啦

3031
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,480
那勉強可以啦

3032
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,480
你就看這個字太小

3033
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,480
那我就是再開一次再調一次

3034
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,480
再存一次

3035
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,480
是可以

3036
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,480
對

3037
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
如果是R的話

3038
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,480
可能要再

3039
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,480
應該是有個相對應的格式它可以存成

3040
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,480
就是最原始

3041
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,480
就是可編輯的

3042
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,480
可能要找一下是哪一個格式

3043
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,480
對

3044
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,480
我就要研究一下

3045
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,480
這個好處就是說

3046
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,480
你不用你程式不用再重跑啦

3047
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,480
因為你的圖是

3048
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,480
就是可編輯的圖已經是

3049
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,480
存好了

3050
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,480
對

3051
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,480
這算是使用經驗

3052
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,480
那初學者還是

3053
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,480
EPS我還蠻建議的

3054
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,480
就是方便而且又是像量圖

3055
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,480
嗯

3056
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,480
好

3057
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,480
那

3058
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,480
請問還有什麼問題嗎

3059
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,480
目前好像還好

3060
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,480
就是總之就是

3061
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
就是多練習嘛

3062
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,480
對其實就是取決於說

3063
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,480
你

3064
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,480
你用data做了多少

3065
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,480
事情就是

3066
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
當你做越多的報告你就會遇到

3067
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,480
越多的

3068
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,480
小地方需要克服這樣

3069
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,480
對那

3070
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,480
當你都克服之後你就

3071
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,480
這東西就會變成是你的這樣

3072
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,480
那當然你

3073
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,480
如果想要跟我討論我也

3074
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,480
非常歡迎我也會把

3075
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,480
相對應的code

3076
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,480
就是把一些code給

3077
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,480
大家看這樣讓大家知道

3078
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,480
這是怎麼做的

3079
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,480
對

3080
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,480
我覺得Latex Community它還蠻

3081
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,480
都還蠻和善的啦

3082
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,480
你去Google它都可以找到code

3083
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,480
那我很多code也都是拼湊的

3084
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,480
來的

3085
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480
對

3086
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,480
所以我覺得

3087
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,480
我覺得重點是要

3088
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,480
要有人一起討論啦如果有人一起討論的話

3089
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,480
就是可能有大家不同的做法

3090
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,480
對

3091
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,480
好謝謝

3092
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,480
現在大家問題好像都差不多了

3093
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,480
那我想請問俊霖有特別想要再

3094
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,480
補充嗎

3095
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,480
跟大家講一兩句話就是給所有

3096
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,480
想學Latex的人

3097
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,480
因為我想之後等你講完這段小節

3098
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,480
我就把錄影就關了

3099
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,480
OK

3100
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
好了

3101
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,480
我覺得Latex還是取決於

3102
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,480
你的

3103
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,480
你想要做什麼文件

3104
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,480
像這張圖

3105
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
如果你只是要很簡單的

3106
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,480
做個research note的話

3107
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,480
又無所謂的

3108
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,480
可是當你的文件

3109
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,480
複雜度越來越高的時候

3110
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,480
當你要寫論文寫書的時候

3111
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,480
Latex我

3112
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,480
私心推薦啦

3113
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,480
當然一剛開始學習

3114
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
門檻是比較高的

3115
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,480
可是如果有相對應的機會去練習

3116
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,480
嘗試把自己的報告用Latex

3117
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,480
去做的話

3118
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,480
我相信大家也都會

3119
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,480
上升

3120
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,480
大家都可以發paper

3121
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,480
好那就這我這集的小節

3122
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,480
謝謝講者

3123
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,480
那這樣我就先把錄影就關起來了
