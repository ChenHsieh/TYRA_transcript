0	10000	Yes, Project Terra is an international platform for sharing information.
10000	16000	We hope that scholars from all over the world can share with us
16000	20000	the results of our current research and development,
20000	24000	and more importantly, what is the trend of development.
24000	30000	This is not something you can easily find in Taiwan.
30000	36000	Project Terra can also provide people who are doing research
36000	38000	with opportunities to exchange and collaborate.
38000	42000	So we hold a seminar like this every week.
42000	46000	The speakers are basically all members,
46000	51000	and they will share their new ideas and research trends.
51000	57000	Project Terra is a self-releasing organization
57000	60000	that is dedicated to public service.
60000	66000	We have no intention of making any profit.
66000	72000	All of our members are very enthusiastic doctoral students and post-doctoral students.
72000	79000	You can see our website.
79000	83000	If you are interested in Project Terra,
83000	89000	you can take a look at our website.
89000	93000	If you are interested in Project Terra,
93000	98000	and would like to keep in touch with us,
98000	108000	you can join our membership.
108000	112000	If you can find other people to work with,
112000	119000	we will be happy to help you.
119000	124000	If you have any questions,
124000	127000	you can ask us directly.
127000	131000	We are usually very free to talk.
131000	134000	Sure, no problem.
134000	137000	I would like to remind you that
137000	140000	when we have more and more listeners,
140000	143000	we will set the volume to silent.
143000	147000	So if you remember to click on the microphone icon
147000	149000	before speaking,
149000	152000	you can ask questions or
152000	155000	if you have any questions,
155000	159000	you can directly talk to the speaker, Beta.
159000	164000	Okay, Beta, let's get started.
189000	203000	For some reason, I can't share the screen.
203000	206000	Let me re-join.
233000	243000	Okay, thank you, Ted.
243000	246000	My name is Chengxinda.
246000	248000	My Chinese name is Ergongcheng.
248000	250000	My surname is Daoda.
250000	255000	Today, I would like to thank Ted and Terra
255000	257000	for giving me the opportunity to introduce
257000	260000	a method we are developing.
260000	262000	This is a new method.
262000	265000	The main purpose of this method is to deal with
265000	267000	the interaction between light and matter.
267000	269000	We hope to provide a new way
269000	272000	to do this.
272000	275000	The method we propose is called
275000	278000	Mixed Quantum Classical Electrodynamics.
278000	280000	In English, it should be called
280000	284000	Quantum-Fixed Mixed Electrodynamics.
284000	287000	I will introduce to you in detail
287000	290000	what kind of method it is.
291000	295000	Okay, let me introduce myself.
295000	297000	My name is Chengxinda.
297000	301000	My background is that when I was in Taiwan,
301000	305000	I was studying math and physics in college.
305000	307000	I majored in math and physics.
307000	309000	Later, for some reason,
309000	311000	when I applied to go to college,
311000	313000	I saw that there was a program called
313000	314000	Chemical Physics in Columbia.
314000	319000	I thought it was very similar to what I was doing.
319000	321000	It was also something I was interested in.
321000	323000	So I applied to this program.
323000	325000	I was very lucky to apply to this program.
325000	326000	I found out that when I came to the United States,
326000	328000	I became a chemical physicist.
328000	331000	I have been used as a chemical physicist from beginning to end.
331000	333000	Because of this reason,
333000	336000	I am now working as a chemical physicist
336000	339000	at Penn University.
339000	342000	To sum up,
342000	345000	I use the theory of physics
345000	348000	and the computational method developed in physics
348000	351000	to study the problem of chemistry.
351000	353000	My professional field is
353000	356000	studying dynamics,
356000	358000	which is the theory of dynamics
358000	360000	and the computational method of dynamics.
360000	363000	Specifically,
363000	365000	my Ph.D. is in Columbia.
365000	367000	I am doing chemical dynamics,
367000	369000	that is,
369000	373000	electromagnetic dynamics in a chemical environment.
373000	374000	My postdoc,
374000	376000	what I am doing now
376000	378000	is a little different from my Ph.D.
378000	381000	I am doing the interaction of light and matter.
381000	382000	Today,
382000	384000	my talk will focus on
384000	387000	my postdoc work.
387000	389000	OK.
389000	390000	First of all, what is light?
390000	392000	We often say that light is an object.
392000	394000	Basically,
394000	398000	light is a very important thing in everyday life.
398000	400000	Light is basically an electromagnetic wave.
400000	402000	Electromagnetic waves
402000	405000	are basically the source of all our information.
405000	407000	We see things in this world.
407000	409000	From the greatest extent,
409000	411000	how do we know
411000	413000	what happens on other planets
413000	415000	or on Mars, for example?
415000	417000	We can
417000	420000	reflect the light of the sun from Mars
420000	423000	and see from the spectrum of sunlight
423000	426000	what kind of matter there is on Mars.
426000	429000	How much of this matter is there?
429000	431000	Then,
431000	433000	there are more possibilities
433000	436000	in the development of modern science.
436000	438000	These are no longer visible light.
438000	441000	We have different kinds of light
441000	445000	from low energy to high energy.
445000	447000	Then, from the low energy range,
447000	449000	we have NMR
449000	452000	to Raman
452000	454000	or IR spectrum.
454000	455000	These things are
455000	458000	lower than visible light.
458000	461000	Within the range of higher than visible light,
461000	463000	there is UV,
463000	465000	which is ultraviolet,
465000	467000	and
467000	469000	X-ray spectroscopy, which is more powerful.
469000	471000	Basically, our feature is that
471000	473000	basically,
473000	475000	this
475000	477000	spectroscopy
477000	479000	shows that
479000	481000	the stronger the energy,
481000	483000	the deeper we can see.
483000	486000	Just like in the form of X-ray,
486000	488000	we can see that it can
488000	490000	reflect the electrons in the inner layer.
490000	493000	So you can know what the behavior of the electrons in the inner layer is.
493000	495000	This is one of the functions
495000	497000	of light and matter interaction.
500000	501000	In recent years,
501000	504000	because of the development of nanotechnology,
504000	506000	we can make our devices
506000	508000	in a smaller scale.
508000	511000	So we can even use light,
511000	513000	the quality of light,
513000	515000	to manipulate matter,
515000	517000	to change the nature of matter.
517000	519000	For example,
519000	521000	we can put
521000	523000	a chemical reaction
523000	525000	in a cavity,
525000	527000	and the nature of the chemical reaction
527000	529000	may be changed.
529000	531000	Or we can put this chemical reaction
531000	533000	on a crystal.
533000	535000	This chemical reaction may have
535000	537000	different behavior.
537000	539000	There are other
539000	541000	different nanostructures,
541000	543000	nanostructures,
543000	545000	which can have different
545000	547000	effects on light-matter interaction
547000	549000	and change the nature of matter.
549000	551000	Another very important example
551000	553000	is that in recent years,
553000	555000	there is a very popular
555000	557000	study
557000	559000	on how we use
559000	561000	light-matter interaction
561000	563000	to change,
563000	565000	for example,
565000	567000	this paper
567000	569000	is a paper
569000	571000	about
571000	573000	the conductivity
573000	575000	of organic semiconductors.
575000	577000	They put a very thin
577000	579000	membrane structure,
579000	581000	and there is a circle
581000	583000	above it,
583000	585000	and attach it
585000	587000	to the organic semiconductor.
587000	589000	It can change
589000	591000	the conductivity of the semiconductor.
591000	593000	It can change it
593000	595000	from a bad conductor
595000	597000	to a better conductor.
597000	599000	But these
599000	601000	modern developments
601000	603000	all use the nature of light-matter.
603000	605000	When we need
605000	607000	to understand the nature of light-matter,
607000	609000	we need to discuss
609000	611000	what is light
611000	613000	and what is the difference
613000	615000	between classical light and light-matter.
615000	617000	The classical light
617000	619000	is in the left panel.
619000	621000	We regard classical light as an electromagnetic wave,
621000	623000	and the development
623000	625000	of the electromagnetic wave
625000	627000	is based on
627000	629000	the Maxwell's equation,
629000	631000	which is
631000	633000	the Maxwell's equation.
633000	635000	This is a Maxwell's equation
635000	637000	without a source.
637000	639000	This is a
639000	641000	propagate,
641000	643000	a electromagnetic wave moving forward
643000	645000	without any source.
645000	647000	This is the classical view
647000	649000	of light.
649000	651000	In quantum mechanics,
651000	653000	we regard light as a group
653000	655000	of energy.
655000	657000	Its energy
657000	659000	is discretized.
659000	661000	You may have heard of
661000	663000	the Uncertainty Principle,
663000	665000	which is
665000	667000	the Uncertainty Principle.
667000	669000	The Uncertainty Principle
669000	671000	in light
671000	673000	corresponds to
673000	675000	the distribution of energy.
675000	677000	The energy may not be
677000	679000	only one energy,
679000	681000	but a distribution of probability.
681000	683000	How does quantum mechanics
683000	685000	evolve light?
685000	687000	It is based on
687000	689000	the Heisenberg equation.
689000	691000	The H is an operator
691000	693000	in quantum mechanics.
693000	695000	The H is an operator
695000	697000	in quantum mechanics.
697000	699000	The H is an operator
699000	701000	in quantum mechanics.
701000	703000	This is a description
703000	705000	of how light
705000	707000	evolves
707000	709000	in a space.
711000	713000	What is the difference
713000	715000	between classical
715000	717000	and quantum mechanics?
717000	719000	Let's take a look
719000	721000	at the matter part.
721000	723000	We can also see
723000	725000	what classical matter
725000	727000	and quantum matter are.
727000	729000	Classical matter
729000	731000	is a particle
731000	733000	or many particles.
733000	735000	Many particles
735000	737000	follow
737000	739000	Newton's law
739000	741000	in quantum mechanics.
741000	743000	We all know
743000	745000	classical mechanics.
745000	747000	A particle has a certain speed
747000	749000	and this speed changes over time.
749000	751000	In classical
751000	753000	quantum mechanics,
753000	755000	we take
755000	757000	the energy
757000	759000	as a series.
763000	765000	In quantum mechanics,
765000	767000	we describe
767000	769000	the energy
769000	771000	as a wave function.
771000	773000	In quantum mechanics,
773000	775000	we describe
775000	777000	the energy
777000	779000	as a wave function.
779000	781000	The wave function
781000	783000	is a
783000	785000	distribution
785000	787000	in the direction
787000	789000	of space and momentum.
789000	791000	It is not a solid
791000	793000	particle.
793000	795000	It is a
795000	797000	distribution
797000	799000	in the direction
799000	801000	of space
801000	803000	and momentum.
803000	805000	It is a
805000	807000	distribution in the direction
807000	809000	of space and momentum.
809000	811000	It is a distribution
811000	813000	in the direction
813000	815000	of space
815000	817000	and momentum.
817000	819000	It follows
819000	821000	Schrödinger's equation.
821000	823000	It follows
823000	825000	classical and quantum mechanics.
825000	827000	It follows quantum mechanics
827000	829000	and quantum light mechanics.
829000	831000	When we describe
831000	833000	the interaction
833000	835000	of modern light
835000	837000	and quantum mechanics,
837000	839000	we can use
839000	841000	quantum light
841000	843000	and quantum mechanics.
843000	845000	When we have quantum light
845000	847000	and quantum mechanics together,
847000	849000	we can get
849000	851000	quantum electromagnetic energy
851000	853000	In QED,
853000	855000	we can
855000	857000	integrate the matter
857000	859000	and light
859000	861000	into the same wave function.
861000	863000	Then they will have a combined Hamiltonian.
863000	865000	Then they use this huge thing
865000	867000	to evolve together.
867000	869000	This can include
869000	871000	all the interaction
871000	873000	in high-level quantum mechanics.
873000	875000	But this is
875000	877000	a very, very large
877000	879000	calculation.
879000	881000	It is very difficult
881000	883000	to do a real calculation
883000	885000	except for some basic models.
885000	887000	One of the reasons
887000	889000	is that the total wave function
889000	891000	contains a lot of
891000	893000	degrees of freedom.
893000	895000	There are a lot of variables
895000	897000	in it.
897000	899000	In a real situation,
899000	901000	for example,
901000	903000	I take a real nanoparticle
903000	905000	or a real
905000	907000	nanostructure
907000	909000	to calculate this thing.
909000	911000	Basically,
911000	913000	the current theory can't do it.
913000	915000	So we have
915000	917000	a more
917000	919000	compromise approach.
919000	921000	We develop a set
921000	923000	called Mixed Quantum Classical,
923000	925000	which is a combination of classical quantum
925000	927000	electromagnetic theory.
927000	929000	In this, we treat
929000	931000	light as classical,
931000	933000	as classical,
933000	935000	and material as matter.
935000	937000	Therefore,
937000	939000	we don't need to evolve
939000	941000	the light.
941000	943000	We only need to care about
943000	945000	the behavior of matter.
945000	947000	Then we treat
947000	949000	the behavior of light
949000	951000	as a time-dependent perturbation.
951000	953000	We treat it as
953000	955000	a driving force.
955000	957000	It's like
957000	959000	something is pushing
959000	961000	matter
961000	963000	into evolution.
963000	965000	This is a more
965000	967000	practical approach,
967000	969000	but it has some problems.
969000	971000	Of course,
971000	973000	it's OK for some problems.
973000	975000	This is not
975000	977000	the method we first proposed.
977000	979000	This method has been done by many people.
979000	981000	But it still has some problems.
981000	983000	The first problem
983000	985000	is that it has no feedback.
985000	987000	The so-called feedback is that
987000	989000	we treat the light here
989000	991000	as bending,
991000	993000	and we don't
993000	995000	transfer any energy
995000	997000	to the light.
997000	999000	We don't
999000	1001000	transfer any feedback
1001000	1003000	to the light.
1003000	1005000	Basically,
1005000	1007000	if you take the whole system,
1007000	1009000	the light and matter
1009000	1011000	together,
1011000	1013000	you will find that
1013000	1015000	this theory does not meet the energy conservation.
1015000	1017000	The second problem is that
1017000	1019000	we don't have fluctuation.
1019000	1021000	There is an uncertainty principle.
1021000	1023000	In other words,
1023000	1025000	I should have a
1025000	1027000	standard difference
1027000	1029000	between light and matter.
1029000	1031000	Because
1031000	1033000	my thing is a
1033000	1035000	distribution,
1035000	1037000	I should have a
1037000	1039000	distribution width.
1039000	1041000	But here,
1041000	1043000	because we use classical light,
1043000	1045000	there is no
1045000	1047000	fluctuation.
1047000	1049000	Another problem
1049000	1051000	is that
1051000	1053000	because we treat it as
1053000	1055000	time-dependent perturbation,
1055000	1057000	it is a linear response.
1057000	1059000	Basically,
1059000	1061000	the material
1061000	1063000	responds to
1063000	1065000	what the light pushes.
1065000	1067000	The light pushes
1067000	1069000	very hard, and it responds very hard.
1069000	1071000	However,
1071000	1073000	in strong coupling,
1073000	1075000	if the light pushes very hard,
1075000	1077000	it can change
1077000	1079000	the quality of light.
1079000	1081000	This theory
1081000	1083000	cannot be explained.
1083000	1085000	The most serious problem
1085000	1087000	is that
1087000	1089000	it cannot capture
1089000	1091000	a very important
1091000	1093000	physical quality called spontaneous emission.
1093000	1095000	In Chinese, it is called spontaneous emission.
1095000	1097000	I will explain what it is later.
1097000	1099000	These problems
1099000	1101000	cause
1101000	1103000	classical methods
1103000	1105000	to be stuck there.
1105000	1107000	It can't explain
1107000	1109000	the quantum mechanics
1109000	1111000	we want to explain.
1111000	1113000	So,
1113000	1115000	my job
1115000	1117000	is to
1117000	1119000	develop a new
1119000	1121000	method
1121000	1123000	based on
1123000	1125000	mixed quantum classical dynamics.
1125000	1127000	We hope
1127000	1129000	to develop
1129000	1131000	a new method
1131000	1133000	that
1133000	1135000	can
1135000	1137000	reconstruct
1137000	1139000	spontaneous emission.
1139000	1141000	We can
1141000	1143000	enforce
1145000	1147000	energy conservation.
1147000	1149000	We can also
1149000	1151000	add
1151000	1153000	the fluctuation
1153000	1155000	of classical light.
1155000	1157000	How do we
1157000	1159000	do this?
1159000	1161000	Sorry, I have a question.
1161000	1163000	Please go ahead.
1163000	1165000	I want to ask
1165000	1167000	because
1167000	1169000	using all quantum mechanics
1169000	1171000	is a bit difficult.
1171000	1173000	We cannot calculate it
1173000	1175000	by analytical solution.
1175000	1177000	For example, can't we calculate
1177000	1179000	molecular?
1179000	1181000	Can't we calculate single element?
1181000	1183000	Can't we calculate many-body?
1183000	1185000	Yes,
1185000	1187000	usually many-body
1187000	1189000	is
1189000	1191000	exponential n.
1191000	1193000	Think about
1193000	1195000	how many particles
1195000	1197000	exponential n
1197000	1199000	can't run fast.
1201000	1203000	What we can do
1203000	1205000	is
1205000	1207000	to treat some degree of freedom
1207000	1209000	as classical.
1209000	1211000	There are many good classical methods
1211000	1213000	to propagate Maxwell's equation.
1213000	1215000	For example,
1215000	1217000	single molecule
1217000	1219000	can be calculated?
1219000	1221000	Yes.
1221000	1223000	As a
1223000	1225000	chemist,
1225000	1227000	I want to do
1227000	1229000	something practical.
1229000	1231000	I see.
1231000	1233000	I am doing high-performance.
1233000	1235000	I don't know.
1235000	1237000	I only calculate one by one.
1237000	1239000	Two or three more
1239000	1241000	are difficult.
1241000	1243000	What we want to do
1243000	1245000	is to put
1245000	1247000	a molecule
1247000	1249000	into a cavity.
1251000	1253000	I see.
1253000	1255000	Is LR
1255000	1257000	the same
1257000	1259000	as Lindblad
1259000	1261000	equation operator?
1261000	1263000	Thank you.
1263000	1265000	Is it?
1265000	1267000	I just want to make sure.
1267000	1269000	It is very similar.
1269000	1271000	I will not
1271000	1273000	write it down.
1273000	1275000	It is very similar to
1275000	1277000	Lindblad,
1277000	1279000	but it can't be written as
1279000	1281000	Lindblad form.
1281000	1283000	It is a non-linear term.
1283000	1285000	It is not like Lindblad.
1285000	1287000	It is a linear term.
1287000	1289000	It is a time-dependent
1289000	1291000	and skewed Lindblad.
1291000	1293000	I see.
1293000	1295000	Keep going.
1295000	1297000	I am looking forward to it.
1297000	1299000	I will talk about it
1299000	1301000	later.
1301000	1303000	Basically,
1303000	1305000	what we want to do
1305000	1307000	is to
1307000	1309000	make a low-energy
1309000	1311000	chemical system.
1311000	1313000	We don't
1313000	1315000	consider
1315000	1317000	relative efficiency.
1317000	1319000	We don't consider it.
1319000	1321000	Next,
1321000	1323000	we will talk about
1323000	1325000	spontaneous emission.
1325000	1327000	What is
1327000	1329000	spontaneous emission?
1329000	1331000	The quantum theory of spontaneous emission
1331000	1333000	was proposed by Dirac
1333000	1335000	in 1927.
1335000	1337000	Before Dirac,
1337000	1339000	Einstein introduced
1339000	1341000	spontaneous emission.
1341000	1343000	In 1927,
1343000	1345000	he introduced
1345000	1347000	spontaneous emission
1347000	1349000	from the first principle.
1349000	1351000	So,
1351000	1353000	I consider it
1353000	1355000	as a major contribution.
1355000	1357000	What is spontaneous emission?
1357000	1359000	It is basically
1359000	1361000	a transition.
1361000	1363000	It is a transition from
1363000	1365000	a stimulated state to an excited state.
1365000	1367000	In short,
1367000	1369000	I have an electron.
1369000	1371000	It is in a stimulated state.
1371000	1373000	It is in an excited state.
1373000	1375000	It emits the same light
1375000	1377000	as the transition energy.
1377000	1379000	This is called spontaneous emission.
1379000	1381000	The most important thing is
1381000	1383000	a quantum system,
1383000	1385000	a two-level system,
1385000	1387000	a stimulated state and an excited state.
1387000	1389000	It still emits
1389000	1391000	in vacuum.
1391000	1393000	This is because
1393000	1395000	in quantum theory,
1395000	1397000	we use
1397000	1399000	a thing called
1399000	1401000	zero-point energy.
1401000	1403000	It represents the
1403000	1405000	minimum energy of light in vacuum.
1405000	1407000	Some theories
1407000	1409000	correspond to
1409000	1411000	vacuum fluctuation.
1411000	1413000	Although it is in vacuum,
1413000	1415000	it still
1415000	1417000	interacts with
1417000	1419000	the quantum system
1419000	1421000	to emit spontaneous emission.
1421000	1423000	Why is
1423000	1425000	spontaneous emission
1425000	1427000	so important?
1427000	1429000	Fundamentally,
1429000	1431000	it is a quantum process.
1431000	1433000	In classical theory,
1433000	1435000	it is impossible
1435000	1437000	to get spontaneous emission.
1437000	1439000	Second,
1439000	1441000	spontaneous emission
1441000	1443000	is responsible
1443000	1445000	for almost
1445000	1447000	all light.
1447000	1449000	The light we can see
1449000	1451000	is because of spontaneous emission.
1451000	1453000	Zero light,
1453000	1455000	visible light,
1455000	1457000	the mechanism at the bottom
1457000	1459000	is because of spontaneous emission.
1459000	1461000	It is a
1461000	1463000	leading theory
1463000	1465000	of quantum electrodynamics.
1465000	1467000	After Dirac
1467000	1469000	in 1927,
1469000	1471000	a group of people
1471000	1473000	started to invest in this field.
1473000	1475000	Pauli, Wigner,
1475000	1477000	Eisenberg, Fermi,
1477000	1479000	Freeman Dyson,
1479000	1481000	and Feynman.
1481000	1483000	They started to do
1483000	1485000	QED research.
1487000	1489000	If we
1489000	1491000	use
1491000	1493000	mixed quantum classical equations
1493000	1495000	to deal with
1495000	1497000	spontaneous emission,
1497000	1499000	what will happen?
1499000	1501000	I am going to
1501000	1503000	explain
1503000	1505000	what is
1505000	1507000	mixed quantum classical.
1507000	1509000	First,
1509000	1511000	we can see
1511000	1513000	my mouse.
1513000	1515000	Great!
1515000	1517000	Can you see my mouse?
1517000	1519000	Yes.
1519000	1521000	There is a little
1521000	1523000	lag.
1523000	1525000	If you want to stop,
1525000	1527000	please slow down.
1527000	1529000	No problem.
1529000	1531000	First,
1531000	1533000	let's assume
1533000	1535000	a two-level system
1535000	1537000	is placed in the vacuum.
1537000	1539000	The system is
1539000	1541000	completely in spontaneous emission state.
1541000	1543000	There is no
1543000	1545000	distribution
1545000	1547000	in the state.
1547000	1549000	In
1549000	1551000	mixed quantum classical,
1551000	1553000	there is no spontaneous emission.
1553000	1555000	This is the line
1555000	1557000	I am drawing.
1557000	1559000	The line I am drawing
1559000	1561000	is the time axis.
1561000	1563000	The axis is the
1563000	1565000	population of
1565000	1567000	the stimulated state.
1571000	1573000	The red line
1573000	1575000	represents the
1575000	1577000	time axis.
1577000	1579000	The system
1579000	1581000	does not emit any light.
1581000	1583000	First of all,
1583000	1585000	this is wrong
1585000	1587000	in terms of quality.
1587000	1589000	However,
1589000	1591000	we found
1591000	1593000	that
1593000	1595000	if I am not
1595000	1597000	completely in the
1597000	1599000	stimulated state,
1599000	1601000	for example,
1601000	1603000	I have half
1603000	1605000	of the stimulated state and half of the
1605000	1607000	stimulated state,
1607000	1609000	I will find that
1609000	1611000	there seems to be a little
1611000	1613000	spontaneous emission.
1613000	1615000	However,
1615000	1617000	there is still a gap
1617000	1619000	compared to the
1619000	1621000	real spontaneous emission,
1621000	1623000	the black curve.
1623000	1625000	This is
1625000	1627000	a method we have tried.
1627000	1629000	We have tried other methods.
1629000	1631000	We have tried other three methods.
1631000	1633000	For example,
1633000	1635000	we have tried MCCC.
1635000	1637000	It is called SQC,
1637000	1639000	or CPA.
1639000	1641000	These other methods
1641000	1643000	have problems.
1643000	1645000	The right side of the graph
1645000	1647000	represents the curve in the middle
1647000	1649000	of the graph.
1649000	1651000	The curve in the middle
1651000	1653000	represents the spontaneous emission rate.
1653000	1655000	The red line
1655000	1657000	is the red line
1657000	1659000	in the left side of the graph.
1659000	1661000	From there,
1661000	1663000	I get the emission rate
1663000	1665000	and compare it
1665000	1667000	with the real
1667000	1669000	spontaneous emission rate.
1669000	1671000	Sometimes,
1671000	1673000	for example,
1673000	1675000	when it is almost at ground state,
1675000	1677000	it will be very close
1677000	1679000	to the real
1679000	1681000	spontaneous emission rate.
1681000	1683000	However,
1683000	1685000	it will get worse and worse.
1685000	1687000	When more and more population
1687000	1689000	are at ground state,
1689000	1691000	the distance
1691000	1693000	will get bigger and bigger.
1693000	1695000	The other methods
1695000	1697000	have the opposite
1697000	1699000	effect.
1699000	1701000	This is the second problem.
1701000	1703000	The last problem
1703000	1705000	is
1705000	1707000	a very old problem.
1707000	1709000	Our factory
1709000	1711000	is a classical factory,
1711000	1713000	so there is no
1713000	1715000	any fluctuation.
1715000	1717000	If I want to calculate
1717000	1719000	anything about fluctuation,
1719000	1721000	I must be wrong.
1721000	1723000	The method we propose
1723000	1725000	is called
1725000	1727000	PLOS R.
1727000	1729000	We call it
1729000	1731000	the average length method.
1731000	1733000	We use PLOS R
1733000	1735000	because it is the simplest
1735000	1737000	average length method.
1737000	1739000	In the average length method,
1739000	1741000	we add
1741000	1743000	LR,
1743000	1745000	which is a little bit like
1745000	1747000	the Limplot form.
1747000	1749000	What is PLOS R?
1749000	1751000	It has three functions.
1751000	1753000	The first one is
1753000	1755000	an additional relaxation.
1755000	1757000	We take some population
1757000	1759000	from the ground state
1759000	1761000	to the ground state.
1761000	1763000	The additional population
1763000	1765000	is based on
1765000	1767000	the Ehrenfest equation
1767000	1769000	to deduce
1769000	1771000	how much is missing
1771000	1773000	and how much
1773000	1775000	relaxation we need to add
1775000	1777000	to make it
1777000	1779000	exactly the same
1779000	1781000	as spontaneous emission rate.
1781000	1783000	This is the first thing.
1783000	1785000	The second thing is
1785000	1787000	that we took some population
1787000	1789000	from the ground state
1789000	1791000	to the ground state
1791000	1793000	in the previous step.
1793000	1795000	Where does
1795000	1797000	this energy go?
1797000	1799000	This energy should be
1799000	1801000	put into
1801000	1803000	the power plant.
1803000	1805000	It should
1805000	1807000	become
1807000	1809000	a part of
1809000	1811000	the power plant
1811000	1813000	or the magnetic field
1813000	1815000	to ensure
1815000	1817000	that
1817000	1819000	the whole system
1819000	1821000	is energy-stable.
1821000	1823000	So we designed a method
1823000	1825000	to make
1825000	1827000	this energy
1827000	1829000	to be put
1829000	1831000	into the power plant.
1831000	1833000	We also designed
1833000	1835000	a thing called
1835000	1837000	stochastic,
1837000	1839000	which is a random
1839000	1841000	defacing.
1841000	1843000	In a random process,
1843000	1845000	the system
1845000	1847000	will decide
1847000	1849000	whether to
1849000	1851000	turn the system's phase
1851000	1853000	a little bit.
1853000	1855000	It can decide
1855000	1857000	whether to
1857000	1859000	turn the system's phase
1859000	1861000	a little bit.
1861000	1863000	This small
1863000	1865000	stochastic defacing
1865000	1867000	introduces
1867000	1869000	the fluctuation
1869000	1871000	of the classical
1871000	1873000	power plant.
1873000	1875000	I'm not running
1875000	1877000	one trajectory,
1877000	1879000	but many trajectories
1879000	1881000	to balance
1881000	1883000	its trajectory behavior.
1883000	1885000	We can
1885000	1887000	tell
1887000	1889000	what is
1889000	1891000	the coherent
1891000	1893000	of the power plant
1893000	1895000	we are
1895000	1897000	generating.
1897000	1899000	Is there
1899000	1901000	a part of
1901000	1903000	coherent,
1903000	1905000	which means
1905000	1907000	it has
1907000	1909000	a certain frequency,
1909000	1911000	and the other part
1911000	1913000	is incoherent.
1913000	1915000	The incoherent part
1915000	1917000	means the frequency
1917000	1919000	shifts a little bit,
1919000	1921000	and the value
1921000	1923000	is zero.
1923000	1925000	With these three
1925000	1927000	additional
1927000	1929000	plus-or strategies,
1929000	1931000	we can
1931000	1933000	recover
1933000	1935000	the green line.
1935000	1937000	We can
1937000	1939000	recover
1939000	1941000	the spontaneous
1941000	1943000	emission rate.
1943000	1945000	It's a little bit
1945000	1947000	of a pain in the ass.
1947000	1949000	We know
1949000	1951000	the difference,
1951000	1953000	and we can
1953000	1955000	recover the spontaneous
1955000	1957000	emission rate.
1957000	1959000	However,
1959000	1961000	this is not
1961000	1963000	the selling point.
1963000	1965000	The selling point is
1965000	1967000	that we can
1967000	1969000	recover
1969000	1971000	the correct emission rate.
1971000	1973000	Although our emission
1973000	1975000	will be a pile of
1975000	1977000	thousands of
1977000	1979000	classical
1979000	1981000	power plants,
1981000	1983000	on average,
1983000	1985000	it will be
1985000	1987000	consistent with the
1987000	1989000	quantum intensity.
1989000	1991000	Let me
1991000	1993000	explain this to you.
1993000	1995000	The blue line
1995000	1997000	is the intensity.
1997000	1999000	It's like the
1999000	2001000	square of the power plant.
2001000	2003000	The blue line
2003000	2005000	is the
2005000	2007000	square of the
2007000	2009000	power plant.
2009000	2011000	We all know
2011000	2013000	that the
2013000	2015000	difference between
2015000	2017000	the average square
2017000	2019000	and the average square
2019000	2021000	is the standard difference.
2021000	2023000	From 50-50,
2023000	2025000	when the
2025000	2027000	system is
2027000	2029000	50-50,
2029000	2031000	the standard difference
2031000	2033000	is smaller.
2033000	2035000	If we
2035000	2037000	start from
2037000	2039000	100%,
2039000	2041000	from
2041000	2043000	78,
2043000	2045000	the two-level
2045000	2047000	system
2047000	2049000	will have a
2049000	2051000	very big standard difference.
2051000	2053000	What does this mean?
2053000	2055000	It means that
2055000	2057000	from this 100%
2057000	2059000	two-level system,
2059000	2061000	there is no coherence emission.
2061000	2063000	The blue line below
2063000	2065000	is the coherence emission.
2065000	2067000	Anyway,
2067000	2069000	we are
2069000	2071000	very satisfied
2071000	2073000	with this result.
2073000	2075000	We can see that
2075000	2077000	although we use
2077000	2079000	classical power plants,
2079000	2081000	we are still satisfied
2081000	2083000	with this result.
2085000	2087000	Now, let's recap
2087000	2089000	what we have done.
2089000	2091000	We have proposed
2091000	2093000	ERMFES PLUS R
2093000	2095000	Mixed Chromium Classical Dynamics.
2095000	2097000	It can recover
2097000	2099000	spontaneous emission.
2099000	2101000	It also satisfies
2101000	2103000	energy conservation.
2103000	2105000	We even
2105000	2107000	modified
2107000	2109000	ERMFES PLUS R
2109000	2111000	Mixed Chromium Classical Dynamics
2111000	2113000	to simulate
2113000	2115000	quantum fluctuation.
2119000	2121000	I have a question.
2121000	2123000	Sorry.
2123000	2125000	Can you go back
2125000	2127000	to the previous slide?
2127000	2129000	Why is the
2129000	2131000	electric field
2131000	2133000	average
2133000	2135000	not zero?
2137000	2139000	Generally speaking,
2139000	2141000	for spontaneous emission,
2141000	2143000	the average square of
2143000	2145000	the electric field
2145000	2147000	should be zero.
2147000	2149000	The average square of
2149000	2151000	the electric field
2151000	2153000	is only
2153000	2155000	zero in one situation.
2157000	2159000	If the system
2159000	2161000	is fully
2161000	2163000	activated, it is zero.
2163000	2165000	However, when the system
2165000	2167000	is fully activated,
2167000	2169000	the average square of
2169000	2171000	the electric field
2171000	2173000	is not zero.
2173000	2175000	Sorry.
2175000	2177000	My question is
2177000	2179000	for any electromagnetic wave,
2179000	2181000	the average square of
2181000	2183000	the electric field
2183000	2185000	should be zero.
2189000	2191000	The average square of
2191000	2193000	the electric field
2193000	2195000	is zero in one situation.
2195000	2197000	The average square of
2197000	2199000	the electric field
2199000	2201000	is 0.
2201000	2203000	Is it right?
2203000	2205000	Sorry.
2205000	2207000	The average square of
2207000	2209000	the electric field
2209000	2211000	is 0.
2215000	2217000	Sorry.
2217000	2219000	I have absolute value here.
2221000	2223000	I want to compare
2223000	2225000	the difference between
2225000	2227000	coherence emission and
2227000	2229000	all emission.
2231000	2233000	You can think of it as
2233000	2235000	the amplitude of the electric field.
2235000	2237000	It's like a sine.
2237000	2239000	It's the value in front of the sine.
2239000	2241000	Sorry.
2243000	2245000	It's the amplitude of the electric field.
2245000	2247000	It's the square of
2247000	2249000	the amplitude of the electric field
2249000	2251000	and the intensity.
2251000	2253000	I see.
2253000	2255000	Thank you.
2255000	2257000	Let's continue.
2259000	2261000	Now we have this.
2261000	2263000	Very good.
2263000	2265000	I want to do more
2265000	2267000	with this good tool.
2267000	2269000	I don't want to just do two-level system.
2269000	2271000	I want to do a more complicated system.
2271000	2273000	Of course, it can't be too complicated right away.
2273000	2275000	So we looked at two different cases.
2275000	2277000	One is Raman.
2277000	2279000	The first case is Raman scattering.
2279000	2281000	It's to test
2281000	2283000	our
2283000	2285000	Ernefest plus R method.
2285000	2287000	Is there a way to
2287000	2289000	deal with multiple quantum states?
2291000	2293000	The second question
2293000	2295000	is called Moller triplet.
2295000	2297000	Basically, it's a very strong
2297000	2299000	phenomenon.
2299000	2301000	We want to test
2301000	2303000	if Ernefest can handle
2303000	2305000	the electric field in the wall.
2309000	2311000	First,
2311000	2313000	Raman scattering.
2313000	2315000	Raman
2315000	2317000	is basically
2317000	2319000	a
2319000	2321000	Indian scientist.
2321000	2323000	Very cool.
2325000	2327000	The most basic model
2327000	2329000	of Raman scattering
2329000	2331000	is three-level system.
2331000	2333000	You can see on the right
2333000	2335000	0, 1, 2.
2335000	2337000	Energy from 0 to
2337000	2339000	1 to 2.
2339000	2341000	In the beginning,
2341000	2343000	the system
2343000	2345000	is on 0.
2345000	2347000	There is a
2347000	2349000	beam of light coming in.
2349000	2351000	This beam of light will
2351000	2353000	pump the electricity from 0 to 2.
2353000	2355000	0 and 1
2355000	2357000	are not coupled
2357000	2359000	in the system.
2359000	2361000	So,
2361000	2363000	they pump the electricity
2363000	2365000	from 0 to 2.
2365000	2367000	There are two possible
2367000	2369000	pathways from 0 to 2.
2369000	2371000	One is from 2 to 0
2371000	2373000	or from 2 to 1.
2373000	2375000	So,
2375000	2377000	the beam of light
2377000	2379000	comes from every transition.
2379000	2381000	The beam of light
2381000	2383000	is elastic.
2383000	2385000	It is the same frequency
2385000	2387000	from 0 to 2
2387000	2389000	and back to 0.
2389000	2391000	So, it is called elastic process.
2391000	2393000	The other frequency
2393000	2395000	from 2 to 1
2395000	2397000	is called
2397000	2399000	inelastic process.
2399000	2401000	In quantum mechanics,
2401000	2403000	the whole process
2403000	2405000	can be explained
2405000	2407000	by a formula.
2407000	2409000	This is a
2409000	2411000	KHD,
2411000	2413000	Kramer, Heisenberg and Dirac.
2413000	2415000	This is a
2415000	2417000	quantum formula
2417000	2419000	to explain
2419000	2421000	the spectrum.
2421000	2423000	Why
2423000	2425000	Raman Scattering
2425000	2427000	is so important?
2427000	2429000	It contains a lot of important information.
2429000	2431000	For example, it can tell us
2431000	2433000	the excited state,
2433000	2435000	which is the state above.
2435000	2437000	What is the movement
2437000	2439000	of Raman?
2439000	2441000	It also contains a lot of
2441000	2443000	molecular structure information.
2443000	2445000	For example,
2445000	2447000	Raman's
2447000	2449000	spectroscopy is used on the surface.
2449000	2451000	So, it can know
2451000	2453000	the structure of
2453000	2455000	the molecule attached on the surface.
2455000	2457000	Is it straight or curved?
2457000	2459000	There are different
2459000	2461000	Raman's movements.
2461000	2463000	I forgot to mention that
2463000	2465000	Raman has
2465000	2467000	three different transitions
2467000	2469000	with different labels.
2469000	2471000	R stands for Reidy.
2471000	2473000	Reidy means
2473000	2475000	from 2 to 1, which is the elastic part.
2475000	2477000	Stock Raman
2477000	2479000	is from 0 to 2
2479000	2481000	and back to 1.
2481000	2483000	This is from 0 to 2 to 1.
2483000	2485000	This is called
2485000	2487000	Stock's Reidy.
2487000	2489000	Anti-Stock's Reidy is a
2489000	2491000	weaker signal.
2491000	2493000	It still has a chance
2493000	2495000	to go from 1 to 2 and back to 0.
2495000	2497000	This is a weaker
2497000	2499000	signal.
2499000	2501000	OK.
2501000	2503000	Next,
2503000	2505000	basically,
2505000	2507000	we want to know
2507000	2509000	whether Mixed Kronenklassik
2509000	2511000	can
2511000	2513000	capture Raman's scattering.
2513000	2515000	There are some
2515000	2517000	problems here.
2517000	2519000	Basically, Mixed Kronenklassik
2519000	2521000	does not have a plus R.
2521000	2523000	There is only one
2523000	2525000	elastic scattering.
2525000	2527000	There is only one R.
2527000	2529000	You can see it in the
2529000	2531000	picture.
2531000	2533000	I have different
2533000	2535000	scattering frequencies
2535000	2537000	from
2537000	2539000	3 quarters
2539000	2541000	to
2541000	2543000	3 quarters of 0 to 2
2543000	2545000	to more than 0 to 2.
2545000	2547000	There are different frequencies.
2547000	2549000	It is not necessarily resonance.
2549000	2551000	This is Resonance Raman.
2551000	2553000	OK.
2553000	2555000	Although I can get
2555000	2557000	this one,
2557000	2559000	but
2559000	2561000	in Mixed Kronenklassik,
2561000	2563000	I don't have
2563000	2565000	any other mechanism
2565000	2567000	to make it go from 2 to 1.
2567000	2569000	Basically, it is impossible
2569000	2571000	to have any
2571000	2573000	Raman's scattering.
2573000	2575000	In addition, the old problem of MQC
2575000	2577000	is that there is no fluctuation.
2577000	2579000	After adding
2579000	2581000	RMFS plus R solution,
2583000	2585000	we will find that
2585000	2587000	the picture on the right
2587000	2589000	can completely recover
2589000	2591000	Dock's Raman.
2593000	2595000	In fact,
2595000	2597000	we can also get Anti-Stock Raman,
2597000	2599000	but the signal
2599000	2601000	of Anti-Stock Raman is very small.
2603000	2605000	If we draw a
2605000	2607000	log plot,
2607000	2609000	there is a signal,
2609000	2611000	but it is relatively weak,
2611000	2613000	so the signal is very small.
2615000	2617000	We can see
2617000	2619000	the Anti-Stock Raman.
2619000	2621000	But how accurate
2621000	2623000	is this Anti-Stock Raman?
2623000	2625000	So we can
2625000	2627000	compare it
2627000	2629000	with KHD.
2631000	2633000	The picture on the top
2633000	2635000	shows
2635000	2637000	RMFS plus R
2637000	2639000	blue line.
2641000	2643000	It is almost
2643000	2645000	qualitatively agree with
2645000	2647000	quantum mechanics.
2651000	2653000	The red line
2653000	2655000	does not add RMFS plus R.
2655000	2657000	We find that there are
2657000	2659000	several order of magnitude
2659000	2661000	difference.
2661000	2663000	This picture
2663000	2665000	proves that
2665000	2667000	RMFS plus R
2667000	2669000	is not only a quantitative improvement,
2669000	2671000	but also
2671000	2673000	different physics.
2673000	2675000	There is a
2675000	2677000	qualitative difference.
2677000	2679000	Next,
2683000	2685000	we see that
2685000	2687000	Riley and
2687000	2689000	Raman,
2689000	2691000	RMFS plus R
2691000	2693000	is very similar to
2693000	2695000	KHD.
2697000	2699000	Let me
2699000	2701000	recap again.
2701000	2703000	What did we learn
2703000	2705000	from Raman Scattering?
2705000	2707000	RMFS plus R
2707000	2709000	is very similar to
2709000	2711000	KHD.
2711000	2713000	RMFS plus R
2713000	2715000	is very similar to
2715000	2717000	KHD.
2717000	2719000	RMFS plus R
2719000	2721000	allows us to
2721000	2723000	do the multistate transition.
2723000	2725000	allows us to do the multistate transition.
2729000	2731000	We can get a multistate transition
2731000	2733000	with a good
2733000	2735000	quantization.
2737000	2739000	We don't need
2739000	2741000	to use our hands
2741000	2743000	to create a frequency
2743000	2745000	to make it vibrate.
2745000	2747000	We can get a
2747000	2749000	inelastic scattering
2749000	2751000	with RMFS.
2751000	2753000	Lastly,
2753000	2755000	I'm sorry,
2755000	2757000	I interrupted you.
2757000	2759000	You can continue.
2759000	2761000	I have a question.
2761000	2763000	I have a question.
2763000	2765000	RMFS plus R
2765000	2767000	RMFS plus R
2767000	2769000	RMFS plus R
2769000	2771000	RMFS plus R
2771000	2773000	RMFS plus R
2773000	2775000	RMFS plus R
2775000	2777000	RMFS plus R
2777000	2779000	RMFS plus R
2779000	2781000	RMFS plus R
2781000	2783000	RMFS plus R
2783000	2785000	RMFS plus R
2785000	2787000	RMFS plus R
2787000	2789000	RMFS plus R
2789000	2791000	RMFS plus R
2791000	2793000	RMFS plus R
2793000	2795000	RMFS plus R
2795000	2817000	RMFS plus R
2817000	2819000	RMFS plus R
2819000	2821000	RMFS plus R
2821000	2823000	RMFS plus R
2823000	2832000	So if I understand correctly, you add a Resonance Intermediate State in the middle
2832000	2835000	Add a Resonance Intermediate State in the middle
2835000	2844000	Because if it's Fermi's Golden Rule, you choose an energy and all your In and Out will be Resonant with that energy
2845000	2847000	No, what I mean is
2847000	2851000	What I mean is
2851000	2853000	I know
2853000	2856000	For example, I know every transition 2-1
2856000	2858000	2-1 and 2-0
2858000	2861000	They all meet different Fermi's Golden Rule
2861000	2864000	Fermi's Golden Rule is a rate
2864000	2867000	There is a transition rate
2867000	2870000	In my theory
2870000	2872000	I can deduce
2872000	2877000	How much is the difference between RMFS and Fermi's Golden Rule
2877000	2883000	Then I will use those three methods to add the difference
2883000	2885000	That's OK
2885000	2888000	Let me ask
2888000	2892000	Sorry, can you go to the next page?
2892000	2894000	Yes
2894000	2897000	Next, I want to see the picture on the right
2897000	2903000	Sorry, I want to see the picture on the right
2903000	2910000	So the input frequency
2910000	2918000	In these ranges, do you have to re-calculate how to add other parameters?
2918000	2922000	Or these are already
2922000	2925000	Omega i
2925000	2927000	There are ten
2927000	2932000	Do you have to add other parameters ten times?
2932000	2934000	That may be easy
2934000	2936000	I don't understand
2936000	2938000	I just ask
2938000	2939000	It doesn't matter
2939000	2940000	Actually, it doesn't matter
2940000	2945000	Every trajectory is exactly the same
2945000	2947000	Just change a parameter
2947000	2949000	Omega i
2949000	2951000	Yes, I just need to change Omega i
2951000	2953000	I didn't change anything
2953000	2957000	I didn't change anything else in the calculation
2957000	2960000	So I don't need to re-calculate
2960000	2964000	Can I ask a question?
2964000	2968000	Whether it's Rayleigh or Raman
2968000	2970000	You said you want to use Fermi's Golden Rule
2970000	2972000	But in general
2972000	2975000	State 2 is a virtual state
2975000	2977000	So in reality
2977000	2980000	You can't get the real coupling constant
2980000	2983000	How do you solve this problem?
2983000	2988000	Can't get the real coupling constant
2988000	2993000	In practice, you can measure Rayleigh scattering cross-section
2993000	2995000	Or Raman scattering cross-section
2995000	2999000	But you can't get a
3000000	3004000	Real state and virtual state coupling
3004000	3006000	How much is it?
3006000	3009000	Yes
3009000	3011000	It's like this
3011000	3014000	I don't have virtual state and real state coupling here
3014000	3019000	The coupling I use is
3019000	3021000	Resonant coupling
3021000	3023000	I shouldn't say resonant, sorry
3023000	3028000	The coupling I use is actually 1 and 2 coupling
3028000	3031000	Then
3031000	3035000	If you look back from the lab
3035000	3039000	Because my idea is more from
3039000	3044000	First principle
3044000	3047000	If I want to calculate this
3047000	3050000	In fact, the actual molecule to calculate this
3050000	3055000	I will use electronic structure
3055000	3059000	Use electronic structure to calculate the real coupling
3059000	3061000	This coupling
3061000	3063000	Not the real coupling
3063000	3065000	In the electronic structure
3065000	3067000	How big is the coupling
3067000	3069000	This coupling is good
3069000	3072000	This coupling can be calculated in the electronic structure
3072000	3074000	It's a transition dipole moment
3074000	3076000	1 and 2 state transition dipole moment
3076000	3078000	The light I hit
3078000	3080000	Whether there is resonance
3080000	3083000	I use the transition state dipole moment
3084000	3088000	So what you mean is
3088000	3091000	You have real state in the molecule
3091000	3094000	Then you use real state transition dipole moment
3094000	3097000	Then you sum up all these real states
3097000	3100000	Yes
3100000	3104000	Because in this mixed quantum classical
3104000	3107000	I don't have any virtual state
3107000	3112000	It's not like the sum over state theory
3112000	3114000	I have a lot of virtual state
3114000	3116000	No, this is real state
3116000	3118000	Then different frequency
3118000	3122000	Thank you
3122000	3126000	Because it is a bit like a driving system
3126000	3129000	It is a dynamical system
3129000	3134000	I hope this will answer your question
3134000	3137000	Any other questions?
3137000	3139000	No, I will continue
3139000	3141000	Where did I just talk about
3141000	3144000	In the end, we want to say
3144000	3147000	In the end, the problem we want to deal with
3147000	3149000	Is a strong problem
3149000	3151000	What about this strong problem
3151000	3153000	It's called model triplet
3153000	3155000	It is a two-level system
3155000	3157000	Back to a very simple two-level system
3157000	3161000	But there is a very strong classical field
3161000	3165000	What is the biggest feature of model triplet
3165000	3169000	I think the coolest point is that it is classical
3169000	3171000	Classical in quantum now
3171000	3173000	It's a bit like laser
3173000	3175000	It's a coherent state
3175000	3178000	It's very close to classical mechanics
3178000	3181000	Classical mechanics
3181000	3185000	But the spectrum it emits
3185000	3188000	It's a very, very non-classical
3188000	3191000	It's a very quantum spectrum
3191000	3193000	Why is that?
3193000	3195000	Because this field
3195000	3197000	This field is because it is very strong
3197000	3199000	So it's basically
3199000	3201000	It has exceeded all the encirclement theory
3201000	3203000	So we can't use the encirclement theory anymore
3203000	3205000	So in quantum theory
3205000	3209000	It's a bit like a mixing state
3209000	3211000	It's a bit like a hybridization
3211000	3214000	What about the picture in the lower right corner
3214000	3216000	Actually on the left
3216000	3218000	On the left side of this diagonal
3218000	3220000	It's bare state
3220000	3222000	I made
3222000	3225000	Two-level system
3225000	3227000	Generate
3227000	3229000	Sorry
3229000	3232000	Two-level system and light frequency
3232000	3234000	The state generated
3234000	3236000	Draw it out
3236000	3238000	After the hybridization is drawn
3238000	3241000	You will find that the one on the right is the state after the hybridization
3241000	3243000	It's a bit like a mix
3243000	3245000	It's a bit like a dress state
3245000	3247000	But it's light
3247000	3251000	Hybridization is the hybridization of light and two-level system
3251000	3253000	So its energy level
3253000	3255000	Will be changed
3255000	3257000	Then
3257000	3259000	Inside the dress state model on the right
3259000	3261000	It has three different
3261000	3263000	Launch frequency
3263000	3265000	The first one
3265000	3267000	We call it T
3267000	3269000	Why is it called T? It's actually very simple
3269000	3271000	It's called three
3271000	3273000	Three photons
3273000	3275000	You can see it from the highest
3275000	3277000	After one, two, three
3277000	3279000	Three times to the lowest
3279000	3281000	So it's called triple
3281000	3283000	Three photons
3283000	3285000	Then what about F? F is called fluorescence
3285000	3287000	Fluorescence is basically
3287000	3289000	It's the lowest level
3289000	3291000	It's the two closest
3291000	3293000	Between
3293000	3295000	Launch
3295000	3297000	Then the other two
3297000	3299000	It's called Rayleigh
3299000	3301000	Two Rayleigh
3301000	3303000	It goes through two photons
3303000	3305000	It's called Rayleigh
3305000	3307000	That
3307000	3309000	This
3309000	3311000	The whole quantum theory
3311000	3313000	Gave us three different
3313000	3315000	Frequency, which means it's three different
3315000	3317000	Peak
3317000	3319000	Then inside these peaks
3319000	3321000	Will be produced
3321000	3323000	It contains the Rabi frequency
3323000	3325000	Rabi is
3325000	3327000	The gentleman on the left is Rabi
3327000	3329000	He was actually in Columbia before
3329000	3331000	Very cool
3331000	3333000	Then
3333000	3335000	The same we can use this
3335000	3337000	Mixed quantum classical method
3337000	3339000	Let's try
3339000	3341000	We found that if we don't put any
3341000	3343000	Change we don't put any
3343000	3345000	We found that this system is basically
3345000	3347000	Classical in, classical out
3347000	3349000	It's classical in, it's classical out
3349000	3351000	There won't be much change
3351000	3353000	If you were a kid
3353000	3355000	Or high school
3355000	3357000	There is a physical phenomenon
3357000	3359000	That is, you put
3359000	3361000	A pile of protein
3361000	3363000	Put in a
3363000	3365000	Tie a pile of protein
3365000	3367000	Tie a pile of protein on the same pole
3367000	3369000	The pole has a fixed frequency vibration
3369000	3371000	After a long time, they will be synchronized
3371000	3373000	Together
3373000	3375000	This phenomenon is basically the same as what we see here
3375000	3377000	It's like
3377000	3379000	I
3379000	3381000	Although there are many different frequencies in it
3381000	3383000	Run in there
3383000	3385000	In fact, we are looking at
3385000	3387000	This mixed quantum classical
3387000	3389000	In a short time, you will see three peaks
3389000	3391000	We can see three peaks
3391000	3393000	But for a long time, you will find that the two peaks next to it
3393000	3395000	Gradually disappeared
3395000	3397000	Only the middle peak is left
3397000	3399000	Basically it is a
3399000	3401000	Classical driving system
3401000	3403000	Classical in, classical out
3403000	3405000	Nothing else
3405000	3407000	The other is
3407000	3409000	There are other old problems
3409000	3411000	We don't have any fluctuations here
3411000	3413000	That
3413000	3415000	With this plus r
3415000	3417000	We will find that this blue line
3417000	3419000	Is the line after the plus r
3419000	3421000	We can see that they can
3421000	3423000	Have a stable
3423000	3425000	Side peak
3425000	3427000	It won't be because of time
3427000	3429000	It won't disappear because of a long time
3429000	3431000	Why is there a stable side peak?
3431000	3433000	In fact, it is
3433000	3435000	In fact, it is a
3435000	3437000	Return to
3437000	3439000	Random perturbation
3439000	3441000	Stochastic defacing
3441000	3443000	It's a bit like
3443000	3445000	In this classical system
3445000	3447000	Push it from time to time
3447000	3449000	Don't let it fall back
3449000	3451000	The huge frequency
3451000	3453000	Don't let it be forever
3453000	3455000	Classical in, classical out
3455000	3457000	There is a small stochastic
3457000	3459000	Defacing is actually very important here
3459000	3461000	It can make
3461000	3463000	The two side peaks are stable for a long time
3465000	3467000	We want to know
3467000	3469000	Here we can see that
3469000	3471000	These three ratios are r
3471000	3473000	With f and t
3473000	3475000	With
3475000	3477000	All classical theory
3477000	3479000	The prediction is consistent
3479000	3481000	We want to know
3481000	3483000	Is there any other
3483000	3485000	More interesting properties
3485000	3487000	We can compare with classical theory
3487000	3489000	What about here
3489000	3491000	We show
3491000	3493000	This picture above
3493000	3495000	Is the result of an experiment
3495000	3497000	2012
3497000	3499000	The result of the experiment
3499000	3501000	What did it change?
3501000	3503000	It is also a model triplet
3503000	3505000	Then the different lines
3505000	3507000	From the bottom to the top
3507000	3509000	Also different
3509000	3511000	Infrared light frequency
3511000	3513000	Then you will find that
3513000	3515000	There are several features
3515000	3517000	The wind in the middle
3517000	3519000	Almost unchanged
3519000	3521000	But the wind next to it
3521000	3523000	Different
3523000	3525000	Different evolution
3525000	3527000	The first one is
3527000	3529000	Peak position
3529000	3531000	You can see the picture on the right
3531000	3533000	The middle line
3533000	3535000	The middle line
3535000	3537000	The middle line is
3537000	3539000	Central peak
3539000	3541000	It doesn't change much
3541000	3543000	But this
3543000	3545000	Side peak
3545000	3547000	It is with
3547000	3549000	This width is called
3549000	3551000	Many people call
3551000	3553000	Generalized
3553000	3555000	Rabi frequency
3555000	3557000	It is off resonance
3557000	3559000	Not necessarily resonance
3559000	3561000	Rabi frequency
3561000	3563000	This experiment
3563000	3565000	Very well with theory
3565000	3567000	This
3567000	3569000	This peak
3569000	3571000	Basically
3571000	3573000	Basically
3573000	3575000	This
3575000	3577000	The position of the peak is not a rare thing
3577000	3579000	So in practice and theory
3579000	3581000	Not too much
3581000	3583000	Then we
3583000	3585000	In
3585000	3587000	In urbanfest plus r
3587000	3589000	You can also see the same behavior
3589000	3591000	That is to say
3591000	3593000	Central peak
3593000	3595000	Fixed
3595000	3597000	Side peak
3597000	3599000	There is a
3599000	3601000	Generalized Rabi frequency
3601000	3603000	These two pictures
3603000	3605000	A little flip
3605000	3607000	Because I want to be the same as the left
3607000	3609000	X and y are above
3609000	3611000	The experiment is the opposite
3611000	3613000	But if you turn it over
3613000	3615000	The color is correct
3615000	3617000	Blue against blue
3617000	3619000	This is what we observe
3619000	3621000	Very good point
3621000	3623000	This is basically
3623000	3625000	Is not a difficult thing
3625000	3627000	But
3627000	3629000	Excuse me
3629000	3631000	In addition to these three peaks
3631000	3633000	There is another peak outside
3633000	3635000	Correct
3635000	3637000	There are more on the left and right
3637000	3639000	So that is also
3639000	3641000	Resonance
3641000	3643000	Resonance
3643000	3645000	It may be higher
3645000	3647000	Higher
3647000	3649000	Correct
3649000	3651000	Let me make sure
3651000	3653000	I have an impression
3653000	3655000	Please tell me
3655000	3657000	I remember the so-called
3657000	3659000	Because the light is very strong
3659000	3661000	So
3661000	3663000	Equal to this original
3663000	3665000	There is an ac
3665000	3667000	This way
3667000	3669000	Create two more
3669000	3671000	My previous understanding is like this
3671000	3673000	Correct
3673000	3675000	So this calculation method
3675000	3677000	Above
3677000	3679000	The method they came up with in 2012
3679000	3681000	Is it a simulation method?
3681000	3683000	In fact
3683000	3685000	Use you today
3685000	3687000	The method of analysis
3687000	3689000	The method they use is
3689000	3691000	The method they use is
3691000	3693000	Is
3693000	3695000	Dark shift
3695000	3697000	There is
3697000	3699000	Electrophonic hybridization
3699000	3701000	You can put those
3701000	3703000	The relationship between
3703000	3705000	Calculate
3705000	3707000	OK
3707000	3709000	Then continue
3709000	3711000	The earliest MOLO paper is
3711000	3713000	1967
3713000	3715000	The earliest prediction
3715000	3717000	MOLO triplet was in 1967
3717000	3719000	Then later
3719000	3721000	Of course a lot of people
3721000	3723000	Just go in and explain this thing
3723000	3725000	There is a very good resource
3725000	3727000	Do a lot
3727000	3729000	Work in this area
3729000	3731000	Then
3731000	3733000	Okay, let's take a look at one
3733000	3735000	More interesting thing
3735000	3737000	That is, I am comparing
3737000	3739000	This picture is what I compared
3739000	3741000	Except that I want to compare
3741000	3743000	The position of the peak, I also want to compare
3743000	3745000	Can I get
3745000	3747000	Can I get the correct
3747000	3749000	Coherence emission
3749000	3751000	What about this one on the left?
3751000	3753000	What about this curve?
3753000	3755000	Quantum mechanics
3755000	3757000	Is the whole quantum theory
3757000	3759000	That
3759000	3761000	Coherence emission
3761000	3763000	The ratio
3763000	3765000	That
3765000	3767000	This green dot
3767000	3769000	There is a dot
3769000	3771000	We use
3771000	3773000	Ernest plus r to calculate
3773000	3775000	Then we found here
3775000	3777000	Especially near the place
3777000	3779000	Delta omega is zero
3779000	3781000	Near the place
3781000	3783000	Very good
3783000	3785000	Is there a way
3785000	3787000	We also have a small caveat
3787000	3789000	In fact, this quantum mechanics
3789000	3791000	The theory is based on
3791000	3793000	Rotating wave approximation
3793000	3795000	It is based on
3795000	3797000	Very close to this
3797000	3799000	Very close to the resonance
3799000	3801000	So we don't know
3801000	3803000	Far away
3803000	3805000	Where is the resonance
3805000	3807000	The theory of quantum mechanics
3807000	3809000	Is our calculation method
3809000	3811000	The theory of quantum mechanics
3811000	3813000	Is it accurate?
3813000	3815000	So this place
3815000	3817000	We are not very clear
3817000	3819000	Is this place accurate?
3819000	3821000	Anyway, what we get is
3821000	3823000	Quite different
3823000	3825000	At least near the resonance
3825000	3827000	Their results are very close
3827000	3829000	What about this thing on the right?
3829000	3831000	Is a
3831000	3833000	Can play
3833000	3835000	It can almost surpass
3835000	3837000	Rotating wave approximation
3837000	3839000	That is to say
3839000	3841000	If we look at the peak on the left
3841000	3843000	For
3843000	3845000	For
3845000	3847000	For
3847000	3849000	Different frequency changes
3849000	3851000	That
3851000	3853000	The red line
3853000	3855000	Is the right side peak
3855000	3857000	The blue line is the left side peak
3857000	3859000	That
3859000	3861000	Is the quantum theory
3861000	3863000	Under this
3863000	3865000	Under this
3865000	3867000	It is a line
3867000	3869000	It will not predict at all
3869000	3871000	Irregular situation
3871000	3873000	Because it is only
3873000	3875000	Focused on
3875000	3877000	One level
3877000	3879000	One level quantum behavior
3879000	3881000	Because of this
3881000	3883000	Rotating wave approximation
3883000	3885000	It only focuses on one level quantum behavior
3885000	3887000	So it can get the middle one
3887000	3889000	It's right, but it can't get it
3889000	3891000	At this point
3891000	3893000	But our
3893000	3895000	Mixed quantum classical method
3895000	3897000	Because I didn't do anything
3897000	3899000	Rotating
3899000	3901000	Rotating wave
3901000	3903000	So the result I got
3903000	3905000	I can get this
3905000	3907000	Linear crossing result
3907000	3909000	This result is actually
3909000	3911000	The result of the experiment is the same
3911000	3913000	That is, in practice, we can also see
3913000	3915000	This is not a fixed point
3915000	3917000	It is a
3917000	3919000	Linear crossing
3919000	3921000	This result is very
3921000	3923000	Exciting result
3923000	3925000	So
3925000	3927000	So
3927000	3929000	Finally
3929000	3931000	This is a final recap
3931000	3933000	We found this
3933000	3935000	RFS class R dynamics
3935000	3937000	It can almost simulate
3937000	3939000	Quantum mixing
3939000	3941000	There is no mixing mechanism
3941000	3943000	But just use
3943000	3945000	Driving field
3945000	3947000	With a small stochastic
3947000	3949000	Diffusing, I can simulate
3949000	3951000	Quantum mixing
3951000	3953000	We can also
3953000	3955000	Very clearly distinguish
3955000	3957000	Coherence emission and incoherence emission
3957000	3959000	I hope
3959000	3961000	These
3961000	3963000	Advantages can tell
3963000	3965000	Everyone that we are developing now
3965000	3967000	The theory is a very reliable
3967000	3969000	Method
3969000	3971000	To deal with
3971000	3973000	Light-material interaction
3973000	3975000	But this method still has a lot of problems
3975000	3977000	This method
3977000	3979000	We are still
3979000	3981000	I haven't thought about any
3981000	3983000	Quantum mixing
3983000	3985000	That is, our current
3985000	3987000	Matter is a very simple matter
3987000	3989000	Two-level system, three-level system
3989000	3991000	Is a very simple matter
3991000	3993000	From the perspective of a chemist
3993000	3995000	We are
3995000	3997000	We hope that we can
3997000	3999000	At least put some
3999000	4001000	Chemistry
4001000	4003000	Put potential energy
4003000	4005000	Put nuclear
4005000	4007000	Put in
4007000	4009000	Non-adiabatic dynamics
4009000	4011000	Put these different behaviors
4011000	4013000	This is a
4013000	4015000	A good direction
4015000	4017000	Another question mark
4017000	4019000	Can we get
4019000	4021000	Photon counting statistics
4021000	4023000	Because there are
4023000	4025000	The second point and the third point
4025000	4027000	Very similar
4027000	4029000	Anti-function
4029000	4031000	Because
4031000	4033000	There is another big feature of monostripe
4033000	4035000	I haven't covered here
4035000	4037000	Three-wind
4037000	4039000	Quantum counting statistics
4039000	4041000	Because
4041000	4043000	The sequence of light
4043000	4045000	So every light
4045000	4047000	For example
4047000	4049000	F light
4049000	4051000	The first one
4051000	4053000	The next one may be very close to it
4053000	4055000	T light
4055000	4057000	The first one
4057000	4059000	Must be far away from it
4059000	4061000	Can't release a light right away
4061000	4063000	When you measure the light
4063000	4065000	When the statistics are
4065000	4067000	You will find
4067000	4069000	F light may be
4069000	4071000	In line with
4071000	4073000	Poisson distribution
4073000	4075000	T light
4075000	4077000	Subpoisson distribution
4077000	4079000	The quality of light
4079000	4081000	Will be different
4081000	4083000	Here
4083000	4085000	We haven't tried it yet
4085000	4087000	Of course
4087000	4089000	There is no light here
4089000	4091000	We can get similar
4091000	4093000	Last
4093000	4095000	Thermal light
4095000	4097000	If the light is not
4097000	4099000	Not
4099000	4101000	Not at 0 degree
4101000	4103000	There is a thermal distribution
4103000	4105000	Then
4105000	4107000	Can we
4107000	4109000	In mixed quantum classical
4109000	4111000	Get detail balance
4111000	4113000	Or we may
4113000	4115000	Violate detail balance
4115000	4117000	The last question
4117000	4119000	Is a very important question
4119000	4121000	In many systems
4121000	4123000	Two-level system
4123000	4125000	Spontaneous emission rate
4125000	4127000	May be changed
4127000	4129000	Not in line with Fermi's golden rule
4129000	4131000	Spontaneous emission rate
4131000	4133000	Because of cavity
4133000	4135000	Cavity causes strong interaction
4135000	4137000	Strong interaction
4137000	4139000	Causes
4139000	4141000	This
4141000	4143000	The frequency of emission will change
4143000	4145000	This method
4145000	4147000	Based on Fermi's golden rule
4147000	4149000	May be
4149000	4151000	So this is also a possibility
4151000	4153000	Need to consider
4153000	4155000	Then
4155000	4157000	We do this
4157000	4159000	Method
4159000	4161000	Method development
4161000	4163000	Method development
4163000	4165000	For people
4165000	4167000	The most common thing we do
4167000	4169000	Is that we have created a new toy
4169000	4171000	Is
4171000	4173000	We want to use it in many places
4173000	4175000	Hope many people
4175000	4177000	Use it in many places
4177000	4179000	For us
4179000	4181000	A very important question
4181000	4183000	When will it break down
4183000	4185000	This is the most important
4185000	4187000	The most important thing we want to know
4187000	4189000	When does it not work
4189000	4191000	That
4191000	4193000	Of course there are many
4193000	4195000	Application
4195000	4197000	These things are
4197000	4199000	We hope to push it to
4199000	4201000	Other
4201000	4203000	Spectroscopy
4203000	4205000	Spectroscopy group
4205000	4207000	Let's try
4207000	4209000	Can we use this
4209000	4211000	Same method
4211000	4213000	To see
4213000	4215000	Chemistry
4215000	4217000	Put it in a cavity
4217000	4219000	It may be because of the interaction with light
4219000	4221000	To change
4221000	4223000	Its
4223000	4225000	Vibrational energy level
4225000	4227000	Because of the change of the vibrational energy level
4227000	4229000	It may have different
4229000	4231000	Reaction pathway
4231000	4233000	So it will have different
4233000	4235000	This is
4235000	4237000	This is a thing we can do
4237000	4239000	A direction
4239000	4241000	Another application
4241000	4243000	Is a new theory
4243000	4245000	Called
4245000	4247000	Model
4247000	4249000	Then
4249000	4251000	In this model
4251000	4253000	I use
4253000	4255000	Classical source
4255000	4257000	Generate quantum light
4257000	4259000	Then use this quantum light
4259000	4261000	Different light
4261000	4263000	Go to
4263000	4265000	The target
4265000	4267000	Then
4267000	4269000	I can see
4269000	4271000	This target
4271000	4273000	Different
4273000	4275000	Photon statistics
4275000	4277000	The
4277000	4279000	Behavior
4279000	4281000	This is a new thing
4281000	4283000	But this thing
4283000	4285000	There is no experimental implementation yet
4285000	4287000	But in theory
4287000	4289000	Many people are
4289000	4291000	Pursue this direction
4291000	4293000	Finally
4293000	4295000	A very
4295000	4297000	In device and material science
4297000	4299000	A very useful application
4299000	4301000	Conductance enhancement
4301000	4303000	Application
4303000	4305000	Conductance enhancement
4305000	4307000	Conductance enhancement
4307000	4309000	Can be used
4309000	4311000	Cavity
4311000	4313000	Can be used
4313000	4315000	To simulate
4315000	4317000	We hope
4317000	4319000	Can use this method
4319000	4321000	To understand
4321000	4323000	Why
4323000	4325000	Conductance enhancement
4325000	4327000	Finally
4327000	4329000	Thank you

4333000	4335000	The middle one
4335000	4337000	Old man
4337000	4339000	Not old

4347000	4349000	Visiting scholar
4349000	4351000	Half a year
4351000	4353000	The

4357000	4359000	Arizona State University
4359000	4361000	Professor
4361000	4363000	This method
4363000	4365000	Generate
4365000	4367000	Three-dimensional
4367000	4369000	This method
4369000	4371000	I have a
4371000	4373000	Electron system
4373000	4375000	The evolution
4375000	4377000	The evolution of the classical electron system
4377000	4379000	Maxine is a classical electron system expert
4379000	4381000	So he can use
4381000	4383000	I don't know the theory
4383000	4385000	Put it
4385000	4387000	With some
4387000	4389000	Very mature classical electron system
4389000	4391000	Combine
4391000	4393000	Then Taoli is us
4393000	4395000	A researcher in my group
4395000	4397000	Then he is
4397000	4399000	We did a lot of work together
4399000	4401000	Finally, I want to thank
4401000	4403000	Ted
4403000	4405000	Organize the whole
4405000	4407000	Let me have a chance to share with you
4407000	4409000	Thank you
4411000	4413000	Hello
4413000	4415000	Thank you
4419000	4421000	Everyone
4421000	4423000	Does anyone have any special questions?
4427000	4429000	The
4429000	4431000	The
4431000	4433000	The
4433000	4435000	Okay, let me ask
4435000	4437000	I am
4437000	4439000	Good
4439000	4441000	When we look at it recently
4441000	4443000	I
4443000	4445000	What I've been doing lately is
4445000	4447000	Light polarization
4447000	4449000	Interaction
4449000	4451000	Use
4451000	4453000	In the semiconductor
4453000	4455000	What's in there
4455000	4457000	We are looking at it recently
4457000	4459000	In addition to
4459000	4461000	Because we are more concerned
4461000	4463000	Like what you are talking about now
4463000	4465000	Light in classical way
4465000	4467000	The electromagnetic wave
4467000	4469000	To present
4469000	4471000	If like us
4471000	4473000	So we do it
4473000	4475000	We do more polarizations
4475000	4477000	Or
4477000	4479000	So it's
4479000	4481000	It depends on the light itself
4481000	4483000	His own characteristics
4483000	4485000	Then we recently
4485000	4487000	Looking at one is
4487000	4489000	You should probably listen to it
4489000	4491000	Just
4491000	4493000	There is
4493000	4495000	This kind of thing
4495000	4497000	I'm thinking
4497000	4499000	If there is
4499000	4501000	Although it was quite new at first
4501000	4503000	but
4503000	4505000	There is
4505000	4507000	The light is recently
4507000	4509000	I think it's a hot topic
4509000	4511000	One
4511000	4513000	Have you ever thought about it?
4513000	4515000	His whole disease
4515000	4517000	He is also a
4517000	4519000	That one
4519000	4521000	This boundary
4521000	4523000	One of the conditions
4523000	4525000	Square
4525000	4527000	Its light is a bit like it
4527000	4529000	A wave of rotation
4529000	4531000	It's different from the circle
4531000	4533000	Still not the same
4533000	4535000	So it is
4535000	4537000	There is also a moment
4537000	4539000	Then you
4539000	4541000	This may be
4541000	4543000	Maybe you are now
4543000	4545000	It may not be the same
4545000	4547000	But I want to say
4547000	4549000	You have a way to analyze this
4549000	4551000	The light will be
4551000	4553000	With
4553000	4555000	Maybe not yet
4555000	4557000	The interaction of molecules
4557000	4559000	Or with any two-level system
4559000	4561000	Interaction
4561000	4563000	How does it react
4563000	4565000	I think
4565000	4567000	This
4567000	4569000	I was not born with light
4569000	4571000	These things are a bit difficult
4571000	4573000	I
4573000	4575000	I am now
4575000	4577000	I am now
4577000	4579000	What they are doing
4579000	4581000	Very confident
4581000	4583000	I have
4583000	4585000	FDTD
4585000	4587000	These good
4587000	4589000	Classic electric mechanics
4589000	4591000	That basically
4591000	4593000	He
4593000	4595000	What he does now
4595000	4597000	Different
4597000	4599000	Different
4599000	4601000	Can do
4601000	4603000	I think
4603000	4605000	If he does this
4605000	4607000	I think it should be
4607000	4609000	The problem you are thinking about is helpful
4609000	4611000	Great
4611000	4613000	Let's pay attention to this
4613000	4615000	Professor
4625000	4627000	I have a question
4627000	4629000	Ok
4629000	4631000	This is
4631000	4633000	This is a long-standing question
4633000	4635000	I want to know
4635000	4637000	When will it happen
4637000	4639000	When will it happen
4639000	4641000	Outer tongue splitting
4641000	4643000	Then
4643000	4645000	What is your second
4645000	4647000	Outer tongue splitting
4647000	4649000	Oh
4649000	4651000	Then
4651000	4653000	I know it's probably
4653000	4655000	Only in molecules
4655000	4657000	Or the atomic system
4657000	4659000	This mole triplet will occur
4659000	4661000	But in the acetone system
4661000	4663000	It will only happen
4663000	4665000	But what is the specific reason
4665000	4667000	Do you know
4667000	4669000	I don't know the specific reason
4669000	4671000	Because my understanding of him
4671000	4673000	Same as you
4673000	4675000	He is in
4675000	4677000	In the molecule
4677000	4679000	In the molecular system
4679000	4681000	He will be
4681000	4683000	In the acetone system
4683000	4685000	I still have to learn
4685000	4687000	I haven't
4687000	4689000	I have been doing this
4689000	4691000	This set of theory
4691000	4693000	About a year and a half
4693000	4695000	Ok
4695000	4697000	There are still a lot to learn
4697000	4699000	Ok
4699000	4701000	There is another thing
4701000	4703000	Outer tongue
4703000	4705000	What is the other one
4705000	4707000	Called
4707000	4709000	EIT
4709000	4711000	Electronic
4711000	4713000	Transparency
4713000	4715000	What's the difference between the two
4715000	4717000	Transparency
4717000	4719000	I really don't know
4719000	4721000	Ok
4721000	4723000	Out of my
4723000	4725000	You may ask
4725000	4727000	Ted may not understand
4727000	4729000	I remember EIT
4729000	4731000	With male triplet
4731000	4733000	There seems to be a difference
4733000	4735000	EIT seems to be more in the atom
4735000	4737000	But I actually don't remember
4737000	4739000	EIT
4739000	4741000	EIT
4741000	4743000	EIT and
4743000	4745000	The effect of outer tongues looks the same
4745000	4747000	But it's completely different from male triplet
4747000	4749000	Male triplet you will see three states
4749000	4751000	EIT and
4751000	4753000	Outer tongues you see two states
4757000	4759000	I forgot
4759000	4761000	Sorry
4761000	4763000	It doesn't matter
4763000	4765000	But I think this is a pretty interesting question
4765000	4767000	I think I should
4767000	4769000	I should use
4769000	4771000	Because male triplet is basically
4771000	4773000	The first thing we try
4773000	4775000	Let's try to break down
4775000	4777000	This method
4777000	4779000	See if this method will break down here
4779000	4781000	Actually quite good
4781000	4783000	So I was thinking
4783000	4785000	Maybe our next project will use EIT
4785000	4787000	Ok
4787000	4789000	Then another thing
4789000	4791000	You said you add
4791000	4793000	You add fluctuation in the electric field
4793000	4795000	Then in the classical field
4795000	4797000	Add fluctuation
4797000	4799000	Then let it
4799000	4801000	Looks like there is spontaneous emission
4801000	4803000	Then
4803000	4805000	Which electric field are you
4805000	4807000	Is it driving force electric field
4807000	4809000	Add fluctuation
4809000	4811000	No, I'm in the radiation field
4811000	4813000	Add fluctuation
4813000	4815000	Driving field here
4815000	4817000	We still treat it as
4817000	4819000	It's a
4819000	4821000	Electric field running past
4821000	4823000	Maxwell equation is linear
4823000	4825000	You can break it down
4825000	4827000	But this
4827000	4829000	If you are in emission
4829000	4831000	That
4831000	4833000	Add fluctuation in radiation
4833000	4835000	Then
4835000	4837000	You said your addition is
4837000	4839000	You just assume
4839000	4841000	It's running above the time
4841000	4843000	Then
4843000	4845000	At a certain random time
4845000	4847000	Let it change the phase
4847000	4849000	Like this
4849000	4851000	Then
4851000	4853000	This thing seems to be with that
4853000	4855000	Is two-dimensional
4855000	4857000	Spectroscopy inside
4857000	4859000	The method they use
4859000	4861000	Very similar
4861000	4863000	Do you say pump probe method
4863000	4865000	Is in two-dimensional
4865000	4867000	Spectroscopy inside
4867000	4869000	They have
4869000	4871000	One is called homogeneous line width
4871000	4873000	Another one is called
4873000	4875000	No, this is homogeneous line width
4875000	4877000	There are two components
4877000	4879000	The first one is
4879000	4881000	Free induction decay
4881000	4883000	The second one is
4883000	4885000	Scattering of phonon
4885000	4887000	Scattering of other things
4887000	4889000	Then the second
4889000	4891000	Their assumption
4891000	4893000	They bring in
4893000	4895000	Model method
4895000	4897000	In the radiation field
4897000	4899000	Add a random
4899000	4901000	Phase drop
4903000	4905000	So these two things
4905000	4907000	Is it the same
4907000	4909000	Actually different
4909000	4911000	A little different
4911000	4913000	That is to say
4913000	4915000	OK
4915000	4917000	I want
4917000	4919000	That is
4919000	4921000	I want to say one thing
4921000	4923000	Because i'm not
4923000	4925000	I'm not really
4925000	4927000	I'm not really
4927000	4929000	Add a random phase
4929000	4931000	I am adding a random phase
4931000	4933000	In
4933000	4935000	In
4935000	4937000	Two-level system
4937000	4939000	Then this two-level system
4939000	4941000	Random phase will reflect on the electric field
4941000	4943000	So i'm really adding
4943000	4945000	Electric field
4945000	4947000	There are two benefits to this method
4947000	4949000	Because
4949000	4951000	My
4951000	4953000	My
4953000	4955000	It is natural
4955000	4957000	There are two benefits to this method
4957000	4959000	Because my
4959000	4961000	Two-level system
4961000	4963000	Also need this defacing
4963000	4965000	He also needs
4965000	4967000	This little defacing
4967000	4969000	Correct his
4969000	4971000	His fluctuation
4971000	4973000	He also needs this thing
4973000	4975000	From
4975000	4977000	From
4977000	4979000	Then another benefit is
4979000	4981000	Because i'm
4983000	4985000	Put
4985000	4987000	There is actually a
4987000	4989000	Difficulty point is because i put
4989000	4991000	I want to put this
4991000	4993000	Add a little fluctuation
4993000	4995000	I can't just add it
4995000	4997000	Add to a certain place
4997000	4999000	It just caused his self-interaction
4999000	5001000	Will destroy the whole system
5001000	5003000	That
5003000	5005000	So he will have one
5005000	5007000	Specific method
5007000	5009000	Add it to a correct place
5009000	5011000	That
5011000	5013000	This thing
5015000	5017000	Because he
5017000	5019000	Because of this field
5019000	5021000	He is not like he is not only a point
5021000	5023000	He is a whole space
5023000	5025000	And he has to meet some basic
5025000	5027000	For example, he can't go beyond the speed
5027000	5029000	I can't put a field suddenly
5029000	5031000	Add to a place beyond the speed
5031000	5033000	Right
5033000	5035000	So
5035000	5037000	Try not to add directly
5037000	5039000	On field
5039000	5041000	So when we design this method
5041000	5043000	This fluctuation
5043000	5045000	Add to two-level system
5045000	5047000	Add to two-level system
5047000	5049000	Naturally generate this fluctuation
5051000	5053000	OK
5057000	5059000	Then there is a more detailed question
5059000	5061000	I want to know this
5061000	5063000	Why this classical
5065000	5067000	It's just
5067000	5069000	Quantum matter and classical
5069000	5071000	Field
5071000	5073000	That
5073000	5075000	Only when
5077000	5079000	When that
5079000	5081000	That
5081000	5083000	Low
5083000	5085000	Low 0
5085000	5087000	Low 1 is
5087000	5089000	There will be no emission
5089000	5091000	Then there will be other emissions
5091000	5093000	I always thought it was all
5093000	5095000	No emission
5095000	5097000	Thank you for asking this question
5097000	5099000	Because
5099000	5101000	Because of my time
5101000	5103000	I missed a part
5103000	5105000	That's it
5105000	5107000	Here
5107000	5109000	Here
5109000	5111000	Mixed quantum classical
5111000	5113000	Here
5113000	5115000	It's not pure
5115000	5117000	Is the most
5117000	5119000	The most basic
5119000	5121000	Mixed quantum classical
5121000	5123000	It is a mixed quantum classical
5123000	5125000	That is to say
5125000	5127000	I am in this
5127000	5129000	This
5129000	5131000	In uranfest
5133000	5135000	Two-level system
5135000	5137000	Classical
5137000	5139000	Field
5139000	5141000	Will also
5141000	5143000	Interact to two-level system
5143000	5145000	Let it decay
5147000	5149000	So this is already a non-linear system
5149000	5151000	So you see these
5151000	5153000	These red lines are not
5153000	5155000	A simple
5155000	5157000	Simple exponential decay
5159000	5161000	So it's a
5161000	5163000	It will continue to
5163000	5165000	Self-interact
5167000	5169000	So
5169000	5171000	There will be some decay
5171000	5173000	Basically
5173000	5175000	This is
5175000	5177000	One of our recent papers
5177000	5179000	His point is uranfest
5179000	5181000	This is the most basic
5181000	5183000	Mixed quantum classical
5183000	5185000	Can get some
5185000	5187000	Partially correct
5187000	5189000	But
5189000	5191000	He won't get all
5191000	5193000	Sorry
5193000	5195000	You can go to the front page
5195000	5197000	Let me see what is called uranfest
5199000	5201000	You said
5201000	5203000	His equation
5203000	5205000	I didn't write it out
5205000	5207000	OK
5209000	5211000	I can give you
5211000	5213000	Our paper
5213000	5215000	There is
5215000	5217000	I can check it myself
5217000	5219000	Because I didn't
5219000	5221000	Write it all out
5221000	5223000	A bit complicated
5229000	5231000	Thank you
5241000	5243000	Other listeners have no questions
5243000	5245000	Discuss
5257000	5259000	If there is no problem
5259000	5261000	That's the end of our speech today
5263000	5265000	Thank you all
5265000	5267000	Thank you
5267000	5269000	Thank you
5269000	5271000	OK
5273000	5275000	You think
5275000	5277000	Tell us when you are ready
5277000	5279000	We will put the video up
5279000	5281000	OK
5281000	5283000	OK
5283000	5285000	That's all for today
5285000	5287000	OK
5287000	5289000	Good night
5289000	5291000	It's okay
5291000	5293000	4.30
5293000	5295000	OK
5295000	5297000	Thank you all
5297000	5299000	Bye
