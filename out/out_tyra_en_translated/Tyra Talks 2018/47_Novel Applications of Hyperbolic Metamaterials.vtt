00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Welcome to the Terra Talks on September 8th.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
Today's topic is Non-Verbal Applications of Hyperbolic Metamaterials.

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
We are honored to have Dr. Lin Hong-Yi, a Ph.D. student at NTU.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Let me briefly introduce Dr. Hong-Yi's background.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

00:35.000 --> 00:53.000
She is a non-verbal application of hyperbolic metamaterials.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
She is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

01:34.000 --> 01:47.000
Dr. Hong-Yi is a Ph.D. student at NTU.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
First, let me introduce what metamaterials are.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
You may have heard of metamaterials before.

01:56.000 --> 02:05.000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

02:05.000 --> 02:15.000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

02:15.000 --> 02:23.000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
Some people even use the concept of positive reflection.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
Some people even use the concept of positive reflection.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
The concept of positive reflection is based on permissibility.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Metamaterials are objects in the natural world, such as invisible corks.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
The direction I made is called Hyperbody Metamaterial.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
It is a Metamaterial, another one of the branches.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
What is Hyperbody?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Hyperbody is the color curve.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
The Metamaterial color curve is like this.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
You can see, like this, double-curve.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Up and down, or it is left and right.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
If you open up and down, it is Type I.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Type I like this.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
The circle is basically a general material.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
My Hyperbody Metamaterial is this up and down, Type I or Type II.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
How to achieve the color curve of this Type I material?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
There are some simple ways.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Basically, there are two components.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
The first one is metal, and the second one is a catalyst.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Metal is a metal nanofiber in a dielectric environment.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
This metal nanofiber needs a regular arrangement.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
If it is random, its color curve distribution will not be so uniform.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
The distribution of Hyperbody.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
So, like this metal nanofiber, it can be like a metal nanorod.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Or a metal nanorod in a dielectric, like a polymer environment.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
I have seen some people say that this is also the Hyperbody Metamaterial of Type I.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Another Type II Hyperbody Metamaterial is like this multi-layer film.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Multi-layer film is like a multi-layer film of metal and catalyst.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Convex structure.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Then it needs a lot of pairs.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
About three or four pairs, five or six pairs or more.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Of course, I have seen some people do more than ten or twenty pairs.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
In this case, the quality of the coating is very good.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
Otherwise, the coating is not the distribution of Hyperbody Metamaterial.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Basically, HMM is called Hyperbody Metamaterial.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
HMM has these two structures.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I often do this kind of multi-layer film.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Because this is very simple.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
We use thermal to coat.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Then coat some metal film and catalyst film.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
This is a cross-layer film.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
There are other ways to achieve this kind of multi-layer structure.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I will also introduce this thing in addition today.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
What are the benefits of this HMM?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
What are the features?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
You can see that this is its Wave Vector.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So it will have a lot of Wave Vector Modes in it.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
What are the benefits of having a Wave Vector Mode?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
The biggest benefit is that its Density of State is very large.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
You can take a look at the Fermi's Golden Rule.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I'll just mention it a little bit.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
Fermi's Golden Rule's Transition Rate is proportional to my Density of State.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
The Density of State is also proportional to my Wave Vector.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So my Wave Vector Mode is very high.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
My Density of State is large.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
If the Density of State is large, it means that my Transition Rate is high.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
What does Transition Rate mean?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
You can take a look at it.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
It's like if my PO is a fluorescent molecule.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
It can make my radiation more.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
So if a fluorescent molecule is placed on top of my HMM, it will radiate more.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Because it's in my Excited State.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Jump to Ground State.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
It can store more energy.

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
So what it means is that it consumes less radiation.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Because it stores more radiation.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Basically, we put some fluorescent molecules or fuels.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
There will be a stronger trend on this HMM base.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Let's compare HMM with other materials.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
What is the concept of HMM and other materials?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
What is the concept of HMM and other materials?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Usually, we have some diagrams.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
For example, SL2 or TL2.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Its radiation curve is a very regular linear radiation curve.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
Its Isofrequence Surface is like what you just saw.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
It's a circle.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Its Density of State is like this.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
It's not so much.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
You can see this picture.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
The phenomenon of Metal Directory is like...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
This base is the Directory.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I may have some metal nanoparticles on it.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
You may have seen the enhancement of POSMONICS.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Gold particles or silver particles.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
It's like I have some metal particles on TL2 or SL2.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
It's because the interface of metal and solid electrons will have a very strong local field.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
This local field is called Surface POSMON Polariton.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
This Surface POSMON can only be activated at a certain ray light and frequency.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
So, like this metal or solid electrons.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Enhancement behavior on these large electrons.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
This is what we call Surface POSMON Polariton Enhancement.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
The one on the far right is Metal Nanoparticle.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
This is a metal nanoparticle.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
There will be different field enhancement behaviors after the light hits.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
But this kind of field enhancement behavior also has a certain frequency.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Or a certain direction can trigger more energy.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
So this kind of enhancement behavior is also a kind of separation.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's not a very broadband enhancement.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
The reason why I chose HMM is like this.

08:39.000 --> 08:46.000
The third column is because HMM has a lot of Density of State.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
Then different angles can also trigger different modalities.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
So it can make my luminous molecules above.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Or other materials or dyes.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It hits the PL enhancement.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
PL is Photoluminescence Enhancement.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Or hit the laser enhancement.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
All have a certain effect.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I will also introduce you a little bit in the following video.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
This is the basic concept of material.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
I listed a little bit about what HMM has to do.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
HMM has a High Wave Vector Mode.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So the light that comes into the factory can be transmitted to the original factory.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Instead of the electromagnetic wave.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Instead of the evanescence field disappear.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
So HMM's early application is to do this.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Far Field Image.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
For example, the light that comes into the factory can be transmitted to the original factory.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Not like ordinary metal or other materials.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Decay at the front.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Because the light can be transmitted in this multi-layer film.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
So some people used to do waveguide.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
I have seen some people do some patterns on the multi-layer film.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Then the pattern is retained.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
This is IN and this is OUT.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Can be used as a biosensor.

10:05.000 --> 10:11.000
Then they put some detectors.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Then use the form of light.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Can measure the change of different penetrations.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Then come to a biosensor.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
This is published on Natural Material.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Then there are people who use simulation to calculate.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
This kind of ring multi-layer film.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It can be INVISIBLE COAT.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
For example, the things inside me can be covered.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
So I come in from here.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
My scattering things go out from here.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The electromagnetic wave will not be affected at all.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
So some people use this concept to do INVISIBLE COAT.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
But this concept is only at a certain frequency.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
May be at a certain frequency.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Can achieve this INVISIBLE COAT behavior.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
That may not work in a broadband.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
So this is just a simulation result.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I have seen some people use this to say.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
This kind of HM energy can be transmitted inside.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So some people say this kind of HM structure.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Like this is a multi-layer film structure.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Then this is the NETWORK.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Plugged in the Type-1 structure.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
It is said that it can be used as a light communication behavior.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Because the energy can be transmitted inside.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So they say this.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Maybe this can be used in the future.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Is an optical transmission behavior.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Let's look at the top here.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
The top here is this year.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Cai Dingming Laboratory published on Advanced Material.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
They use Pattern HM structure.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
This is a multi-layer film structure.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Then use FOX-3B to make Pattern.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You can see this kind of tofu-like structure.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Then the top is Multicorner Well.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Then I use a short-wave 266 pumping laser to fight.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Then there will be a long-wave 289.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
A long-wave 289 laser comes out.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That 289 is a Deep UV.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
So this thing is 266 Pump.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Then 289 Lacing is a Deep UV laser.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
The width is only about 2-3 nm.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
The result of this HM Pattern.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It can also be regarded as an enhanced behavior of LED.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
This is published on Nano Energy.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
It was also published by Cai Dingming Laboratory this year.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
Because this HM has a large Density of State.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
So it can enhance this Light Matter Interaction.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
So it can reach the enhancement of laser or LED.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
In the early days, there were only two PL enhancements.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
PL enhancement is...

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
This is published on the Nature Nano Technology Shop in 2014.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
For example, I patterned a multi-layer film structure.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Then the top is mixed with some dye.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Like R6G or PMMA.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Because the concept of PL enhancement is spontaneous radiation.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Spontaneous Emission.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
This year is to achieve Stimulant Emission.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
This is published by Cai Dingming Laboratory.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Because of its high purity rate.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
So this pattern structure, multi-layer film structure.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I saw someone use it as a color film emitter.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Basically, this is the application of HM.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
It's quite a wide range.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
It's not just a simple theoretical application.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So now, in addition to doing Biosensor and Laser.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
And PL enhancement.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Now more and more people.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Will also use this HM to do different applications.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
So now I see that the main thing is to publish this trend.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
How to design a good HM?

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Usually HM is with me.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Because my HM multi-layer structure.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
It's about the thickness of my metal and solder.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
First of all, let's take a look at what Feofixion is.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Feofixion is the thickness of metal.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
The thickness of metal is the thickness of metal and solder.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
This is the thickness of a pair.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
So different Feofixion.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
In different wavelengths, this is the wavelength.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
What you see is different.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
This is the fun part of HM.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
If it's like this one, for example.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Feofixion is at 0.5.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Its short wavelength is Type 1.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Type 1 is the color curve is up and down.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Type 2 is left and right.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
If Feofixion is a little less.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Because Feofixion is less.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It means that the metal component is less.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
The metal component is less.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Overall, what it sees is a capacitance.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
So it's not HM.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
It's elliptical metameter.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Elliptical is elliptical.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It's like the general kind of material.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
We call it EMF.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
If the metal component is more.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
It's a metal material compared to it.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Not HM.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So it's also a type of EMF.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Does EMF have a lot of difference in optical measurement?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
Sometimes it's a few times worse.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
This is ACS Photonics.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
In 2007, it also measured some of Peo's enhancements.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It also put the fuel molecule.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
On my multi-layer HM board.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
You can see that on the HM board.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Its enhancement is quite strong.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It can be more than 1,000.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
If it's on EMF, it's about 400.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
So if it's the same multi-layer HM board.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
But my metal and fuel molecule thickness ratio is wrong.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The behavior of my enhancement is much worse.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
This type of EMF will also enhance.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
The reason it will also enhance.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Because it may be the enhancement of effective metal.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
That is to say, at least my board will reflect a little.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
So it will also enhance a little.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
But it's not as much as HM.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
This is 2012's Photoscience.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
EMF will have a longer lifetime.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
HM will have a shorter lifetime.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
For a fluorescent molecule.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
The longer the lifetime, the longer it will stay in the activation state.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
It will jump out.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It will jump to the ground state for a longer time.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
For example, if it jumps to the ground state for a longer time.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
It means it may be damaged by some other heat energy.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
So if I want to enhance PO.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
The shorter my lifetime, the better.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
That is to say, the shorter it stays in the activation state, the better.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
Then it can achieve a lot of PO enhancement purposes.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
So when we look at this kind of light-metal interaction.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
We all look at the first PO.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Is it enhanced?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Second, does it have a shorter lifetime?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
That is usually the EMF's lifetime will be longer.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Then its PO will be less.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
This is the basic concept of light-metal interaction.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm here with Mr. Chen Yongfang.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Mainly do something called random laser.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Let me mention a little bit about what random is.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Sorry, I have a question.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
I guess you're going to talk more specifically about your lab.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So I want to ask a more out-of-the-box question.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Because I don't make materials.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Basically, from the point of view of electronics.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Now the focus of metal materials is on.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
For example, you are now showing these hundreds of nanometers of wavelength.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Because basically you have to have a wavelength.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Far greater than a field, a pair, right?

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
So you are equal to the unequality of the material.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Then it becomes that you can adjust it.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Then let the light see an average effect.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
If I want to operate today.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
For example, if it is a wave, I can.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
For example, a layer is 100 nanometers.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Then pass two or three layers.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Will it have the same effect of metal material?

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
I have seen this kind of thing at the beginning.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Their thickness is very thick.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You can see it with your eyes.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
This kind of multi-layer film.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Unlike our film is more than 10, 20, 30 nanometers.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Unless you have seen, for example, sub-micron.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
100 nanometers or something.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Yes, I have seen a very thick one.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Then it may not be the way to grind.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
Because the grinding may be 1-2 nanometers at a time.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Because they are all 1-second ENSO.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
1 ENSO is 0.1 nanometer.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
If I want to do 1000 nanometers.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Then you have to do a lot of pairs.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
That is to be very high-strength.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
Of course, I have seen someone like Weibo or Terahertz.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Use the same concept to explain.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Then it will also have an effect.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Also have.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Because it was in the early stage.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Such a long wave.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Now everyone is more interested in visible light.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
The structure of visible light multi-layer film is very small.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
OK.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
So there is still such a feature.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I have a second question.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The second question is.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Your metal is basically operating at a constant temperature.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
So its skin depth is basically 1 over the square root of the wavelength.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's right.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
If today.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
For example, the metal you grind up.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
It will become a super conductor at a very low temperature.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
That super conductor.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
Its skin depth is 1 over the length.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Not.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Wait a minute.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
1 over the wavelength.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Anyway, it will not be the same.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
But it will have the same effect.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
If I want to operate at a very low temperature.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
There will also be the effect of metamaterial.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I haven't seen this yet.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
But because.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
This may also be a good research direction.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Right.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Measure at a very low temperature.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
See what will happen.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I guess.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
It will be different in terms of brightness.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
But it should still have some effect in terms of straightness.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Because it is basically a skin depth.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Here.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Not sure.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Because standing at such a low temperature.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
The concept of super conductor.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I remember this HMM.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I don't think I've done this yet.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Because it may be limited to experiments.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I guess this low temperature is also the kind of ethyl chloride.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Very low, very low temperature.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
I guess.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
OK.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
I haven't seen this yet.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
But I guess it should be a good topic.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
OK.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Basically, this is the concept of my HMM.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Then I will skip a little bit.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Another topic is.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Random laser.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
What is random laser?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Then we first introduce.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
What is a general laser?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
General laser.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I need a fixed rectifier.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Then my quality.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
The quality must be very good.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
It's a game medium.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
In a.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
A.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
A.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
A.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
In a rectifier.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Then when I pass the light inside.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Back and forth.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
The round trip.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Uh.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Uh.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Propagate.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
When the gain is greater than the loss.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Will be from a certain direction.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Specific frequency.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Then.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Lacing out.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Then this is the general concept of laser.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
It can be applied to a lot of things like a laser pen.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Visography.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Cutting.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
And light.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
A lot of surgery.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
This kind of.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Behavior.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
On the application.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
This is the general concept of laser.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
What is it called?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I am now mainly.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Focus on.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
HM.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Combined.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
The concept of random laser.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
What is that random laser?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Random laser.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Also want this kind of game medium.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Like ZMO.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
This.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Very irregular.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Uh.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Nanoparticle.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
In this.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
That.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
In this environment.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Then when I am very focused.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Very.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Uh.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Hit me this.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
On top of the game medium.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
It will be here.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
A process of multiple scattering.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Just like this.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
That is.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Multiple scattering.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
When it comes to this kind of game.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
When it's bigger than Rose.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
It will also be.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Very.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Very wide.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
To reach a type.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
The level of laser.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
That kind of laser.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Uh.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Because it's this kind of random laser.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
So it's light.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Will be inside.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Scattering everywhere.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So the direction it comes out.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Is.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Uh.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
We call it both.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Angular.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Or.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Angle free.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
This kind of emission.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Unlike general laser.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Only in a specific direction.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Will come out.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
So he.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
We are this kind of random laser.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
It's a different angle.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Can be lighted up.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
This kind of laser signal.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
So it's a little bit like the general laser.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Not the same.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That's it.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Uh.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
General laser.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
With random laser.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Concept.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
That.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
What.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
That.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Mechanism.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
The random laser.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Is.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
It's just like I just said.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
It's me.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
A pump laser.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
And then.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Hit me this.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
On top of the game medium.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
Then.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
When it's bigger than Rose.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
So.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
There will be a laser effect.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Come out.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
That.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
We will say.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
This is called.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Cross loop.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
And then.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Represents its light.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
In some places.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
The game medium.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Will.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Be very strong.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
So he.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
The probability of getting bigger than Rose.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Will be greater.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
So he.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Can be received from different angles.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
That.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
We usually discuss with randomness.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
When.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
We will discuss.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Say he's a.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Scattering.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
One thing.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
That.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Random laser.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Signal.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
That.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Random laser.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Signal.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Probably like this.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
This is me.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Peel.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Generally.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
If it's like.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
I hit it with a laser.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Will get a peel.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
A bag.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
A bag of peel.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Signal.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
That.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
When I'm strengthening my power.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I will get.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Amplify.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Spontaneous emission.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
It's like this green thing.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
That.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
I'm strengthening my power.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
I will get this.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Random laser.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
Peak.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
This is a typical.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Random laser.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Peak.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It's like this.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
The peak I measured with the next second.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
It's a little bit different.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Because he.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
The last second and the next second.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Light in there.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Scattering everywhere.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
The process is different.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
That.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Not all.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
The material.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Will hit this.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Random laser.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
That.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Need.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Like my material.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Need to have a certain.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Scattering things.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Or scattering.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
He will hit this.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Random laser.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
The.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Peak out.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
That.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
The advantage of random laser.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Is that I measure different angles.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
You can take a look.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
I might be 30 degrees.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Or 45 degrees.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Or 60 degrees.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Different angles of light.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
I can get this.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Random laser.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Peak.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Out.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
That.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
This kind of random laser.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
He has his own.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Advantage.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
If applied to this kind of lighting.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
He is from different angles.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
You can have this.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Very strong signal.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
And.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Uh.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
And he's a very.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Wide-angle behavior.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
That's it.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Uh.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Typical.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Random laser.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
A feature.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
He's a board.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Angle.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Uh.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Emission.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
That.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
My first.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
The first thing I do is.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Here is the combination of the teacher.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
HMM.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
The board.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
There's this mess on it.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
This kind of.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Uh.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Zin-R-Side.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Nanoparticle.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
His size is very irregular.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
It's maybe 50 nanometers.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
To.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Maybe.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Two or three hundred nanometers.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
There are.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
So I use the green light.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
If.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I'm going to be in my.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
This.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
ZMO nanoparticle.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
A scattering process.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Then.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Will be different angles.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Uh.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Random laser.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Out.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
That.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
You can.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Right.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I've seen it before.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
The first one.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Uh.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Cai Liming.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
It's already been used.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Uh.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Payton.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
HMM.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Stemming emission.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
He's a single.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
That.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
I'm using this.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Uh.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
ZMO nanoparticle.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
On the HMM board.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
To achieve a random laser.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Behavior.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
That.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
This is what I compared.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Different.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
HMM sample.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
There's my EMA sample.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
And my reference.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Reference is.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Control.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Simple.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
That's ZMO nanoparticle.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
On the general.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Silicon.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
That's his original.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
ZMO nanoparticle.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
He's going to have some.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
Random laser.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Peak.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
That's what I want.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Uh.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Intensity.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
It's going to be a little bit bigger.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
He's going to have.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
That.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Power.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
A little bit.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
He's just a general PL signal.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
That.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
If I zoom in here.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
He's just a general PL signal.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
That.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
EMA sample.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Uh.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I designed this work.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Two.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Different.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Multi-layer model ratio.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
One is.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
He's in this.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
HMM.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
The other one is.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
He's in this.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
EMF.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
You can also.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
You can see that he's in this.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
When this wave section.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
His brilliance.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Stronger is a bit weaker.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
But he was in hours.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Of this.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
amp Wave.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Of the word.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Of his.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Scare him.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Lazys effect.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Is very powerful.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
You can see this.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
There's a lot of it.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
This kind of prickles.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Speak.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
The signal.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
That is.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
La RES一樣不好就是也不重要

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It's like this one.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
That.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
That.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm in this design.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
At.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
AM.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
This is just to.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Task.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm on this side.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
It's at 45 degrees.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Uh.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Angle on both sides.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
That.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
You can see this intensity.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
With.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Uh.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Power density is.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Uh.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Uh.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Uh.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Uh.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Uh.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Uh.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Uh.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Uh.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Uh.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Uh.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Uh.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Uh.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Uh.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
Uh.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Uh.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Uh.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Uh.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Uh.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Uh.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Uh.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
Speak.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
At.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
AndPlayback.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
If it is probably, it doesn't matter.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Uh.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Speaker.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
What's going on?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
The force should not be heavy.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Once under massage together.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I don't want to fall every time.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Uh.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Uh.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
Uh.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Come on those days.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Power use guy.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
That's all I'm saying wait.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Don't get that.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Just lazer.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Speak.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Scientist.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
What's on Picachin night?

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
That doesn't sound like it's working.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
There's my alligator.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
And that's how deep it is.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
That data is.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
You can see that I'm usually different.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
That.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
I'm different.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Power.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Uh.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
In the measurement test, my HM machine board.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
He's two.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
It.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
The enhancement is stronger than the men and the reference.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
That we can even see an additional.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
What are you looking at?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
There will even be a.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
The phenomenon of a child on the HMS board.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
That I'm a little bit.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
I'm going to use a little bit of simulation to explain why this thing is there.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
That.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
We have different angles of measurement.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Maybe this is the color of the road.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
The angle of the road is 30 degrees.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
The other one is 60 degrees.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
That's basically what my HMS is.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Enhancement will be stronger than others.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
That's what this is.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Because it's a random laser.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
So I measured it in the last second.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Emission stability.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
It's going to be a distribution of the curve.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
In other words, HMS.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
He may be from more than 800 to about 1100.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
That.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
We measured it several times.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
It's probably a.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
It's kind of a stable.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
That.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
So, on behalf of me, this random laser.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
This one.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Zero nanoparticle.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
And my whole material.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
He won't because.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Uh, the longer it takes.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Uh, uh.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
So his, uh, intensity will drop.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
So it's basically a very stable emission process.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
That's what I'm going to do with a little bit of power.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
The laser to measure.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
He's going to have a P.O. signal.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
That's why I'm going to use the stronger power to measure.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
He's going to have a random laser.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
You can see his.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Uh, I'm going to measure it with a 3G4 laser.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
His.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, the energy is.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
More than 100 millijoules.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
That's what I'm looking for.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
The energy is used.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
More than 20 millijoules.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
This is more than 100 microjoules.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
This is more than 20 millijoules.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
So he's a very large number.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
So I'm going to have to be stronger.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm going to be able to get a random laser signal.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
So this is the behavior of measuring my life.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
So you can see that my HM machine.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
My life is probably more than 2 nanoseconds.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
That's going to be shorter than my EMM.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
The shorter the life.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
His.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Uh, uh.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Uh.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
That's going to be bigger.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
The resolution Ray will be bigger.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
That's the shortest I can get.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
It's easier to get a random laser behavior.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
So this is my FD numerical FDD.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
A little run simulation.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
This is my input signal.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I can take a look at my.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
This is where I put a ZN or NaN particle.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
This is my HM machine.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Let's take a look at how he affects the overall.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Uh, what's the effect of the barfield?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
You can see my HM machine.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
In this area, there is a relatively strong.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
A strong barfield.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
That's a little bit weaker.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
This is what I'm doing.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
After a normalization.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
So you can see it clearly.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
If it's a real machine.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
My ray beam will go under me.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That's my HM machine.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
He's going to my positive.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
A very strong scattering phenomenon.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
So this is a very strong scattering phenomenon.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
It will also be conducive to my.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
A random laser behavior.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
So this is the continuation of the simulation.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
This is my original distribution map.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
So you can see my.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
0 to 180 is my positive.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
180 to 360 is.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Go down.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
So you can see my HM machine.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
He's a lot more.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
It's going to my original direction.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Positive direction.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
It's ZMO.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
It's going to ZMO.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
So it's going to help me.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
One of the ZMO.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Uh, the scattering process.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
So this is me.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I ran some simulations from different angles.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
So you can see my.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Red is HM.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
The red HM.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It's basically stronger than the green EMM.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Scattering is even stronger.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
The blue is my reference board.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
So I.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Because random laser.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
It's a scattering process.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
So I did some math.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Scattering efficiency.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
So first of all, I.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I put a ZMO nanoparticle first.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
It may be a 40 nanometer radius.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
The height is 100 nanometers.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Put it on my different HM board.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Or EMM board.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Or reference board.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
You can see my HM board.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
His scattering efficiency.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
It's going to be a lot higher than my EMM.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It's going to be a lot higher.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And my HM board.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
He's in.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Especially in the 389 long-wave field.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
This one will be more.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
So.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
I jumped back here to explain.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Here.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I have more long-wave fields.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
So.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
I was thinking about this thing.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
In addition, there will be a phenomenon of redness.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
It's because my HM is on the long-wave field.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
It's stronger.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Scattering is more likely to result in.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Of course I.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I have a simulation.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
ZMO nanoparticle.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
If it's round.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
He's on different boards.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
His scattering.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
The effect is probably like this.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
Of course.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
With this ZMO nanoparticle.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It's hexagonal.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
It's a little bit like that.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It's just that the real situation is different.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
So this is my.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
The distribution of the scattering curve of this HM.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
So you can see.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I have this.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
ZMO nanoparticle.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
The lacing place is probably in this area.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Then I.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I'm on this HM board.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
I'm set to be 300.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
After 375 nanometers.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
It's a.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It's a.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Hyperbody dispersion curve.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
So this kind of thing.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
He will be in.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
So my multi-layered board.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
He can be in my ZMO nanoparticle.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Lacing time.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
There will be.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
There will be a stronger lacing effect.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Then I.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
In addition, I ran some more.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Like Persil Factor.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Persil Factor is.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
The value of Persil Factor is.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I have this thing with me.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
I have this dipole.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
When ZMO shines.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
In this environment.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
With me in FreeSpace.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
FreeSpace.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
It's when you don't have this board.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
To get along.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Made a pen.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Then you can see my HM.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Especially in the long wave field.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
38.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
The place of 390 will be longer.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
That's with my EMM.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
It's going to be a little bit weaker in this place.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
In fact, this.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
This multi-layered strengthening concept.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
He is a.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
An action of exponential decay.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
The black line is HMM.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
That red is EMM.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
That.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
If it's blue, it's Riffen.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
It's a line lying on the ground.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Then you can see.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
In fact, this kind of strengthening.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
You can see that this is.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Uh.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Within 50 nanometers.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Within 50 nanometers.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
It's probably.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Uh.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
For HMM.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
It's about four times.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
That's EMM.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
EMM.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
It's about twice.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
That.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
But if I put this whole thing together.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
It's an average.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
For HMM.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
HMM.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
The proportion of enhanced.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Can be up to.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
More than 30 times.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
But because he.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Enter the field.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
The main.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
The main.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
The most enhanced contribution is still in the field.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
That.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
The original factory is about 50 nanometers.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
In terms of words.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
It's about four times.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
But the previous few nanometers.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
It's very, very, very strong.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
That I have calculated.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Denser loop state.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
That his.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
The density.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Will be.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
In terms of HMM.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
His density.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
It's higher than EMM.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
So he.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Can reach the optiogame.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Will be more.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
That I have calculated.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
His decay rate.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Decay rate.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
In contrast to.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Lifetime.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
So my lifetime is shorter.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
My decay rate is higher.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
This means he's in.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Excited state.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Jump down.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Time.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Faster.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
That's what decay rate means.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
That's what decay rate means.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
That's what decay rate means.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
That's what decay rate means.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
That's what decay rate means.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
That's what decay rate means.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
So.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
That I have run for a while.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
For a while.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
That's what I'm getting at.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
It's.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
It's relatively new.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
That's what EMM does.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
And that's what we're talking about.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
It's bigger.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
More about.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
With.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
VVV is the power factor.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
There.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
The power main quantity is coming.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Uh.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
If it's bigger.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Good for him.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
The space was getting smaller.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Well.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Power machine causes.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
In other words.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
The greater the power of the largest power plant.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
The meaning is.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
I.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
My light can be very strong.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Localize in my.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
HMM.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Near the zeo nanoparticle.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
It's not like EMM.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Or reference board.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
It's harder to get my light.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Uh.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
In the local unit area.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
It's going to be stronger.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
So.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
The less I touch you.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
The smaller.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
The stronger I get.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Because the smaller the touch.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
The bigger my Perseverance is.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
So this is also a.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's also a concept that can be explained to each other.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Uh.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Then I.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
This thing.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
The following.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Is.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
I can look at me.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I looked at my TV.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
In my EMM.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
On top of my HMM.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
It's going to be a little longer.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And the strength of the resonance is going to be longer.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
This is after I've normalized it.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
So you can see a clear comparison.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
That's what it is.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
It's gone in a second.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
EMM.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
It's also going to be a resonance.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
But it's gone in a second.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
This time scale is.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
The level of Phenosecond.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And then HMM.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Its resonance strength.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Of course, it's going to be better than the other.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Uh.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
The other two are basically stronger.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
This is.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
This is.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
One of mine.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
The first work in the PhD class.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
It's the concept of Random Laser Combined HMM.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
That was accepted by ACS Photon at the end of last year.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
That's what we saw this year.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
So if you're interested.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
You can take a look at this one.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
And the above.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
The above data are all in.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
On this work.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
So this is my.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
The first work of the PhD class.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
So I'm the first one.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
It's the first one.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
It's the first one.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Combine HMM and Random Laser.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Concept.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
And then to achieve a.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Lacing enhanced.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Random Lacing enhanced behavior.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
So let me just sum up my work.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
So my work is a little bit.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
It's a little bit new.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Because he's.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
We're using the first one to use HMM.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Random Laser Concept.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Then we'll think it's interesting.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
It's because we can enhance.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Random Laser Peak.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And then our measurement came out.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Lifetime is short again.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Then we'll think this is a very.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
A very useful concept.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Because we can.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Reduce the Lacing demand.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
And then this.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Concept.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
This Random Laser is a board.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Angular emission.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Just like me.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
This is what I showed you a long time ago.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
The work.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Well, basically, this is my PhD.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
The first one.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
I.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
Combine HMM and Random Laser.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
So I'm going to give you a little bit of an introduction.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
We have other in our lab.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Random Laser.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
In this year.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
The article published.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So this is a few months ago.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
In.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
It should be last month.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Or the last month.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Advanced Optical Material.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Accept.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
It looks like.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Work.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
He's a.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
One of our labs.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
After a PhD.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
That's what he's doing now.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Change to two teachers.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Two labs to continue.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Continue to finish this work.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
That's it.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Finished.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
Published.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
That's his concept.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
It's also very simple.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
That is.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
They are using PurpleSky.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
And then use the combined.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Graphene Nanowall.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Graphene Nanowall.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
And then sprinkle some.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Like silver granite.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
As a scattering.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
So why do this?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
The graphene that stands up.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
It's because of my light.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's even more scattering inside.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It's a three-dimensional structure.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
And then you can get to.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And then you can get to.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
A very low level of laser.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
A very low level of laser.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
A very low level of laser.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
So you can see.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
This is in.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Nanogel.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
You can even get to the laser.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Because I'm using the graphene that stands up.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
The concept of three-dimensional.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Random Laser.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Random Laser.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
So you can see.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
This is a lot of peaks.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
This is a.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
This is some random CIs this year.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Random Laser Peaks.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Random Laser Peaks.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
What about last month?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
This is a covered paper.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
What about last month?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
This is a covered paper.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Then this is another one we have in the laboratory.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
This is another one we have in the laboratory.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
An article recently published.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
An article recently published.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
This article was taken last year.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
This article was taken last year.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.800
Last year the end was accepted to publish

40:01.800 --> 40:03.000
In scientiFLEport.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
This article is also a very simple concept.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
We put three RGBs.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Different materials.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
And then the laser meets in the middle.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
So it will hit a white laser.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Then I put down the YouTube video.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Then I put down the YouTube video.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
What is the situation when measuring?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
So when the RED light hits

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
The middle piece will hit a white light.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
The middle piece will hit a white light.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Random Laser Peak.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
Put another one.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
So it's like this.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
The middle is white light.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
If the focus is here.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
It's green and blue mixed out.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
If the focus is here.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
It's red and green mixed out.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
What is the selling point of this concept?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
If I want to make a lot of pixel.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
If I want to make a lot of pixel.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Overall, it's a white light.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Overall, it's a white light.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Random laser.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
Then we just mix the demo RGB first.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Mixed into this shape.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Then hit the middle.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
It is also a white light signal.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
This is the laser peak on both sides.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
If I turn on the power,

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Of course, my RGB peaks will be displayed.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
If we mix out the CIE image.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
You can see that it is very, very close to the white light.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
You can see that it is very, very close to the white light.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
This one is also a good one.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
This one is also a good one.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
In fact, I have another topic for today's report.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
This is my HMM.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
This is my HMM.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
To combine the concept of up-switching.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
In fact, because I will introduce first.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
What is the concept of up-switching?

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
The concept of up-switching energy is.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
My YB nanoparticle.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
My YB nanoparticle.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It may have a lot of different chemical elements.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
It may have a lot of different chemical elements.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Like my YB.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
To absorb the long-wave field.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Like 980.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
We usually use 980 or 8080.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
We usually use 980.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
So after YB absorbs 980.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
It will give the energy to other materials.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
The other materials are absorbed several times.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
After YB gives the long-wave field energy.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
It will jump out in a relatively short-wave form.

42:17.000 --> 42:22.000
Because the short-wave field is more powerful.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
The long-wave field is less energy.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
So this energy transfer process is called up-switching.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Because in general.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
The PL or type on both sides are down-switching.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Down-switching is that I give a short-wave field.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
The short-wave field means that the energy is more powerful.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
The short-wave field is like 266 laser.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Hit my ZMO.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
It releases 388.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
About 388.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
The up-switching is.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Hit 980 and put the visible light.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
4500, 300 can be.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
It depends on the ratio of my friction.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Basically, the up-switching nanoparticle is.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Different friction ratios.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I just hit 980.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Of course, this is the paper of others.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Just hit 980.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I can see different colors.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
The signal of different colors comes out.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
So this up-switching nanoparticle.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Everyone is.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
It will look like this.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
These are all TM photos.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Between different layers.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Because I need different.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
A distinction between different elements.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
So if you synthesize different dyes.

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
I need to connect with different ligands.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
So that my different elements.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
It will be very close together.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Basically, this is a concept of up-switching.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
This is the light of 980.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
Put visible light.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
In fact, my work.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
The work I focused on today is also this one.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
But because of this work.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
This work is still under review.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
In ACS content.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
I am a co-author with an Indian doctor.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
In fact, I thought this work.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Can be accepted in my report today.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
But now it's the second time.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
So wait a minute.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Because our first reviewer.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
There are four reviewers on the first floor.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Later on the first floor.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
When we revised.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
The editor sent it to reviewer 4.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Reviewer 4.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
He said we answered all the questions.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
But he suggested that we turn to Advanced Material.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
So the editor is looking for the fifth reviewer.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
We are now replying to the fifth reviewer's questions.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
So wait for it to be accepted later.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
I'll show it to you again.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Basically, this work is still under review in ACS content.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
In fact, the concept of this work is very simple.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
So I didn't show my Lacing Peak today.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Then I'll talk a little bit about it.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
How did I do this work?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Also, I need a multi-layer model.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Then put on top of it.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Upgraded Nanoparticle.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Then the upgraded Nanoparticle.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
He himself has to have RGB light.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Then we actually want this work.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I want to get a white laser thing out.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Then we actually have three designs.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
HM board.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Put it in the same way.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Upgraded material.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
That simple upgrade.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
He would have his own RGB light.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
But he would be more blue light here.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
For example, blue light and red light here.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
If I want to hit the white light.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
I need to go up.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
I need a little bit more green.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
Then I designed different boards.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
The closest to the HM1 board.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
HM1 is already very, very close.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
This 0.333 0.333 place.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
Because 0.333 0.333 is a pure white place.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Because it hasn't been accepted yet today.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
So I didn't show the data.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
The upgrade mechanism is the same as mine.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
As I said in the last video.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
I need a YB.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Need different.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Can put out RGB.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
These three kinds of dye.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
This kind of material.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Then my upgrade is to ask.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Taiwan Chemicals.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
YT-TEN laboratory cooperation.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
That is also looking for a doctor in India.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
Chen Yichong laboratory.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
Then there are ER, TM, and EU.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
All three will put RGB.

46:26.000 --> 46:32.000
It's hard to get a white light through synthesis.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
It's hard because this kind of jumping process.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
It's all a nonlinear.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
Assuming that my green light is already weaker.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I want to enhance my green light behavior.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
Once I can enhance my green light.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
I may eat other light.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
A thing that eats other light.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
That synthesis is also not an easy thing.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
But as long as we use this kind of HM1.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
This kind of basic enhancement.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It can be very, very close to white light.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
That kind of HM1.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
You can see that this is my Perseverance simulation.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
HM1, then there will be more places to enhance the green light.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Compared with other HM2 or HM3 places.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
So I combine this top conversion.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
And HM.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
I can make my green light stronger.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Then it's very, very close to white light.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
This is my other work.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
With an Indian.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Now in ACS Neo.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
I'll have a chance to show it to you later.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
But I want to say.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Since it's not convenient to show too much information to everyone.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I'll show you another one.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
This is a topic that the doctoral class has already published.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
In fact, this is also last summer.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
At this time.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
With a student in the math class.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
The topic that came to mind in Xiaofu.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Because the math class is mainly to do.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Tension.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
This kind of flexible thing.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
The photo detector.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Tension.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
There is also a flexible photo detector.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
On the base of Kerala.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Then I was wondering if I could use this concept.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
To do my one.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
This is the concept of the novel HM.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
This HM.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
I did it last summer.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
I did it for two or three months.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Then I wrote it.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Then I went to the scientific report.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Do you still remember?

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
This is my HM.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
I need a metal and a lithium-ion base.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
A multi-layer.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
This is very simple for me.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I use gold and PVA.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
As a base.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
HM's base.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
My PVA.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It's also a polymer.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Its detection rate is 1.5.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Like.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Just like the general material.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
That's just the advantage of PVA.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
It is durable.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
The first one.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
It can be melted.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
For example, if it is put in water.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
It will melt.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
So we want to say.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Can you do a tension.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
There is also a flexible HM.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
That's it.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
This is what I have done.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Materials.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
I do four pairs.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Because in fact, every pair.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I need to grind once.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Then break the cavity.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Spin coating again.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
So in fact.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
After a lot of pairs.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
This material is not easy to do.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
This is the material I just finished.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Put it in the water.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Then after 1.5 hours.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
It's gone.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
So I.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Tension HM.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
This thing is flexible again.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
Published this year's scientific report.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
This topic is actually.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Last year, with a math class.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
Studied together.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Why do tension?

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Because tension.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
In the early days.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
A few years ago.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
At that time.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
It was also very fierce.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Especially in 2012.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
This piece of science.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Is tension electronics.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Is this kind of.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Electronics.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Its material is made of like coal.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
The coal melts in the water.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
The coal is melted in the water.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
So you can see this.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Tension electronics.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Is my one-time.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Or short-term use.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
After using it, throw it away.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
That.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
I see.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I see their old paper.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
The introduction says.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
This can be used in the future.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Some military use.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
For example, after I use it.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
I don't want to take it away.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Or what?

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Just throw it on the ground.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Solved.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
That kind of thing.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Because it can be melted by water.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
That.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
I see some people are using.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
In vivo.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
In vivo.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
In vivo.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
The experiment.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
He.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
He can point it at me.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
One.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
A human body or machine.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Uh.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Inside the organ.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Then measure.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
After the test.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I don't have to open it again.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Until I take this material out.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
He.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
In this material.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
In this environment.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
In the biological body.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
It will disappear on its own.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
So this is the concept of tension electronics.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Concept of tension optics.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
That.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
The concept of horizontal optics.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
We first issued one in hs-nano last year.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
He is very simple here.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
That's.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Disori balalasporsp.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Publicity.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Also, we use.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
We do this with the topic.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
We use PVA.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
PVA is.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Shh.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Soil melt.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Ah.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Is the magnification is 1.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Then we mix it with PBA.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Anyway, there are other problems.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Zn or nanoparticle.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
There are other.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Uh.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Tl2 nanoparticle.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Then measure the light.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Then this.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
This device to measure the light.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
The.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
The data.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
After that, this thing.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
You can melt it.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
That's basically the concept of this spring.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Spring concept.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
That we.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Last year, we put it together first.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Uh.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
This kind of random laser.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Then I told the teacher class.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
The junior thought.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Can you.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Do a spring.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
Spring spring HMM out.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.000
This is my ASEAN photo.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Corsasia ASEAN photo.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
I designed a different HMM sample.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
The first one is HMM1.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
HMM1 is gold and PVA.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Is 25 and 42 nanometers.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
That gold.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
That's because PVA.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
This is more difficult.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
Is that he needs to test his parameters.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
So we're testing out about four different speeds.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Can reach 42 or 49 nanometers.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Then I can design different HMM.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
The color curve.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
The sample comes out.

51:59.000 --> 52:02.000
Then we do four pairs.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Then you can see this HMM1.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
It's a different wavelength.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
It's also this kind of hyperbolic dispersion.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
That HMM2.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
It's HMM in different wavelengths.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Then he is also EMM.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
This is EMM.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So his PL is in this 530.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
He will be weaker.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
Then we have this kind of HMM.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Sample to measure different fuels.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
Then you can find HMM1.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
In different fuels.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Because HMM1 is in this place.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
He belongs to me.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
He's stronger.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Will HMM be a little weaker?

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Then you can see this HMM.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
It's basically weaker than reference.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
So my HMM concept.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
I use it here.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Lifetime.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
For Lifetime.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
It's also a relatively short trend.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Of course, I also calculated the Skeleton cross-section.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Then I also calculated.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
I have different wavelengths.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Perceived effect enhancement behavior.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Of course, the closer to the base.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
My enhancement ratio will be larger.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
The farther he will be weaker.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
That.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
This is a little demo.

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
I'm in this trend HMM.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
In different like silicon base.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
Then the other is like glass glass base.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
He put it in the water.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
He will melt the same.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
In fact, you can see.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
After putting it in the water for five minutes.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
He will be a little bit broken.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
After 1.5 hours.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
His material will be melted in the water.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Just like this.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Next to the water.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
It's the kind of metal that's broken.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
That kind of metal.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
The components come out like this.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Of course, we have.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Demo some of his work.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Or on the PET base.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Then he can even stick it on his hand.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
As a bending.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Then we even want to say in the future.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
This concept can be combined.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
That smart phone.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
For the future to do this.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Lens may be helpful.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
That's just a demo of this concept.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Then we also did some bending test.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
That's on a different bending base.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
He can also measure a.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Strengthening behavior.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Uh, it's not like that.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
He still has a certain.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
PL signal out.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
That's Fred.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Of course, it will be stronger.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
That's in different bending radius.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
This is the signal we measured.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
That.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
That.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
This kind of polymer-made.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
What are the benefits of HM?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
It's that he can bend.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
That's not like the usual SL2.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Or what?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Uh, pick a rabbit.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
If it's an electrolyte.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
He could bend a few times.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
It's broken.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
It's not a good mold.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
That.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
This is our bending cycle.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
This is a motor that looks like a four-wheel drive.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Give him one.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Go on.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Give him a bending.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
That.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
After a few thousand times of bending.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
He.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
His PL signal still exists.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
So we feel like this kind of polymer-based.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Uh, HM.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
He's a future.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Maybe in Flexible Electronics.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Or Flexible Optics.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
It's also one of the moves.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
That's what we did before.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
He can do this thing.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
That.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
That.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
I.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
This is.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I proved that he could.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
That is.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Uh, put it in the water for five minutes.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
And then take out the sample.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Blow dry.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
After taking it out and drying it.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
And then the first dye.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Five minutes later.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
He's actually going to be DK.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Because the general R6G.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
His enhancement is about 100.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
More than 100.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
More than 100.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
So strong.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
That.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Soak for 30 minutes.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Take it out in 30 minutes.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
Two more PO.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
He's a little bit weaker.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
He's a lot weaker.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Okay, so I'm going to conclude a little bit.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Uh, I'm just going to conclude a little bit.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
This is.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
This is.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
It's the first one to make spring.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
And then again.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Flexible HM.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Then he is.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Polymer.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
The main material.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
That.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
We'll find it interesting.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Because he.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
It still retains the HM.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
The general kind of metal.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
The characteristics of the metal film.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
That.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
This kind of thing.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
It's kind of interesting.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.000
Because he might have used it.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
After a while.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
It's still there.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
It's still there.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
It's still there.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
It's still there.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
It's still there.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Maybe it will melt after a while.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
That's the future.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
First of all.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Yeah.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Environmental friendly.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
One concept.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Then he can also retain.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
If there is any.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.000
Data in there.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
He can.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Uh, go away.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
ERS4201

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
That's the CONCLSIR stream.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
It's a flexible.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
The conception of optoelectron.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
That's the relationship.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
So we.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Would you think this is a good job for the future.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
I see a lot of things.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
A group like Stanford.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
Someone calling ESKEET electronic feat.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Then we're going to do this maybe.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
In the future, we can do electron.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Optical electronic skin.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
An application.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Then this work.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Just a little demo.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
This concept.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
So this work.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
It actually took about 30.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Later.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Uh.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
It took about two or three months.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
It's over.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
Because in fact, this time.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
It's all very simple.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Then we're going to measure.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
P2 enhance.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Then melt.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Bending.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
So this work.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
It's almost like this.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Hey.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
That's basically my work.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It's probably like this.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Let's see what's wrong with everyone.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
That's our lab.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
This was taken last year.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Then we are actually a very large team.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
The teacher is here.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Then there are other Indians.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Then we will cooperate with other labs.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Mainly like this.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Because.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
I'm sorry.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Because this time I didn't introduce too much.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
My.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
This work.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
Because this work is still under review.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
So I'll just show you a little bit.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
How did we achieve this concept?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
And then the next one.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
My question is.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
That's it.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
He is.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
You put it in a flexible.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
It's kind of like a substrate.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Anyway, it's a flexible film.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
PET or something, right?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
That's right.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
You have a concept.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Your response.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
How sensitive is the deformation of this film?

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
You mean the deformation?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Correct.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
In fact.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Uh.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Wait a minute.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Let me see.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
In fact, if it is.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Let me see you like this.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Let's say it's like this.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Suppose he's in a bend.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
He might have some angles.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
It's not H.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
M.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
Some angles.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
Because my concept of H.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
M.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
To be in.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Uh.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Specific direction.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Specific frequency.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
If he bends.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
He might not be H.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
M.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
As for how to bend.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Uh.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm not going to prove this thing.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Correct.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Because like this bending.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
If you measure the side.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
We are bending.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
When the surface.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Measure the signal above.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
How is it?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
See if this thing will be.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Because of the process of bending.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
And affect.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
My light.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Come out.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
It looks okay.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
But if I bend.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Like this.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Because what I think of is.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
That is.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
You are equal to.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
It's kind of like.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
Just to prove that he said.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
You bend.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Do 500 times.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
1000 times.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
3000 times.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
And then put it back.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
He will have the effect.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
So he can.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
He can bear it.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Such.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Is bending.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
But.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
What I think of is.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
For example.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
If you take this thing.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Can replace.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
For example.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Like a pressure material.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Or.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
Like that.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.000
That kind of thing.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
You can become.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Super sensitive.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
The pressure.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Pressure sensor.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Or.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
The change of the sensor.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Uh.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I think maybe.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Just.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It depends on you.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Because you are doing light.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Your sensitivity.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
To change.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Just like you just said.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Maybe a little bit of deformation.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
He.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Uh.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
He didn't have that effect in an instant.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Then you know he's deformed.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You know what I mean.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Then if you choose.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
More correct.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
For example.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Your substrate.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
The material.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Let him.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Hardness.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Just.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
That.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
It's equal to.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Hardness is high enough.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Then he won't deform so much.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
You may be able to slightly increase your.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Dynamic.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Is that you can measure things.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Dynamic window.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Then you.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You can become a super sensitive.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The shape of the sensor.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I think.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I guess.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I don't know.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It must be calculated.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Correct.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Oh.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
OK.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Because this is also a direction.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Correct.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Just combine this.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
My this.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Flexible concept.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
To combine.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
This kind of.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Uh.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Uh.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Uh.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Uh.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Uh.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
The software.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
The whole thing.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
So I'm going to combine the concept.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Uh.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It's piezo.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
This.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
incidence of kind of concept.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Yeah.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Okay, so.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Basically, this.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I will introduce you to my previous ones.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And this one.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
PH.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
verbs.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Back to a Louis bonneture.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
9889,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
says,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Yeah.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Then.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
What are the other questions?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Questions.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I am.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Comment.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
That word.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
That worrit.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Then, later.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I'll tell you about it again if I have a chance.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Because we.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We actually have more.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Do other.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
White laser.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Come out.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Then this is still on both sides.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Then we have a work.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Will be this.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
The surface is still.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
We think it's still cool.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
The structure.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Then this is still on both sides.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Yeah.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Tomorrow will be on both sides.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Yeah.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And it is expected to be white light.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Then.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
What else do you have?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Questions.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I have a question.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Or.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yo, yo, yo.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Uh.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Just.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I want to ask.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Is.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Generally put a.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Is.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Something that glows.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Put it on.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Metal surface.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
It was.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Will be coupled to.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Surface plasma.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Oh, right.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Then.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Its.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Decay rate.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Will be faster.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That's right.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Is.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
How do you make sure.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Is.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Uh.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Because.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Because your material.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The top is also a layer of gold.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Metal.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
How do you make sure.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
That is.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
That is.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
That is.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
That is.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
How do you make sure.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
That is.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Not because of this reason.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
But because it has.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
HMM.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
What caused it.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
In fact.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Like doing this experiment.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We will.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
With.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Simple.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
The same thickness.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Mirror.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Like gold.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
To compare.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
That.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
You can.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
If it is gold.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It is.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Where it is strong.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It won't be like HMM.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It is a.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Boehming.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I have seen.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
If I.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
If I use the same thickness of metal.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Count.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
In this case.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Then strengthen.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
If it is possible.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's like this.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It's a very strong.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
A rumor.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It's in other waves.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Zengqian.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Just no.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It's not as strong as HMM.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
So of course it's right.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Like Xu Yang.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You just said.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It mirrors.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Gold.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
The general metal.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Neutron.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It's also a strength.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But if I want to do one.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Boehm.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Different wavelengths.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That is.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
For metal.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
The particles.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
May be impossible.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
That.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I can still control this.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
It.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Strengthen a rumor of different wavelengths.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
About.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Is there any strength?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That's right.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
The main thing is to look.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
The main thing is to look at the application.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
See what kind of application you want.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
That's like me.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
It's the strength of white light.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So I need to design this.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Different.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Different wavelengths.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Strengthening behavior.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
That's simple.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
The same thickness of metal.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Uh.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Gold.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It just can't reach.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It's close to a white light.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
A strength.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The light.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So simple metal.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It will also strengthen.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Then the other question is.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Is it possible.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's not.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
It's not.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's not.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It's not.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
It's not.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
It's not.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Then the other question is.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
This kind of metal material.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Usually the problem is absorption.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
That's.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
That's.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
In.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
In these.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Uh.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Lacing.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Or.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
You started with.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Enhance this.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
These.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
In the work.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Will this absorption.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Have caused some problems.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Hey.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I hope your question is.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Will the base be absorption?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Or.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
It's still.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It's still.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It's still.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's still.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It's still.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's still.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
It's still.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
It's still.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It's still.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Is it.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It's still.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Does it carry a lot of metal?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Uh.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Yeah.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Because he will absorb some things himself.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But as a whole.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It will make me.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
The top.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
The top.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Medial.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Medial.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
The.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Memory function will become higher.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
The.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's basically a little bit of absorption.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That's right.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So that's.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
A little bit.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
It's.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's a little bit.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
It's a little bit.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
It's.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It's a little bit.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
How much.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
But the reflection is OK.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Reflection is OK.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
It won't absorb everything.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Of course, I can also design.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
At some stages.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It absorbs very strongly.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
At some stages.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Its reflection is very strong.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It can rely on me.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Different.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Like.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Uh.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
A little bit.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Like.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Different.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Feel Fiction.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Can reach.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Wait a minute.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Like.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Like this.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I can.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Through different.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Feel Fiction.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
To adjust.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
So.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Not to say.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
This one.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
HMM comes out.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
For all the materials.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Perfect.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I want.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Case by case.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
To design.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
So.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Basically.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
HMM.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
If it's different.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
If it's different.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
My thickness ratio.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's a little bit different.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Just.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Case by case.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
To design.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I have a question.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Is that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Is that.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
How much is the mold volume?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
How much is the mold volume?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And that.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Why.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Mold volume.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Mold volume.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Mold volume.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Mold volume.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Mold volume.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Mold volume.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Mold volume.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Just.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Generally its.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
MOLD.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
How much is the mold volume.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It's like you said it.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It is.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
She is very small.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
But I don't know how little she is.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Ah.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Right.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I see you here.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
HMM.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Um.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But uh.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
This is a plane.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
That plane.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
The height of the.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
What is it?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
This.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The unit.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
What is it?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
This unit is.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Uh.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
The height of the plane.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
The height of the plane.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Uh.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
I think.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
UM3.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
It's changed to NANO3.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
It's ten.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Multiplied by ten to the ninth.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It should be.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Or ten to the sixth.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So it's this thing.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Multiply it by ten to the sixth.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Or ten to the sixth.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It is.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
How many MM3.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
So it's actually.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
It's a very small thing.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
That.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
This kind of thing.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
My question is.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
This thing is a plane.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
It's a plane.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
If it's a plane.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Uh.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Volume should be a length.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
The length.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
It's a length.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
That.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Unit.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Oh.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Because actually we.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Is.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's a plane.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But we.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
When using.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Calculation.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It also needs a.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
The volume to surround it.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
A.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
An overall calculation.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Area.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So it.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So the volume will bring you.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
The size of your calculation.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Inside.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yeah.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
This is.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
This is.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So actually I.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
How much is it?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Do you know?

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Hey.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I haven't counted this.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Of course.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
OK.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
But actually I'm different.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Depends on different.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
