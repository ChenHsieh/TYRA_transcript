00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Lin Yuwei from UC Irvine.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Our guest for today's TerraTalk is Lu Kefan, a Ph.D. student at Fairbanks University of Alaska.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
His field of research is very interesting. It's about Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He also worked as an intern at the Department of R&D at Fairbanks University of Alaska.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He also taught for 3 and a half years.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He is expected to graduate next spring.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You can visit his defense course and watch the aurora.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's welcome Lu Kefan.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Thank you, everyone.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't want to bore you.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Plus, no one knows about this field.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, I'll introduce the Arctic Ocean Sea Ice.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll talk about my field of research.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll also talk about my field of research.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll also talk about my field of research.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:07,000
At the beginning, we saw a video.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a popular video on social media.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It tells us how to reduce this year's sea ice.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's about how to save the Arctic, the Earth, and the environment.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's a similar title.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
For me, the video's demand is correct.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But every time I see a similar video, I have to be careful.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What does the color in the video represent?

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You may think that the white part is the size of the ice.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But in fact, this video is from NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It calculates the age of the ice.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That is, the length of time the ice stays in the ocean.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why do we look at the age of the ice?

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Generally speaking, we will divide the ice into one-year ice or multi-year ice.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
One-year ice is the gray part.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can see that it fluctuates a lot every year.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because it melts in summer.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When the sea water reaches the freezing point, it freezes again.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In fact, the thickness of the sea ice has nothing to do with its age.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The average thickness of one-year ice is about 2 to 3 meters.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Multi-year ice is the ice that has not completely melted in summer for more than a year.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Its thickness is actually about 3 meters.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The thickness of one-year ice or multi-year ice may be more than 5 meters.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So when you see a video like this, especially a large-scale video,

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because the thickness of the sea ice is very difficult to measure in the air.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So if you see such a large-scale video,

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It is usually not discussing the thickness of the sea ice or its size or volume.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Next, let's look at the winter of 2016.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Take a closer look at the gray part.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
For example, as I just said,

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One-year ice is also 3 meters.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Multi-year ice is also 3 meters.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then you will see that the whole piece is white.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Even the east coast of the United States still has sea ice.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then visually, you will not feel so deeply that our sea ice is declining.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You will not feel that terrible.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But NASA made this video is not to intimidate everyone.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This video has several points.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The first is that we can see that most of the sea ice will flow out of the Atlantic coast.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is the first point.

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The second point is that if we look closely at the gray area,

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Or look at the statistics next to it,

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
In the summer, the gray area is the part of one-year ice.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Indeed, there is a gradual decrease in the trend.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will say that it is a decrease in the trend,

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not that it's really decreasing every year.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's because it's really decreasing every summer.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But overall, it has been gradually decreasing in the past 40 years.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The countries that are concerned about the research of the Arctic Ocean

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There are mainly neighboring eight countries, including the United States, Greenland, Iceland,

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then the Nordic countries and Russia.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In addition to these neighboring eight countries,

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There are some countries such as Europe, Germany, France, East Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The reason why they are so concerned about the research of the Arctic Ocean is because

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everyone wants to take advantage of the summer when there is no ice.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Take advantage of the fishing rights and navigation rights in the Arctic Ocean.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So these distant East Asian countries,

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Once they can use this red line,

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This red line is the Arctic Ocean's North East Line.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It is now being used.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If East Asian countries use the North East Line to travel by sea,

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you send something to Europe,

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Its navigation will be about one-third of the way to the south.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So for them, the melting of the summer ice,

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or the gradual decrease in the area of ​​ice,

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
For some countries, it's not entirely a disaster or a bad thing.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Or something you want to avoid.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Not to mention the United States, Norway, and Russia.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There are very large drilling projects along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Or mining natural resources.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's not like what you see.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Greenpeace has tried to ban drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then they won.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not like that.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The reason why Shell stopped drilling in the Arctic Ocean

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's because they hired a lot of scientists to do research.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then they found out that if they were to deal with the subsequent oil and gas problems,

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And to strengthen the ecological balance,

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They didn't lose any profits.

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's why they decided to withdraw.

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But in addition to Shell,

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There are a lot of oil companies in the United States.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like ConocoFlips or BP.

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They continue to drill along the coast of the Arctic Ocean.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Not to mention that the entire north coast of Norway is a drilling platform.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What about these countries?

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Their attitude towards the reduction of sea ice is

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Treat it as a natural phenomenon that is already happening and is almost impossible to reverse.

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Their research focuses on how to deal with what has already happened.

105
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:51,000
For example, researchers from Alaska and Norway are now working on improving the shape of the oil platform.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Because we see that if there is less sea ice, the flow of the sea will be strengthened.

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But there will still be some floating ice stuck on the coast.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
These floating ice will be affected by the strong flow of the sea.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then it will hit the oil platform.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And then it could cause a public safety accident.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So they want to improve the oil platform to reduce the slowdown of floating ice collision.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Or like the East Asian countries I just mentioned,

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They are constantly studying when to enter the Arctic Ocean.

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Which route to take to avoid aftershocks and shipwrecks.

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
For example, Alaska's King Crab is very famous.

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
As the sea ice retreats, the water temperature will change.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So we find that the King Crab is gradually moving north.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At this time, they have to consider whether to change the target species or change the area and timing of the King Crab.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
These are all countries that are now working on Arctic research.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They are not completely treating it as a disaster to avoid.

121
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Or try to recover to the original sea ice situation.

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
From this animation, we can get a lot of information.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:41,000
A lot of sea ice is flowing out of the Atlantic Ocean.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This can be seen from the ocean flow cycle of the Arctic Ocean.

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There is a lot of Atlantic Ocean water flowing from the Atlantic Ocean of the Arctic Ocean.

126
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because of the force of gravity, the King Crab will move along the right bank of the Arctic Ocean.

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The Atlantic Ocean has an opening, and the Pacific Ocean also has an opening.

128
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why didn't the King Crab flow out of the Pacific Ocean?

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is because the opening of the Pacific Ocean is very narrow.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The width of the opening is about 100 to 200 kilometers.

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The depth of the opening is about 30 to 50 meters.

132
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The depth of the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is about 200 to 300 meters.

133
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So once the Atlantic Ocean enters the Arctic Ocean, it is difficult to flow out of the Pacific Ocean again.

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
At the same time, there is also water flowing from the Pacific Ocean.

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So the King Crab will continue to move along the right bank of the Atlantic Ocean.

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The King Crab will continue to move along the right bank of the Atlantic Ocean.

137
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is the first reason.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The second reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.

139
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The second reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The first reason is that we can see the picture of the King Crab.

141
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Continue to the third reason.

142
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The third reason is that the King Crab became very wet from the air.

143
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Continue to the fourth reason.

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Continue to the fifth reason.

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Continue to the sixth reason.

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Continue to the seventh reason.

147
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Continue to the eighth reason.

148
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Continue to the ninth reason.

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Continue to the tenth reason.

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Continue to the eleventh reason.

151
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Continue to the twelfth reason.

Continue to the thirteenth reason.

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Continue to the fourteenth reason.

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Continue to the 26th reason.

166
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000

The bottom of the ice water is a large layer of ice with a very high salinity of about 33 degrees.

297
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The reason why it is called winter water is because when the sea water freezes, it releases a lot of salt.

298
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
After the salt has melted, it enters the sea water, which makes the sea water very heavy.

299
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
After the sea water freezes, it sinks to the bottom, leaving a large amount of high salinity and very cold water.
