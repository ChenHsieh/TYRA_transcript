00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
Q&A

00:13.000 --> 00:25.000
Today's speaker is Dr. Wu Xinmei, a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, majoring in geoscience.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Before coming to the U.S., she was a graduate student of the Department of Geosciences at NTU.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Xinmei and I have met in many areas that are not overlapping.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
I met Xinmei when she was a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
My wife and Xinmei were classmates in college.

00:52.000 --> 01:04.000
After coming to Caltech, she met another Taiwanese friend in the Department of Physics, and turned out to be Xinmei's classmate.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
She will be talking about Anatomy of Ophethal in Yellowstone from Seismic Observation.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Let's give her a round of applause.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, by the way, you have to turn on the microphone to hear the applause.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Thank you for the introduction.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Today's presentation is a relatively easy one.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
There won't be a lot of formalities.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I will focus on the concepts.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Because people are not familiar with geoscience or geophysics,

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
I will focus on the concepts and focus on Ophethal Geyser.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
Ophethal is a very famous geyser in the U.S.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
If you go sightseeing in Yellowstone Park, you will definitely go to Ophethal.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
I hope you will find this topic more interesting.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
First, let's talk about Yellowstone.

02:18.000 --> 02:34.000
Yellowstone is on the left of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
This is the intersection of the three states.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
This is the area of the National Park.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Ophethal is on the right of Wyoming.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Let me introduce Ophethal first.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
Ophethal is a place where people rarely go to sightseeing.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
People usually go sightseeing to Ophethal.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Because it takes about five hours to get to many national parks.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
So if you drive from Ophethal to Yellowstone, it will take about five hours.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
If you have a chance to visit, you can come and visit.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Yellowstone is famous for its volcanic activity.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
People have heard of Ophethal.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
But if you come to the National Park to sightsee,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
what you see is not volcanic activity.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
It's more like a geyser, a hot spring, or a hydrothermal feature.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
I'll go into more detail later.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
If you drive from West Yellowstone to Ophethal,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
it will take about 30 to 40 minutes to get to Ophethal.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
So, after you drive in,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
you will see the National Park,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
and then you will see Ophethal.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
So, after you drive in,

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
you will see parking lots,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
and then you will see the Visitor Center.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
And then you will see Ophethal.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
And then you will see Ophethal.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
And then you will see Ophethal.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
You can sit here and wait for it to erupt.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
You can find the pathway up here,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
and the upper part is called the Geyser Hill.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
It's called the Geyser Hill because this is the place

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
with the highest density in the world,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
and it has the hydrothermal feature.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
So, you can see a lot of things smoked or hot water,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
hot springs, and some geysers.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
So, if you come to Yellowstone,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
you will definitely come here for a walk.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So, you can see things like this.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
It's very colorful.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
A lot of colors.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
These colors are usually some biological,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
microorganisms here.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
There are a lot of microorganisms here,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
so the colors you see are mainly caused by

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
the impact of the geysers.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
So, this is the map from the north to the south.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
This is the Geyser Hill,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
and there are a lot of hydrothermal features

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
around it.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
This is Old Faithful,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
and it's just over there.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
There's a video on the right,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
because we go out there every year.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So, this is the video.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
So, I thought Americans knew,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
but a lot of Americans have never been here,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
so they wouldn't be surprised.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Old Faithful has a lot of features.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
First of all, it's spectacular when it erupts.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Second, it can be predicted.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It can predict when it will erupt next time.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And if you go to the tourist center,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
they will put up a sign

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
to tell you when it will erupt next time,

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
so you can sit there and wait.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
But there's usually a 10-minute error.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
If you Google Old Faithful Webcam,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
you can see that there's a real-time camera

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
looking at Old Faithful.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I heard that a lot of people who like geysers

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
watch Old Faithful Webcam every day.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
If you're interested, you can Google it.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Old Faithful can predict,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
which means that the eruption

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
from this time to the next time

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
is very stable.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So the graph on the right

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
shows all the statistics

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
from 2000 to 2011.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
This is the probability.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
The horizontal axis is the eruption interval,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
which is how long it takes

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
from the first eruption to the next eruption.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And it has a peak value of about 92 minutes.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
So this is the prediction

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
for the last 10 to 20 years.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
But if we look at the longer period,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
from 1878 to now,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
the eruption cycle is about 60 minutes

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
to the present 90 minutes.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And then there's another one.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You can see there's a little peak here.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
It's not very obvious.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
It's divided into long eruption intervals

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
and short eruption intervals.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
The short one is about 60 to 65 minutes.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And then the long one and the short one,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
you can...

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I don't know what it's called in Chinese.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Anyway, a lot of park rangers

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
will do all kinds of things

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
in the National Park,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
or they'll do a lot of things.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
For example, look at the length of the eruption.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
The eruption time is about 2 to 5 minutes.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
If it's a long eruption,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
the next eruption will be 90 minutes later.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
But if it's an eruption

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
that feels like it's going to be gone in two minutes,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
the next one will be about 60 minutes later.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So all the predictions

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
for the Old Faithful eruption

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
are based on what you can see on the surface.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
But the National Park

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
is a very protected environment.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
So even if there are a lot of geologists

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
and geophysicists

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
and geophysicists

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
doing research here,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
they can't do research for a long time.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
They might come for a few hours

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
or a few days.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Although the Old Faithful eruption

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
has been recorded

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
about 100 years ago,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
it is still possible

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
to make the next prediction

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
based on the data from the eruption.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
So why is there a long-term change

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
or why is there a short-term change

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
or why is there a short-term change

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
or why is there a long-term change?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
The real mechanism is still unclear.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
If you have any questions,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
you can ask at any time.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Let me talk about

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
how we use geophysics

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
or geophysics

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
to study the structure of the fountain.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
People are usually unfamiliar

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
with seismology.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Although seismology is traditionally

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
known as earthquake science,

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
it mainly uses some relatively large energy,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
such as very large earthquake energy,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
to understand the information

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
from the source

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
to the process in which you receive it.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
So why do we want to study the fountain

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
or the interstitial fountain?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
First of all,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
it has a very important indicator.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
In fact, all the structures

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
under the ground

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
or some physical mechanisms

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
are quite similar to volcanoes.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
So you need a lot of water

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
to get to the bottom of the fountain.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
There is a narrow channel

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
called the conduit,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
and there is a reservoir

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
below it.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
There is also a volcano,

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
which you may have heard of.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
In the process of temperature pressure

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
or building,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
they move forward.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
You can see the animation here.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
These are the lava,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
because of the temperature

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and pressure below,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
and some mass.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
The lava is mass,

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
and then it moves forward

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
to a critical value,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
and then it moves back.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
The lava is a mass,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
and it moves forward to a critical value,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
and then it moves back.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Most of the volcanic prediction

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
is to use the mass movement

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
to generate signals

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
and contact delays.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
If you have an earthquake

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
near the volcano,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
you can get some earthquake signals.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
So geysers have similar principles.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
But when it comes to studying volcanoes,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
a lot of them erupt every few million years

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
or every volcano grows differently.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And it's dangerous to study volcanoes.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
A lot of people don't want to die

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
because of studying volcanoes.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
So if we can find a way

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
to understand the mechanism

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
of geysers,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
we might be able to

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
apply our understanding

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
of volcanoes in the future

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
and do some analysis of volcanic disasters.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Hello.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Before you move on to the next page,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
I'd like to ask a question.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Someone has a question.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Wu Mengchang has a question.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Do you want to ask it yourself?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
You can turn on the microphone.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Can you use artificial geysers

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
and your internal structure

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
to create animations?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Animation?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
Do you mean volcanoes or geysers?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
I mean your animation.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
There are a lot of studies

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
on volcanoes.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It's not just one or two studies.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
If you go to IRIS,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
you can find a lot of

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
visual education content.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Most of the research on volcanoes

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
is very complicated.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
If it's an earthquake signal,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
it's coming from a very deep

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
or shallow place.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
There are a lot of ways

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
to analyze it.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
The geyser I'm going to talk about

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
is a bit applicable.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
If you have any questions,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
please feel free to ask.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I'll talk about

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
traditional geyser theory.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
It's what I use.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
If there's an earthquake,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
the geyser energy is very strong.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
It will pass through

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
different waves.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
For example,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
if you put a station here,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
you can receive the geyser signal

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
from that station.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Geyser theory uses

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
such a geyser signal

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
to analyze the source of the earthquake

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
or what effect it has

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
on the path of the geyser.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
This is the most traditional geyser theory.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
In other words,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
if you have a geyser,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
you can use this energy

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
to study the structure

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
between the source and the receiver.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
If you know the source,

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
you can use it to study the path.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
This is a bit of a trade-off,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
but there are many different kinds of research.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
It's scientific.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
We can verify each other

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and it will become believable.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
I think this is the only way

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
to look at the internal structure of the earth.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
NASA is now putting a geyser on Mars,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
so it's very difficult

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
to predict the structure of Mars.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
This is a bit of a trade-off.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Now I'm going to talk about

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
my own research.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm going to talk from the biggest structure

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
to the smallest structure.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
This is our yellow picture.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
This is a picture of Mars.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
This is a picture of Mars.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
This is our yellow picture.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
This is a picture of Mars.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
This is the Geyser Hill.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
This is the Geyser Hill.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
This is the Geyser Hill.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
The red circle is the path.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
The red circle is the path.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Each red circle is our instrument.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
We don't know what to look at

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
We don't know what to look at

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
We try to spread it evenly.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
We try to spread it evenly.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Let's see what we can get

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Let's see what we can get

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
It's about this big

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
It's about this big

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
You can go and dig a lot in a short time

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
You can go and dig a lot in a short time

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
If an earthquake may impact an environment or human activity,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
If an earthquake may impact an environment or human activity,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
There are frequent circumstances where people can enter.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
As fast as you can imagine,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
it's a long forest.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
As fast as you can imagine,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
this type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
this type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
This type of instrument will be more innovative in the near future

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
This is not a traffic jam,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
but a structure.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
but a structure.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
but a structure.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
but a structure.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
but a structure.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
but a structure.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
but a structure.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
but a structure.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
But what can you prevent?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
But what can you prevent?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
What will you do?

19:18.040 --> 19:21.020
Likewise, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunken because of the distance.

19:21.020 --> 19:24.000
Similarly, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunked because of the distance.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.160
Similarly, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunken because of the distance.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.200
Similarly, the signal becomes delayed and the current is shrunken because of the distance.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.380
Use a common fact to distinguish between two sign boards.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.520
Use a common fact to distinguish between two sign boards.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.620
Use a common fact to distinguish between two sign boards.

19:39.620 --> 19:42.360
you can find the signal that's stored in the noise.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.860
you can find the signal that's stored in the noise.

19:45.860 --> 19:47.720
Find its origin.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.740
Find its origin.

19:54.380 --> 19:57.400
Find the recommendation time.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.080
Use concrete feedback to perform cross-student calculations to find its origin.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.100
Use concrete feedback to perform cross-student calculations to find its origin.

20:09.220 --> 20:11.160
Do you have time or distance?

20:11.760 --> 20:12.660
Do you have time or distance?

20:29.460 --> 20:31.660
Do you have time or distance?

20:41.160 --> 20:43.160
Do you have time or distance?

21:11.160 --> 21:13.160
Do you have time or distance?

21:41.160 --> 21:43.160
Do you have time or distance?

22:11.160 --> 22:13.160
Do you have time or distance?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.160
Do you have time or distance?

23:11.160 --> 23:13.160
Do you have time or distance?

23:41.160 --> 23:43.160
Do you have time or distance?

23:43.160 --> 23:45.160
Do you have time or distance?

24:07.660 --> 24:09.660
Do you have time or distance?

24:11.160 --> 24:13.160
Do you have time or distance?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.160
Do you have time or distance?

25:11.160 --> 25:13.160
Do you have time or distance?

25:41.160 --> 25:43.160
Do you have time or distance?

25:43.160 --> 25:45.160
Do you have time or distance?

25:45.160 --> 25:47.160
Do you have time or distance?

25:47.160 --> 25:49.160
Do you have time or distance?

25:49.160 --> 25:51.160
Do you have time or distance?

26:07.160 --> 26:09.160
Do you have time or distance?

26:09.160 --> 26:13.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:13.160 --> 26:15.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:15.160 --> 26:17.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:17.160 --> 26:19.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:19.160 --> 26:23.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:23.160 --> 26:25.160

26:33.160 --> 26:35.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:35.160 --> 26:37.160
Good or bad roaring dragon

26:37.160 --> 26:39.160
But when it's high frequency

26:39.160 --> 26:41.160
You can see I drew a box here

26:41.160 --> 26:43.160
Blue area

26:43.160 --> 26:45.160
High frequency when it passes through the blue area

26:45.160 --> 26:47.160
You can see its waveform

26:47.160 --> 26:49.160
The first waveform is late, very obvious

26:49.160 --> 26:51.160
The second is that it has a lot

26:51.160 --> 26:53.160
Smaller and higher frequency

26:53.160 --> 26:55.160
Wiggle is

26:55.160 --> 26:57.160
One by one we call coda

26:57.160 --> 26:59.160
What does this mean

26:59.160 --> 27:01.160
This means that the high frequency

27:01.160 --> 27:03.160
Small wave

27:03.160 --> 27:05.160
Relatively small wavelength

27:05.160 --> 27:07.160
In a shallow place

27:07.160 --> 27:09.160
When it passes through this area

27:09.160 --> 27:11.160
Obstructions

27:11.160 --> 27:13.160
Here are some

27:13.160 --> 27:15.160
Objectivity

27:15.160 --> 27:17.160
Of course, you can use some

27:17.160 --> 27:19.160
Earthquake learning methods to guess

27:19.160 --> 27:21.160
What is the situation

27:21.160 --> 27:23.160
You can also be a model

27:23.160 --> 27:25.160
I won't talk too much

27:25.160 --> 27:27.160
Because of this

27:27.160 --> 27:29.160
Observation results

27:29.160 --> 27:31.160
Find out

27:31.160 --> 27:33.160
There is a relatively large

27:33.160 --> 27:35.160
Hello

27:35.160 --> 27:37.160
I have a problem with the front page

27:37.160 --> 27:39.160
it is good

27:39.160 --> 27:41.160
My question is

27:41.160 --> 27:43.160
Did you frame the blue box

27:43.160 --> 27:45.160
It's obvious when you frame it

27:45.160 --> 27:47.160
There is clustering

27:47.160 --> 27:49.160
This is different from the other set of data

27:49.160 --> 27:51.160
But if you don't frame the blue box

27:51.160 --> 27:53.160
I slipped when I looked at my eyes

27:53.160 --> 27:55.160
Really

27:55.160 --> 27:57.160
I mean

27:57.160 --> 27:59.160
Very difficult

27:59.160 --> 28:01.160
Can be seen at a glance

28:01.160 --> 28:03.160
If your test today

28:03.160 --> 28:05.160
Ten more times

28:05.160 --> 28:07.160
Isn't it more difficult

28:07.160 --> 28:09.160
I'm curious

28:09.160 --> 28:11.160
Technically

28:11.160 --> 28:13.160
Try to adapt

28:13.160 --> 28:15.160
For example

28:15.160 --> 28:17.160
Machine learning

28:17.160 --> 28:19.160
Autoprocessing

28:19.160 --> 28:21.160
Pre-selection

28:21.160 --> 28:23.160
Interpret

28:23.160 --> 28:25.160
Or you can see it

28:25.160 --> 28:27.160
This

28:27.160 --> 28:29.160
This picture is for us

28:29.160 --> 28:31.160
Very obvious

28:31.160 --> 28:33.160
Can be seen

28:33.160 --> 28:35.160
So

28:35.160 --> 28:37.160
I think machine learning is definitely the future trend

28:37.160 --> 28:39.160
My boss is still working with

28:39.160 --> 28:41.160
Computer science

28:41.160 --> 28:43.160
Want to do real-time

28:43.160 --> 28:45.160
Real-time

28:45.160 --> 28:47.160
To see the changes

28:47.160 --> 28:49.160
But these are more

28:49.160 --> 28:51.160
And especially machine learning

28:51.160 --> 28:53.160
You need some training data

28:53.160 --> 28:55.160
You have to have some

28:55.160 --> 28:57.160
Know some

28:57.160 --> 28:59.160
Knowledge

28:59.160 --> 29:01.160
You can apply it to the future

29:01.160 --> 29:03.160
Prediction

29:03.160 --> 29:05.160
But machine learning is definitely

29:05.160 --> 29:07.160
Must do

29:07.160 --> 29:09.160
I didn't talk about this bar

29:09.160 --> 29:11.160
This bar is

29:11.160 --> 29:13.160
We predict

29:13.160 --> 29:15.160
This distance

29:15.160 --> 29:17.160
If I predict the same speed

29:17.160 --> 29:19.160
Where will they be

29:19.160 --> 29:21.160
So it will be obvious

29:21.160 --> 29:23.160
You see them

29:23.160 --> 29:25.160
1 km

29:25.160 --> 29:27.160
But this area

29:27.160 --> 29:29.160
They become

29:29.160 --> 29:31.160
0.5

29:31.160 --> 29:33.160
I think

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
It must be good

29:35.160 --> 29:37.160
You have to see

29:37.160 --> 29:39.160
Very small

29:39.160 --> 29:41.160
But this is very obvious

29:41.160 --> 29:43.160
We have to

29:43.160 --> 29:45.160
To see

29:45.160 --> 29:47.160
I think

29:47.160 --> 29:49.160
The answer is good

29:49.160 --> 29:51.160
So we can

29:51.160 --> 29:53.160
Different frequency

29:53.160 --> 29:55.160
Different sensitivity

29:55.160 --> 29:57.160
So we can

29:57.160 --> 29:59.160
Sensitivity and range

29:59.160 --> 30:01.160
To estimate

30:01.160 --> 30:03.160
This thing

30:03.160 --> 30:05.160
How big

30:05.160 --> 30:07.160
This thing

30:07.160 --> 30:09.160
Relatively deep storage

30:09.160 --> 30:11.160
Water

30:11.160 --> 30:13.160
All to

30:13.160 --> 30:15.160
The system

30:15.160 --> 30:17.160
Water

30:17.160 --> 30:19.160
Water

30:19.160 --> 30:21.160
If it's a volcano

30:21.160 --> 30:23.160
It may be a lava pool

30:23.160 --> 30:25.160
I forgot to say

30:25.160 --> 30:27.160
The slope is from A to A

30:27.160 --> 30:29.160
So it's just a slope

30:29.160 --> 30:31.160
The low frequency I just talked about

30:31.160 --> 30:33.160
Southwest

30:33.160 --> 30:35.160
Ice Age

30:35.160 --> 30:37.160
Northeast

30:37.160 --> 30:39.160
Lava

30:39.160 --> 30:41.160
The purpose is

30:41.160 --> 30:43.160
Because

30:43.160 --> 30:45.160
We have a lot of volcanoes

30:45.160 --> 30:47.160
Taiwan also has a volcano

30:47.160 --> 30:49.160
But geyser

30:49.160 --> 30:51.160
Feature

30:51.160 --> 30:53.160
Very rare

30:53.160 --> 30:55.160
Why is it rare

30:55.160 --> 30:57.160
You have so many hot springs

30:57.160 --> 30:59.160
It actually needs a specific geological structure

30:59.160 --> 31:01.160
To be able to

31:01.160 --> 31:03.160
Such a condition

31:03.160 --> 31:05.160
For O-Facebook

31:05.160 --> 31:07.160
The first one you can see

31:07.160 --> 31:09.160
This

31:09.160 --> 31:11.160
Reservoir

31:11.160 --> 31:13.160
Like a reservoir

31:13.160 --> 31:15.160
It's not directly

31:15.160 --> 31:17.160
At the bottom of O-Facebook

31:17.160 --> 31:19.160
It's in the southwest

31:19.160 --> 31:21.160
Why

31:21.160 --> 31:23.160
Because

31:23.160 --> 31:25.160
Relative to this

31:25.160 --> 31:27.160
Geyser

31:27.160 --> 31:29.160
It's easier to break

31:29.160 --> 31:31.160
If you have temperature or pressure

31:31.160 --> 31:33.160
Give it a lot of temperature or pressure

31:33.160 --> 31:35.160
It's easier to fracture

31:35.160 --> 31:37.160
So when you have water

31:37.160 --> 31:39.160
From below

31:39.160 --> 31:41.160
They prefer

31:41.160 --> 31:43.160
It's easier to break

31:43.160 --> 31:45.160
This is another

31:47.160 --> 31:49.160
Result

31:49.160 --> 31:51.160
Then I just said it was big

31:51.160 --> 31:53.160
I'm going to talk about it now

31:53.160 --> 31:55.160
It's not me

31:55.160 --> 31:57.160
Let's talk about this little one

31:57.160 --> 31:59.160
Smaller

31:59.160 --> 32:01.160
What I'm talking about now

32:01.160 --> 32:03.160
Bubble trap is this one

32:03.160 --> 32:05.160
It's probably in this

32:05.160 --> 32:07.160
It's about 300 meters deep

32:07.160 --> 32:09.160
Then

32:09.160 --> 32:11.160
The depth is about

32:11.160 --> 32:13.160
20 to 60, but this is much smaller

32:13.160 --> 32:15.160
This is probably

32:15.160 --> 32:17.160
20 meters deep

32:17.160 --> 32:19.160
Then the width

32:21.160 --> 32:23.160
Then they said

32:23.160 --> 32:25.160
This is another way

32:25.160 --> 32:27.160
They set up a lot of stations

32:27.160 --> 32:29.160
It's on O-Facebook

32:29.160 --> 32:31.160
You can see this

32:31.160 --> 32:33.160
It's completely different from our first station

32:33.160 --> 32:35.160
This is a little bit denser

32:35.160 --> 32:37.160
Then it's more focused

32:37.160 --> 32:39.160
They don't use

32:39.160 --> 32:41.160
The source

32:41.160 --> 32:43.160
They use O-Facebook

32:43.160 --> 32:45.160
Their own source

32:45.160 --> 32:47.160
Then go and see

32:47.160 --> 32:49.160
For example, I have an energy here

32:49.160 --> 32:51.160
Then I have a very dense array above

32:51.160 --> 32:53.160
My energy to this station

32:53.160 --> 32:55.160
They will have a time difference

32:55.160 --> 32:57.160
So they use

32:57.160 --> 32:59.160
Array

32:59.160 --> 33:01.160
Very dense array

33:01.160 --> 33:03.160
All the energy

33:03.160 --> 33:05.160
Where did it come from

33:05.160 --> 33:07.160
I'll talk more about it later

33:07.160 --> 33:09.160
This energy

33:09.160 --> 33:11.160
Now

33:11.160 --> 33:13.160
It's part of the structure

33:13.160 --> 33:15.160
They found

33:15.160 --> 33:17.160
For example, from the last station

33:17.160 --> 33:19.160
Between

33:19.160 --> 33:21.160
The energy is divided into two areas

33:21.160 --> 33:23.160
The first area is almost vertical

33:23.160 --> 33:25.160
Under O-Facebook

33:25.160 --> 33:27.160
The second area is the red area

33:27.160 --> 33:29.160
Is more to the south

33:29.160 --> 33:31.160
A little bit

33:31.160 --> 33:33.160
Because of this discovery

33:33.160 --> 33:35.160
I think

33:35.160 --> 33:37.160
O-Facebook structure

33:37.160 --> 33:39.160
It may not be

33:39.160 --> 33:41.160
Just a channel

33:41.160 --> 33:43.160
There will be other

33:43.160 --> 33:45.160
This is called

33:45.160 --> 33:47.160
Cavity or bubble trap feature

33:47.160 --> 33:49.160
It has an offset structure

33:49.160 --> 33:51.160
The constraint here

33:51.160 --> 33:53.160
Not very good

33:53.160 --> 33:55.160
But after all, the energy still comes from here

33:55.160 --> 33:57.160
It means that there is actually

33:57.160 --> 33:59.160
There is a structure here

33:59.160 --> 34:01.160
This discovery

34:01.160 --> 34:03.160
Very important

34:03.160 --> 34:05.160
Because you said

34:05.160 --> 34:07.160
A lot of modeling

34:07.160 --> 34:09.160
Geyser modeling

34:09.160 --> 34:11.160
Research

34:11.160 --> 34:13.160
It actually needs very

34:13.160 --> 34:15.160
Determine

34:15.160 --> 34:17.160
What does it look like

34:17.160 --> 34:19.160
Do you have one

34:19.160 --> 34:21.160
Involved in this

34:21.160 --> 34:23.160
It's very different

34:23.160 --> 34:25.160
So

34:25.160 --> 34:27.160
This discovery is actually quite a lot

34:27.160 --> 34:29.160
More surprised

34:29.160 --> 34:31.160
Then

34:31.160 --> 34:33.160
Conjured

34:33.160 --> 34:35.160
This structure is too small

34:35.160 --> 34:37.160
All

34:37.160 --> 34:39.160
Referred

34:39.160 --> 34:41.160
Conjured

34:41.160 --> 34:43.160
From this reference

34:43.160 --> 34:45.160
This is about 20 years ago

34:45.160 --> 34:47.160
Whether it's Caltech or Berkeley

34:47.160 --> 34:49.160
Then they just put it directly

34:49.160 --> 34:51.160
Camera

34:51.160 --> 34:53.160
Put the camera down

34:53.160 --> 34:55.160
From O-Facebook

34:55.160 --> 34:57.160
Put it down

34:57.160 --> 34:59.160
What does it look like

34:59.160 --> 35:01.160
What does it look like

35:01.160 --> 35:03.160
If you are interested, you can watch YouTube

35:03.160 --> 35:05.160
That feels like

35:05.160 --> 35:07.160
Explore outer space

35:07.160 --> 35:09.160
Satellite environment

35:09.160 --> 35:11.160
Anyway, it looks like this

35:11.160 --> 35:13.160
Then there will be a lot of explanations

35:13.160 --> 35:15.160
Why do they do this

35:15.160 --> 35:17.160
What did you find

35:17.160 --> 35:19.160
The interesting thing is that they

35:19.160 --> 35:21.160
In the past

35:21.160 --> 35:23.160
Maybe the instrument or something

35:23.160 --> 35:25.160
Will not receive more restrictions

35:25.160 --> 35:27.160
You can't be there when it erupts

35:27.160 --> 35:29.160
So they are

35:29.160 --> 35:31.160
This observation

35:31.160 --> 35:33.160
Actually did it for two or three years

35:33.160 --> 35:35.160
Then what did you say in the first year

35:35.160 --> 35:37.160
It's a big bubble

35:37.160 --> 35:39.160
In the water of Bolin

35:39.160 --> 35:41.160
Then go down

35:41.160 --> 35:43.160
Then go again in the second year

35:43.160 --> 35:45.160
Then the main thing is

35:45.160 --> 35:47.160
About 20

35:47.160 --> 35:49.160
He can

35:49.160 --> 35:51.160
The camera can reach about 20 meters

35:51.160 --> 35:53.160
20 meters deep

35:53.160 --> 35:55.160
I'm not sure

35:55.160 --> 35:57.160
If this restriction is also

35:57.160 --> 35:59.160
If you have a feature next to you

35:59.160 --> 36:01.160
Then its pipe is very narrow

36:01.160 --> 36:03.160
Then you may not be able to get out of the video

36:03.160 --> 36:05.160
Can be seen

36:05.160 --> 36:07.160
But this kind of observation

36:07.160 --> 36:09.160
Is very reliable

36:09.160 --> 36:11.160
What you see is what

36:11.160 --> 36:13.160
If it is an earthquake signal

36:13.160 --> 36:15.160
Or some signals

36:15.160 --> 36:17.160
He actually

36:17.160 --> 36:19.160
There is an error

36:19.160 --> 36:21.160
You have to measure

36:21.160 --> 36:23.160
How much

36:25.160 --> 36:27.160
Ok

36:27.160 --> 36:29.160
The first half of the structure is like that

36:29.160 --> 36:31.160
If you have any questions, you can ask now

36:31.160 --> 36:33.160
How much time

36:33.160 --> 36:35.160
If not, I have to continue

36:35.160 --> 36:37.160
What I'm talking about now

36:37.160 --> 36:39.160
Old Facebook

36:39.160 --> 36:41.160
Your own

36:41.160 --> 36:43.160
What is the signal

36:43.160 --> 36:45.160
That is

36:45.160 --> 36:47.160
This paper

36:47.160 --> 36:49.160
He is mainly using signals

36:49.160 --> 36:51.160
I think this will be more interesting

36:51.160 --> 36:53.160
Ok

36:53.160 --> 36:55.160
So if you have a station

36:55.160 --> 36:57.160
Put it in

36:57.160 --> 36:59.160
It should be super close

36:59.160 --> 37:01.160
Maybe put it next to it

37:01.160 --> 37:03.160
Then this will be

37:03.160 --> 37:05.160
If that station is on the ground

37:05.160 --> 37:07.160
This is the signal we received

37:07.160 --> 37:09.160
This is a whole day

37:09.160 --> 37:11.160
This is a 24-hour signal

37:11.160 --> 37:13.160
So you see he is 90

37:13.160 --> 37:15.160
About 90 minutes

37:15.160 --> 37:17.160
Every 90 minutes

37:17.160 --> 37:19.160
Related cycle

37:19.160 --> 37:21.160
Then

37:21.160 --> 37:23.160
If we only look at one

37:23.160 --> 37:25.160
If we only look at one

37:25.160 --> 37:27.160
This is about 100 minutes

37:27.160 --> 37:29.160
So there is a burst

37:29.160 --> 37:31.160
If you look at it

37:31.160 --> 37:33.160
Where do you think it will be

37:33.160 --> 37:35.160
Where

37:35.160 --> 37:37.160
I probably won't

37:37.160 --> 37:39.160
This red curve

37:39.160 --> 37:41.160
It is the real record

37:41.160 --> 37:43.160
To the time of the burst

37:43.160 --> 37:45.160
So you see before he

37:45.160 --> 37:47.160
We think

37:47.160 --> 37:49.160
More than 10 hertz

37:49.160 --> 37:51.160
More than 10 hertz

37:51.160 --> 37:53.160
The signal

37:53.160 --> 37:55.160
Even stronger than

37:55.160 --> 37:57.160
The signal when you burst

37:57.160 --> 37:59.160
This signal

37:59.160 --> 38:01.160
If we zoom in

38:01.160 --> 38:03.160
You can see a very obvious

38:03.160 --> 38:05.160
Event

38:05.160 --> 38:07.160
This kind of signal

38:07.160 --> 38:09.160
From

38:09.160 --> 38:11.160
We are talking about

38:11.160 --> 38:13.160
Bubble collapse

38:13.160 --> 38:15.160
For example, you cook

38:15.160 --> 38:17.160
You cook a pot of soup

38:17.160 --> 38:19.160
There will be a lot of small bubbles

38:19.160 --> 38:21.160
Then slowly float to the front

38:21.160 --> 38:23.160
Colder water

38:23.160 --> 38:25.160
Then they will

38:25.160 --> 38:27.160
Break off

38:27.160 --> 38:29.160
Break off

38:29.160 --> 38:31.160
Every event

38:31.160 --> 38:33.160
Relative

38:33.160 --> 38:35.160
Relative to

38:35.160 --> 38:37.160
You can see a lot here

38:37.160 --> 38:39.160
Recorded

38:39.160 --> 38:41.160
Then this picture

38:41.160 --> 38:43.160
This is the signal

38:43.160 --> 38:45.160
You see the water coming out

38:45.160 --> 38:47.160
The first one

38:47.160 --> 38:49.160
Before the burst

38:49.160 --> 38:51.160
The energy is much smaller

38:51.160 --> 38:53.160
Then he grew up

38:53.160 --> 38:55.160
It's completely different from them

38:55.160 --> 38:57.160
Then

38:57.160 --> 38:59.160
We won't talk about it today

38:59.160 --> 39:01.160
The signal of the burst

39:01.160 --> 39:03.160
Before the burst

39:03.160 --> 39:05.160
Like these signals

39:05.160 --> 39:07.160
Can bring us

39:07.160 --> 39:09.160
How can we do research

39:09.160 --> 39:11.160
How can we use these signals

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
To understand

39:13.160 --> 39:15.160
What is it

39:15.160 --> 39:17.160
So

39:17.160 --> 39:19.160
There are a lot of

39:19.160 --> 39:21.160
The first

39:21.160 --> 39:23.160
Burst every 90 minutes

39:23.160 --> 39:25.160
Why

39:25.160 --> 39:27.160
So

39:27.160 --> 39:29.160
This kind of thing

39:29.160 --> 39:31.160
There is a fixed pattern

39:31.160 --> 39:33.160
There will be a certain pattern

39:33.160 --> 39:35.160
There will be a certain pattern

39:35.160 --> 39:37.160
For example, here

39:37.160 --> 39:39.160
There is no event

39:39.160 --> 39:41.160
Then there will be more

39:41.160 --> 39:43.160
So the first one

39:43.160 --> 39:45.160
Let's calculate

39:45.160 --> 39:47.160
How many

39:47.160 --> 39:49.160
Along the time

39:49.160 --> 39:51.160
How many

39:51.160 --> 39:53.160
This event

39:53.160 --> 39:55.160
Then do the statistics

39:55.160 --> 39:57.160
30

39:57.160 --> 39:59.160
A total of 30

39:59.160 --> 40:01.160
Is

40:01.160 --> 40:03.160
One

40:03.160 --> 40:05.160
A total of 30

40:05.160 --> 40:07.160
Then

40:07.160 --> 40:09.160
Use eruption time

40:09.160 --> 40:11.160
As a reference

40:11.160 --> 40:13.160
Then all the time

40:13.160 --> 40:15.160
Relative to the time of the burst

40:15.160 --> 40:17.160
20

40:17.160 --> 40:19.160
20 minutes before the burst

40:19.160 --> 40:21.160
20 minutes before the burst

40:21.160 --> 40:23.160
40

40:23.160 --> 40:25.160
40 minutes before the burst

40:25.160 --> 40:27.160
60 minutes before the burst

40:27.160 --> 40:29.160
Then hope that if we

40:29.160 --> 40:31.160
Collected a lot of eruption cycles

40:31.160 --> 40:33.160
See if there is a fixed pattern

40:33.160 --> 40:35.160
This is the number

40:35.160 --> 40:37.160
Gray is the number

40:37.160 --> 40:39.160
Gray is the number

40:39.160 --> 40:41.160
So it has a very

40:41.160 --> 40:43.160
The fixed pattern is

40:43.160 --> 40:45.160
It will have a number

40:45.160 --> 40:47.160
Peak

40:47.160 --> 40:49.160
20 minutes before

40:49.160 --> 40:51.160
20 minutes before the burst

40:51.160 --> 40:53.160
Then there will be a decrease

40:53.160 --> 40:55.160
Then there will be an increase

40:55.160 --> 40:57.160
Then the red is

40:57.160 --> 40:59.160
If you consider not only the number

40:59.160 --> 41:01.160
You consider the size of each event

41:01.160 --> 41:03.160
Then the pattern will look like this

41:05.160 --> 41:07.160
In addition to the number

41:07.160 --> 41:09.160
What else can be done

41:09.160 --> 41:11.160
You can see

41:11.160 --> 41:13.160
Each of these events

41:13.160 --> 41:15.160
You can see

41:15.160 --> 41:17.160
Is there a number

41:17.160 --> 41:19.160
Or they all look different

41:19.160 --> 41:21.160
Or they actually have a set model

41:21.160 --> 41:23.160
So what you can do is

41:23.160 --> 41:25.160
I don't know if you know

41:25.160 --> 41:27.160
Cluster analysis

41:27.160 --> 41:29.160
Use it

41:29.160 --> 41:31.160
For example, you have

41:31.160 --> 41:33.160
You have a box of blocks

41:33.160 --> 41:35.160
It may have different shapes

41:35.160 --> 41:37.160
Different colors

41:37.160 --> 41:39.160
Then you can sort by color

41:39.160 --> 41:41.160
You can also sort by shape

41:41.160 --> 41:43.160
You can also sort by whatever you want

41:43.160 --> 41:45.160
Then our sorting method is

41:45.160 --> 41:47.160
The similarity of the waveform

41:47.160 --> 41:49.160
For example, this looks like this

41:49.160 --> 41:51.160
Or this looks like this

41:51.160 --> 41:53.160
Use this to sort

41:53.160 --> 41:55.160
Then the sorting method is

41:55.160 --> 41:57.160
The same is the cross-section coefficient

41:57.160 --> 41:59.160
This is not a function

41:59.160 --> 42:01.160
We just use it

42:01.160 --> 42:03.160
When they are the most similar

42:03.160 --> 42:05.160
What is the coefficient

42:05.160 --> 42:07.160
So the coefficient will be between 0 and 1

42:07.160 --> 42:09.160
0 is the least similar

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
1 is exactly the same

42:11.160 --> 42:13.160
Then this

42:13.160 --> 42:15.160
Same

42:15.160 --> 42:17.160
This is the time series

42:17.160 --> 42:19.160
You can compare it

42:19.160 --> 42:21.160
Eruption time

42:21.160 --> 42:23.160
Then

42:23.160 --> 42:25.160
20 minutes

42:25.160 --> 42:27.160
To do cluster analysis

42:27.160 --> 42:29.160
Every blue dot is every event

42:29.160 --> 42:31.160
If this is a cluster ID

42:31.160 --> 42:33.160
If the ID is very close

42:33.160 --> 42:35.160
If they are nearby

42:35.160 --> 42:37.160
It means they are more similar

42:37.160 --> 42:39.160
If it's the same ID

42:39.160 --> 42:41.160
That means between them

42:41.160 --> 42:43.160
At least 0.8

42:43.160 --> 42:45.160
The coefficient is at least 0.8

42:45.160 --> 42:47.160
So it's from 0 to 1

42:47.160 --> 42:49.160
If it's the same ID, it's probably 0.8

42:49.160 --> 42:51.160
0.8 will be

42:51.160 --> 42:53.160
The number is very similar

42:53.160 --> 42:55.160
So the first thing to pay attention to

42:55.160 --> 42:57.160
You can see

42:57.160 --> 42:59.160
For example, there is a cluster here

42:59.160 --> 43:01.160
Is it closer to the ID?

43:01.160 --> 43:03.160
Then there is another one here

43:03.160 --> 43:05.160
Then there is another one here

43:05.160 --> 43:07.160
There is another one here

43:07.160 --> 43:09.160
Another thing to pay attention to

43:09.160 --> 43:11.160
You can find different clusters

43:11.160 --> 43:13.160
They are relative

43:13.160 --> 43:15.160
Relative to the time of eruption

43:15.160 --> 43:17.160
It's different

43:17.160 --> 43:19.160
Like this cluster

43:19.160 --> 43:21.160
It's more likely to be 40 minutes to 80 minutes

43:21.160 --> 43:23.160
Then this cluster

43:23.160 --> 43:25.160
It's about 30 to 60 minutes

43:25.160 --> 43:27.160
36 to 60 minutes before the eruption

43:27.160 --> 43:29.160
Before the eruption

43:29.160 --> 43:31.160
Actually nothing

43:31.160 --> 43:33.160
Fewer events

43:33.160 --> 43:35.160
Like this cluster

43:35.160 --> 43:37.160
It's more like late

43:37.160 --> 43:39.160
You

43:39.160 --> 43:41.160
Did you spray all the water this time?

43:41.160 --> 43:43.160
Is it before the next eruption?

43:43.160 --> 43:45.160
It's slowly accumulating

43:45.160 --> 43:47.160
Maybe there will be water

43:47.160 --> 43:49.160
Fill in

43:49.160 --> 43:51.160
Fill in the hot water

43:51.160 --> 43:53.160
Or fill in the underground water nearby

43:53.160 --> 43:55.160
Or it's building

43:55.160 --> 43:57.160
Its pressure and temperature

43:57.160 --> 43:59.160
Then it will erupt until it reaches a critical value

43:59.160 --> 44:01.160
Then in the front

44:01.160 --> 44:03.160
We say this is called recharge

44:03.160 --> 44:05.160
It's a bit like recharge

44:05.160 --> 44:07.160
I don't know how

44:07.160 --> 44:09.160
Then the early recharge

44:09.160 --> 44:11.160
It's more likely to have this kind of wave

44:11.160 --> 44:13.160
That mid-range recharge

44:13.160 --> 44:15.160
There will be a wave like this

44:15.160 --> 44:17.160
There will be a wave like this

44:17.160 --> 44:19.160
This is actually good news

44:19.160 --> 44:21.160
Because you have this pattern

44:21.160 --> 44:23.160
If it is fixed

44:23.160 --> 44:25.160
If it is every eruption

44:25.160 --> 44:27.160
If it has this pattern

44:27.160 --> 44:29.160
We can use it to study a lot of things

44:29.160 --> 44:31.160
We can study

44:31.160 --> 44:33.160
Where did this wave come from?

44:33.160 --> 44:35.160
What is its source?

44:35.160 --> 44:37.160
Is the location different?

44:37.160 --> 44:39.160
Is the shape of its source different?

44:39.160 --> 44:41.160
There are still many possibilities

44:43.160 --> 44:45.160
Or you can use this pattern

44:45.160 --> 44:47.160
There are many eruption cycles

44:47.160 --> 44:49.160
If they are all the same

44:49.160 --> 44:51.160
We can use this pattern

44:51.160 --> 44:53.160
To do prediction

44:53.160 --> 44:55.160
Especially machine learning

44:55.160 --> 44:57.160
If this pattern is

44:57.160 --> 44:59.160
Between certain error ranges

44:59.160 --> 45:01.160
Then you can use

45:01.160 --> 45:03.160
Such data as knowledge

45:03.160 --> 45:05.160
You already know the knowledge

45:05.160 --> 45:07.160
Then as training data

45:07.160 --> 45:09.160
If you can have more data in the future

45:09.160 --> 45:11.160
Or you can

45:11.160 --> 45:13.160
For technological progress

45:13.160 --> 45:15.160
You can use this information

45:15.160 --> 45:17.160
To do machine learning

45:21.160 --> 45:23.160
These are the four clusters I chose

45:23.160 --> 45:25.160
Let's see what they look like

45:25.160 --> 45:27.160
You can find an average

45:27.160 --> 45:29.160
Let's see what this group looks like

45:29.160 --> 45:31.160
Let's see what this group looks like

45:31.160 --> 45:33.160
Let's see what this group looks like

45:33.160 --> 45:35.160
Let's see what this group looks like

45:35.160 --> 45:37.160
This is the first cluster

45:37.160 --> 45:39.160
This is the first row

45:39.160 --> 45:41.160
The second cluster is the second row

45:41.160 --> 45:43.160
The third cluster is the third row

45:43.160 --> 45:45.160
The fourth cluster is the fourth row

45:45.160 --> 45:47.160
The red one is for time series waveform

45:47.160 --> 45:49.160
The blue one is for frequency

45:51.160 --> 45:53.160
The blue one is for frequency

45:53.160 --> 45:55.160
The units are hertz

45:55.160 --> 45:57.160
So it's 0 to 100 hertz

45:57.160 --> 45:59.160
So it's 0 to 100 hertz

45:59.160 --> 46:01.160
So it's 0 to 100 hertz

46:01.160 --> 46:03.160
The good news is that these four waveforms

46:03.160 --> 46:05.160
The good news is that these four waveforms

46:05.160 --> 46:07.160
If we do not see the EU flu

46:07.160 --> 46:09.160
They will be very similar

46:09.160 --> 46:11.160
If we do not see the EU flu

46:11.160 --> 46:13.160
They will be very similar

46:13.160 --> 46:15.160
we can see that the frequency ratio

46:15.160 --> 46:17.160
we can see that the frequency ratio

46:17.160 --> 46:19.160
The low frequency waveform

46:19.160 --> 46:21.160
The low frequency waveform

46:21.160 --> 46:23.160
is likely to be 10 Hz

46:23.160 --> 46:25.160
like this

46:25.160 --> 46:27.160
is like this

46:27.160 --> 46:29.160
There's only one eruption cycle

46:29.160 --> 46:31.160
There's only one eruption cycle

46:31.160 --> 46:33.160
If we use the same method

46:33.160 --> 46:35.160
If we use the same method

46:35.160 --> 46:37.160
If we use the same method

46:37.160 --> 46:39.160
We can see that the other eruption cycle

46:39.160 --> 46:41.160
We can see that the other eruption cycle

46:41.160 --> 46:43.160
Is it the same?

46:43.160 --> 46:45.160
Or is it different?

46:45.160 --> 46:47.160
You will find that

46:47.160 --> 46:49.160
These two look very similar

46:49.160 --> 46:51.160
These two look very similar

46:51.160 --> 46:53.160
These two look very similar

46:53.160 --> 46:55.160
These two are a little different

46:55.160 --> 46:57.160
But the low frequency part is very close

46:57.160 --> 46:59.160
But the low frequency part is very close

46:59.160 --> 47:01.160
This is also good news

47:01.160 --> 47:03.160
This is also good news

47:03.160 --> 47:05.160
It's not just the eruption time

47:05.160 --> 47:07.160
It's not just eruption time

47:07.160 --> 47:09.160
Even the inner process

47:09.160 --> 47:11.160
Even the inner process

47:11.160 --> 47:13.160
Is very close

47:13.160 --> 47:15.160
Is very close

47:15.160 --> 47:17.160
At least 10 years

47:17.160 --> 47:19.160
At least 10 years

47:19.160 --> 47:21.160
So

47:21.160 --> 47:23.160
What can you do

47:23.160 --> 47:25.160
I just mentioned

47:25.160 --> 47:27.160
I just mentioned

47:27.160 --> 47:29.160
I am planning to do a more detailed prediction

47:29.160 --> 47:31.160
I am planning to do a more detailed prediction

47:31.160 --> 47:35.160
Not just the pulses, but ability to combine the numbers

47:35.160 --> 47:39.160
Or, you could even set the times and odds

47:39.160 --> 47:41.160
Add lots of videos

47:41.160 --> 47:43.160
Add lots of videos

47:43.160 --> 47:45.160
Like deep learning machine learning

47:45.160 --> 47:47.160
Do prediction

47:47.160 --> 47:49.160
And if the country really gives them the green light

47:49.160 --> 47:51.160
And if the country really gives them the green light

47:51.160 --> 47:53.160
And if the country really gives them the green light

47:53.160 --> 47:55.160
If the terrain is great

47:55.160 --> 47:57.160
You could do monitoring

47:57.160 --> 47:59.160
And make sure this works

47:59.160 --> 48:01.160
To be more scientific

48:01.160 --> 48:03.160
I'm curious about the bimodal eruption

48:03.160 --> 48:05.160
I'm curious about the bimodal eruption

48:05.160 --> 48:07.160
Why sometimes it's 90 minutes

48:07.160 --> 48:09.160
Why sometimes it's 60 minutes

48:09.160 --> 48:11.160
If you have a complete data set

48:11.160 --> 48:13.160
You can use a lot of data to do statistics

48:13.160 --> 48:15.160
You can use a lot of data to do statistics

48:15.160 --> 48:17.160
Why sometimes it's 60 minutes

48:17.160 --> 48:19.160
This is important

48:19.160 --> 48:21.160
Like when we talk about volcanoes

48:21.160 --> 48:23.160
How do we predict the next eruption

48:23.160 --> 48:25.160
Last time it was 60 million years

48:25.160 --> 48:27.160
Last time it was 10 million years

49:27.160 --> 49:29.160
And the last picture is also outdoors

49:29.160 --> 49:31.160
And the last picture is also outdoors

49:31.160 --> 49:33.160
Outdoors is beautiful

49:33.160 --> 49:35.160
But it's cold

49:35.160 --> 49:37.160
Not fun

49:37.160 --> 49:39.160
It's open in winter

49:39.160 --> 49:41.160
We went there in November

49:41.160 --> 49:43.160
We went there in November

49:43.160 --> 49:45.160
Because it's easy to get super cold

49:45.160 --> 49:47.160
Because it's easy to get super cold

49:47.160 --> 49:49.160
And it's open in December

49:49.160 --> 49:51.160
But only for snowmobiles

49:51.160 --> 49:53.160
If you want to see what winter looks like

49:53.160 --> 49:55.160
If you want to see what winter looks like

49:55.160 --> 49:57.160
You can rent a snowmobile in December

49:57.160 --> 49:59.160
You can rent a snowmobile in December

49:59.160 --> 50:01.160
But it will be cold

50:01.160 --> 50:03.160
But it will be cold

50:03.160 --> 50:05.160
Thank you

50:26.160 --> 50:28.160
Please go ahead

50:28.160 --> 50:30.160
It's hard to understand

50:30.160 --> 50:32.160
What am I saying?

50:32.160 --> 50:34.160
I said if it's hard to understand, you can say it

50:34.160 --> 50:36.160
Because I will adjust it next time

50:36.160 --> 50:38.160
Because I don't know how to do it

50:38.160 --> 50:40.160
No, I think you said it very well, very clearly

50:40.160 --> 50:42.160
Oh, really? Thank you

50:42.160 --> 50:44.160
She kept nodding her head, she said it very clearly

50:44.160 --> 50:46.160
Okay, Meng Chang has a question

50:46.160 --> 50:48.160
You can just ask

50:48.160 --> 50:50.160
Turn on the microphone

50:50.160 --> 50:52.160
Okay, I want to ask

50:52.160 --> 50:58.160
They can't see the changes directly?

51:01.160 --> 51:03.160
So in our field

51:03.160 --> 51:05.160
First, you have to have a source

51:05.160 --> 51:07.160
For example, you do X-ray

51:07.160 --> 51:09.160
X-ray or something, you have to have an energy

51:09.160 --> 51:11.160
Or radar, you have to have an energy

51:11.160 --> 51:13.160
To hit it

51:13.160 --> 51:15.160
But if your energy is not strong enough

51:15.160 --> 51:17.160
Or the frequency is not right

51:17.160 --> 51:19.160
You won't be able to see the scale you want

51:19.160 --> 51:21.160
The scale or the depth

51:22.160 --> 51:24.160
So if we want to look at the ground

51:24.160 --> 51:26.160
It usually requires relatively strong energy

51:26.160 --> 51:28.160
You have to be

51:28.160 --> 51:30.160
For example, have you heard of

51:30.160 --> 51:32.160
Oil companies will use a big car

51:32.160 --> 51:34.160
To fix it

51:34.160 --> 51:36.160
But this kind of energy is very

51:36.160 --> 51:38.160
It will destroy the environment

51:38.160 --> 51:40.160
If you have been there

51:40.160 --> 51:42.160
There will be a lot of warnings

51:42.160 --> 51:44.160
You can't jump

51:44.160 --> 51:46.160
Or you can't go to certain places

51:46.160 --> 51:48.160
Some people will go crazy

51:48.160 --> 51:50.160
Because these

51:51.160 --> 51:53.160
They need a very special environment

51:53.160 --> 51:55.160
This environment is relatively fragile

51:55.160 --> 51:57.160
You can't let that water

51:57.160 --> 51:59.160
Release pressure to the surface

51:59.160 --> 52:01.160
So we are now

52:01.160 --> 52:03.160
If you want to look at the underground environment

52:03.160 --> 52:05.160
Then you have to go through

52:05.160 --> 52:07.160
A more indirect method like us

52:07.160 --> 52:09.160
You have to use some natural energy

52:09.160 --> 52:11.160
Or something

52:11.160 --> 52:13.160
But there is a limit to this

52:13.160 --> 52:15.160
Because the source of these energies

52:15.160 --> 52:17.160
You can't control

52:17.160 --> 52:19.160
You have to find the right source

52:20.160 --> 52:22.160
Find the right thing

52:22.160 --> 52:24.160
You can use it to see

52:24.160 --> 52:26.160
What you want to see

52:26.160 --> 52:28.160
But my impression is

52:28.160 --> 52:30.160
Like oil companies

52:30.160 --> 52:32.160
They look at

52:32.160 --> 52:34.160
They also have

52:34.160 --> 52:36.160
I have heard that they may also use

52:36.160 --> 52:38.160
The so-called atomic clock

52:38.160 --> 52:40.160
Because the atomic clock

52:40.160 --> 52:42.160
The density of the surface changes

52:42.160 --> 52:44.160
The change of gravity

52:44.160 --> 52:46.160
There will be a change in the structure

52:46.160 --> 52:48.160
Very sensitive

52:49.160 --> 52:51.160
So he can use the atomic clock

52:51.160 --> 52:53.160
To measure

52:53.160 --> 52:55.160
This place

52:55.160 --> 52:57.160
What is its composition

52:57.160 --> 52:59.160
Correct

52:59.160 --> 53:01.160
No need for destructive things

53:01.160 --> 53:03.160
I am not

53:03.160 --> 53:05.160
I don't know much about the atomic clock

53:05.160 --> 53:07.160
But I think if

53:07.160 --> 53:09.160
If there is such a way

53:09.160 --> 53:11.160
If you can see

53:11.160 --> 53:13.160
Everyone should have used it long ago

53:13.160 --> 53:15.160
So I think he should have his limits

53:15.160 --> 53:17.160
Because there are actually a lot of

53:17.160 --> 53:19.160
Battery

53:19.160 --> 53:21.160
Battery

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
I forgot how to say

53:23.160 --> 53:25.160
Some ways to use batteries

53:25.160 --> 53:27.160
Very local

53:27.160 --> 53:29.160
But it is very limited

53:29.160 --> 53:31.160
It is limited to

53:31.160 --> 53:33.160
The range of your ears

53:33.160 --> 53:35.160
If your ears are small

53:35.160 --> 53:37.160
You want to see such a small structure

53:37.160 --> 53:39.160
But you can only see about 1-2 meters deep

53:39.160 --> 53:41.160
But if you want to see

53:41.160 --> 53:43.160
Big structure

53:43.160 --> 53:45.160
If you want to look deeper

53:45.160 --> 53:47.160
Left and right

53:47.160 --> 53:49.160
Lateral extension

53:49.160 --> 53:51.160
Can't see a few meters

53:51.160 --> 53:53.160
This kind of thing

53:53.160 --> 53:55.160
So I think every one

53:55.160 --> 53:57.160
We all use this kind of indirect

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
More indirect method

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
This method has its own limits

54:01.160 --> 54:03.160
So I don't know the atomic clock

54:03.160 --> 54:05.160
But I think he must use his limits

54:05.160 --> 54:07.160
Otherwise, everyone has used it long ago

54:07.160 --> 54:09.160
Because the atomic clock is still

54:09.160 --> 54:11.160
A very big country

54:11.160 --> 54:13.160
A plan to find a way to build

54:13.160 --> 54:15.160
Because he is

54:15.160 --> 54:17.160
Probably only the United States, Japan

54:17.160 --> 54:19.160
France

54:19.160 --> 54:21.160
I'm doing these things

54:21.160 --> 54:23.160
So I don't know

54:23.160 --> 54:25.160
Maybe it's very expensive

54:25.160 --> 54:27.160
But I heard before

54:27.160 --> 54:29.160
I heard before

54:29.160 --> 54:31.160
There is a private company

54:31.160 --> 54:33.160
Sponsor a laboratory

54:33.160 --> 54:35.160
Their publication

54:35.160 --> 54:37.160
Will not be put on the table

54:37.160 --> 54:39.160
But there is a private company

54:39.160 --> 54:41.160
To pay for their research

54:41.160 --> 54:43.160
So I guess the cost

54:43.160 --> 54:45.160
May be a lot

54:45.160 --> 54:47.160
That's about it

54:47.160 --> 54:49.160
But the oil industry is super poor now

54:49.160 --> 54:51.160
We are almost out of work now

54:51.160 --> 54:53.160
So I don't know

54:53.160 --> 54:55.160
Maybe it's hard to pay

54:55.160 --> 54:57.160
Now the oil is super cheap

54:59.160 --> 55:01.160
Thank you

55:01.160 --> 55:03.160
But it's a very good proposal

55:03.160 --> 55:05.160
Actually, I don't know much about it

55:11.160 --> 55:13.160
Does anyone else have any questions?

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
Let me ask a question

55:21.160 --> 55:23.160
Just

55:23.160 --> 55:25.160
Because we just saw all the data

55:25.160 --> 55:27.160
It's all in the real world

55:27.160 --> 55:29.160
The horizontal axis is the real time

55:29.160 --> 55:31.160
Then the vertical axis is your

55:31.160 --> 55:33.160
But you are

55:33.160 --> 55:35.160
Under such data

55:35.160 --> 55:37.160
You just actually emphasized

55:37.160 --> 55:39.160
Most of the time

55:39.160 --> 55:41.160
The time to trigger

55:41.160 --> 55:43.160
No matter when you assume

55:43.160 --> 55:45.160
Or the real time

55:45.160 --> 55:47.160
Then you calculate the time

55:47.160 --> 55:49.160
My first question is

55:49.160 --> 55:51.160
Then you said cross correlation

55:51.160 --> 55:53.160
Can remove a lot of

55:53.160 --> 55:55.160
Uncorrelated background

55:55.160 --> 55:57.160
If you look at

55:57.160 --> 55:59.160
Amplitude, will there be any new

55:59.160 --> 56:01.160
Information or better resolution

56:01.160 --> 56:03.160
This is the first

56:03.160 --> 56:05.160
The second is that since you want to do

56:05.160 --> 56:07.160
Cross correlation

56:07.160 --> 56:09.160
You plug that

56:09.160 --> 56:11.160
The position of the measuring instrument

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
Shouldn't it be

56:13.160 --> 56:15.160
Very strict and uniform

56:15.160 --> 56:17.160
But I think you seem to be

56:17.160 --> 56:19.160
A little bit along the way

56:19.160 --> 56:21.160
Is it okay?

56:25.160 --> 56:27.160
Let's talk about the first government

56:27.160 --> 56:29.160
Government

56:29.160 --> 56:31.160
This is a very good

56:31.160 --> 56:33.160
Good question

56:33.160 --> 56:35.160
Generally speaking, we are

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160
It's easy to come up with

56:37.160 --> 56:39.160
Is the time difference

56:39.160 --> 56:41.160
This message

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
In the most traditional earthquake

56:43.160 --> 56:45.160
Because of the relationship

56:45.160 --> 56:47.160
Or because of a lot of uncertainty

56:47.160 --> 56:49.160
For example, your earthquake

56:49.160 --> 56:51.160
For example, you have a small one here

56:51.160 --> 56:53.160
Earthquake, it will decline

56:53.160 --> 56:55.160
But not just because of the distance

56:55.160 --> 56:57.160
It's because of what you've been through

56:57.160 --> 56:59.160
Or is there anything next to you

56:59.160 --> 57:01.160
Influence its transmission

57:01.160 --> 57:03.160
These will affect the government

57:03.160 --> 57:05.160
So the first one is traditional

57:05.160 --> 57:07.160
Or what I'm talking about now

57:07.160 --> 57:09.160
I'm talking about this result today

57:09.160 --> 57:11.160
It doesn't include government information

57:11.160 --> 57:13.160
Second, if the government

57:13.160 --> 57:15.160
The message is to be applied here

57:15.160 --> 57:17.160
It will be relatively difficult

57:17.160 --> 57:19.160
But we're doing it now

57:19.160 --> 57:21.160
Because it's not just one

57:21.160 --> 57:23.160
There are a lot of features here

57:23.160 --> 57:25.160
That every feature

57:25.160 --> 57:27.160
For example, like this station

57:27.160 --> 57:29.160
There is a very strong pool nearby

57:29.160 --> 57:31.160
It gives it a lot of energy

57:31.160 --> 57:33.160
For government information

57:33.160 --> 57:35.160
If you look at the whole area

57:35.160 --> 57:37.160
Then it will be a lot of

57:37.160 --> 57:39.160
Localized government

57:39.160 --> 57:41.160
But for cross-referencing

57:41.160 --> 57:43.160
We're promoting now

57:43.160 --> 57:45.160
There are a lot of people

57:45.160 --> 57:47.160
Trying to include

57:47.160 --> 57:49.160
The so-called government

57:49.160 --> 57:51.160
But you have to be sure

57:51.160 --> 57:53.160
It's a real signal

57:53.160 --> 57:55.160
It's not a lot of

57:55.160 --> 57:57.160
Localized artifacts

57:57.160 --> 57:59.160
Then

57:59.160 --> 58:01.160
We're going to do it again

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
What's the second question

58:05.160 --> 58:07.160
My second question is

58:07.160 --> 58:09.160
You're in this station

58:09.160 --> 58:11.160
It's basically saying

58:11.160 --> 58:13.160
Is there any limit

58:13.160 --> 58:15.160
Because I think this position

58:15.160 --> 58:17.160
Is there an average

58:17.160 --> 58:19.160
It should affect you

58:19.160 --> 58:21.160
Cross-correlation structure

58:21.160 --> 58:23.160
You're talking about

58:23.160 --> 58:25.160
You said

58:25.160 --> 58:27.160
The address conditions below

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
It's just that

58:29.160 --> 58:31.160
The distance between the station and the station

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
Need to be even

58:33.160 --> 58:35.160
My idea is

58:35.160 --> 58:37.160
Between your station and station

58:37.160 --> 58:39.160
To be on this projection

58:39.160 --> 58:41.160
It should be very even

58:41.160 --> 58:43.160
Then you will

58:43.160 --> 58:45.160
You're going to be

58:45.160 --> 58:47.160
The result of your cross-correlation

58:47.160 --> 58:49.160
You can make it lower

58:49.160 --> 58:51.160
I think I don't know

58:53.160 --> 58:55.160
That if you want

58:55.160 --> 58:57.160
If you want to do

58:57.160 --> 58:59.160
If you want to do

58:59.160 --> 59:01.160
If you want to do

59:01.160 --> 59:03.160
Of course it's very

59:03.160 --> 59:05.160
Very very complete

59:05.160 --> 59:07.160
But if you're really going to

59:07.160 --> 59:09.160
It's almost impossible

59:09.160 --> 59:11.160
It's almost impossible

59:11.160 --> 59:13.160
But of course it's more

59:13.160 --> 59:15.160
The more complete the better

59:15.160 --> 59:17.160
I think we've done our best

59:17.160 --> 59:19.160
And he doesn't allow us to go

59:19.160 --> 59:21.160
He doesn't allow us to go

59:21.160 --> 59:23.160
We can't leave this path

59:23.160 --> 59:25.160
You can only be next to the path

59:25.160 --> 59:27.160
So this is already the best

59:27.160 --> 59:29.160
And then

59:29.160 --> 59:31.160
Will there be a systematic effect

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
I think it will

59:33.160 --> 59:35.160
But if

59:35.160 --> 59:37.160
It depends on your size

59:37.160 --> 59:39.160
For example, we want to look at

59:39.160 --> 59:41.160
A relatively large structure

59:41.160 --> 59:43.160
Our structure is here

59:43.160 --> 59:45.160
Between your station and station

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
These are a little uneven

59:47.160 --> 59:49.160
The relative error is actually for this structure

59:49.160 --> 59:51.160
It's more minor

59:51.160 --> 59:53.160
So when we're doing

59:53.160 --> 59:55.160
Any research

59:55.160 --> 59:57.160
We have to think about the first

59:57.160 --> 59:59.160
The second one is between our station and station

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.160
Is the distance suitable

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.160
To explain something like that

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.160
So

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.160
That's about it

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.160
And then the government

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.160
This question is very good

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:13.160
But I'm still doing it

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
But of course I want to have government information

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
But because it's going to be too much

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.160
Localized energy

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160
Is there any question?

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.160
Felt like

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.160
Zhen said very well

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.160
But she really understands

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.160
I don't know what she knows

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.160
But she heard very well

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.160
You can do it

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.160
What did you say

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
There's a lift

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.160
Right

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.160
You can do it

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.160
You can ski

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.160
Ok

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.160
Our time

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:59.160
Today is just right

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.160
The speaker's time is very good

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.160
I want to use

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.160
The right of the host

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.160
To ask everyone to turn on the microphone

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160
Otherwise, there is only my voice

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.160
Let's applaud again

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.160
Thank you to our speaker

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
And thank you all for coming

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.160
See you next week

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.160
Bye bye

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.160
Thank you

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.160
Can I turn it off now?

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160
Yes
