1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, let's welcome everyone to participate in today's TARA speech.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today's speaker is Mr. Zhang Yanyong.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He is now a Ph.D. student in astronomy and physics at Caltech.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Before coming to Caltech, he studied at NTU Physics and NTU Mechanics.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
During his time at NTU, he specialized in accelerometers,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
half astronomy and half accelerometers, high-performance physics experiments.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now he is at Caltech, he specializes in dark matter experiments,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
which are more astronomical.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So today's speech is mainly about...

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Zhang Yanyong.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's mainly about how they detect their detectors in design experiments.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want to share it with you.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Some of it has nothing to do with today's speech,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but it has a lot to do with the speaker.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Zhang Yanyong is a disciplined, self-trained athlete.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is a good trainer.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If you are interested in running, cycling, or surfing,

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
he has a lot of experience.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He also likes to discuss these things with you.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lastly, as you have heard,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
today is Zhang Yanyong's birthday.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Actually, it's not yesterday, it's today.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't know why Zhang Yanyong...

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Did Zhang Yanyong say that he was drunk yesterday because it was his birthday?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not easy to forget your birthday.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I decided to sing a happy birthday song for Zhang Yanyong.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You can open the microphone and sing together.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's welcome Zhang Yanyong to share his research with us.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll turn off the microphone.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you hear me?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because I found that the new version of BlueJeans

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
can't use a lot of screens on Linux.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So the topic I'm going to talk about is

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Photon Noise Estimation and Suppression for Explicit Cryogenic Measurement.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why did I choose this topic?

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The reason is...

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Of course, this is very specific.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's an example of what we're doing right now.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But we all know that

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
any experiment needs to pursue a higher sensitivity.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The current trend in the world is that we're going to do it at a lower temperature.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because basic statistical physics tells us that

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
no matter what system it is,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
its noise is basically related to temperature.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So the lower the temperature, the lower the noise.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So today I want to talk about something more general.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For most people, whether they're listening now

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
or watching on the Internet,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
those who are doing experiments

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and want to take it,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
whether you want to put your experiment device into a liquid nitrogen

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
or a liquid nitrogen solution,

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
or like we use cryogenic dilution fridge,

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
are all useful technologies.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In order to further promote its sensitivity in our experiments,

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
we developed an application of this technology.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Next slide.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
what our traditional concept of noise is.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why these concepts are very meaningful

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
if you think through the details.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's not something we can apply directly to our experiments.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
First of all, what you're seeing now is called

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
thermal noise,

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
which we think is traditionally classical noise.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Of course, we have to say it's Johnson-Nyquist noise

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
because Johnson-Nyquist is the person who invented it.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Its feature is that it's very wide,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that is, it's maybe 10 hertz.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What you see on the screen

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
may be from 10 hertz to tens of millions of hertz.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's the whole range

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that you can see this kind of noise signal.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And it's flat, so it's called white noise.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's like white light.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We know that Johnson found that

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
this noise only has to do with the temperature

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
of the instrument that produces this noise,

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
or the equivalent temperature.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It doesn't have to do with anything else.

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
For example, I have a resistor today,

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and it keeps producing noise.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This resistor, whether it's made of cement,

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
wire, metal, or air,

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it doesn't matter.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As long as the temperature of this thing is like that,

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
its noise is like that.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is a very special thing.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So at the beginning of the 20th century,

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
it was a very special physics.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That is, you would have expected

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that this thing would keep producing that noisy signal.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Should it be related to its material?

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The answer is no.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But later on, the development of quantum mechanics

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
immediately made people think,

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
isn't this the same as black radiation?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What is black radiation?

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Black radiation is its light or energy.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Its energy is kT,

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and it only has to do with temperature.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because no matter what material it is,

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
they exchange energy with light.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I've already said that.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So here's a question.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is it that makes this classical system

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
reach thermal equilibrium?

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The answer is light.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No matter what material it is, it's all light.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So this light becomes...

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Later on, Planck found that

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
as long as light reaches thermal equilibrium,

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
this thing will emit light.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It has nothing to do with material.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It has nothing to do with temperature.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then it's called black radiation.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But we also know that black radiation

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is the most important thing in human history.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It is the first direct evidence,

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and it has been explained,

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and it has started the so-called quantum era.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Without quantum mechanics,

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
without the phenomenon of quantum being brought into physics,

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
there is no way to explain black radiation.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So here's a very strange thing.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We say this is a classical system.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Classical thermal equilibrium has this phenomenon.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But without quantum mechanics,

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
there is no way to explain it.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So why does this happen?

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you put any material in a temperature,

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
put it in a temperature environment,

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
which is more scientific,

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
which is called photon bath.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then through these quantum particles,

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
which is what we call photons,

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
exchange energy to reach thermal equilibrium,

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
there will be this classical effect.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why is this thing?

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because in fact...

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why is the classical description

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
applicable to the quantum phenomenon?

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It has a very important reason.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This reason will also tell me today

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
why it is very relevant to future experiments.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Because in past experiments,

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
we usually think that

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I operate in classical regime,

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think classical,

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that is, T equals 4KT.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If I operate in quantum regime,

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think quantum.

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But why is this important?

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Because I have already said that

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in this classical noise,

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it actually comes from quantum effect.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But why can we use

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
classical treatment to think about this thing?

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because if you look at the textbook

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
or you look at the wiki,

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
roughly, usually at a normal temperature,

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I write Montaigne here.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In fact, I just want to imply that

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
in fact, we are not doing

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the experiment we are doing now in the future.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
At a normal size,

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
for example, as big as your palm,

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
a normal temperature,

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
for example, a thing of room temperature,

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
it emits a ray of black radiation.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That ray of light

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
is every second,

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
every square meter,

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it will emit 10 to 20 times of radiation.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So much that it's like

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when you go to drink water,

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
you won't feel a drop of water

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
hitting your tongue.

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's like a continuous state.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So a classical description can be used.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it can be calculated as 4KT.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But we can't forget that

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
if you look at its spectrum,

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
it can't be explained by classical physics.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It must be quantized.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's why we started the quantum era.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I can ask a question.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If your tongue is really sensitive,

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
when you drink water,

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
can you feel a drop of water?

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Think about this question.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will continue to talk later.

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then everyone will know

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
why I'm asking this question.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This question is actually quite interesting.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Next time you drink water,

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you can think about

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
if I can feel a drop of water

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
on my tongue.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is the first type.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Now let's look at the second type.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The second type is called shock noise

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
or Poisson noise.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Of course, Poisson comes from

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Poisson distribution.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think most people who study quantum mechanics

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
have studied it.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is a mathematical description.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
When you have a fixed probability,

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you can calculate

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
the probability of something happening

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
in the fixed probability.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But sometimes I see it,

218
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and the last chance I see it

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is the biggest.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The last chance I see it is the smallest.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If you look at the picture on the right,

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for example, let's look at the blue and purple.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
On average,

224
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
there is a certain probability

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that you will see something

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
four times.

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, you see it four times

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
in one minute.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If you see it five times

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
in one minute,

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
it will be smaller.

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you see it six times,

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
it will be smaller.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But you actually have a chance

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to see it 50 or 20 times

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
in one minute.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But the chance is very small.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You see it is very small here.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And zero times is also very small.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This thing is called Poisson distribution.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It is a system

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that requires quantization

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to be resolvable.

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
For example,

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
if the leaves fall down for a minute,

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
how many pieces can you see?

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You can see this quantization.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why?

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What we are implying here is that

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
as a detector,

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the resolution of your timing

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
is much higher than

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the frequency at which the leaves fall down,

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
rather than the

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
frequency at which the leaves fall down.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So you can see this quantization.

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it becomes shot noise.

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But you will suddenly find that

259
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
shot noise is a peak.

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's bulging here,

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
on the right side of the picture.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's not like the picture above.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a whole screen.

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But in theory,

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
they are just different.

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you have that kind of resolution

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that can see

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the leaves fall down

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
or the frequency

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of the water molecules hitting the tongue?

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But its nature

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is very different.

273
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You see this shot noise.

274
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's a very narrow band.

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's a peak here.

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And it's due to quantization.

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's due to the quantum nature

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
of carrier or event.

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The example I just gave

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is the leaves falling down.

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I can give another example.

282
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
For example,

283
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
if there is a導線 today,

284
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you charge it.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The resistance of the導線 is very small.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So through the current,

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the particles of the electron

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
are very, very, very many.

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So it feels like

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the thermal noise

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I just mentioned.

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's also very typical.

293
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's how people measure

294
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
thermal noise.

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's exactly the same thing.

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If I put a導線 today

297
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and use the pressure to do it,

298
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is the resistance super, super big?

299
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's so big

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that you can't measure it.

301
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Uh,

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
a dozen,

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
a dozen,

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
a dozen,

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
a dozen,

306
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
a dozen,

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
a dozen,

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
a dozen,

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
a dozen,

310
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
a dozen,

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
a dozen,

312
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
a dozen,

313
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
a dozen,

314
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
a dozen,

315
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a dozen,

316
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
a dozen,

317
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
a dozen,

318
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
another one,

319
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
another one,

320
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
another one,

321
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
two,

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
two,

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
two.

324
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,000


325
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
is this

326
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This is because

327
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's because

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
this

329
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
kryptonite

330
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it's

331
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
very,

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
very,

333
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
very,

334
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
very high.

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The electronic

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
力

337
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
only got

338
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
carried

339
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
across

340
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
this

341
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
dotted

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
line,

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
then it

345
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
became

346
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
like a

347
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
very,

348
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
very,

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
very high

350
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
voltage.

351
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It can

352
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
destroy that

353
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
restraining force

354
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and let it

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
pull out

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
one by one

357
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
like this.

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay,

359
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
this is

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
shot

361
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
noise,

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
but

363
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
shot

364
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
noise

365
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in

366
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
uh

367
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
mundane

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
apparatus

369
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
usually

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
happens

371
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
in

372
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
you have

373
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
externally

375
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
apply

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
a

377
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
force

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to

379
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
