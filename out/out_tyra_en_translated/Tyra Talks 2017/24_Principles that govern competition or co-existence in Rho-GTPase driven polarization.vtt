00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
If you have any questions, you can just type them in the chat box.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
No, he just said to start recording.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Because when I pressed it, he told me that my memory was full.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay, I'm going to turn off the microphone now.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Okay, bye bye.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Yeah, so if you have any questions later, you can just type them in the chat box.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Or you can just turn on your microphone and ask questions.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
It doesn't matter.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
Because in fact, this video, if I were to talk to a person who does biological math, it would be about 20 minutes.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
But in fact, I think it should be far more than that.

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
Because I hope to let everyone, even if it's not a biological math background, to get a little bit of an idea of what I'm doing.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
At least have a concept.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Okay, I'm going to start.

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
My topic today is mainly to discuss how a cell decides to extend itself in one direction.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
As you can see, the nerve cell on the left side of the projection film, it only extends in one direction.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Or it extends in many directions.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Like the nerve cell on the right, it extends in many directions.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
So how does it control such a mechanism?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
This is actually a very, very big problem.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
And in different biological systems, they may use different methods to control it.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
But no one has actually asked this question yet.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
So today I'm going to use the mechanism that we already know, the mechanism that the organism extends in a certain direction.

01:38.000 --> 01:48.000
Let's understand this mechanism and then study what kind of nature it has to decide whether it extends in one direction or in many directions.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
So my topic today is Principles that Govern Competition or Coexistence in Rho-GTPase Driven Polarization.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Rho-GTPase is a protein.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
It's a very interesting protein.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
We're going to go all over it today.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
What does polarization mean?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Let me explain it to you now.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
First of all, for a cell,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Modeling people often think about how to model a cell.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Generally, you would imagine that you have a cell membrane.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
There's a cell tissue inside.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
There's a cell box inside.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
There's DNA in the cell box.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
We don't care about DNA.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
All the protein is floating in your cell tissue.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.000
If someone asks me how much of the protein in the cell tissue is dense,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Different proteins are different.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
For example, I'll tell you that the density of the protein in the cell tissue is about this much, a fixed number.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Let's make an assumption.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
The whole cell is uniform.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
The density of the same protein in the cell tissue is basically the same.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
In this situation, a cell can't tell which side is the head and which side is the tail.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
For a person, it is very important to distinguish between the head and the tail.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Because first of all, you need to know where your head is.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
You even need to distinguish between the front and the back.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Front and back.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Back and side.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Left and right.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
So a lot of this kind of asymmetry is very important to the cell.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
It's not just a whole individual thing for humans.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
For a cell, it's the same thing.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
For example, if this is a mobile cell,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
For example, if this is a tissue,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
It needs to know where it's going.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
The tail will shake and it will swim to the other side.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Even if it's not a mobile cell,

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
It could be, for example, your intestinal mucosa cell.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
It needs to know which side is the side with food or poop.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
And which side is the side with blood vessels.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Because it's trying to get nutrients from one side to the other.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So it needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So for biological cells,

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
It's very important to establish this front and back axis.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Usually, the way this is done is

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
A certain protein may have a completely uniform distribution in the cell.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
It needs to go through a certain process.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It needs to gather at the same end of the cell.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And then from that end,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
For example, it starts from that end.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
The skeleton of the cell grows from there.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
For example, if it wants to secrete protein,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
The secretion ball will move forward along the cell skeleton.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
So it needs to gather the protein to that side first.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
After the cell skeleton, it will let everyone go that way.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
If this is a long-term cell,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
It obviously needs to grow a cell skeleton first.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
After the direction of this axis, it needs to go.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
The source of all this is that we need to polarize a certain protein.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
That's what we call polarization.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It needs to be gathered to the same end.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
In the process of polarization,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
In fact, it's not just a problem of building an axis.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Another problem is,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Do you want to build an axis, or do you want to build a lot of axes?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Let's say you want to transport something out.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Do you want to transport it to one place at a time,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Or do you want to transport it to a lot of places at a time?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
For example, what you see now is

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
The nerve cells of the hippocampus.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
In fact, no matter what nerve cells,

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
That's pretty much how it grows.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
In the beginning, it only grew to one end.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
It only grew to one end when it was very small.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Then it started to grow to a lot of places.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
These things that grow to a lot of ends,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Things like trees, we call them trees.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
The tree is the place where the nerve cells receive information.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
After the tree grows, it starts to grow the axis.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
It only grows to one end.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
A nerve cell has a lot of trees, but it only has one axis.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
So it needs to switch from growing to a lot of ends to only one end.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Then the axis will grow very, very long.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
So the information that the nerve cells receive

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
The same information is passed to the same axis.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
So obviously, for the nerve cells,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
When it grows to one end, when it grows to a lot of ends,

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
It's a very important thing.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
This is the main problem I have today.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Our lab is not actually doing nerve cells.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Our lab is doing hemoglobin.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Hemoglobin is the only thing on top.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
It's called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
In short, hemoglobin,

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Hemoglobin is what we brew beer,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Or beer yeast,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Or yeast for making bread.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
We often encounter it because

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
If you put it in a non-oxidative space,

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
When it eats sugar, it will dilute it into alcohol.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
People are a kind of wild creature,

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
So they love to drink.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
So we like hemoglobin very much.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
In addition, we often use hemoglobin

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
It produces a lot of carbon dioxide.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Then it will make the bread fluffy.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Anyway, this is cold knowledge.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I just want to tell you what is hemoglobin.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Hemoglobin is the one we see above.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
What hemoglobin does is it will sprout.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
If you have read biology in high school,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
You will learn the name of sprout growth.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
That is to say,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
The way hemoglobin gives birth to children is

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
It will first try to gather a certain protein to one end.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
That end will become its head.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
It will grow a tooth from the head.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
The tooth will become its baby.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Then the tooth will split out again.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
It will become a baby.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
This is the way hemoglobin gives birth.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
So for hemoglobin,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It is very important that it only grows one head.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
What is the reason?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Because when it is split up,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Its DNA will be divided into two parts.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Then the average one part is divided to the child,

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
One part is kept by itself.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
If it grows two heads today,

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
It will have two children.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
At this time, it does not know how to divide its DNA.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Many times, the child will only get half of the DNA.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Then it will die.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
So for hemoglobin,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
It is very important that it only grows one head.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
But at the same time,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
The one below is also another kind of sprout.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But it is the kind of sprout that grows spores.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
But hemoglobin is very close relatives.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
They basically use the same system

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
To decide how to grow their heads.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
But the sprout that grows spores

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
We call it Aspia gossypia.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Aspia gossypia

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
It does not only grow one part at a time.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Because if it grows like this,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
It will grow into a pipe.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It will become a very useless sprout.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
One important thing for it is that

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
It needs to split up.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
If it can grow today,

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Then grow forward, split up,

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Everyone splits up,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
It can grow into a secret net.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
That secret net can absorb

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
The nutrients of the whole land or tree trunk.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
So for these sprouts,

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
It is important to grow many heads at a time.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
But controlling how they grow their heads

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Is to decide the protein at the end of their heads

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Is the same kind of protein.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
This kind of protein is called Rho-GTPase.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
It is called Rho.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
This kind of protein is called Rho.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
The most important question today is

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
This Rho-GTPase protein

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Why does it have the same mechanism

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
To decide these two different results?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
What kind of method

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Can control it to grow one part or two parts?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Today, my speech will be divided into two parts.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
One part is my theory

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
To discuss

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
This Rho-GTPase protein

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
How does it

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
From a state of uniformity in a cell

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
To a state of uniformity in a cell

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
How does this mechanism

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Decide whether it grows one part or two parts?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
This is the first part.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
This part is mainly used for

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Phenolphthalein and some other things.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
The second part is

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I want to start from the actual biological body

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Actually, I'm using yeast.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
To verify the knowledge I got from the previous theory

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Whether some rules

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Are applicable to this biological body.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So I'm going to divide it into two parts.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
One part is very mathematical.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
You'll see me shaking there.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
But you'll see me showing the persimmon

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
And see my cat running.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
The other part

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
You'll see the video of yeast.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So far, are there any questions?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
I have one

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Maybe I missed it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I feel a little weird.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
I think you're talking about

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
These bacteria have

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Have consciousness

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
It can decide what it wants to do.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
It's not a bacteria.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
It's a cell.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Anyway, you know what I mean.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It decides where it grows.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Is it active?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Actually, it is.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
For example, a yeast

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
There are two ways it grows.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
But anyway

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Yes, it is active.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
The so-called active means

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
It's not random.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
I know it's not random.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Because from the outside

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
It doesn't look like it's random.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I mean, it decides where it's going to grow.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
For example

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Let's say there's a plant today.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
It's going to grow in the opposite direction of gravity.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Or grow in the direction of gravity.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
And then you turn it 90 degrees.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
It will find the direction of gravity again.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
So it's actually

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
In the direction of gravity

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
It's passively deciding where it's going to grow.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Maybe in the middle is some very simple

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Some underlying mechanisms of physics

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
It may not be a conscious process.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
But if it's a cell

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I can't imagine

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
It can decide

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I want to put all the proteins in the same direction today.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
And then it goes in the same direction.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
OK

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I think I'll answer a simple question first.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
If your passive and active definition is like this

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
If it is

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
It's a very simple

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Today there is a

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
There is a source of information.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
And then it reacts to that source of information.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
And then if this simple process is passive

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
That's right.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
It's a passive mechanism.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
This is the easy part.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
But the hard part

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
It's not my major.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Maybe it's

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
So you think consciousness is

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
It's not a chemical reaction.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Or consciousness

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
With some biological cells

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
The combination of reactions

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It may also

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
The same pattern

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
It's the same as getting a message and then reacting.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
It's just that this process is very simple.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Or it's a very difficult question.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That's right.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
It's hard to answer that part of the question.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
And then that part is what I can't answer.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
But I think it's an interesting question.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
But just the simple part

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yes, it is

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
You can use a set of message transmission systems

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
To

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
To react to external messages

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
For example, this serum

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It's

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
It's going to be with another kind of

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Gender serum

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Then it will try to grow there.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
The reason is that the other one will release pheromones.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Then it will grow there.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
If you think this is passive

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
That's right. All the processes I talked about today are passive.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
OK, thank you.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Are there any other questions?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
If not, I'll go down.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Otherwise there is a question.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
OK

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
So

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Let me say first that I haven't been on any creatures.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
So what I mean is that

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
It's not like a serum.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
For example, you just said that there is a

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Gender

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Does the serum have a gender?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
It's just that you said you want to match that example.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Someone releases pheromones

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
So this one will grow over there.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
So what you mean is that

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
He can't decide for himself

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Contact that

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Sexuality

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Is that right?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Is that what it means?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
As long as someone releases pheromones, he will

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
not

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It should be said

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
This is what we see.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
That is to say, if you give him a group of serum today.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Then you put a group

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
So the gender of the serum

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
We will divide A and Alpha.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
A and Alpha can be matched

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That's it.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
So if you put a group of A and a group of Alpha today.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
If you mix them together

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
You can imagine it as a group of boys.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
A group of girls all mixed together

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
At this time, some people will run to

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Match with others

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Some people will not match with others

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Some people don't match

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
It's because they're in the wrong direction.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Some people are because they

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
It's not right at all

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Pheromones

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
But

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
So this is a phenomenon

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Is this his decision?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Or did he decide not to say that?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Because I would think

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
If this environment is for him

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
It's his mating that's more beneficial to him.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
After this mating

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
After giving birth to a child

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
If you can adapt to the environment

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Those who did not mate successfully

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
They are likely to be killed by the gods.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Then gradually

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
This group of cells that will react

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
So they are in the process of evolution

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Learn to react to pheromones

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Is this a proactive process?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I think it's a big question

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
This is how we understand the process

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
But how do you determine

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Is this a conscious thing?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I think it's a big question

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
I just said I can't answer

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
OK, thank you

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Are there any other questions?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Then I'll go down

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
it is good

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
In the past, there have been several studies

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
We gradually realized that

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
These

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I just talked about

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
It creates a front and back

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
The principle of this polarity

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Is a

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
This mechanism of our so-called Turing text

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Turing

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Everyone should have heard a little bit

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Because there was a movie a while ago

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
It's called

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
The Mutation Game

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
The handsome guy in it

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Is playing Alan Turing

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
So everyone should know who Alan Turing is

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Everyone may know

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
He does computer

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
And he is

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
So-called mechanical consciousness

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Contribution in this area

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
In fact, he is a super genius

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I am studying this whole field

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Biomathematics

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Basically all

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
What is Turing text?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Before

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Everyone has always had a doubt

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
For example, you see a tiger today

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
It has a pattern

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
You see a leopard, it has a pattern

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
You see some fish

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
It may have a pattern on it

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
The pattern becomes a pattern

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
These patterns

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
How did it come out?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
How did these patterns come out?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
If you say there is something

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
To control these patterns

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
That controls its thing

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
So you have to go forward

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Then found

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
It seems

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
It seems to be in a certain step

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
That pattern will need

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
There is a way to self-release

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
From a completely uniform state

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Pattern comes out

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
It does not need to be controlled at all

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
It will automatically grow a pattern

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
So everyone is very confused

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
What does this machine look like?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Alan Turing

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
First, with a very simple partial equation

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
This conclusion

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
He said

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
If this cell is good

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Or a piece of land

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
If it has two chemical substances

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
One is activator

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Then the other is substrate

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
One is

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
How to say activator?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Activator should be easy to understand

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
What it does is activate

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
The other thing is substrate

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
This is its value

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
What does activator do?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Once there is this activator

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
It will have a positive feedback

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Then let more activators grow

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Activator in the process of growing

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It absorbs the value and becomes activator

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
For example

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
There may be an activator today

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
The process of its positive feedback

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
He went to catch another substrate

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Then turn that substrate into activator

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
So in this process

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Once activator grows

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
He will have a positive feedback

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
To make himself more and more

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
But at the same time

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
In this process

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
It will absorb the substrate

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
So the substrate will become less and less

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
If there is such a process

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
With activator

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
It spreads very slowly

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Then substrate

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
If it spreads very quickly

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
In this way, it will

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Such a system can make

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Point

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
A whole piece

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
It can also make a strip

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
It can make a very interesting pattern

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
It can make a counterpoint

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
It can even make a piece

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
No substrate part

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
So the same system

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
As long as you give it different parameters

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
It can run

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Different pattern results

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
So this is a very interesting thing

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
The picture on the right

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Is that we took one

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Entering its black and white photo

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Then take the photo

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Its brightness

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
That model will automatically

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
According to the brightness above

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
To run

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Its pattern is all white

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Or dot or semicolon

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
In short, this is a very cool thing

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Everyone realized

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
It turns out that such a system

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Can make a piece

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Nothing

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Run out of the pattern

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
That such a system

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
What does it have to do with the activator I just talked about?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
The activator is probably like this

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
That is to say

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Rho-GTPase

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
It is a protein

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It has two forms

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
One is when it sticks to GTP

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
This form is activator

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
This form is active

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
It can guide the downstream

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
All biological reactions

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
To go to it

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Then there is another form

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
It is a non-living form

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
It is Rho-GDP

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
It is Rho-GDPase

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
So this protein

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It has a non-living form of GTP

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Then it switches between these two forms

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
That

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
When the active Rho-GDP

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
It spreads very slowly

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Then the active Rho-GDP

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
If it spreads very quickly

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
This becomes a

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Healing mechanism

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
So actually in the cell

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
The way it works is like this

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
That is to say, we have a Rho-GDP

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It is stuck on the cell membrane

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Because it has a tail

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
It is stuck on the cell membrane

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
That

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Once there is a Rho-GDP

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
It will try to

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Turn other Rho-GDP

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Into Rho-GDP

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
So everyone sees that the red arrow

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Is a positive feedback

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
At the same time, it also has another form

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Called Rho-GDP

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
I just told you that it is a living form

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Its tail is wrapped

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
So it can be in the cell

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Happy in the cell

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
It spreads quickly in the cell

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
There is an

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Activator substrate system

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
It just happens to be its activator

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
It spreads very slowly

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Then its substrate spreads very quickly

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
And its activator

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
It has a positive feedback

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
The way we model this thing

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Is that we have a partial differential equation

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
That is to say

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
If we put the active form

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Called U

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
The inactive form is called V

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
That

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
The change in time

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Will determine

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
How fast it spreads

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
And its

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I just put three arrows on it

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
To give it a reaction

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
At the same time

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Its V

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
The change in time

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
It depends on how fast it spreads

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
And its chemical reaction

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
It's just a little bit special here

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Because the reactor

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
That part

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
It's basically

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
If anything grows out of U

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
It must have disappeared from V

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
It can only be exchanged between V and U

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
So its

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
That term

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
It's positive and it's negative

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
What this means

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Is that the whole system is qualitatively consistent

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
There is no term in here

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
It will automatically

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Grow out of

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Rho GDP

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Or U

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
There is no term

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Any particle

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Disappears from the system

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I have a question

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Okay

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
That is

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
What is the unit of UV?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Is it density?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Or something like that

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Yes, it should be

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
It should be concentration

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
But because it is

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
For example, the concentration on the entire cell membrane

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
So it is

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
It is the change in position and time

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
But it is concentration

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
So this is weird

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
There is a problem with this

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I think your big D

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
U and big D

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's not a dimensionless value

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
That is to say

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
You are discussing

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
A

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Rho GDP

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
With a Rho GDP

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Interaction

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Discuss with you once

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Ten Rho GDP

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
With ten Rho GDP

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
It won't be the same

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Because your big D is not dimensionless

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Do you understand? It can't be multiplied by ten

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Because it is not a value without units

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I don't understand

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Yes, I don't understand

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I don't understand

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
So U and V are equal

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
You said concentration

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
It's actually a concept of density

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
For example, unit volume

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
At this time

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
At this time, at this position

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Its density

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Then DU and DV are the rate of expansion

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
For example, the unit may be

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
The unit should be

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Every second

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Then the molecule should be

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
For example, square meters or square meters

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
It should be similar to this concept

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
That is to say

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
DU and DV

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Its concept should be

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Every second it can

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
It should be one square meter per second

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
It should be like this

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
How much can it move outward every second

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Is this outward expansion

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
OK, confirm

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Yes, that's right

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
But like this

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
What did you just say

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
One U

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
One rho gdp

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
OK, good

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
You remove the big F first

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Because don't worry about the big F

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Both sides of this square

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
There is this small U or small V, right?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
So the two of them

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
The units in this place

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Will be the same

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Then you put

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
What is the right side of the square?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Divided by two X

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Then X is the unit of length

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Then on the left

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Divided by a T is the unit of time

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
So your unit of big D is actually

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Distance per square unit time

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yes, yes

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
So the dimension on both sides

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Is it right?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
But the distance per square unit time

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
This value

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
In your change

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
You discussed

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
This whole distance

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
For example, the size of your change

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Or you only look at one at a time

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Or you only look at ten at a time

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
This value will keep running

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
It won't be unchanged

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Unless you take data

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Time also changes

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
But it won't

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Because you take data

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
You keep looking at it every second

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Keep looking

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
So your value will change

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
From that

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
From that

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
From you

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
OK, all the way to that

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
All the way to that

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
The unit of the expansion constant

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
I followed up

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
And then you said

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
So why does it

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Why does it change

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
It's a fixed value

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Then

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
You said why does it change

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
I really don't understand

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Wait a minute

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm the only one who doesn't understand

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Is there anyone who can help me

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Say

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
What does this mean

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I think it sounds a bit strange

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Because it

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Yeah, I understand

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
It's a rate of expansion

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
The rate of expansion should be related to the environment

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Instead of GDP or GDP

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
For example, you say the rate of expansion

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
The rate of expansion has nothing to do with GDP or GDP

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah, if you look at this rate of expansion

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
It should be said that

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
On the cell membrane

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
The rate of expansion is a slower value

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
And then in the cell nucleus

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
It's another faster value

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
But

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
But in

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
In different locations

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Different time points

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
As long as it is

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
As long as it is on the cell membrane

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
The rate of expansion is the same

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
As long as it is in the cell nucleus

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
The rate of expansion is the same

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Oh, okay, I know

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I know how to ask

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Then I change a question

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
This big D

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Big D U or big D V

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
These two values

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
What does it have to do with

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
It will be with

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It will be with the nature of these two cells

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
What kind of cell is it?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Right?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Correct

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Is there anything else?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
No more

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
It's basically

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Theoretically, you should

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Theoretically, when you write this governing equation

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You should hope these two

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
These two numbers are basically used to present

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
To some extent

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
It's just about the relationship between this interaction

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Right?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Just the two of them

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
But if you do

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
No, I mean the two of them

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
If one is a stone

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Or one is a protein

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Obviously that D will be very different

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I can't even write

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Correct

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
So it is

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Correct

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Characterize the nature of your system

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Or the nature of the unit in the system

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
But

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
It looks like your persimmon

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Dimension

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Will still be with

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
For example, how big do you put these cells

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
It doesn't matter to cultivate

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
It looks weird

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Wait, why am I

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
It looks weird

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I think I can understand it

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Then I also know

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
I understand your question

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I think I understand the question

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
But why

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
That D

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I guess what you mean is that

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
That D

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
I said Zhang Aiyong

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
What you mean is that

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
That D is not a constant

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
It's actually a variable

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Right?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Will change according to the unit you choose

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Correct

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
So why is this a problem?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
So why is this a problem?

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I can know what that thing is

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
It is a constant

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Yes, you set a system

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
It is a constant

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Then you change a system

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
You change a constant

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So why is this a problem?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Yes

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
This is equivalent to

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Your expansion equation

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
In fact, it is the same as the general heat transfer

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
The expansion equation is the same

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Yes, it's exactly the same

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Heat transfer coefficient is related to temperature

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
It changes with temperature

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
No matter what it does

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
It won't be a problem

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
So I don't understand

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
I don't understand what the problem is

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
My feeling is that

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
This thing is not

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
I won't say it's a problem

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
But I will say it's not enough

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Is it not beautiful enough?

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Because it actually

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Yes, it's actually a heat transfer

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
This is a matter of aesthetics

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
Because it's not enough

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Generalize

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
I think I have to think about it

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Because I think we've been stuck for a long time

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It will take up a lot of your time

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I basically understand this equation

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Because this is actually

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
It's a heat diffusion equation

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
It's an expansion equation

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Then add the heat diffusion

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Yes

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Ok, let's continue today

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Thank you, I'm sorry

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
No

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
So

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
That expansion constant

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
It's only two kinds

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
One is

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
One is the expansion constant of U

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It will be on the film

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
It's a slower value

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
But it's the same in different positions

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Then

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
The expansion constant of V is faster

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Bigger

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Speaking of this, I suddenly thought of

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
You just said

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Their number

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Anyway, you just said that

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Magnitude is called magnitude

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
So you don't need to add another

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Magnitude equation

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
For example, the total number must be zero

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
No, because he himself

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
He himself

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I write it like this now

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
He will already be constant

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
The reason is good first

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
The expansion side

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
He will only run to the side

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
He won't

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
He won't disappear, right?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
So the expansion is already constant

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
What about the part of the reaction?

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
You just disappear

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Because his reaction rate on the V side

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
Is negative f of uv

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Then the reaction rate on the U side is

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
f of uv

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
So

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Anything disappears from V

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
He will use the same rate

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Come out from U

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
So he will automatically say

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Yes, I understand

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
OK, thank you

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
What about this system

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Basically

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
You will see that

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Rho gtp

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
He is

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
If he is anywhere

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
He has a little bit

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
More rho gtp

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
He will

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Cause a positive feedback

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Then he will suck a lot of

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Substrate

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Then it becomes

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Just suck a lot of rho gtp

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Then it becomes a lot of rho gtp

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Gathered in that position

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
The problem is now rho gtp

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
At this time it causes a

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
Rho gtp vacuum

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
But in that cell

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Part of it is

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
It doesn't seem to have

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Is rho gtp

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
The concentration is very low

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
But at this time

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Because in the cell

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
His expansion rate is very fast

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
So this concentration vacuum

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Will be quickly

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
It's the rho gtp in other places

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Once it's subtracted

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
It will be quickly sucked

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
To the cell membrane

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
So such a mechanism

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Will quickly put

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
The whole cell

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Rho gtp

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
All gathered

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
To the same cell membrane

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
To the same cell membrane

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
To the same cell membrane

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
To the same cell membrane

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
This is basically the

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Turing mechanism

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
In my special example

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
In my special example

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
More intuitive explanation

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
If I plot it directly

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
It will be like this

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
That is to say

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
What you see today

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
The orange text you see here

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
The orange is

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
The x-axis is the position

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Then the y-axis is

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
The y-axis is the concentration

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Anyway, this mechanism

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
It will basically let you

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Random

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
It will automatically grow out

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
All of these objects

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Will try to gather

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
To the same location

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Then it will form a

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Concentration peak

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
According to our understanding of the Turing system

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
That is to say

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
How long is this cell

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Today is 3 microns

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
If I am today

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
On top of 3 microns

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Model this system

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
It will grow out a peak

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
But if I use 6 microns today

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
It will grow out

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
It will grow out two peaks

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
But we found

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
The next thing that happens is

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
These two peaks

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
They will

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
There is a bit of competition between them

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Because they are both

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
Absorbing the same pool value

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Then so

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
When a peak

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
He grabbed

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
That is, he

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
He will grab another peak

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
When the peak

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
He will put

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
He will absorb

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Faster than the other

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Then

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
So he put

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Another peak

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Things inside

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
All grabbed

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
So he

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Although

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
A Turing system

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Theoretically

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Like the picture we just saw

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
The same

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
It can grow out a lot of dots

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
But actually

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
In a

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Energy

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
Quality

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
In the system

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
If you grow a lot of dots

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
A lot of dots

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
They will compete with each other

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
In the end

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
There will only be one

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
So

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
In a quality

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
He will

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
There will be competition

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
That competition will decide

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
He has only one peak

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
We can understand it this way

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
That is to say

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
This part

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
You may have to

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Just believe me first

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Just

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
A peak

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
He absorbs

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Absorbing these

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
The ability of the pool value

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Actually determines

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
His

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
Concentration of the peak

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
That is

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
The height of his peak

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Basically

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Decided

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
His ability to absorb

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
Like the one on the right

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
The one on the right

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
He has a stronger ability to absorb

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
So if you look at his

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Under the pool value

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
He will also cause

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
A relatively large

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Valuation vacuum

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
And then

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
He will be more over there

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
That is the concentration of the cell value

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Will be lower

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
At the same time

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
If you look at the small one

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Because he has a poor ability to absorb

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
So he won't be so fast

37:16.000 --> 37:17.000
Take

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
All the cells under him

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Grabbed

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
So the cell value under him

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
That one

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
The concentration is higher

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
At this time he caused

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Say

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
At this time he caused

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Say here

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
There is a

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
The concentration of the cell value

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Because in the cell value

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
His

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
His expansion is very fast

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
At this time

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
The substance will be very fast

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
From the small peak on the left

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Run to the right

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
And then

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
This is what happens at this time

37:42.000 --> 37:43.000
That is

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Everyone

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Run over

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Then he will be sucked to the other side

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
This is probably

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Why two peaks

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Will compete with each other

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
A

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Rationale

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
In fact

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
We are in the real

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
There is such a phenomenon

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
In the school drama

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
That is

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
In fact, like me

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Of course not only

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
One

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Rho GDP

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
One Rho GDP

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Between him

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
There are other molecules involved

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
But basically

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
The concept is still the same

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
That is, everyone can still see

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Say

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
I helped him point

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Great

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
That is

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Basically everyone was here

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
See that

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
That positive feedback

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
He is not going to

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Promote his own activation

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
He is

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
He will catch one

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
One

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Scaffold

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Is a framework

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Protein

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
That protein

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Will stick to another

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
A protein called GAP

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
But this GAP

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Its role is

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It is used to put

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Rho GDP

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Becomes Rho GDP

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
So once there are so many

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Rho GDP

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
After that

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
He will call out this green

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
And this yellow

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Then this yellow

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Will try to turn blue into yellow

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
So this

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
This one

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Is a positive feedback

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
So basically

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
In the school drama

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
We can see

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
I was just modeling

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
That thing

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
In the school drama

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
We do see

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
If today

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Don't let that

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Green

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
This protein

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
It's the one you'll see later

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
The black part

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Is this green

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Green protein

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Or you let this

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Red red protein

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
He is

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
That Rho GDP

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
In the school drama

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
It's called CC42

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
This protein

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
If you let it shine

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
You'll see later

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
First

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It will grow out of a lot of points

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
But

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
There will be competition between these different points

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
And then there's only one point left

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
And then there's only one point left

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Everyone can see

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
These two are the same cell

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Different proteins

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
There are two

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
And then it becomes one

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
And the one below

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It's the same

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
It's

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
At first

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
There will be two points

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
And then these two points

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
Finally it becomes a point

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Excuse me

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
So this competition

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
This is not a simulation

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
This is real

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Yeah, this is from the microscope

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
See below

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
If

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
If you put that protein

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
If you put a fluorescent protein on top

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
And then it's under the microscope

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Recording

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Recording the fluorescence

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
And then

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Yeah, I'm turning black and white now

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
So

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
The fluorescent part is black

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Hi, I have a question

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
I've been looking

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
I've been looking for trouble

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
It's

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
My question is

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
It's the time under the video

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Is that unit a second?

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
It's a second

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
A few minutes, a few seconds

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
So it's time under the video

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
So

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
This whole video

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
It's probably

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
What ten minutes or something

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Yeah

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
And then he competed

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
This process is probably

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
It will end in less than three minutes

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
How much is the distance between the two points

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
The diameter of the entire cell

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
It's about

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Five

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Millimeters

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
No, no, no

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Millimeters

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It's ten to the sixth square meter

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
Millimeters

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
It's the diameter

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
So the distance between the two points is about

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Two meters

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
So this kind of cell

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
In the spread

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Speed

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
Will

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
In this ten-odd minutes

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Will be less than

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
The distance between the two points

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Otherwise

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Your F

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
The parameters should have time

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
It won't be

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
Because you wait

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Interaction is infinite

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
It's not

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Every moment

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
To achieve its effect

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Like this

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
The F inside

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Is

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
The parameters of the reaction rate inside

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
There is time

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
It's

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
It's in the F

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
Will be

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Every second

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
How much

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
How much more can be generated every second

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
How much

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
The concentration of U

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
Directly like this

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
The parameter in front

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
There is time

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
OK

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
I also have a question

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
That is

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
GTP will consume GDP

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
That consumption is

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Will

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
As long as there is GDP

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
It will definitely consume it

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Or

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
It has a certain criteria

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
To a certain extent

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Even if it has GDP around it

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
It doesn't care

42:19.000 --> 42:20.000
No, we are

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
We are

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
We didn't imagine

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
It has a threshold

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
That is

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
As long as it

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
That is

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
GTP will consume

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
That is

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
GDP will consume GDP

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Right?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Then

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Then I mean

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
This consumption is

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
There is actually one less

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
That is

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It has a key

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
For example, you can see

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
There are two keys here

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Right?

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
So it is

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
For example, this one

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
This key rate

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
With

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Road GDP

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Is related

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Then come back

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
The rate is related to

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Road GDP

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
So today if there is

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Very little road GDP

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
A lot

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
A lot of road GDP

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Very little road GDP

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
That

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Then this positive feedback

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It will work hard to put the value

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
That is road GDP

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
All become

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
It keeps becoming road GDP

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Right?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Then but

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Road GDP

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
It is also going back

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
It will also run back

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
So this is a bit

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Depends on

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
This middle balance

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
So

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
So

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
So GTP

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
That is the pink one

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Will also have a chance to turn blue

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
It is not

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
Right

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
It is a

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
It is reversible

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Right

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Got it

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Thank you

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Right

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
So in this

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
In this complex amount

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
It is a two-way arrow

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
In the original simple amount

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
It is also a two-way arrow

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
That is

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
It can run on the model

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
It will fall back

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
But because

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Because

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Because if at that point

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
There are a lot of road GDP

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
The positive feedback will keep running

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
It is easy to be sucked

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Hiding on the model

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Ok

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
That

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
That's right

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
So we are in the project

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Sometimes found

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
Indeed this system

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
It will indeed

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
At the beginning

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Several different

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
Peak

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
That is

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Several different

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
Different blocks of road GDP

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
But they will compete with each other

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Until the end

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
There is one

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
That

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
The next question is coming

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Ok

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
If I told him

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
Um

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
These two road GDP

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Peak

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
They will definitely compete with each other

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
That

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Then we solve it

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Why only get a

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
A

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
A front end

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
Such a question

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
That

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
In this case

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Those that will grow

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
How does it differ

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
In the end

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Under what circumstances

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
These road GDPs

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Peak

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
It will not compete

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
This is my main question

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
And then I found

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
In fact, a very simple thing

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
You just need to increase the length of the cell

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Long enough

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
That is

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
If it is a short cell

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
It will be over soon

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
But if it is a long cell

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
It actually started

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It will also compete very quickly

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
But the competition

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
It seems to be competing

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
The speed becomes super slow

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
There is no

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
There will be a little competition at the beginning

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
So it disappeared

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Just a few

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
This peak and this peak disappeared

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
But in the end

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
These four

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
They seem to stay there all the time

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Then it lasted

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
A very long time

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
it is good

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
That

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
So why is it like this

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
I slightly

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Let me confirm

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
If my understanding is not wrong

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Between them

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
There should still be a rise

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's just that it's an equilibrium

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Does that mean

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Of course there is a rise between each other

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
That is

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Yes, they are actually

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Still competing between each other

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
The speed of that competition

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Becomes very, very slow

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
That is, the competition at the beginning is very fast

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
I don't know why the competition at the end

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Very slow

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
If my own understanding

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
According to that

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
If you look at the expansion formula

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Because it

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Blue turns red

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
And red turns blue

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
It's two-way

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So if your distance is long enough

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
If they each reach the local balance

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Then they are the last

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Those few peaks

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Will not compete anymore

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
because

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Ah yes

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
I mean this

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
It should be like this, right

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Yes yes

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
It should be like this

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
This meaning

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Yes

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
I guessed it myself

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
I am

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Confirm

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Yes

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
But according to what we said earlier

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
If there are two peaks over there

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
They should compete in the end

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
That is

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
They are right

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
They are indeed

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Local has reached an equilibrium

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
That is to say

46:23.000 --> 46:24.000
You will see this on top

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
There is a small peak

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
There will be a small

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Concentration

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
There will be a place

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Is

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
It's more concentrated

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Then this

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
This value

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
On this side

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
It's a little bit

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
It's a little bit

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
It's a little bit

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
It's a little bit

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
It's a little bit

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
This value

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
With

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Its activator

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
This is itself

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Equal

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Then this side

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Equal

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
But under this balance

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
The concentration here

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Will be higher

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Under this balance

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
The concentration here

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Will be lower

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Leading to

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
It will still compete in the end

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Theoretically

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
This mechanism

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Should be

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
How long

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Still have to

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Have a way

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
To do

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
But if it looks like

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
If the distance is long enough

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Indeed they

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
The blue line

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Will have a slope

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
So it will lead to

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Flow from high

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
But at the same time

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
The orange line

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Will return

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
Return to blue

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
So it's possible

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
The orange line

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
It will turn blue

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Speed ​​higher than

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Blue

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
High place

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
Flow to low place

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Then they will reach

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
A kind of balance between each other

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
A kind of balance between each other

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
If the distance is long enough

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
If the distance is long enough

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Ah

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
But because

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
In this system

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Its blue

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Its blue

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
Sorry

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Because in this system

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Its blue

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Its blue

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Its blue

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Its blue

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Its blue

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
Its blue

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
So it becomes

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
The effect of blue expansion

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Will

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Far greater than red

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Should say so

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
OK

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Then

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Caused

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Theoretically

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
It should run like this

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Yes

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Theoretically it should be competitive

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Then everyone wait for me

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
It seems that someone

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Because I'm going to argue

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Want to enter our house

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Wait for me

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Sorry

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Pervert

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Pervert

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Ask them to come in and listen to the speech

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
He is not here now

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Can't hear it

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
They have a speech

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
They want to talk about that today

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
Just said

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
They want to talk about Maya culture

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And there is food to eat outside

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Why do you think they will come in

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Speaking of this

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
That one

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Discuss a topic with everyone

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
That is

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
We are now

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Tara

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
That is the fund

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
In fact, it can explode

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
That is food

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
There is food

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Because

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Ah

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
We are now with

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
The education department wrote the grant

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Is

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
It can be written up to 400 yuan at most

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
But it has to be reported in time

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
That

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
That

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We only buy this city now

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
So it actually costs more than 100 yuan

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Less than 200 yuan

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Then

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
If everyone wants

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
In fact, we think

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
What what

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
No

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
He should be talking to other people outside the door

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Don't care about him

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Oh ok

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Then I will tell him quickly

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Wait for me

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
We are discussing another thing

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
So if everyone wants to say

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Every time I open Tara

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Buy some donuts or something

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
In fact, you can

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Send me some votes

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Then

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I will transfer this money to you

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Then those votes can be used to report the education

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Is the account of our project

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Then everyone can

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
Save a little money

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Every time you have a meeting

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
You can buy some donuts

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
Then you think about it

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
If you are interested

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
We can discuss

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Sorry

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Then you can continue

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Should

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Why did you go to find other people

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Correct

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Correct

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Where was I just now

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Just now everyone is talking about

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
There should be an equilibrium here

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Then

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
If the distance is too long

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
It should be said

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
If the distance is long to a certain extent

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Between him

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Why is there an equilibrium

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Actually, I don't understand

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
But

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Let's leave it alone

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Because now I think

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Maybe it will be a bit difficult to explain

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
why

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
There will be no equilibrium

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
But

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Actually we

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
There is a way

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Directly from

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
This is called

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
Stability Analysis

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
That is to say

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
If I look today

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Two

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Exactly the same

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Peak

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Then go to see this

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Peak solution

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
If there is stability in math

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Will find

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
He

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
In fact, it will never be unstable

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
He will always compete

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
This is already

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Is

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
This is what we

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Directly use math to prove

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Say

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
He will always compete

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
This thing

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Just me in this speech

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
I usually don't put that

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Take out the math

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So I hope everyone can believe me first

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
Say they will definitely compete

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
This thing

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
But I know this is a bit

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Excessive thing

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
It becomes

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Everyone just have to believe me

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
But

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
But anyway

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Yes

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Then it becomes

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
This is very strange

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
In the end

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
If it is already mathematical proof

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
He just

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
He will definitely compete

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
That is in the end

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
Is

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
In the end

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Why are they competing

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
The speed will become so slow

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Later found

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
It's like this

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
That is to say

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Because at first we guessed the distance

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Because we are very obvious

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
We just made the distance longer

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
So we guessed the distance at first

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Then I guess the distance

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
They did it for about half a year

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
I found out later

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Oh, it's not the distance

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
In fact

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
In fact

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Will affect the most

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Is the amount of protein in it

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Ask us today

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
If we are modeling this system

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
That is to say

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
If it is a small cell today

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
And a big cell

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Then we all assume

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
At the beginning

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
The concentration of protein in the cell

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
If it's the same

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
Then when I put that cell

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
When it gets longer

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
At the same time

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
I also added all the protein

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
So if

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Then

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
This is the first thing

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
The second thing

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
The first thing is more trivial

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
The second thing is to say

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
We suddenly found this thing

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
That is

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
If there was a peak

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
You keep stuffing protein in it

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Keep stuffing protein

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
The amount of protein

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Damn

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
The amount of protein

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
The mouse is gone

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
If the amount of protein becomes more

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
That peak will increase

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
That is, it will become more

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
More concentrated

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
But it doesn't grow to a certain extent

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
It just grows horizontally

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
That means

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
It actually has a boundary

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You can't go beyond that boundary

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
You can't grow higher than it

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
The reason for this boundary is actually because

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
If you are a little more familiar with this system

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
If you realize this thing

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
This is actually a bi-stable reaction

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
That is to say

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
The concentration of U

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
At the highest point

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
Is stable

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Then the lowest point

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Is also stable

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
So if it goes beyond that point

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
It will come back by itself

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Then it stops at that point

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Then this bi-stability

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
This nature

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
It actually comes from

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Every time a peak comes out

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
It will cause a value vacuum

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Value vacuum will

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
The higher the peak, the more serious the value vacuum

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
But it can't get worse infinitely

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Because it can't get negative

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
So it will stop at a certain point

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Then it limits

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
You basically can't grow that high anymore

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Because it will become lower when it grows higher

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
The value will not be able to support the peak

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Will grow higher

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Basically such a concept

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
If you look at it from a mathematical point of view

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
If we plot f of u, v

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Assuming that this f of u, v is

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
a u square b minus b u square

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
It is a

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
As far as I know

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
As far as I know

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
The simplest

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
This system

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Polarized reactor

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
a and b are a constant

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Is a reaction constant

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
There is time in it

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Then u and v are density

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
If it is such a reactor

54:27.000 --> 54:30.000
It actually looks like a green curve

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
It's not right at first glance

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
This is obviously a 2-dimensional

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Why does it look like a 3-dimensional

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
That's because

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
In

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Steady-state

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
How to say steady-state

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
In steady-state

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
d u d t is 0

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
So these two things

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Now it becomes like this

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
If you add the two things

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
That f of u, v will just disappear

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Then

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
If f of u, v just disappears

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
You are on both sides at the same time

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
If you do two points for x

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
This thing will come out

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
So the density of v and the density of u

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
It's actually a linear relationship

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
This is actually a reaction

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
This is the reaction

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
That is to say

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
q is a constant

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
It's basically the level of the basal

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
The density of the basal value

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Then there will be one in the middle

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
The vacuum of the value

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
This vacuum of the value

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
It will actually react directly to that u

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
That is

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
How high is the density of the activator

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
This can be solved directly

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
After solving

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
v is equal to this u plus q

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
If you bring this in

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
You will find that it is actually a three-dimensional

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
This three-dimensional means

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Today everyone will see this f of u, v term

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
Then I need a mouse now

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
This f of u, v term means

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
In fact, if x is u

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
The axis is f of u, v

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Now there is no f of u, q

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Because v is replaced by q

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
OK

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
There are two points in it

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
These two points are all stable state

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
That is to say

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
If the density is slightly deviated

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
It will run this way

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
Then if it is slightly deviated on both sides

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
It will run to the middle

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Then this is an unstable state

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
In short, if both sides are

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
When it is almost zero in density

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
It is directly zero in this world

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
When the density is zero

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
It is a stable state

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Then its density

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
When it is in this position

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
It is also a stable state

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
So it will cause

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
It will cause

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Your peak rose to a certain extent today

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
It stops here, it will not rise anymore

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
This is a stable state

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
The following is also a stable state

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
So in such a system

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
In fact, everyone will find that

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
If there are two peaks today

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
And this big peak

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
It must be higher than the small peak

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
It will have a density gradient

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Because of the relatively narrow peak

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Its density here will be higher

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
The higher the peak, the lower the density

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
But in fact, if today there are two

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Different big peaks

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
But it's just a wider one

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
One is narrower

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
If the height of the two is almost the same

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
At the same time, the base density

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
The height will be almost the same

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
At this time, the middle one

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
That density gradient

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
It becomes very, very small

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Because the density gradient is too small

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
So this competition will become very, very fast

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Follow up here

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Have

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Ok, let's assume that everyone has followed up

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
If you don't follow up

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
You can directly accept this conclusion

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
That is to say, we found out

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
Because

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
First two things

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
One thing is because there is a U peak

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It will cause a V vacuum

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
This vacuum can't run down infinitely

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
This will definitely decide

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
A peak height limit

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
We call saturation point

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
It is saturated there

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
So in such a system

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Saturation point must exist

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
This is the first one

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
Then there is

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
If the height of the peak

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
When it is close to the saturation point

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
At this time, even if the two peaks are not the same

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
The competition between them

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Because the density gradient is very, very small

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
So it becomes very, very, very slow

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Except for that part

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
I also did this thing directly

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I'm in my model

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Change all the parameters I can change

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Then I go

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
So in each one

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
The two axes are different parameters

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
This is the total value

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Or this is the length

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Or this is the reaction length

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Or this is the expansion length

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Can be changed

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
After I changed it

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
I put the time between the two peaks

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Plot out with color

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
At the same time, I put the saturation index between them

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Not the saturation index between them

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
This is the peak saturation index

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
The so-called saturation index

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Its definition is

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
The closer the peak height

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
The closer it is to the saturation point

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
Its color is more yellow

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Then everyone will find

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Competition time and saturation index

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
It's almost completely correlated

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
If I put the competition time

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Plot in the y-axis

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
Then the x-axis is basically the height of the peak

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I will get this dot

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Every simulation here

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
If you turn it into a dot

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
You get a trend like this

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Trend

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
This trend means

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
If I have two peaks competing today

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
They compete very fast

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So there is a group of dots here that is very fast

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
In addition, there is a group of dots

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
It will become very, very slow

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Because this curve

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It basically becomes like this

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It is a very dramatic switch

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So it's almost a switch-like response

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
As long as it protrudes a little bit

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
It will become very, very slow

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So today it's like a cell

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
It's in this state

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Look at this state

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Between the growing dots

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Make a choice

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Then we found this kind of

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
In fact, it is not limited to the f of uv that I just showed

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
That is, its f of uv can be replaced with various f of uv

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
For example, I just used this picture

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
That is to say, there are three arrows

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
One up, one down, and then a positive feedback

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Today we can make that positive feedback smaller

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Make that positive feedback bigger

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Today we can add an additional negative feedback on that positive feedback

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Or we can make that positive feedback

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
The positive feedback is actually

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Active form to suppress the speed of its own fall

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
This is also another kind of positive feedback

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We can change these f of uv in any way

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
They will get the same conclusion in the end

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That is, the more saturated the two peaks

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Their competition will be slower

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Then this is a switch-like response

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
So to make a conclusion

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
First of all, if there are several clusters today

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
That is, several different peaks of low-GTPS

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
They will definitely compete

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Then that is to say

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
If these several peaks are all saturated

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Their competition will be very, very slow

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
If it's very, very slow

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Basically in a biological system

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You can almost say that they are two non-competing peaks

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
They may have to spend billions of years

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
To be able to compete

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Then we are in the biological system

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So we just think it's not going to compete

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
This is part of my theory

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Any questions?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Okay, if not

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
The key question is actually

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Whether those mathematics can be reflected

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
In the biological system, right?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
At this time we did something called

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Septim Mutant

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
That is to say, this is also a small

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I have a question

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
So can I make the same conclusion

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
So your experiment can't go

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
That is, you can't go from the results of the experiment

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
To probe

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
What is the content of that big F

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Yes, because in fact

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
My model only has U and V

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Then a real model

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
It actually needs more protein in it

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Then I cut it into a simple form

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So in this simple form

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
What should the F of U and V look like

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
In fact, it's hard for me to say

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But I just said a very important point

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
No matter what form the F of U and V looks like

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
It doesn't matter

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
The point is that no matter what form it looks like

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
They will actually compete

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And they will switch to non-competing

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Because I think you will compete

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Then it will reach the Global Equilibrium

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The biggest reason is

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
If you go back to the front

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That partial T U is equal to big D

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Then that is partial partial U plus F

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Then the other one is minus F

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
In fact, if you add the first line and the second line

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Then you can get rid of F

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And your big F doesn't depend on T or X

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So you can just get rid of it

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
So the whole Global Dynamics

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It's only related to U, V, X, T

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It has nothing to do with F itself

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So from here, can I conclude

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
In fact, from this equation

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Theoretically, it shouldn't have anything to do with the connotation of F

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Because it's an elliptical equation

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I just spent an hour talking about this

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
That's right

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
OK

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
OK

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
OK

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I just have

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
OK

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
So

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So your experiment will focus on

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Is

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It's a bit like the diffusion itself

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Can this be verified

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Instead of F

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
You can test the content of F

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Is that right?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I don't want to test what the content of F is

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
OK

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
But if what I just inferred is right

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
No matter what the content of F is

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
First of all

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
A system

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
If they peak

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
They can compete at the beginning

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But they may become a

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Can't compete

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
It's a very, very slow competition

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
This

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Then this will depend on a saturation point

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Then I have to prove that the saturation point exists

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So this is what experiments need to test

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
OK, I see

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
OK

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
OK

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Thank you

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
I have always

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Who else just now

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Is it

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I have always wondered about the so-called competition

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
This word

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Because from your equation

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Your

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Your source term is that F

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It doesn't have time

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It doesn't have time to be its

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
What do you call it?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Self-variable

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
So this is an elliptical equation

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Then it's only related to the boundary conditions

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It will always reach a

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Steady state solution

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So just now your data proved

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It will eventually have a

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Steady state

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
That is, a stable solution

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That has a stable solution

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It means that it won't change at any time

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
That won't change at any time

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
It means that

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
There will be no so-called competition between them

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Relationship

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So I have always been

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I can't understand why

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Math can prove

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
They will have a competition

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Because there is a competition

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Because

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Can I interrupt you first?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
OK

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
So that's it

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Today

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But indeed

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It can reach a

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Stable state

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
That is, the steady state solution

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It may have two peaks

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Right

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
But that doesn't mean

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
That steady state solution is stable

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So this solution

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It may be

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Noise in any cell

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Just

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Get a bigger one

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
A smaller one

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
If it is unstable

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
This situation will make them compete

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Then

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Let it from a

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Two-peak steady state solution

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Becomes only one-peak steady state solution

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Because there is only one

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Steady state means

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
It won't change at any time

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yes

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Steady state means

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
It won't change at any time

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
But if you leave the steady state

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It may go to another steady state

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
At this time we will say

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The original steady state is unstable

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So this deviation

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Must be in

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Initial condition

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It appeared

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It can't say that this system is halfway

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
It reached

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
The current system reached the steady state

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Then you have to say

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
It has a noise

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Caused it to go to another place

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Because when you have this noise

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
When it appears

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Your system is completely different

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Yes yes

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
This system is different

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So you can't use

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
When I wrote this system

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
I should add a noise term later

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
That's right

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Because in the cell

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Noise is something that exists at any time

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
But if

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Your source term

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Source term should not only be f

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Then uv

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Should be f, uv

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Then there is a time t

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Then this system

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
May be a noise of time

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
It doesn't have to be a noise of time

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
That noise term doesn't need to be a noise of time

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Oh

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Just turn it into a snow machine

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
It will be in

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
It's a snow machine

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Take data

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
You are in your take data

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Throughout the history

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
There will be a moment suddenly

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
There will be a moment suddenly

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
There will be fluctuation

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I think that's what that t means

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yes

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So actually I think

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I probably know what you two are going to say

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
In fact, that is to say

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
If you just look at this value

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It will actually reach the equilibrium at the end

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Regardless of the equilibrium

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
That is

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Is stable or unstable

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It just shouldn't change

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But if there is a fluctuation

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
It may suddenly fluctuate

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Then put the unstable equilibrium

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
The whole is biased to another place

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
But this

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
This fluctuation should actually be written

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
There is a t in that F

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But you didn't write it now

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I think that's what it means

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yes

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I understand what you are talking about

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Theoretically, that's right

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
But anyway

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Because I am now

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Just because it's simple

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I didn't write that noise term

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
But if

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
If its initial condition is noise

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
In fact, it won't really run to two peaks

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Stay

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
That is

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Like this

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
It's just that there is noise

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
It won't grow two exactly the same peaks

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Then as long as they are two

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
These two peaks are a bit different

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
They will definitely compete

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
The only stable or steady state at the end

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I can understand what you want to say

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
But what I want to say is that this picture

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Can't represent what you want to say

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Because this picture only shows

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Its solution has not yet reached

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Steady state

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But I understand what you mean

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I know

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Yes

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It did not reach the steady state at the beginning

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
If you put the steady state at the beginning

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
It won't

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It will be stuck there

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Then you have to give it a little bit of noise

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It can only run to one

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
So what I mean is that this picture

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
There is no way to explain what you are talking about

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
But I can understand what you want to say

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Sorry

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Because I am doing the value simulation

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So I have always been

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Strange

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
That

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Some strange

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yes

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
What we do is to solve

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Solve two peaks

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Then solve a peak

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Then

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Prove that the two peaks are not stable

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
In this case

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Once we know that the two peaks are not stable

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
In fact, when we run the simulation

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Even if the solution is there

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
The simulation will not run to that solution

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
It is not an attractor

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It will run to the stable

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Steady state solution

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
So they almost never really go

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Unstable solution

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
From a mathematical point of view

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
It will definitely

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
It's what you just said

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Put two peaks, one peak

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
As long as there is no noise

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Your equation is always that group

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Then its source term noise is exactly the same

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
It will definitely become the same solution

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Because it is an elliptical equation

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
In terms of numbers, that's another problem

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Because you can't prove

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
The numerical method you use

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
No numerical

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Numerical noise

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Because I just mentioned it

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Ok that's it

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
I think

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
The simulation I just showed

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
The main noise term

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Is my initial condition

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Sorry, let me wipe it

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
How many more in your head

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I just said

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
7.30 right

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Yes

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And 1, 2, 3, 4

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
But there are a lot of animations here

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Otherwise I can walk faster

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Then basically

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I want everyone to watch the movie

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Then

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Otherwise we are like this

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
You finish it first

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
If we have time at the end, let's ask questions together

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Thank you all

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Deal

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Ok

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So now the situation is

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I want to see in the game

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Can really see this

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Is

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Composition from fast to slow

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So it can grow two buds

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
First of all, we do one thing

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
When we were simulating

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Let the composition

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
From fast to slow

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
The fastest way is to put that

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
The distance is long, right

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So now we make a longer cell

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
This longer cell

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
What actually happens is

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
A real yeast

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You should see two cells in the picture

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Is a large cell

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
After the small cell

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
They will break

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
They are now broken

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But after that

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I let one of its proteins

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Is responsible for breaking it

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
This protein is basically

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Very unstable at 37 degrees

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But stable at 24 degrees

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So that protein

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It is invalid

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
The result is that it can't be separated

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The result is like this

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
You can look at the top cell first

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It first grew a tooth

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
At this time, only one tooth grew

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
At this time, two teeth grew

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
At this time, two teeth grew

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
OK

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
The following one

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
It grew a tooth

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It grew a tooth

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
It grew a tooth

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
It grew three teeth

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It grew three teeth

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
At this time, we can almost guess

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
When it only grows one tooth

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Because it's not broken here

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So its entire cell is all connected

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
It obviously has two

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
It looks like a cell, but it's not broken

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
But at this time, it only grew a tooth

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
We can almost be sure that

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
This is probably what we did before

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But it grew to a certain length

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
But it found that it would grow a lot at this time

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
But it found that it would grow a lot at this time

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
But it found that it would grow a lot at this time

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
If we use the same method

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Let's go inside

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
The one I just talked about

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Is that the protein emits a silver light

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
You'll see

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
For example, let's say this one

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
This cell cycle is over

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It seems to be happening too fast

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It stopped growing

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
At this time, a bunch of them would grow at the beginning

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
A few of them disappeared

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Only these two remain

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
After these two remain, they no longer compete

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Then it becomes two teeth

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
At the same time, there are many of them growing at the same time

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
At the same time, there are many of them growing at the same time

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
But in the end, these two compete

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
So it only grows one

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
This is the same situation

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So we see that in the same group of cells

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So we see that in the same group of cells

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
There are a bunch of cells here

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And each cell actually

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Some of them will grow on both sides

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Some of them will grow on one side

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
In a population

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
About 65% of the population

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It will grow two teeth

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It looks like

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I ran out of the previous solution

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
At the beginning, many different peaks came out

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Then the small peak was quickly competed

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
After the big peak stayed

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
The competition became very slow

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Then they will move forward

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Then there are about 65% of the cells

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
It's two teeth

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
If I just said

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
The conclusion of the mathematical side is correct

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
If we put the whole system

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
If the amount of protein in the system is adjusted

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Then my peak should be from saturated

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
It's not saturated

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So it has to go from compete very slowly to compete very quickly

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Right?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Then we should see less

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Two-button cells

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
So what we do is

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
We are now comparing

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
The first bar is wild type

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Except

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Normal, non-separable yeast

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Then the second bar is

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Normal yeast

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
But it's inside

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
That red or blue guy

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It only has half the amount

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Then the third bar is

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
The yellow guy inside

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
The yellow protein has only half the amount

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Then the fourth bar is

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Both red and yellow have only half the amount

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Then

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The last bar is

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
All proteins in this cell have only half the amount

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Then when we do this comparison

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
We found that

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
The more protein

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It will have more cells

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
On both sides

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Then the less protein

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
The less population

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It grows on both sides

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
This means

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
This is pretty much

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
In line with our experiment

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Our theory

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Then

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
But then people will say

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Maybe it's not a matter of distance

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Maybe it's not a matter of protein quality

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Maybe the distance plays a bigger role

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Like you see the cell on the left

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Is it longer

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
So it's slower

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Because

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Because of the spread

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Because the longer the distance, the slower the spread

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Then it will be more unbalanced

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
This is another assumption

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
But we found

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
If we go to the two-body cell and the one-body cell

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Then measure the length of their cells

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Then we found that they didn't have much difference

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So this time I put this alternative hypothesis

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Rejected

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
My own hypothesis is better

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Then another hypothesis

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Is a mathematical hypothesis

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I said you talked so much math in front

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
It's really a bit boring

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Because in fact we don't need this math

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
To explain this

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Today if our competition process

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Is a peak to put another peak

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
To compete

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
That is to suck dry

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Let's say we have two peaks today

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
They don't need to saturate

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Then these two peaks are higher

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But there are more things inside

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So it takes longer to suck dry

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
So if we are

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Fixed at a certain time

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
It's going to start growing

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
At that time it will start to grow two

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
See, you don't need a saturation

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Such an explanation

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Then I want to reject this hypothesis

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
So I did this

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
In fact, in a math system

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
In addition to the positive feedback I just mentioned

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It actually has a negative feedback

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
In a normal system

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It still has a negative feedback

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
In the model

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
If we remove this negative feedback

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
It will increase the saturation point

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
The result of increasing the saturation point

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
That is to say

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
If the original amount of protein

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Is the same

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
If you just increase the saturation point

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
At this time it will become less saturated

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
At this time it should

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Compete faster

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Because it's sharper

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So it depends on

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
In the actual cells

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
If you remove this negative feedback

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Is it like we thought

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
It will become faster

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
We found that

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
This cell

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
It is less saturated

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I'll close the door

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
In this state

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
We found

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
In fact, if we compare

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
These two genes

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
There is a negative feedback

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
If there is no negative feedback

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
In fact, there is a negative feedback

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It is

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
The amount of protein in the patch

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Is relatively small

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
But even so, it still looks like it competes slower

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Such a phenomenon

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
With my alternative hypothesis

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I didn't explain it

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So I rejected this alternative hypothesis

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Okay

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
So far

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
The experiments I have done

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It seems to be quite

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
It seems to be quite

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
In line with my math

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
The hypothesis

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Instead of other possible hypotheses

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So we got

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
To sum up

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Three conclusions

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
One is

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
When I make the pathogen

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Longer

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It will become more

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Its competition

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
The competition between the low-GTPS

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It will become slower

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
So it becomes

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
It can increase by 2.5

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Or even 3.5 or more

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
This is quite in line with my model

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Then again

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
The saturation point can be moved

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
If we can move the saturation point

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
It means that basically

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
We can support the saturation point

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
In addition to the saturation point

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
In addition to this hypothesis

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I can't think of any other hypothesis

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
To explain my last data

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
So I will end it here

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I am basically in a lab of the military

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And everyone is doing experiments

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
So on the left

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
This is my teacher

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
This is my senior

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
She has gone to Boston

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
They are doing experiments

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
This group is mathematicians

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I can't write the proof

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The proof part

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
These two guys wrote it for me

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Thank you very much

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I don't know how to write the proof

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
The following is my experiment

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Thank you

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Before entering Q&A

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Because our time is late

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So if you have any questions

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
You can leave

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
No need to force

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
In the dialogue room

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I will post it again

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
There is a feedback form

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
You can fill in this video

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Today

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I am the host

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
How is the meeting

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Then the quality of the connection

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Then the quality of the speech

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And so on

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Then if you are interested in

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
The research of Jiangen

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
You can leave a message to him

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Then I will help you forward it to Jiangen

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
If you want to

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Leave your contact information

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Then discuss it in depth

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Then I will put it in the dialogue box

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Everyone can please click

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
If you don't have any special

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
If you have any comments, please click

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Because this information

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
We will apply for all kinds

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
This

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Support or

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That proposal

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
May use my data

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Thank you for your help

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Do you have any questions?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
You can ask directly

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Thank you for the chat box

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Because I just

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Can't see the chat box

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Let me ask first

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Is

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Does anyone take this model

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
To study social phenomena

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Because I always feel

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
If we take the cell membrane

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
As the territory of the United States

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Then you use red and blue lines

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Then this matter recently

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Red and blue

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And you see

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
What is mentioned in the video

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Including

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Basically not

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Protein

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Think of it as a person

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Or something

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Such a model

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Can be used to simulate

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Or predict social phenomena

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Do you know anyone doing this?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
What I know is

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
First of all, I will talk about the limit

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
That limit is first

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I didn't model any highway

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Or flying

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So that diffusion

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Basically

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
In real life

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Will be defeated by a lot of this kind of fast transportation

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
So he can't

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Model a lot of things

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
At least in today's society

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I know someone doing

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Turing pattern

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Research on social science

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Is about crime

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
More like in a local

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Little city

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Which point

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
For example

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
For example

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
A certain area in downtown

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Then it is easy to produce criminals

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Then the criminals will assume

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Can spread out

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But at the same time there is another group of people outside

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
For example

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I don't know if he is a policeman

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Or a resident who is not a criminal

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
He can be a witness

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Anyway, he is in the model

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Dynamics between the two

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
He will have unknown changes at the same time

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Then there are some

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Criminals and witnesses

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
These interactions between the police

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Some are like this

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
But in fact we have seen a lot

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Purely with a

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Deterministic

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Model

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I haven't seen a lot

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Or at least

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Because I'm looking

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
This is related to Turing pattern

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Then I haven't seen a lot

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Maybe a lot is related to Turing pattern

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Ok very cool

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Thank you everyone

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I want to confirm

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
My understanding

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
This model

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
The most important thing should be

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Between two species

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
The rate of spread is very large

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
This is the first point

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
The second point is

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Because

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
In theory, this model should be

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
In the chemical field

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Their molecular

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Spreading

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Between two different chemical substances

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Then they

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I am more curious about why

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Their chemical

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Expansion

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Did not mention any

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So-called Turing

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Turing

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
How do you say it in English?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Because Turing

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
At the beginning of this

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
His imagined activator and substrate

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Are chemical reagents

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Then he imagined

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
In fact, this application is a lot

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
In the case of non-living things

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Someone even found some chemical reactions

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
One is Diffuse slower

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
One is Diffuse faster

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Of course they will have a rate of spread

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
So it won't be

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
It won't be mass conserved

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
They really have a way to

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Add chemical reactions

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Then he really ran out of dots

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
So do a lot in chemical reactions

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
So you have seen paper

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Is the real world

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Chemical substances will produce

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
What is this called?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Turing pattern

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Turing pattern

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Is there such a thing in the real world?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Yes

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Can work hard to give you

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I haven't seen those for a long time

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Because now it's chemical compounds

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
But you really are in a

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Cultivator

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Then you add a certain substance and another substance

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Then they ran out of dots

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I remember

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Is there anyone

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Is there anyone studying that cat?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Dog? What animal pattern?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Yes

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
That's more of a guess

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Because if it is a chemical substance

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
What is your chemical substance

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
What is their reaction rate

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
All measured

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
So that model

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
How to write

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
But if it's in cats and dogs

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
We still

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
As far as I know

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
We don't know

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Which one

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Which one

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Or

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
There is another

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
This is actually a more common

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
One is

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
It will inhibit

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Even so

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I can't find which one is the key

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Which one is the key

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Because there are too many molecules in the body

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So I don't know

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
But they will point out

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Look at the pattern of the cat

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
It's exactly the same

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
It must be like this

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Mechanism

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
But no one really found that chemical substance

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Even if you find that chemical substance

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You have to write that thing

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
It is usually necessary to go through a lot of

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Simplification

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Because in the body

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Any other questions

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
I have one

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Common

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I think

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
For example, like Zhang Yanping just asked

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Say that in social science

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Or

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Social psychology

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Is there a way to use such a model

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Go

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Do research

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Then, for example, he used one here

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
A model like diffusion

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Then someone just asked

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
That's it

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
At the beginning

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
When he proposed such a model

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
He is actually in chemistry

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
That is to say

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
But I myself

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
From the point of view of physics

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I think

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
These are just

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's called effective model

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It's not really

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I think you can't

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
You have such a mathematical model

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Then

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
To get data is the same

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Then he interpreted this

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Interaction

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
What is the nature of this system

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Because

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
For example

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Just

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I think he just means

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
You have a quantity

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Then it changes over time

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
It's a certain

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
He to another variable

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
How many times

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
You can actually write a super long

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
That is to say

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
You write super long

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Then see which one comes out

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Is the most like

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But in fact, in chemistry

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
For example, in chemistry

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
The range of the equation

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
At least

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
That is to say

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
The size of the molecule

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Otherwise you enter a completely different

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Then you are different

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So I think it's just

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Effective model

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Uh

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Yeah, so we actually hate it

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
In fact, there are a lot of models

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Will do this thing

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Uh

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
In fact, like the original

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It's the same

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
There is a

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
There is a mechanism

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
It will grow

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Just

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
In physics

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
It's the same

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But it doesn't mean

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
The mechanism of the original model

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
It's exactly the same

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And indeed I told you today

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
This model is also a very

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Very simplified

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
But there is actually a basis

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
That is to say

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
That's why I'm so happy to play with it

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Because in fact

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
In terms of Helmholtz

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Of course, this is also simplified

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
But in terms of Helmholtz

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
We know the molecule

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
In terms of

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I can write a model

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
On the membrane

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
In the cytoplasm

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And then

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
On the membrane

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And then this scaffold

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
And this circle

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And then they all have that protein

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And if you kill one of the proteins

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
It really won't polarize

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So these are all genetic data

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
In fact, it is very likely

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
There are a lot of data

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
This kind of circuit operation

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
But if I want to write this out

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
7

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
No, it's actually

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
8

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Diffusion equation

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
System

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Then it's hard to study

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
But someone

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
After this simplification

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
It can go through some state-by-state assumptions

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Then get one

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
This kind of simplified

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
So there is a theory

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
It's not entirely

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I ran out of a model today

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Then this model just

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
It's just

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
The appearance of the creature

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So we think that model is wrong

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I think this kind of model is

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
This is

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Overclaiming the model

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Can do things

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I totally agree with what you just said

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
But so we will pay attention

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
We actually

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Is that molecular mechanism a Turing mechanism?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Then we think it is

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Because there are other creatures

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Supporting it

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
If today I am directly using the mechanism

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Piled up

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Then this model

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
There is a way to see me in the creature

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
The phenomenon is the same

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I didn't give it a direct assumption

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
You should look like a Turing mechanism

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
When my model is 8

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
When molecules

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
It can't tell it's a Turing

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But it looks like a Turing

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I'm more confident at this time

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I think

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
It should be said

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I don't know what the person who just asked

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
But my understanding

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
It should be what he wants to ask

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
You this model

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
What you are doing now is that you assume

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Use a very logical way to infer a model

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Then find this model

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Results with your research data

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Can

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Match your research data

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
But such a conclusion

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
There is no way to prove

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Your model is really

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
The mechanism of this real world

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
You can only say your model

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
It's just a model

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
It's not any law

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
The question I asked just now

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
My understanding is like this

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I don't know if it's right

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
My understanding is the same

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
But the problem is

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I can understand

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
If you have a model today

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Then you can use it to infer

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Then you can infer a result

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Then it's the same as the phenomenon

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
This does not explain

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
How things actually happen

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
For example, I use a more familiar example

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Even if I can model today

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
On Facebook

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
This

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
How to diffuse

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Then how it is

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Between Racism and Anti-Racism

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Make adjustments

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
For this process

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I can go to model this phenomenon

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Then there is also effect

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
But this does not explain

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I can understand that this does not explain

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Then I am on Facebook

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
How to influence another user

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Pull it to me

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
This is not the case

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
But conversely

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
If I can't make a reasonable statement at the beginning

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Say

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
On Facebook

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Interaction with people

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Satisfy diffusion

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I won't set this model at the beginning

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Because you are blind

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I want to set it up

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I don't believe anyone sets it up like this

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Like when I first started

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Really

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Really

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Many models do this

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
There are so many physics

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
No one talks about it

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
May be this mechanism

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
We have a lot of people here

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Models mess up

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Sometimes I hate it

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Models mess up

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Make us famous

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
But I want to talk about

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
At the beginning

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
When using this model

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
He also said first

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
We actually have a protein here

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
It looks like it can satisfy

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
This model

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
The assumption at the beginning

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Or the description of that

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Only use it

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
So I don't think

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
In the case of Jenkins

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
There is a big problem

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Of course I don't think

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
You have this problem

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I don't think he meant it

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
But

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I think I understand what he said

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I think

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Because my model

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
There are some mechanistic bases

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
There are some

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Data

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Is to support

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
These chemical reactions

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
These chemical reactions

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
So I'm more confident about my model

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
But even so

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Anyway, I can't say

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
That model itself

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Is what actually happened

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I totally agree with this sentence

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
But actually from a more scientific

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
If you think about it

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Which model

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
All models are false

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
He must have gone through some simplifications

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
At least he went through some simplifications

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
In fact

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Even when we

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Understand any system

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
The truth we understand

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
It's not a truth

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
All the theories we understand

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It's not the truth

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
And we don't know

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
There is no way to know

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
The theory we understand is the truth

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
There is no way to verify

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Or

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Yes

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
First of all

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
There is no way to verify

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
And it's very hard to deny

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
What we can do

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Like what I was trying to do

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I have a model today

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Or I have a theory

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
If there is only one theory

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
It's hard for me to know

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Is it right

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
For example, God created man

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It's hard for me to know

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
But if I have another theory

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
For example, this theory

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Explaining other phenomena is better than this

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Or this theory

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
There is a way

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
This theory is easy to be denied

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
We need to compare two theories

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
The advantages between them

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
We have a way to

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
To be more realistic

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
It should look like this

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
In the process

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Of course there is no theory

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
It's real

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
We can only try to be as realistic as possible

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
The process of being realistic

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
We try to compare different theories

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Put the bad theory aside

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Then compare with a different theory

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Then put the bad theory aside

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Then try to be realistic in this process

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
But our theory will never be true

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I think it's totally fine

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Because when you say

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
You are a model

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
It has already shown that it is such a thing

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Because if you are from

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Applied mathematics

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Model, theorem, law

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
These all represent different things

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
So if you use the definition of people

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
In the field of applied mathematics

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
When you say it is a model

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
In fact, people in the field of applied mathematics

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
They won't care about

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
The mechanism behind the model

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
They will only ask

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
You have a model, you have done validation

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
You have done verification

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Then this model is

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
A reasonable model

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
As for whether this model

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Represents physics or the real world

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
In fact, from the point of view of applied mathematics

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
It's not that important

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Because since you already call it a model

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
It means that as long as it works

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
That's it

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
But we still try our best

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
I hope our model can explain

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Is to be as realistic as possible

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Because we

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
After all, in the end, we want to solve the problem of life

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
OK

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
OK

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
We don't have much time, is there any question?

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
OK, just say it

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Yeah, no, because

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I may have to leave at half past five

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I need to leave and prepare

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
For the audience

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Thank you very much for your support today

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Thank you very much for your questions

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
I'm sorry it's a bit of a drag

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I hope this cross-field research

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Although it is cross-field

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Because for me, cross-field

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
We are always stuck in different areas

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
In different areas

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Our only advantage is that we can

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Talk to people in different areas

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Then I hope this video

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Today's speech has a little bit with

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Have conversations in different areas

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Everyone can understand what I'm talking about

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Then

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Put this idea together a little bit

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Be able to do something

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Then I think this is pretty good today

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Thank you very much

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Thank you, Jian, very, very cool

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Very wonderful

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Thank you all again, bye
