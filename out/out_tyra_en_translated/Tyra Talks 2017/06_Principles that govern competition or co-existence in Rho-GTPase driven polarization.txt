If you have any questions, you can just type them in the chat box.
No, he just said to start recording.
Because when I pressed it, he told me that my memory was full.
Okay, I'm going to turn off the microphone now.
Okay, bye bye.
Yeah, so if you have any questions later, you can just type them in the chat box.
Or you can just turn on your microphone and ask questions.
It doesn't matter.
Because in fact, this video, if I were to talk to a person who does biological math, it would be about 20 minutes.
But in fact, I think it should be far more than that.
Because I hope to let everyone, even if it's not a biological math background, to get a little bit of an idea of what I'm doing.
At least have a concept.
Okay, I'm going to start.
My topic today is mainly to discuss how a cell decides to extend itself in one direction.
As you can see, the nerve cell on the left side of the projection film, it only extends in one direction.
Or it extends in many directions.
Like the nerve cell on the right, it extends in many directions.
So how does it control such a mechanism?
This is actually a very, very big problem.
And in different biological systems, they may use different methods to control it.
But no one has actually asked this question yet.
So today I'm going to use the mechanism that we already know, the mechanism that the organism extends in a certain direction.
Let's understand this mechanism and then study what kind of nature it has to decide whether it extends in one direction or in many directions.
So my topic today is Principles that Govern Competition or Coexistence in Rho-GTPase Driven Polarization.
Rho-GTPase is a protein.
It's a very interesting protein.
We're going to go all over it today.
What does polarization mean?
Let me explain it to you now.
First of all, for a cell,
Modeling people often think about how to model a cell.
Generally, you would imagine that you have a cell membrane.
There's a cell tissue inside.
There's a cell box inside.
There's DNA in the cell box.
We don't care about DNA.
All the protein is floating in your cell tissue.
If someone asks me how much of the protein in the cell tissue is dense,
Different proteins are different.
For example, I'll tell you that the density of the protein in the cell tissue is about this much, a fixed number.
Let's make an assumption.
The whole cell is uniform.
The density of the same protein in the cell tissue is basically the same.
In this situation, a cell can't tell which side is the head and which side is the tail.
For a person, it is very important to distinguish between the head and the tail.
Because first of all, you need to know where your head is.
You even need to distinguish between the front and the back.
Front and back.
Back and side.
Left and right.
So a lot of this kind of asymmetry is very important to the cell.
It's not just a whole individual thing for humans.
For a cell, it's the same thing.
For example, if this is a mobile cell,
For example, if this is a tissue,
It needs to know where it's going.
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.
The tail will shake and it will swim to the other side.
Even if it's not a mobile cell,
It could be, for example, your intestinal mucosa cell.
It needs to know which side is the side with food or poop.
And which side is the side with blood vessels.
Because it's trying to get nutrients from one side to the other.
So it needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.
It needs to know which side is the head and which side is the tail.
So for biological cells,
It's very important to establish this front and back axis.
Usually, the way this is done is
A certain protein may have a completely uniform distribution in the cell.
It needs to go through a certain process.
It needs to gather at the same end of the cell.
And then from that end,
For example, it starts from that end.
The skeleton of the cell grows from there.
For example, if it wants to secrete protein,
The secretion ball will move forward along the cell skeleton.
So it needs to gather the protein to that side first.
After the cell skeleton, it will let everyone go that way.
If this is a long-term cell,
It obviously needs to grow a cell skeleton first.
After the direction of this axis, it needs to go.
The source of all this is that we need to polarize a certain protein.
That's what we call polarization.
It needs to be gathered to the same end.
In the process of polarization,
In fact, it's not just a problem of building an axis.
Another problem is,
Do you want to build an axis, or do you want to build a lot of axes?
Let's say you want to transport something out.
Do you want to transport it to one place at a time,
Or do you want to transport it to a lot of places at a time?
For example, what you see now is
The nerve cells of the hippocampus.
In fact, no matter what nerve cells,
That's pretty much how it grows.
In the beginning, it only grew to one end.
It only grew to one end when it was very small.
Then it started to grow to a lot of places.
These things that grow to a lot of ends,
Things like trees, we call them trees.
The tree is the place where the nerve cells receive information.
After the tree grows, it starts to grow the axis.
It only grows to one end.
A nerve cell has a lot of trees, but it only has one axis.
So it needs to switch from growing to a lot of ends to only one end.
Then the axis will grow very, very long.
So the information that the nerve cells receive
The same information is passed to the same axis.
So obviously, for the nerve cells,
When it grows to one end, when it grows to a lot of ends,
It's a very important thing.
This is the main problem I have today.
Our lab is not actually doing nerve cells.
Our lab is doing hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is the only thing on top.
It's called Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
In short, hemoglobin,
Hemoglobin is what we brew beer,
Or beer yeast,
Or yeast for making bread.
We often encounter it because
If you put it in a non-oxidative space,
When it eats sugar, it will dilute it into alcohol.
People are a kind of wild creature,
So they love to drink.
So we like hemoglobin very much.
In addition, we often use hemoglobin
It produces a lot of carbon dioxide.
Then it will make the bread fluffy.
Anyway, this is cold knowledge.
I just want to tell you what is hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is the one we see above.
What hemoglobin does is it will sprout.
If you have read biology in high school,
You will learn the name of sprout growth.
That is to say,
The way hemoglobin gives birth to children is
It will first try to gather a certain protein to one end.
That end will become its head.
It will grow a tooth from the head.
The tooth will become its baby.
Then the tooth will split out again.
It will become a baby.
This is the way hemoglobin gives birth.
So for hemoglobin,
It is very important that it only grows one head.
What is the reason?
Because when it is split up,
Its DNA will be divided into two parts.
Then the average one part is divided to the child,
One part is kept by itself.
If it grows two heads today,
It will have two children.
At this time, it does not know how to divide its DNA.
Many times, the child will only get half of the DNA.
Then it will die.
So for hemoglobin,
It is very important that it only grows one head.
But at the same time,
The one below is also another kind of sprout.
But it is the kind of sprout that grows spores.
But hemoglobin is very close relatives.
They basically use the same system
To decide how to grow their heads.
But the sprout that grows spores
We call it Aspia gossypia.
Aspia gossypia
It does not only grow one part at a time.
Because if it grows like this,
It will grow into a pipe.
It will become a very useless sprout.
One important thing for it is that
It needs to split up.
If it can grow today,
Then grow forward, split up,
Everyone splits up,
It can grow into a secret net.
That secret net can absorb
The nutrients of the whole land or tree trunk.
So for these sprouts,
It is important to grow many heads at a time.
But controlling how they grow their heads
Is to decide the protein at the end of their heads
Is the same kind of protein.
This kind of protein is called Rho-GTPase.
It is called Rho.
This kind of protein is called Rho.
The most important question today is
This Rho-GTPase protein
Why does it have the same mechanism
To decide these two different results?
What kind of method
Can control it to grow one part or two parts?
Today, my speech will be divided into two parts.
One part is my theory
To discuss
This Rho-GTPase protein
How does it
From a state of uniformity in a cell
To a state of uniformity in a cell
How does this mechanism
Decide whether it grows one part or two parts?
This is the first part.
This part is mainly used for
Phenolphthalein and some other things.
The second part is
I want to start from the actual biological body
Actually, I'm using yeast.
To verify the knowledge I got from the previous theory
Whether some rules
Are applicable to this biological body.
So I'm going to divide it into two parts.
One part is very mathematical.
You'll see me shaking there.
But you'll see me showing the persimmon
And see my cat running.
The other part
You'll see the video of yeast.
So far, are there any questions?
I have one
Maybe I missed it.
I feel a little weird.
I think you're talking about
These bacteria have
Have consciousness
It can decide what it wants to do.
It's not a bacteria.
It's a cell.
Anyway, you know what I mean.
It decides where it grows.
Is it active?
Actually, it is.
For example, a yeast
There are two ways it grows.
But anyway
Yes, it is active.
The so-called active means
It's not random.
I know it's not random.
Because from the outside
It doesn't look like it's random.
I mean, it decides where it's going to grow.
For example
Let's say there's a plant today.
It's going to grow in the opposite direction of gravity.
Or grow in the direction of gravity.
And then you turn it 90 degrees.
It will find the direction of gravity again.
So it's actually
In the direction of gravity
It's passively deciding where it's going to grow.
Maybe in the middle is some very simple
Some underlying mechanisms of physics
It may not be a conscious process.
But if it's a cell
I can't imagine
It can decide
I want to put all the proteins in the same direction today.
And then it goes in the same direction.
OK
I think I'll answer a simple question first.
If your passive and active definition is like this
If it is
It's a very simple
Today there is a
There is a source of information.
And then it reacts to that source of information.
And then if this simple process is passive
That's right.
It's a passive mechanism.
This is the easy part.
But the hard part
It's not my major.
Maybe it's
So you think consciousness is
It's not a chemical reaction.
Or consciousness
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.
Consciousness is not a chemical reaction.
With some biological cells
The combination of reactions
It may also
The same pattern
It's the same as getting a message and then reacting.
It's just that this process is very simple.
Or it's a very difficult question.
That's right.
It's hard to answer that part of the question.
And then that part is what I can't answer.
But I think it's an interesting question.
But just the simple part
Yes, it is
You can use a set of message transmission systems
To
To react to external messages
For example, this serum
It's
It's going to be with another kind of
Gender serum
Then it will try to grow there.
The reason is that the other one will release pheromones.
Then it will grow there.
If you think this is passive
That's right. All the processes I talked about today are passive.
OK, thank you.
Are there any other questions?
If not, I'll go down.
Otherwise there is a question.
OK
So
Let me say first that I haven't been on any creatures.
So what I mean is that
It's not like a serum.
For example, you just said that there is a
Gender
Does the serum have a gender?
It's just that you said you want to match that example.
Someone releases pheromones
So this one will grow over there.
So what you mean is that
He can't decide for himself
Contact that
Sexuality
Is that right?
Is that what it means?
As long as someone releases pheromones, he will
not
It should be said
This is what we see.
That is to say, if you give him a group of serum today.
Then you put a group
So the gender of the serum
We will divide A and Alpha.
A and Alpha can be matched
That's it.
So if you put a group of A and a group of Alpha today.
If you mix them together
You can imagine it as a group of boys.
A group of girls all mixed together
At this time, some people will run to
Match with others
Some people will not match with others
Some people don't match
It's because they're in the wrong direction.
Some people are because they
It's not right at all
Pheromones
But
So this is a phenomenon
Is this his decision?
Or did he decide not to say that?
Because I would think
If this environment is for him
It's his mating that's more beneficial to him.
After this mating
After giving birth to a child
If you can adapt to the environment
Those who did not mate successfully
They are likely to be killed by the gods.
Then gradually
This group of cells that will react
So they are in the process of evolution
Learn to react to pheromones
Is this a proactive process?
I think it's a big question
This is how we understand the process
But how do you determine
Is this a conscious thing?
I think it's a big question
I just said I can't answer
OK, thank you
Are there any other questions?
Then I'll go down
it is good
In the past, there have been several studies
We gradually realized that
These
I just talked about
It creates a front and back
The principle of this polarity
Is a
This mechanism of our so-called Turing text
Turing
Everyone should have heard a little bit
Because there was a movie a while ago
It's called
The Mutation Game
The handsome guy in it
Is playing Alan Turing
So everyone should know who Alan Turing is
Everyone may know
He does computer
And he is
So-called mechanical consciousness
Contribution in this area
In fact, he is a super genius
I am studying this whole field
Biomathematics
Basically all
What is Turing text?
Before
Everyone has always had a doubt
For example, you see a tiger today
It has a pattern
You see a leopard, it has a pattern
You see some fish
It may have a pattern on it
The pattern becomes a pattern
These patterns
How did it come out?
How did these patterns come out?
If you say there is something
To control these patterns
That controls its thing
So you have to go forward
Then found
It seems
It seems to be in a certain step
That pattern will need
There is a way to self-release
From a completely uniform state
Pattern comes out
It does not need to be controlled at all
It will automatically grow a pattern
So everyone is very confused
What does this machine look like?
Alan Turing
First, with a very simple partial equation
This conclusion
He said
If this cell is good
Or a piece of land
If it has two chemical substances
One is activator
Then the other is substrate
One is
How to say activator?
Activator should be easy to understand
What it does is activate
The other thing is substrate
This is its value
What does activator do?
Once there is this activator
It will have a positive feedback
Then let more activators grow
Activator in the process of growing
It absorbs the value and becomes activator
For example
There may be an activator today
The process of its positive feedback
He went to catch another substrate
Then turn that substrate into activator
So in this process
Once activator grows
He will have a positive feedback
To make himself more and more
But at the same time
In this process
It will absorb the substrate
So the substrate will become less and less
If there is such a process
With activator
It spreads very slowly
Then substrate
If it spreads very quickly
In this way, it will
Such a system can make
Point
A whole piece
It can also make a strip
It can make a very interesting pattern
It can make a counterpoint
It can even make a piece
No substrate part
So the same system
As long as you give it different parameters
It can run
Different pattern results
So this is a very interesting thing
The picture on the right
Is that we took one
Entering its black and white photo
Then take the photo
Its brightness
That model will automatically
According to the brightness above
To run
Its pattern is all white
Or dot or semicolon
In short, this is a very cool thing
Everyone realized
It turns out that such a system
Can make a piece
Nothing
Run out of the pattern
That such a system
What does it have to do with the activator I just talked about?
The activator is probably like this
That is to say
Rho-GTPase
It is a protein
It has two forms
One is when it sticks to GTP
This form is activator
This form is active
It can guide the downstream
All biological reactions
To go to it
Then there is another form
It is a non-living form
It is Rho-GDP
It is Rho-GDPase
So this protein
It has a non-living form of GTP
Then it switches between these two forms
That
When the active Rho-GDP
It spreads very slowly
Then the active Rho-GDP
If it spreads very quickly
This becomes a
Healing mechanism
So actually in the cell
The way it works is like this
That is to say, we have a Rho-GDP
It is stuck on the cell membrane
Because it has a tail
It is stuck on the cell membrane
That
Once there is a Rho-GDP
It will try to
Turn other Rho-GDP
Into Rho-GDP
So everyone sees that the red arrow
Is a positive feedback
At the same time, it also has another form
Called Rho-GDP
I just told you that it is a living form
Its tail is wrapped
So it can be in the cell
Happy in the cell
It spreads quickly in the cell
There is an
Activator substrate system
It just happens to be its activator
It spreads very slowly
Then its substrate spreads very quickly
And its activator
It has a positive feedback
The way we model this thing
Is that we have a partial differential equation
That is to say
If we put the active form
Called U
The inactive form is called V
That
The change in time
Will determine
How fast it spreads
And its
I just put three arrows on it
To give it a reaction
At the same time
Its V
The change in time
It depends on how fast it spreads
And its chemical reaction
It's just a little bit special here
Because the reactor
That part
It's basically
If anything grows out of U
It must have disappeared from V
It can only be exchanged between V and U
So its
That term
It's positive and it's negative
What this means
Is that the whole system is qualitatively consistent
There is no term in here
It will automatically
Grow out of
Rho GDP
Or U
There is no term
Any particle
Disappears from the system
I have a question
Okay
That is
What is the unit of UV?
Is it density?
Or something like that
Yes, it should be
It should be concentration
But because it is
For example, the concentration on the entire cell membrane
So it is
It is the change in position and time
But it is concentration
So this is weird
There is a problem with this
I think your big D
U and big D
It's not a dimensionless value
That is to say
You are discussing
A
Rho GDP
With a Rho GDP
Interaction
Discuss with you once
Ten Rho GDP
With ten Rho GDP
It won't be the same
Because your big D is not dimensionless
Do you understand? It can't be multiplied by ten
Because it is not a value without units
I don't understand
Yes, I don't understand
I don't understand
So U and V are equal
You said concentration
It's actually a concept of density
For example, unit volume
At this time
At this time, at this position
Its density
Then DU and DV are the rate of expansion
For example, the unit may be
The unit should be
Every second
Then the molecule should be
For example, square meters or square meters
It should be similar to this concept
That is to say
DU and DV
Its concept should be
Every second it can
It should be one square meter per second
It should be like this
How much can it move outward every second
Is this outward expansion
OK, confirm
Yes, that's right
But like this
What did you just say
One U
One rho gdp
OK, good
You remove the big F first
Because don't worry about the big F
Both sides of this square
There is this small U or small V, right?
So the two of them
The units in this place
Will be the same
Then you put
What is the right side of the square?
Divided by two X
Then X is the unit of length
Then on the left
Divided by a T is the unit of time
So your unit of big D is actually
Distance per square unit time
Yes, yes
So the dimension on both sides
Is it right?
But the distance per square unit time
This value
In your change
You discussed
This whole distance
For example, the size of your change
Or you only look at one at a time
Or you only look at ten at a time
This value will keep running
It won't be unchanged
Unless you take data
Time also changes
But it won't
Because you take data
You keep looking at it every second
Keep looking
So your value will change
From that
From that
From you
OK, all the way to that
All the way to that
The unit of the expansion constant
I followed up
And then you said
So why does it
Why does it change
It's a fixed value
Then
You said why does it change
I really don't understand
Wait a minute
I'm the only one who doesn't understand
Is there anyone who can help me
Say
What does this mean
I think it sounds a bit strange
Because it
Yeah, I understand
It's a rate of expansion
The rate of expansion should be related to the environment
Instead of GDP or GDP
For example, you say the rate of expansion
Yeah
The rate of expansion has nothing to do with GDP or GDP
Yeah, if you look at this rate of expansion
It should be said that
On the cell membrane
The rate of expansion is a slower value
And then in the cell nucleus
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus
The rate of expansion in the cell nucleus
It's another faster value
But
But in
In different locations
Different time points
As long as it is
As long as it is on the cell membrane
The rate of expansion is the same
As long as it is in the cell nucleus
The rate of expansion is the same
Oh, okay, I know
I know how to ask
Then I change a question
This big D
Big D U or big D V
These two values
What does it have to do with
It's going to be with the nature of these two cells
What kind of cell is it?
Right?
Yeah
Is there anything else besides this?
It's basically the same
Theoretically, you should
Theoretically, when you write this governing equation
You should hope that these two
These two numbers are basically used to present
To some extent
It's just the relationship between this interaction
Right?
Just the two of them
But
If you do that
If one is a stone
Or one is protein
Obviously that D will be very different
I can't even write
So it is
Characterize the nature of your system
Or the nature of the unit in the system
But
It looks like your persimmon
It's still with
For example, you put these cells
It doesn't matter how much you cultivate
It looks weird
Wait, why?
I
I
It looks weird
I think I understand
Then I also know
I understand your question
I think I understand the question
But why
That D
I'm guessing what you mean
That D
I said Zhang Yiyong
You mean that D is not a constant
It's actually a variable, right?
It will change according to the unit you choose
Yeah, so why is this a problem?
I
I can know what that thing is
A system
It's a constant
Yeah, you set a system
It's a constant
Then you change a system
You change a constant
So why is this a problem?
Yeah
This is equivalent to
Your expansion equation
It's actually the same as the general heat transfer
The expansion equation is the same
It's exactly the same
Heat transfer coefficient is related to temperature
It changes with temperature
No matter what
It won't be a problem
So I don't understand
I don't understand what the problem is
My feeling is that
This thing is not
I won't say it's a problem
But I will say it's not enough
Not beautiful enough
Because it's actually
Yeah, it's actually a heat transfer
This is a matter of aesthetics
Because it's not enough
Generalize
I
Okay, I think I need to think about it
Okay, because I think we've been stuck for a long time
It will take up a lot of your time
I basically
I basically understand this equation
Because this is actually
Yeah
This is a
The heat diffusion equation
It's just an expansion equation
Then add the heat diffusion
Yeah
Then let's continue today
Thank you, I'm sorry
No
Yeah, so
So
That expansion constant
It's only two
One is
One is the expansion constant of U
It's on the film
So it's a
It's a slower value
But it's in
It's the same in different positions
Then
The expansion constant of V is faster
Bigger
Speaking of this, I suddenly thought of
You just said
Their quantity
Anyway, you just said that
Magnitude is called magnitude
So you don't need to add another
Magnitude equation
For example, the total number must be equal
and so on
No, because he himself
He himself
I'm writing it like this now
He's already perpendicular
The reason is that first of all
The expansion side
He'll just run to the side
He won't
He won't
He won't disappear, right?
So the expansion is already perpendicular
What about the part of the reaction?
Um
You are
V disappears
Because his V side
The reaction rate is
Negative f of uv
And then the reaction rate over there
Is f of uv
So anything
Disappear from V
He will use the same rate
Come out from U
So he will automatically say
Yes, I see
OK, thank you
Good
Good
What about this system
Basically
You will see that
Rho gtp
He's in
If he's anywhere
He has a little bit
More rho gtp
It will cause a positive feedback
And then it will suck a lot of
Substrate
And then it becomes
Just suck a lot of rho gtp
And then it becomes a lot of rho gtp
Gathered in that position
The problem is now rho g
At this time it causes a rho gtp vacuum
But in that cell
Part of it is
It doesn't seem to have
It's just rho gtp
The concentration is very low
But at this time
Because in the cell
Its expansion rate is very fast
So the vacuum of this concentration
It will be quickly
It's the rho gtp in other places
Once it's subtracted
It will be quickly sucked
To the cell membrane
So this mechanism
Will quickly put
The whole cell
Rho gtp
It's all gathered in the same cell membrane
The location of the cell membrane in the same area
Go up
That's basically the Turing mechanism
In my special example
More intuitive explanation
If I plot it directly
It will be like this
That is to say
You see here
The orange text you see here
The orange is
The x-axis is the location
Then the y-axis is
The y-axis is the concentration
Anyway, this mechanism
It will basically make you from
Random
It will automatically grow out of the message
All of these objects
Try to gather
Go to the same location
It will form a concentration peak
That's our understanding of the Turing system
That is to say
How long is this cell
It's three microns today
If I'm on three microns today
Model this system
It will grow out of a peak
But if I use six microns today
That one
It will grow out of two peaks
But we find
The next thing that happens is
These two peaks
There is a bit of competition between them
Because they are both
Absorbing the same pool value
So when a peak
It will grab another peak
It will absorb faster than the other
So it takes the other
Things in the peak
And so it
Although a Turing system
In theory, like the picture we just saw
It can grow a lot of dots
But in fact
In a system of quality conservation
If you grow a lot of dots
A lot of dots
They will compete with each other
In the end, there will only be one left
So in a quality conservation situation
It will definitely compete
Then the competition will decide
It only has one peak
We can understand it like this
You may have to believe me for this part
Just a peak
It absorbs
The ability to absorb these values
Actually determines
The concentration of the peak
It's basically the height of the peak
Determines its ability to absorb
Like the one on the right
The one on the right
It has a stronger ability to absorb
So if you look at its value
It will cause a bigger value vacuum
Then it will be more
The concentration of the cell is lower
At the same time, if you look at the small one
Because it has a poor ability to absorb
So it won't be so fast
Take all the cells under it
So the concentration of the cell under it
Is relatively high
At this time, it caused
At this time, it caused
There is a concentration in the cell
Because in the cell
Its expansion is very fast
At this time, the matter will be very fast
From the small peak on the left
Run to the right
Then this will happen
This kind of thing
Everyone runs over
Then it will be absorbed to the other side
This is probably why the two peaks
Will compete with each other
Rationale
In fact, we are in
In the real model
There is such a phenomenon
In fact, like me
Of course not only
One row gtp
One row gtp
Between it
There are other molecules involved
But basically the concept is the same
Everyone can still see
I helped him point out
Great
Basically everyone was here
See the positive feedback
It's not going to promote itself
Its own activation
It will catch a scaffold
Is a framework protein
That protein will stick
Another protein called GAP
But this GAP
Its role is
It is used to put
Row gtp
Becomes row gtp
So once there are so many
After row gtp
It will call out this green
And this yellow
Then this yellow
Will try to turn blue into yellow
So this
This itself is a positive feedback
So basically in the school we go
We can see
You can see
The thing I just modeled
In the school we go
We do see that
If you don't let that green
This protein emits light
Is that you will see the black part later
Is this green protein
Or you let this red protein
It is that row gtp
In the school it is called cc42
This protein emits light
You will see later
First it will grow out many points at once
But
This will compete between different points
And then there is only one point left
Everyone can see again
These two are the same cell
Different proteins
There are two
Then it becomes one
The following one is the same
Is
At first
There will be two points
Then these two points
Finally it becomes a point
Excuse me
So this competition
This is not a simulation
This is true
Yes, this is seen from the microscope
If you put that protein
If you connect a fluorescent protein
Then it will be recorded under the microscope
Record the light
Then
Yes, I am now black and white
So the place where the light is emitted is black
Hi, I have a problem again
I have been looking for trouble
My question is
Is the unit of time under this video a second?
It is a few seconds
A few minutes
So its unit of time is 45 seconds
So
This whole video is probably
What ten minutes or so
Yes, then it competes in this process
It will end in about three minutes
How much is the distance between the two points?
The diameter of the entire cell is about
5 micrometers
5 micrometers
10 to the minus 6 square meters
Is its diameter
So the distance between the two points is probably
2 micrometers
So generally this type of cell
In the spread
Speed
Will
In this ten minutes
Will be less than the distance between the two points
Otherwise, your F
The parameter should have time
It won't be
It won't be
Because you assume that
Interaction is infinite
It is
It reaches its effect every moment
Like this
That F inside
Is
The parameter of the reaction rate inside
There is time
That is
It will be in that F
How much per second
How much more can be generated per second
How much
The concentration of U
Just like this
That
The parameter in front has time
OK
I also have a question
That is
GTP will consume GDP
That consumption is
Will definitely
As long as there is GDP
It will definitely consume it
Or
It has a certain criteria
To a certain extent
Even if it has GDP around it
It doesn't care about it
No
We are
We didn't imagine
It has a threshold
That is
As long as it
That is
GTP will consume
If GTP will consume
If GTP will consume
If GTP will consume
Then
Then
Then I mean
This consumption is
There is actually one less
There is a arrow
For example, you can see
There are two arrows here
Right
So it is
For example, this one comes
This arrow
The rate is related to
The GDP is related
Then come back
The rate is related to
The GDP is related
So today if there is
Very little GDP
A lot
A lot of GDP
A lot of GDP
A lot of GDP
That
That this positive feedback run
That this positive feedback run
It will try to put the value
That is GDP
All become
That is
GTP
Right
Then but GDP
It is also going back
It will also run back
So it is a little bit
So it is a little bit
Depends on
The balance of the middle
Depends on
So
So GTP
So GTP
That pink one
There is also a chance to turn blue
It is not single
It is a
It is reversible
Right
I see
Thank you
I see
Right
So
In this complex
It is a two-way arrow
In the original simple
It is also a two-way arrow
It is also a two-way arrow
It can run on the model
It will fall back
It can run on the model
But because
Because
Because
Because if there are a lot of
If there are a lot of
RTDP
GTP
It will fall back
It will fall back
It will fall back
It is easy to be sucked

So
Let's
I found that it was actually a very simple thing to
simply increase the length of the cell.
That is if
it is a
very long period of time.
OK.
So why is it like this?
Let me confirm a little bit.
If my understanding is correct,
they should still be
competing with each other,
but that is an equilibrium.
Is that what you mean?
Of course they are competing with each other.
Yes, they are actually
still competing with each other.
But the speed of the competition
becomes very, very slow.
It's very fast at the beginning,
but I don't know why
the competition becomes very slow later.
If my understanding is correct,
according to the expansion formula,
because the blue turns red
and the red turns blue
are two-way,
so if your distance is long enough,
if they each reach
the local balance,
then they will not compete
with each other
in the end.
Because...
Yes, that's what I mean.
It should be like this, right?
Yes, it should be like this.
Yes, I guessed it myself.
I just want to make sure.
But according to
what we said earlier,
if there are two peaks
over there,
they should compete with each other in the end.
Yes, they do.
The locals have reached
an equilibrium.
That is to say,
you will see that
there is a small peak up there.
There will be a small
concentration line.
There will be a place
that is more R.
So this value
and its activator
are balanced.
And this side is also balanced.
But under this balance,
the concentration here will be higher.
Under this balance,
the concentration here will be lower,
resulting in
it still competing in the end.
Theoretically,
this mechanism
should still be possible
no matter how long it is.
But if it looks like
if the distance is long enough,
the blue line
will have an angle,
so it will lead to
flow from the high place
to the low place.
But at the same time,
the orange line
will return
to the blue.
So it is very likely
that the orange line
will become blue
faster than
the blue high place
to the low place.
In this way,
they will reach
a balance between each other.
If the distance is long enough.
But because in this system,
its blue...
Sorry.
Because in this system,
its blue spreads super fast.
And its red
spreads very, very slowly.
So it turns out that
the effect of the blue spread
is far greater than the red.
Should I say that?
OK.
Then,
in theory,
it should run like this.
Yes, in theory,
it should compete.
Then wait for me.
It seems that someone
wants to come to the grassland
and want to enter our house.
Wait for me.
Sorry.
Pervert.
Ask them to come in
and listen to the speech.
He is not here now.
He can't hear it, right?
They have their own speech.
They are going to talk about that today.
They just said
they are going to talk about Maya culture.
And there is food to eat outside.
Why do you think
they will come in?
Speaking of this,
I would like to discuss
a topic with you.
Now,
the budget of
Taira
can actually explode.
There is food.
Because
we are now
writing a grant
with the Ministry of Education.
It can be written up to 400 yuan at most,
but it must be reported in time.
We only buy this city now,
so it actually took
more than 100 yuan
and less than 200 yuan.
And
if you want,
What?
He should be talking to
people outside the door.
Don't mind him.
OK.
I will finish it quickly.
Wait for me.
We are discussing another thing.
So if you want,
every time you open Taira,
you can buy some donuts.
In fact,
you can
send me some votes.
Then I will transfer
the money to you.
Then those votes can be used
to pay for education.
This is the account of our project.
Then everyone can
save some money.
Every time you have a meeting,
you can buy some donuts.
Think about it.
If you are interested,
we can discuss it later.
Sorry.
You can continue.
Sorry.
I went to find someone else.
Yes.
Yes.
Where was I?
We were talking about
an equilibrium here.
If the distance is too long,
it should be said
that if the distance is too long,
why is there an equilibrium?
Actually, I don't understand.
But OK.
Let's leave it alone.
Because now I think
it may be difficult to explain
why there is no equilibrium.
But
in fact, we can
directly from
this is called
stability analysis.
That is to say,
if I look at
two peaks
of the same height today,
and then look at
this peak solution
if there is stability in math,
I will find that
it will actually
never be unstable.
It will always be competitive.
This is already
that
this is what we
directly use math to prove
that it will be competitive.
This thing
is just that in this kind of speech,
I usually don't put
that math
out.
So I hope you can
believe me first
that they will definitely
compete in this matter.
OK.
But I know this is a
bit too much.
It becomes that
everyone has to believe me.
But anyway.
Yes.
Then it becomes that
this is very strange now.
In the end,
if it is already
proven that
it will definitely compete,
then in the end
it is
in the end
why their competition
will become so slow.
Later I found
that it was like this.
That is to say,
because at first
we guessed the distance
because it was obvious
that we would
just make the distance longer.
So we guessed the distance at first.
Then I spent about
half a year on
guessing the distance.
I found out later
that it was not the distance.
In fact,
the biggest impact
is the protein content
inside.
Today we said
that if we
model this system
that is to say
today if it is
a small cell
and a big cell
then we assume
that the protein content
of the cell
at the beginning
is the same.
Then when I make
the cell longer
at the same time
I also added
all the protein content.
So if
this is the first thing.
The second thing
is more trivial.
The second thing
is that
we suddenly found
this thing.
If there was
a peak
inside
you kept
guessing
the protein content
of the cell.
The mouse is gone.
If the protein content
becomes more
the peak
will increase.
It will become
more concentrated.
But when it
increases to a certain extent
it no longer increases.
It only increases horizontally.
The horizontal increase
means that
there is actually
a boundary
that you can't
exceed.
You can't grow
higher than it.
The reason for
this boundary
is because
if you are
more familiar
with this system
you will realize
that this is
a bi-stable
reaction.
That is to say
the concentration of U
at the highest point
is stable
and at the lowest
point
is stable.
So if it
reaches that point
it will return
and stop at that point.
The nature
of bi-stability
comes from
the fact that
every time there is
a peak
it will
cause a
value vacuum.
The higher the peak
the more
serious
the value vacuum
will be.
But it can't
become more serious
because it can't
become negative.
So it will
stop at a point
and limit
that you can't
stop
at that point.
That's the
basic concept.
If we look at
this from a
mathematical point of view
if we plot
f of u, v
let's say
f of u, v
is a u squared
minus b u squared
it is
as far as
I know
as far as I know
the simplest
way to make
this system
polarize
is
a and b
are both
a function
of time
and u and
v are
densities.
If this
is the
reaction
it will
look like
a green curve.
At first glance
it looks
wrong.
It is a
two-dimensional
curve.
Why does it
look like
a three-dimensional
curve?
It is
because
in
steady-state
how do you
say
in steady-state
d u
d t
is
a
function
of
time
and
u.
If you
add
these two
things
the f of
u, v
will
disappear.
If the
f of
u, v
disappears
you will
get this
if you
multiply
x
by
two
times.
