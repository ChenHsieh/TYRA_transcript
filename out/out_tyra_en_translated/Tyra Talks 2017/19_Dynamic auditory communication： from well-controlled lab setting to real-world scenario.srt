1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,500
So after I graduated from university, I think I did an RA, if I remember correctly, at Professor Chen's place, right?

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
I did it for a year or two

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
After that, I went to Canada's McMaster to study for my PhD

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,500
When I was studying for my PhD, one of the tutors was Dr. Trenner

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,500
He was doing a course on music perception and intuition

6
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:55,500
If you're interested, you can ask him why he chose to do music

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
or intuition and cognition

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I don't know much about intuition, but my impression is that

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
doing visual psychology takes up a large portion of the work

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
So why did I decide to do intuition? I think it's interesting

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I don't know, it's just my guess

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Yongyi has a website, you can go check it out, it's really scary

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
The publications are as long as ghosts

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Other than the publications, there's also awards and media coverage

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
I think that's really cool

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I hope one day I can tell my parents that I'm a journalist

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Without further ado, let's welcome Yongyi to share his research with us

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,500
I'll turn off my mic so you can hear me

19
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Can you hear me now?

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I think it's okay

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm a little shy

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
I don't even know if I have to give a score

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Today is July 8th, I'm guessing my highest score is 87

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I can't go any higher

25
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
That's about it

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
I can predict the results

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,500
You have to turn on the audio so you can hear the laughter

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't think there's any feedback

29
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
I think we need feedback

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Forget it

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
It's pretty funny

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I'm being encouraged, I'm indeed a person who studies truth psychology

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
It's different

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I'm probably just making things up

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm not really interested in hearing

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
There's no deep reason

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
First of all, I'm very interested in music

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I only found out later that most people do visual research

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Most people talk about intuition

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
It's directly implied that it's visual research

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
I only found out later

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
If you're doing hearing research

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
You have to say it's particularly famous for auditory

44
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Otherwise people will get it wrong

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
It's pretty interesting

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I think there are some phenomena in hearing

47
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
It's different when it comes to other senses

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
There are some special problems to deal with

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I think that's what makes hearing interesting

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
It's a special place

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay, let's get into my presentation

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I'm going to start studying how to share my screen

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Okay, while you're studying

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Let me tell you

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Just in case there's feedback

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Let me turn off the microphone

57
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
If you have anything you want to say

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
You can type it in

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
You can also speak

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Okay

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Okay

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Let's go

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Okay

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,500
My PhD research topic is

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
It's very vague

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Dynamic Auditory Communication

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
It's vague

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
It's about how to change your hearing

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
In a dynamic situation

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
How to change your hearing

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
In a dynamic situation

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
This includes

73
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
For example, you're listening to me now

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
All my voices change at any time

75
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
For example, every time I make a sound

76
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
There's a millisecond

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
And then it disappears

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Or listening to music

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
It's kind of like that

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
And then

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
And what I want to share today is

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
My experiment

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
From a traditional laboratory

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Psychological laboratory

85
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
And then do it

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
More complicated

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
We think it's closer to the real

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Interaction

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Under the environment of human interaction

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
That is

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
From a small laboratory to a large laboratory

92
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Between each other

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
There are some research methods

94
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Needs to be adjusted

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
And then I just want to explain today

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Take our research as an example

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
How do we do this

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
So my sub-topic is

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
How do psychologists do research

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
And there is a step-by-step explanation

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Explain

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
What are the problems we encounter

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
And then

104
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
We think

105
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
In our situation

106
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
How do we solve it

107
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
And then

108
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
By the way

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Just

110
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Just

111
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Please help everyone

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
The place is

113
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
September

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Taiwan's Science and Music Magazine

115
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
There will be a

116
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
A special special issue of music psychology

117
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
And then

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I want to put this

119
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Related research

120
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
It's a draft

121
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Go over there

122
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
As a

123
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
A small topic

124
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Just share it

125
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Just as a science book

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Share it to readers in Taiwan

127
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Then I didn't write it myself

128
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
The experience of doing a science book article

129
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Then if I hope

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
That is to say

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
I hope to make today's speech

132
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Into different fields

133
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
People interested in science

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Can probably

135
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Psychologists

136
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
How do we do research

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Especially in

138
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
How do we do research

139
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
In such a special situation

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
If you think

141
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
On the content

142
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Or how to explain

143
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
How can it be adjusted better

144
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,500
That is

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I hope you can tell me

146
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Then

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I will

148
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
I'm going to take the exam in two weeks

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
So thank you very much

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
If there is any help

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
OK

152
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
it is good

153
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
The nonsense should be over

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
First of all, I want to say

155
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Hearing has many domains

156
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Like for example

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
You can know if the pitch is high or low

158
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
What I want to focus on today is

159
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Focus on time

160
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
For hearing

161
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Is a very important thing

162
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
In fact, time is for many senses

163
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
And the reaction is very important

164
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
For hearing

165
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I think it is especially critical

166
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Why

167
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
If you record my voice

168
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Then take it to

169
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
In the software of the computer

170
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Open it

171
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Look at its radio

172
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Its radio

173
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
It looks like

174
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Almost like this

175
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Then you can of course

176
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Decode

177
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
That is to say

178
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
What is my voice

179
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
Then

180
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Our hearing is

181
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
We have to put it together

182
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
To become a meaningful sentence

183
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Ah

184
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
But it's hard for hearing

185
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
That is to say

186
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Every message

187
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
The time it appears is so short

188
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
And

189
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
It won't appear again

190
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Ah

191
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Human beings have lived for so long

192
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
History

193
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
The history of human communication

194
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Before the recorder was invented

195
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
We have no chance

196
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Listen again

197
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
What happened before

198
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
How is it

199
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
So human hearing

200
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
A big problem

201
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
That is to say

202
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
We have to be able to catch it quickly

203
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Ah

204
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
This message is displayed at any time

205
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
And then accurately

206
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Awareness

207
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Feel it accurately

208
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
The content of this

209
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Then

210
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
And another

211
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
More demanding is

212
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
That is

213
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
We are not just aware of this

214
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And we have to

215
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Make a quick response

216
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
For example

217
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
When you have a conversation with others

218
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
What are you hearing

219
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
You will be able to understand immediately

220
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Then immediately

221
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Be able to react

222
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Then this skill

223
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
When quarreling

224
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
It's particularly important

225
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Because if you slow down

226
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
If you slow down

227
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You lost the quarrel

228
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
It's very

229
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It's important to speak

230
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Right

231
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
So you see

232
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Human beings are like this

233
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
No, I'm kidding

234
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
That

235
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Not only in conversation

236
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
In another situation

237
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
For example, you are listening to music

238
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Ah

239
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And for example, you are with

240
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
You sing with others

241
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Ah

242
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Sing together

243
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
That

244
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I can't just listen to other people's music

245
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Listen to this

246
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm going to

247
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Sing my part

248
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Because you are like this

249
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
No matter how fast your processing speed is

250
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
There must be a time difference inside

251
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
That

252
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Ah

253
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
So

254
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
In fact, in many cases of hearing

255
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
We think it is

256
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
He keeps

257
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Keep predicting

258
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
What's going to happen next

259
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Then let people

260
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Always

261
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Let your intuition

262
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Let your nervous response

263
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Always in a

264
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
In a well-prepared situation

265
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Then you can

266
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Precise intuition to this matter

267
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
And then

268
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Quickly prepared

269
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
To make the next reaction

270
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
So I think hearing is on time

271
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Ah

272
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
In fact, compared to other sensory domains

273
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Is

274
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
More demanding

275
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
This is

276
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
My task

277
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
So I think time is very important to hearing

278
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Ok

279
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
If you have any questions

280
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
You can interrupt me in the middle

281
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Then if there is no problem

282
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I will continue

283
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Then

284
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
By the way because I

285
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Now

286
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I share the screen

287
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
So if everyone

288
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
If you leave a message in the chat

289
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I should not be able to see it now

290
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
So everyone can

291
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Just turn on the microphone

292
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
It has nothing to do with me

293
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Ok

294
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Ah

295
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I have a question

296
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Ok

297
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Please say

298
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
The

299
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
The M-I-N-G-E-R above the waveform

300
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
What is that?

301
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh, that's just an example I found on the Internet

302
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I don't know what that is

303
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Sorry

304
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Ok

305
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Ok, thank you

306
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
It should be a project title

307
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Yes

308
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
It looks like this

309
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
But I don't know

310
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I haven't searched either

311
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Alright

312
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Maybe it's doing something

313
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Voice

314
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Voice of the computer

315
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Some of the projects handled by the visual

316
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I don't know

317
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Sorry

318
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Then I will talk about it first

319
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
In traditional psychology and neuroscience

320
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
How do we do this kind of research in the lab

321
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
If we want to know

322
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
What is the importance of time for hearing

323
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
How do we do research

324
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
For example

325
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
I

326
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I will

327
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Design a series of hearing with a computer

328
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
A series of hearing that opens at any time

329
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Then for example

330
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Then for example

331
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I can

332
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
A kind of audio file

333
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
I put it

334
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Every note

335
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Bop, bop, bop

336
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
All time

337
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Every bop, bop, bop

338
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Between each tone

339
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Its time is fixed

340
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The same length

341
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
For example, it's 500 milliseconds

342
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
So this way you

343
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
It sounds like a decoder

344
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

345
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Then you can keep going

346
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
So this

347
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
This is a very regular time

348
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Then you can have a

349
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
An irregular time

350
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
For example, it's

351
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Between your pain and pain

352
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Can be

353
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
For example

354
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Random 250 milliseconds

355
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Between 750 milliseconds

356
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
So it might sound like this

357
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

358
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Just

359
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
You don't know at all

360
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
You

361
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
When will the next pain appear

362
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
And then

363
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
In this different

364
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Under the circumstances

365
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
We can

366
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Require the audience to do some

367
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Intuitive answer

368
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
For example, we can make

369
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Some of them have sounds

370
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Most of these sounds

371
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Most of them are exactly the same

372
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
There are some sounds

373
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Maybe we'll just make it

374
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
It's a little bit higher or a little bit lower

375
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
We're on the frequency domain

376
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
To make some adjustments

377
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
And then the audience

378
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Just

379
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
To participate in the experiment

380
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
The college student has to listen to that sound

381
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
If he hears a higher pitch

382
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
He'll press a button

383
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
If you hear a lower pitch

384
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Just press a button

385
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
It sounds like

386
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

387
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

388
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

389
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
You have to listen to the higher pitch

390
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
You have to react

391
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
And then the other

392
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

393
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
You can also do this kind of manipulation

394
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
And then we can go and see

395
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
For example

396
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Under the circumstances of regular time

397
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
The correct rate of his answer

398
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
It's going to be higher

399
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Under the circumstances of irregular time

400
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Then we can

401
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Psychologists usually say

402
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Oh, that's the regular time

403
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
It can help you

404
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Have a better sense

405
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Because you're better

406
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Because your accuracy is higher

407
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
You can have a more accurate answer

408
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
In this case

409
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
We can also do some

410
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Neuroscientific measurements

411
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
For example, I can measure people's brainwaves

412
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
This is a memory map

413
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
It's because of the nervous response of the brain

414
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
The nervous response of the brain

415
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
It's all about the nerve

416
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
It's all about the neurotransmitter

417
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
To do the reaction

418
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Then we can put those

419
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
For example, the ECG map

420
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Or the sensors for measuring muscle position

421
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
We'll put it on the scalp

422
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
That's because of the nerve response

423
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
It's going to be that wave signal

424
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
It's going to come out

425
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
So we can put it on the surface of the scalp

426
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Record this signal

427
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
That's what we call it

428
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
The signal of the brainwaves

429
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Then we can do some corresponding analysis

430
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
We can see that the brainwaves are

431
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
How to capture the regularity of this time

432
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
And then for example

433
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Let's do some complicated processing

434
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
And then we'll get

435
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Something like this

436
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
The answer is

437
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
We'll find out, for example

438
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The brainwave

439
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
It's going to adjust the speed of its vibration

440
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
It's the same as the external stimulus

441
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
And then we just have to catch this

442
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
In the brain

443
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Imagine the nerve in the brain

444
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
It's like a decoder

445
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
It's going to be able to accurately capture

446
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
How to produce the next second

447
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
That's the traditional neuroscience

448
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Or psychologically

449
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
We're going to do this

450
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
A study of orientation

451
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
But this study is actually quite

452
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
OK, please go ahead

453
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
That's your time

454
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
That's the frequency

455
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
That cycle

456
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
How short can it be

457
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
You mean the cycle of my voice

458
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Or the cycle of the brainwaves

459
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
The cycle of the voice

460
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
And then there's the brainwaves

461
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
You're going to adjust it

462
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
If it's the same as your external

463
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Does it have a limit

464
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
This is a good question

465
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Usually humans can catch the beat

466
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
The shortest is the shortest between pain and pain

467
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's 200 milliseconds

468
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
I can't sing so fast

469
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
It's about the same speed

470
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
More than 200 milliseconds

471
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
You probably think

472
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
It's almost a continuous sound

473
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
That's the slowest

474
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
It's the longest between pain and pain

475
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It can be as long as 1,200 milliseconds

476
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
1.2 seconds

477
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
After that

478
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
You'll feel like every sound is independent

479
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You don't think it's a continuous rhythm

480
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
You just can't

481
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Know the pattern

482
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
What's interesting is that the brainwaves

483
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Can only catch up

484
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Such a speed range

485
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
It's slower than this

486
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Or faster than this

487
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
There's no way

488
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
As for what causes what

489
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't know

490
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
It's because the brain can't move so fast

491
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Move so slow

492
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
To make us instinctively

493
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Can't catch up so fast

494
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Such a slow speed

495
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I don't know

496
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I can only say

497
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
This is what we have now

498
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Thank you

499
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Hello

500
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
So I'd like to ask

501
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
When you do this experiment

502
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Do you have to eliminate

503
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Other noise interference?

504
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
That's right

505
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
We do this kind of experiment

506
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Because we want to be clean

507
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
So we do it in the soundproof room

508
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
And then we'll use headphones

509
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
That is, we'll use those

510
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
More special headphones

511
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Just send the sound

512
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Into the ear

513
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
And it's very close

514
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
The more inside, the better

515
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
And then the sound is transmitted

516
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
It's all very clean

517
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I just want to reduce

518
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
External interference

519
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
That's right

520
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
So when you say

521
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
The so-called hearing

522
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
It means

523
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Human beings

524
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
We can really

525
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
The sound we hear

526
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Or include that

527
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Include that

528
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
The frequency we can't hear

529
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
It's also in the hearing

530
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
For example, ultrasonic waves or

531
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Very low frequency

532
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
That kind

533
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
That kind of hearing

534
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
That kind

535
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
That's what you're asking

536
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
That is to say

537
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Physical stimulation

538
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Does it stimulate psychological feelings?

539
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
That's what we say

540
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Will ask questions like this

541
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Of course

542
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Of course there are people

543
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Study such a question

544
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
That is to say

545
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Where is the limit of human hearing?

546
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Then you can see

547
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Where is the limit of frequency?

548
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
But this is not me

549
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Today

550
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Is the main part of the discussion

551
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Maybe we'll wait

552
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Discuss again later

553
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Like this

554
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I don't know if it's like this

555
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Or just

556
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
You can discuss it casually

557
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
No no no

558
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Because of me

559
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm more curious

560
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
When you say you want to eradicate

561
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
That interference

562
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
When noise interference

563
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
That's how you eradicate that kind

564
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
We don't know at all

565
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
The kind of interference we hear

566
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
For example, like ultrasonic waves

567
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
You are in that

568
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
What is that called

569
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
There is no noise at all

570
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
That kind of interference

571
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
In that kind of experimental environment

572
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
You can't guarantee

573
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
He won't be affected by the outside world

574
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
OK OK OK

575
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Then I know

576
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Of course we

577
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
What we do is

578
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
We already know

579
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Human hearing frequency range

580
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
It's about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz

581
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
In the frequency range of this Hz

582
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
We

583
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
In fact, in the experimental environment

584
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Can still measure

585
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
In the case of measurement

586
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
We will make a comparison

587
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
As for ultrasonic waves

588
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
We generally think it's human

589
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Physically, you can't hear it

590
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
So

591
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
So we don't care about his control

592
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
So for example

593
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
There is an ultrasonic wave in the lab

594
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
The sound of the ultrasonic wave

595
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Or that kind of very, very, very high frequency

596
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
We don't care

597
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
So it's based on an assumption

598
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Those things won't cause

599
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
It won't cause too much interference to humans

600
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Yes, it really won't

601
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
And the other thing is

602
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
In the case of our experiments

603
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
We don't say

604
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
One condition is to make a trial

605
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Of course we will do hundreds of trials

606
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Thousands of trials

607
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Even if there is an effect

608
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
As long as it is with your experiment

609
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
The program set by the computer

610
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
If it's not related to each other

611
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Then the effect we observe

612
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
These external effects

613
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It should be reduced a lot

614
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
OK, thank you

615
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Then

616
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Hey, copy it

617
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
That is to say

618
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
What about this POP process

619
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Of course you can decide for yourself

620
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
See if you want to say

621
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
To accept the middle question

622
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
Or ask at the end

623
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Or open the discussion directly

624
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,500
You can decide

625
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Then but

626
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
That is

627
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
We

628
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
The prediction is that you can

629
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
You can talk for about an hour

630
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
And then

631
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
There will probably be a 20-minute discussion

632
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Ah

633
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
That's it

634
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
As for you

635
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Cut it in half

636
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Or mixed together

637
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
How do you decide

638
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Just decide for yourself

639
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
OK OK OK

640
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
OK

641
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Let me tell you first

642
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I actually didn't prepare a lot of POP

643
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I only prepared about 18 pages

644
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
So

645
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
So the topic part will be finished in a moment

646
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
if

647
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Um

648
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Some related topics

649
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Of course I'm sorry

650
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I just didn't know

651
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
What's your problem

652
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
If it's related to listening or other music

653
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
We can wait until then to discuss

654
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
If this is related to the topic I'm talking about

655
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Of course we'll put it up

656
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Discussed at the scene

657
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Sorry I just didn't know

658
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Your question

659
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
With this

660
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
What I'm talking about now

661
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
What are the links

662
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
OK

663
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
OK

664
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
That

665
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
But

666
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
OK, I'll keep going

667
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I think the biggest problem in doing laboratory research

668
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
That is to say

669
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
If we want to understand

670
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
Between people

671
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
How to use it normally

672
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
For example, interact with listening messages

673
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
But in fact, the time law and the time law

674
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
These two messages

675
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
I experiment

676
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I make this kind of message in the computer

677
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
It doesn't exist in the natural world

678
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
You naturally

679
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
You won't hear one

680
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
It's as accurate as a decoder

681
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You won't hear one

682
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
It's a completely random message

683
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
You usually hear

684
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
A little regular

685
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
But there is no such regular message

686
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
If I do research like this

687
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
In the end for understanding

688
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
My human

689
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
What is the real ability to help

690
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
In fact, sometimes it is a bit biased

691
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
So

692
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
In fact, there is a very interesting paper

693
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Just released recently

694
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
It's called Neuroscience Needs Behavior

695
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
If you are related

696
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Philosophy

697
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
If you are interested in scientific philosophy

698
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I highly recommend this paper

699
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Then I will use it first

700
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
A few pictures inside

701
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
To talk about

702
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
This research

703
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
The limitations of laboratory research

704
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Generally, we want to know

705
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Research can be said

706
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
For example, the neural pattern of the human brain

707
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
What is the relationship between natural behavior

708
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Then you can take the neural pattern

709
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
As

710
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
For example, the psychological journey

711
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Psychological journey

712
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Psychological inner journey

713
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
This is what we want to know

714
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
That one

715
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
A better designed ideal experiment is

716
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
We can control

717
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
We know which part of the psychological journey

718
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Or neural reaction

719
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Corresponding to some of our natural behaviors

720
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
We can have one-to-one

721
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Is a one-to-one correspondence

722
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Or a simpler correspondence

723
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
But like the experiment we just did

724
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
In fact, the experiment just now

725
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Is the experiment I did

726
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I did it myself

727
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Um

728
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
We

729
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
I actually designed an experiment

730
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Human

731
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
In general

732
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
A situation that would not happen at all

733
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Then we are studying his neural reaction

734
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Although we can know

735
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
The relationship between these

736
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
But we can't answer directly

737
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
What is human nature

738
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
How

739
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
We can't answer

740
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Human natural reaction

741
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
So what we know is that some humans

742
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Supernormal ability

743
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
It's beyond his usual ability

744
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
but

745
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Our main research topic

746
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
In fact, there is no direct understanding

747
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
This is what I think the lab is studying

748
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Some big limitations

749
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Especially in other areas

750
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
There is such a situation

751
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
For example

752
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
If you want to manipulate social interaction

753
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
You are in a very small lab

754
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Basically can't do this

755
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Because our lab

756
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
It basically looks like this

757
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Just one person

758
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Sitting in a small partition

759
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Because we have to

760
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Like I just said

761
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Must control all external stimuli

762
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
So

763
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Usually just sit in there alone

764
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
In a very quiet situation

765
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Interact with the computer

766
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
And at the same time because

767
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Uh

768
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
The relationship between our measuring tools

769
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
For example, that

770
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Uh that

771
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
That side brain wave

772
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
That line

773
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Long-term relationship

774
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
He can only sit there

775
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
He can't do anything

776
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
He can only use two fingers

777
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Do the reaction

778
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
So this is actually

779
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
It's a very unnatural situation

780
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
That's some

781
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Traditional lab environment

782
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Some restrictions given

783
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
OK

784
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
And here

785
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Everyone agrees

786
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
In fact, there are quite a lot of restrictions

787
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Then I

788
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
What I want to say is

789
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Then we

790
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
In our lab

791
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
How do we try to go

792
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Uh

793
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Extend to solve such a barrier

794
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Uh

795
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
What I want to say first is

796
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Music

797
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
It can be a good research tool

798
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
It can be a research tool

799
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
As a

800
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Uh

801
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
To help study human mind activity

802
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
And neural reaction

803
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
He

804
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Uh

805
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
There are some good ways

806
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
For example

807
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
I can keep

808
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
There is a good experiment

809
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
For example

810
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I today

811
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
For example, look at this A picture on the left

812
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
I can ask the subject

813
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Ask someone to come in

814
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Then I'll give him a recorder

815
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I asked him

816
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Press the key of the piano

817
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Then the speed of pressing is exactly the same as the recorder

818
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
That's a good one

819
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
A control experiment

820
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
And then

821
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I can put this

822
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
The conditions I control are getting more and more relaxed

823
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,500
For example

824
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
I can ask the computer to produce a recorder

825
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
But this recorder is

826
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
As you press the key

827
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Then he will go

828
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Follow your speed

829
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
To change his own rhythm

830
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Uh

831
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Or you can say

832
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Let two people play together

833
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Multiple people play

834
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Even when there are multiple people playing

835
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
You and the audience

836
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Listening at the same time

837
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
That

838
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Moving more and more to the right side of the spectrum

839
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
That's what we're talking about

840
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Ecological interaction

841
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Ecological validity

842
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
That is to say, what you are studying

843
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Is able to correspond to human beings

844
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
In the case of real life

845
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
The right side is

846
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
We feel

847
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
More like real life

848
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Because when you play music

849
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
You will also have an audience listening

850
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
This can be understood

851
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
But on the right side of the spectrum

852
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
In fact, your time control

853
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
It's getting worse and worse

854
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
For example, when a group of people play music

855
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
If they decide together

856
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Speed up or slow down

857
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
What do you want

858
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
This is not for you

859
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
The experimenter can decide in advance

860
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
The information you get in the end

861
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
It will be difficult for you to explain

862
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
That music

863
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Can be a good tool

864
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Just because he can

865
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Get some kind of balance in the middle

866
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
For example, when the two of them interact

867
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
They may not be random

868
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Play the music they want

869
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
I can give him

870
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
Uh, music score

871
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Uh, ask them to play the music score

872
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
And if they have

873
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
If you play the music score

874
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
If they play something wrong

875
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
In fact, we can

876
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Record afterwards

877
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
To find out about this

878
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
So we can know

879
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
What did he do wrong

880
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I also know

881
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
What is the correct answer

882
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
And we can set

883
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
That is to say

884
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
What is the rhythm he wants to play

885
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
So we still have some control

886
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
But even under these conditions

887
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Their activities

888
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Still very close

889
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
An activity of human real behavior

890
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
So we think music can be

891
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
A good tool to study

892
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Uh, uh, human interaction

893
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
That is, hearing communication

894
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
And it can be balanced

895
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
That is, experimental control

896
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
And ecological efficiency

897
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
These two big questions

898
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
And another advantage of music is

899
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Say

900
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Uh

901
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
You said music is a good research tool

902
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
The reason is

903
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
It sounds like it's because he can be

904
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
That is, he can have this

905
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
From experimental control

906
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
To ecological interaction

907
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
The whole spectrum

908
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
But then you think

909
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
What kind of research tool

910
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
There is no such feature

911
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Uh

912
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
What kind of research tool

913
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Language

914
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Isn't that right

915
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Language

916
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Language also has

917
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Yeah

918
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
So I think I don't really understand

919
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
That's why he's a special

920
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Good research tool

921
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I didn't say he was particularly good

922
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
I said he could be a good research tool

923
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
OK

924
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Good

925
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
So did I get it right this time

926
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
What you mean is

927
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
He can span the whole spectrum

928
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
He can be a

929
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
He can span the whole spectrum

930
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
That language is of course

931
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
You can communicate with the computer

932
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Language

933
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Or the language between people

934
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Communicate with others

935
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Yes, language is also a good research tool

936
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
My language

937
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
There is a difficulty in neuroscience

938
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Because when you want to speak

939
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Mouth to move

940
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
And then actually

941
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
It's a bit difficult to measure the signal

942
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Of course, this is an externalization

943
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
But I think language is also a

944
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Uh, it's a pretty good tool

945
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Okay, got it

946
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I didn't say music is the best

947
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
I just said he was one of them

948
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
And then

949
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
And the other good thing about music is

950
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
He

951
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Even if it's a special event

952
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
But actually in each

953
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
There are music activities in all cultures

954
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
And humans actually

955
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Spend a lot of resources

956
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
In music activities

957
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
A lot of time and resources

958
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
In music activities

959
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
So, uh, we think

960
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Research on music activities

961
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
In fact, it can also be

962
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Uh, it's a reflection of a human being

963
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
A very basic behavior

964
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,500
With a capability

965
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
OK

966
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
So

967
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
So you say music is a good research tool

968
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
It means

969
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
For example, you want to measure his brain

970
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
How does the brain work

971
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
You just play music for them

972
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Is it similar to this

973
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Is this a research method

974
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Uh, play music for them

975
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Or let them

976
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Let them play music

977
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
So that means

978
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
You can have a

979
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
A spectrum

980
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
You can go from the far left

981
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Play music for them

982
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I've already designed this music in advance

983
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
It extends all the way to the far right

984
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
For example, you can

985
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Interact with the music

986
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
For example, if you want to listen to karaoke

987
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
OK

988
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Or if there's no music

989
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
It's just two people playing music together

990
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Oh, good

991
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I have a question

992
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
OK

993
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I have a simple question

994
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
It's like this

995
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Uh, because it says here

996
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
We may start from here

997
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
More and more

998
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
More and more about music

999
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
As a research tool

1000
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
This thing

1001
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
So I want to clarify

1002
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
A simple question

1003
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
That is

1004
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
What we are discussing now is

1005
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Sound is a good research tool

1006
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Or music is a certain kind

1007
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
There is a specific

1008
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Subset

1009
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
In the sound thing

1010
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Or do we have to discuss

1011
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Sound is a research tool

1012
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Uh

1013
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I would say it's music

1014
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Because

1015
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Um

1016
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
If I talk about sound

1017
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
It's just a definition

1018
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Because

1019
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Because of the sound

1020
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Um

1021
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Can you talk about your question again

1022
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Yeah, so my question is actually

1023
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
You're talking about music

1024
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
A good research tool

1025
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
What kind of sound

1026
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Don't you think it's

1027
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
You want to use it as

1028
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
The definition of music

1029
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
Research tool

1030
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Oh, I understand

1031
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Oh, um

1032
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Yeah

1033
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Uh

1034
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I forgot to say that

1035
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
In fact, in traditional

1036
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Research on hearing

1037
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
We will use

1038
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Computer synthesis

1039
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
That's a very

1040
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
It's like you pick up the phone

1041
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
To hear that kind of sound

1042
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Or more than that

1043
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
A lot of noise

1044
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
And these things

1045
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I'm all of us

1046
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Basic hearing

1047
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Uh

1048
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
The material used

1049
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
But in general

1050
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
We don't use that kind of material

1051
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
And then we

1052
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
And

1053
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
In addition, that is to say

1054
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
When we study hearing

1055
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
We often present a

1056
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
A completely unchanged sound

1057
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
A completely correct

1058
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
For example, show it for a second

1059
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
But in the case of nature

1060
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
All the sounds

1061
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
It's probably the first time

1062
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,500
It's gone

1063
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
It won't have the same stimulus

1064
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Repeat repeat

1065
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
It's been extended to a second

1066
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
So long

1067
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
And music

1068
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
It has another component

1069
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
That is to say it has

1070
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Uh

1071
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
More social interaction

1072
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Component

1073
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
It's not just about making a sound

1074
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
It's not just about making it

1075
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Uh

1076
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
I'll just knock on the table today

1077
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Make a sound

1078
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
But it's that people will

1079
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
According to your voice

1080
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
And then he has a response

1081
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
And then he makes a new action

1082
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Did that answer the question

1083
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
There are

1084
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Thank you

1085
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
OK OK OK

1086
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
OK

1087
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Everyone's questions are very good

1088
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
That

1089
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Um

1090
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
In our research example

1091
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
That is to say

1092
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
We want to understand

1093
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Using music

1094
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Play as a

1095
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Model example

1096
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Is a social interaction model

1097
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
How do we measure cooperation

1098
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
And then we have to understand

1099
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Is the relationship between the leader and the follower

1100
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
And then we have to

1101
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
What direction to go

1102
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
To do this research

1103
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Ah, this photo is

1104
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
A photo of our lab

1105
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
And then I just found

1106
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
We had a short film before the lab

1107
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
OK

1108
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Show it to everyone

1109
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
I hope everyone can hear the sound

1110
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Uh, there's a two and a half minute introduction

1111
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Adrian Fung and his colleagues

1112
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Are fitted with specially designed

1113
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Caps and sensors

1114
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Put them in the front of your shirt

1115
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
And wired to monitors

1116
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
That measure their brain activity

1117
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
And heart rate

1118
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Motion capture cameras

1119
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Record their movements too

1120
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Researchers are studying

1121
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
How the musicians communicate

1122
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
With each other during a performance

1123
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Without using a single word

1124
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
How do they use movements

1125
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
What gestures do the musicians make

1126
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
That make it possible for them to

1127
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Communicate with each other

1128
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
And to communicate with members of the audience

1129
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
They're all wired up too

1130
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
To study how they respond

1131
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Physically and emotionally

1132
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
To the performers on stage

1133
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
What's great about this

1134
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Is it affords us

1135
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
The ability to see

1136
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
How effective we are as communicators

1137
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
The theater is state-of-the-art technology

1138
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Including a sound system

1139
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
With incredible acoustics

1140
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Here with just a tap on a tablet

1141
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
I'll make it extremely reverberant in here

1142
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Sort of like a cathedral

1143
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
The room is transformed

1144
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
A cool feature that serves

1145
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
A wider, more scientific purpose

1146
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
One that could help researchers

1147
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Design a better hearing aid

1148
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
For the hearing impaired

1149
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
So, ratting

1150
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Background noise is coming out of all the speakers

1151
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
It's a multi-channel surround mix

1152
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
And then we could test

1153
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
How well does a person with a hearing aid

1154
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Comprehend speech

1155
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
That's presented to them

1156
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
In an environment like this

1157
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Instead of in the quiet room

1158
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
But for now

1159
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Most of the research is focused on music

1160
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
And its therapeutic powers

1161
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Researchers hope their findings

1162
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Will uncover how some rhythms

1163
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Might help an autistic child

1164
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Or why a musical beat

1165
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Can improve the gait of a patient

1166
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
With Parkinson's disease

1167
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
To understand

1168
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
What's going on in the brain

1169
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
We need to know how it's done

1170
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
In typical populations

1171
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Once we understand that

1172
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
And we know that music

1173
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Can help people with Parkinson's

1174
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Or we know that music has an effect

1175
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
On children with autism

1176
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
We can start to understand

1177
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
The deep reasons for that

1178
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
And we can perfect

1179
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
The therapies that we give these people

1180
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
And add to mounting evidence

1181
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
That music is good medicine

1182
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
For the brain

1428
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,600
Cass Rose, Cobain

1429
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Cass Rose, Cobain

1430
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Cass Rose, Cobain

1431
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
Cass Rose, Cobain

1432
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Cass Rose, Cobain

1433
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,600
But this is only an obvious effect in non-seeing.

1434
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
So it represents visual experience,

1435
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,600
which may create some noise,

1436
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,600
which makes it more difficult not to be followed,

1437
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
not to be affected by followers.

1438
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
Of course, this needs to be replicated.

1439
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
This is a small difference.

1440
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
Or did you analyze the interaction?

1441
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
Did you find it?

1442
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Sorry, I don't want to talk about it.

1443
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,600
So there's no difference between the two white bars

1444
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
and the two dark gray bars.

1445
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Is there a difference?

1446
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Did you analyze it?

1447
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
No, I looked at all the interactions.

1448
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Okay, thanks.

1449
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,600
You're welcome.

1450
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,600
We actually replicated this,

1451
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,600
but the difference between the two dark gray bars

1452
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,600
and the FF didn't show up in the replication.

1453
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
That's a shame.

1454
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,600
So we didn't explain much in the paper.

1455
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,600
I don't know why.

1456
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
But we found that

1457
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,600
the body movement can reflect the direction of information transmission.

1458
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,600
But it's not very interesting.

1459
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
What does this have to do with playing music?

1460
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
It's just a bunch of people moving around in the studio.

1461
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,600
It's just who moves first and who moves last.

1462
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,600
After they played each song,

1463
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,600
we asked the musicians to use a quantity table

1464
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,600
to evaluate how well they played.

1465
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,600
We asked them to evaluate three items.

1466
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,600
What is the overall quality of the performance?

1467
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
1 to 5 points.

1468
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,600
Is the synchronization of time synchronized?

1469
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Is there a difference in the difficulty of cooperation?

1470
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Then we compared it with the quantity of Granger Casualty.

1471
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,600
We found that the X axis is very good,

1472
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
the right side is very good,

1473
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
and the left side is very bad.

1474
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
The Y axis is...

1475
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,600
I wrote Casual Density.

1476
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,600
Basically, it's the total amount of information exchanged

1477
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,600
by the whole system.

1478
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,600
We found that the quality of the performance

1479
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,600
and the quantity of Casual Density and the amount of information exchange

1480
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,600
and the coupling of body movements are related.

1481
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,600
The synchronization of time is also related.

1482
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,600
However, in the second time replication,

1483
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
only the overall quality of the performance is related.

1484
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,600
In other words, the amount of information transfer...

1485
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,600
The body movement does not only reflect the direction of information transfer.

1486
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
The amount of information transfer

1487
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,600
seems to reflect the quality of cooperation.

1488
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,600
To sum up, what did we learn?

1489
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,600
We learned that in multi-person cooperation,

1490
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,600
we can observe the direction of information transfer from body movements.

1491
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,600
Even if this is a homework based on hearing and action,

1492
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,600
it seems that it is also an important communication channel

1493
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,600
whether you can see each other visually or not.

1494
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
The overall amount of information flow

1495
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,600
and the amount of information activity obtained by measuring body movements

1496
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
can reflect the quality of cooperation.

1497
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,600
In fact, these three points...

1498
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,600
For everyone, if you don't do research,

1499
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
you can probably guess the result.

1500
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,600
We think the biggest value is that

1501
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,600
we provide a low-threshold research method.

1502
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,600
You don't have to observe in our lab.

1503
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,600
You can observe in any natural situation.

1504
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
You can observe each other's body movements

1505
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,600
through imaging analysis.

1506
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
You may be able to observe the group behavior

1507
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,600
between people in natural situations.

1508
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,600
We just prove that this effect exists

1509
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,600
in a well-controlled lab.

1510
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
It should be an effective index.

1511
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I think that

1512
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,600
if the following researchers want to study

1513
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
complex social behaviors,

1514
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,600
at least they have a tool to use.

1515
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
I have a question.

1516
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,600
I'm sorry.

1517
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,600
I don't quite understand the second and third points.

1518
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,600
I thought the result is that

1519
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
if they are facing each other,

1520
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
they can't see each other.

1521
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
The result is still the same.

1522
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Yes, it is.

1523
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,600
But the effect is weaker.

1524
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,600
There is a main effect.

1525
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
Simple main effect is that

1526
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,600
in the direction of leader to follower,

1527
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,600
you can see each other much better than you can't see each other.

1528
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
I see.

1529
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,600
But the effect is still the same on both sides.

1530
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,600
This is my question for the third point.

1531
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,600
What is the direction of causal relationship?

1532
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,600
For example,

1533
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
is the communication channel

1534
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,600
caused by musical communication

1535
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,600
to cause the following of your body movement?

1536
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Or is it the movement of your body

1537
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,600
that causes the improvement of music?

1538
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,600
I don't know.

1539
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,600
Because if you can't see your body sway

1540
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
or follow each other,

1541
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,600
it doesn't mean visual communication.

1542
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,600
It is the natural body reaction

1543
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,600
caused by the essence of hearing or music.

1544
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,600
So it is a side effect,

1545
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,600
not a real cause.

1546
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,600
I didn't say it is a cause.

1547
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,600
I just said it is a reaction indicator.

1548
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
It is a measurement indicator.

1549
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
I said it is

1550
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,600
when we play music,

1551
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,600
our body does this movement,

1552
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
but we still do it.

1553
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
This information seems to reflect

1554
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,600
the direction of information transmission

1555
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
and the quality of cooperation.

1556
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,600
So you don't think it is functional.

1557
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
You don't think it has a function.

1558
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
It is just an indicator.

1559
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,600
It is just a measurement indicator.

1560
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
I am conservative.

1561
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
I am conservative.

1562
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
I think I don't know.

1563
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
I just said

1564
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,600
I can't prove it is functional yet.

1565
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,600
In my research,

1566
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
some people block the whole person

1567
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
and measure the time difference

1568
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
between each other's buttons.

1569
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,600
When all the buttons are blocked,

1570
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,600
the time difference between the buttons

1571
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,600
will be affected.

1572
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,600
But I think

1573
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
the conclusion is

1574
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
in my research,

1575
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
I can only say

1576
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,600
the result can be reflected.

1577
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,600
Maybe it is just a related indicator.

1578
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
But is the function

1579
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
a part of communication itself?

1580
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
Is it a part of seeing

1581
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
other people's body movements?

1582
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
I don't know.

1583
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,600
Because like you said,

1584
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
even if you can't see,

1585
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
the body movements have this effect.

1586
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Got it.

1587
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,600
Thank you.

1588
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,600
I have another question for Zhang Ting.

1589
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
But it is not directly

1590
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
about your research itself.

1591
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
We want something interesting

1592
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
from your research.

1593
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
If we look at Baha,

1594
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,600
you just emphasized that

1595
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,600
the four characters

1596
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
are relatively...

1597
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,600
What is it called?

1598
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
The responsibilities are more or less equal.

1599
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
So you can randomly assign

1600
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,600
who you are.

1601
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
But if we change it to

1602
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
four-part jazz,

1603
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
the kind of music with strong characters,

1604
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,600
do you expect that

1605
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
the effect size will be very strong?

1606
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Or will they break down?

1607
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
They can't play

1608
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
because they don't know

1609
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
who they are.

1610
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,600
If you don't assign,

1611
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,600
who will lead?

1612
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,600
I know.

1613
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,600
This is our...

1614
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Actually, we did it.

1615
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,600
I didn't put it here today.

1616
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
But this is Experiment 2.

1617
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
In the case of Experiment 2,

1618
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,600
we don't have that kind of jazz.

1619
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,600
We want them to play

1620
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,600
Mozart's music.

1621
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,600
If you look at Mozart's music,

1622
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,600
if you look at the score,

1623
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,600
all the melodies

1624
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,600
are in the first violin.

1625
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
The other parts

1626
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,600
are just beats.

1627
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
But we still do

1628
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,600
the same manipulation.

1629
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,600
Even if the cello

1630
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,600
is just playing beats,

1631
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,600
you still have to lead the violin

1632
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,600
to play its music.

1633
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,600
So this is basically

1634
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
the same manipulation

1635
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
as you think.

1636
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
It's all the same.

1637
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,600
The result is...

1638
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,600
I go back to the previous slide.

1639
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
This is the replication

1640
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
I just talked about.

1641
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
We still have

1642
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,600
the three lines above.

1643
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
The three lines below are gone.

1644
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,600
So we're in a task.

1645
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,600
It's an unbalanced starting point.

1646
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
We're going to do manipulation.

1647
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,600
We still see the above effects.

1648
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,600
But it's actually

1649
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
a lot weaker overall.

1650
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,600
And then we measure

1651
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,600
the strength of the

1652
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,600
grandiosity between each other

1653
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,600
in the case of the bass line.

1654
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
We found that

1655
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,600
in the case of playing Mozart's music,

1656
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,600
the bass line is more uneven.

1657
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,600
In the case of playing Bach,

1658
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
the bass line is even.

1659
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,600
So it does have

1660
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
the effect of the bass line.

1661
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,600
This effect actually

1662
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
shows that this is functional.

1663
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,600
Because in the case of non-syncing,

1664
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
when the music itself

1665
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,600
doesn't have this message,

1666
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,600
when the music itself

1667
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
has an obvious bias,

1668
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
it's hard for you to have

1669
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
this effect.

1670
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,600
For example,

1671
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
in the case of playing the cello,

1672
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
if you don't see it,

1673
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,600
your body swing is not connected.

1674
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,600
But when you see it,

1675
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
it still has an effect.

1676
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,600
It means it's causally linked.

1677
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
Wait a minute.

1678
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
I suddenly feel like

1679
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,600
I'm talking illogically.

1680
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Because although the body...

1681
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,600
But we didn't...

1682
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
But the music itself

1683
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,600
is actually explained.

1684
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,600
I think it's a little hard

1685
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,600
I think even if there is such a difference,

1686
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
it's just possible.

1687
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
But to answer that question directly,

1688
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,600
for example,

1689
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,600
if I tie the musician to the chair

1690
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,600
so that he can't move,

1691
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
let's see what the effect of their performance is.

1692
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
This is a more direct manipulation.

1693
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,600
Do you agree with me?

1694
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,600
I don't know. I can't figure it out.

1695
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,600
I have to think about it again.

1696
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,600
That is to say,

1697
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,600
I can't move your body today.

1698
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Let's see if your performance quality

1699
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,600
will be reduced.

1700
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
Obviously,

1701
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
there will be a lot of confounders.

1702
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
You can't do that.

1703
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,600
But I'm still thinking about

1704
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,600
the lack of evidence just now.

1705
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,600
It seems that it can only prove that

1706
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,600
you still find that

1707
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,600
the reaction between the body

1708
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,600
is causally linked.

1709
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,600
It's the connection between the follower and the leader.

1710
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
But the causality of this connection

1711
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,600
does not represent the causality

1712
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
between the performance of music

1713
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
and the body sway.

1714
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
So it's not a good evidence.

1715
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Do you mean that?

1716
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,600
I'm a little confused.

1717
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
I'm confused, too.

1718
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Forget it.

1719
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,600
When we were writing the paper,

1720
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
different authors were thinking about it.

1721
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
Some authors directly argued that

1722
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,600
body sway is communication.

1723
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
But...

1724
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,600
I don't think you have that evidence.

1725
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
I think the evidence is direct.

1726
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
I just said that I was a little bit safe.

1727
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
Then in the discussion,

1728
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,600
I said it might be like this.

1729
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
But I don't know.

1730
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,600
I think there are indeed

1731
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
two causes and conditions for discussion.

1732
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
One is that

1733
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,600
the body sway of the leader

1734
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,600
leads to the body sway of the follower.

1735
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,600
This is the analysis you are doing now.

1736
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
As long as the bar on your left is higher,

1737
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,600
it means that the causality exists.

1738
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
But...

1739
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,600
But...

1740
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,600
You go first.

1741
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
But the other cause is

1742
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,600
the connection between the music

1743
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,600
and the body sway.

1744
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Is body sway

1745
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,600
the connection between the music itself?

1746
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Yes.

1747
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
OK.

1748
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,600
The first point is

1749
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
about grunge causality.

1750
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
I guess many listeners may know that

1751
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
it is actually argued that

1752
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
causality is a big problem.

1753
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,600
Mathematically,

1754
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,600
causality is a big problem?

1755
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Yes.

1756
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Mathematically,

1757
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
it can only say that

1758
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,600
the amount of information transfer.

1759
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,600
Is there really a cause?

1760
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
There must be some other situations.

1761
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,600
For example,

1762
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,600
I have to sample

1763
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
the whole universe

1764
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
to make it possible.

1765
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,600
In some cases,

1766
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
it is conservative.

1767
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Mathematically,

1768
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,600
I can only say

1769
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,600
A predict B.

1770
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
I can't say A cause B.

1771
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
In this example,

1772
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
you can say causality.

1773
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,600
Because it is the difference in time.

1774
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,600
This information

1775
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
leads to this information change.

1776
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,600
What other factors

1777
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,600
in body sway

1778
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,600
will lead to this change?

1779
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,600
Maybe music

1780
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
has a third reason.

1781
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,600
In short,

1782
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,600
I think the alternative is limited.

1783
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,600
There is no possibility.

1784
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
These alternatives

1785
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
sound

1786
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
not very

1787
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,600
compelling.

1788
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,600
So I think

1789
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,600
even if it is a little risky,

1790
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,600
you can still argue

1791
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,600
that this is a causal relationship.

1792
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,600
On the other hand,

1793
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,600
what you really care about

1794
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,600
is the body movement reaction.

1795
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
Is this information

1796
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
transmitted

1797
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,600
by music communication itself?

1798
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Does it cause

1799
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,600
better music quality?

1800
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,600
Does it cause

1801
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,600
better communication?

1802
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
But

1803
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
I don't think

1804
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,600
there is a causal relationship.

1805
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
I think

1806
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
there is a causal relationship.

1807
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,600
But this seems

1808
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,600
to need other evidence.

1809
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Yes.

1810
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
I am conservative.

1811
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
I think you are conservative.

1812
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
My bubble is gone.

1813
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,600
So everyone is welcome

1814
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,600
to discuss freely.

1815
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,600
It doesn't matter if it is three-dimensional.

1816
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
I would like to ask

1817
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,600
this experiment

1818
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
that you are talking about now.

1819
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
For example,

1820
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
how many groups

1821
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,600
do you need

1822
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
or how many musicians

1823
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,600
do you need

1824
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,600
to be able to

1825
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,600
get a

1826
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
less

1827
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
influenced

1828
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,600
culture

1829
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
or training

1830
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,600
from the performers?

1831
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,600
I think

1832
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,600
this question

1833
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,600
is very good.

1834
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,600
I think

1835
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,600
this is the weakness

1836
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
of this study.

1837
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
First of all,

1838
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
we are looking for

1839
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,600
very high-level musicians.

1840
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
You have to pay a lot of money

1841
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,600
to buy a concert hall

1842
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
for them to come.

1843
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,600
Because of the financial constraints,

1844
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,600
we found two groups.

1845
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,600
We found two groups.

1846
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,600
In terms of statistics,

1847
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
we think it is better to say

1848
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,600
that these are

1849
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,600
called within-subject comparison.

1850
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
That is to say,

1851
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
compare yourself with yourself.

1852
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,600
That is to say,

1853
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,600
how much stronger

1854
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,600
this effect is

1855
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,600
compared to

1856
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
yourself as a follower.

1857
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,600
So even if

1858
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,600
the sample we take

1859
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,600
is very limited,

1860
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,600
that is,

1861
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
two groups of musicians,

1862
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,600
a total of eight people.

1863
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,600
But within each person,

1864
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,600
the direction of their effect

1865
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,600
is the same.

1866
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,600
Is it possible that

1867
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,600
I took some

1868
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
very biased samples?

1869
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,600
For example,

1870
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
these musicians

1871
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,600
do not represent all humans.

1872
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
It is possible.

1873
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,600
This is the weakness of this study.

1874
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,600
I don't know

1875
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
how representative this is.

1876
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,600
I can only say

1877
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,600
that from other

1878
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
currently known studies,

1879
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,600
the representativeness of musicians

1880
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,600
and normal humans

1881
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,600
is actually

1882
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
similar.

1883
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
It can represent

1884
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,600
ordinary humans.

1885
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Other cultures

1886
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,600
also have a problem

1887
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,600
with representativeness.

1888
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
At present,

1889
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,600
it is also said that

1890
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,600
representativeness is still OK.

1891
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
It's just that

1892
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
I don't have direct evidence

1893
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,600
to say that

1894
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,600
this effect

1895
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
can represent

1896
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,600
the effect of all humans.

1897
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,600
I don't know.

1898
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,600
Is it conservative?

1899
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,600
It's OK.

1900
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,600
I have a question.

1901
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,600
OK.

1902
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,600
You ask first.

1903
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,600
You finish first.

1904
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
It's OK.

1905
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
The next question

1906
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,600
has nothing to do with this.

1907
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,600
You can continue

1908
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
to ask other questions.

1909
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,600
OK.

1910
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
I have a question.

1911
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
At the beginning,

1912
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
you mentioned quarreling.

1913
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
But quarreling

1914
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
doesn't seem to be sung.

1915
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,600
It's spoken.

1916
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,600
So I want to know

1917
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
that it can also be sung.

1918
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,600
It's weird.

1919
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,600
So the question I want to ask

1920
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,600
is that

1921
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,600
your research results

1922
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
are already here.

1923
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,600
How much do you think

1924
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,600
it can allow us to predict

1925
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
or provide us

1926
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,600
with knowledge

1927
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
about language communication

1928
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,600
and interaction?

1929
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,600
What kind of implications

1930
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,600
will there be?

1931
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,600
If there are some weaknesses

1932
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
that can't be inferred,

1933
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
what research

1934
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
do you need to make up for

1935
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,600
in terms of speech?

1936
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,600
OK.

1937
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,600
First of all,

1938
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,600
most of the research

1939
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,600
on body movements

1940
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,600
and body shaking

1941
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,600
is done

1942
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,600
in the context of speech.

1943
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,600
But they do it

1944
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,600
in a small lab.

1945
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
There are usually two people.

1946
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,600
They use relevant methods

1947
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,600
to see how similar

1948
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,600
the information is.

1949
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,600
There are other studies

1950
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,600
that show

1951
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,600
that the psychological process

1952
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,600
used in music performance

1953
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,600
and speech

1954
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
are very similar.

1955
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,600
In terms of music,

1956
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,600
we also observed

1957
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,600
a similar effect

1958
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,600
in body movements.

1959
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Of course,

1960
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
it's not exactly the same.

1961
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,600
It's extended,

1962
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
but the effect

1963
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,600
is the same.

1964
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,600
Although there is no direct evidence,

1965
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,600
I think

1966
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,600
the effect

1967
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,600
should be the same

1968
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,600
in terms of speech.

1969
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,600
That's my guess.

1970
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,600
OK, thank you.

1971
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
I have a related question.

1972
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
Can I interrupt you?

1973
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,600
Do you have a number?

1974
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,600
Someone said he had a question.

1975
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,600
I'm afraid I'll keep interrupting.

1976
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,600
I asked too many questions.

1977
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,600
You just said language.

1978
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,600
In fact,

1979
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,600
I think

1980
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
more broadly,

1981
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
do you think

1982
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,600
these are all

1983
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
the phenomenon of hearing?

1984
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,600
Or is it actually

1985
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,600
a wider perception

1986
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,600
or even a mental operation?

1987
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Or is it

1988
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
a specific phenomenon

1989
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,600
of hearing?

1990
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,600
For example,

1991
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,600
in science,

1992
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,600
regularity

1993
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,600
determines

1994
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,600
how you

1995
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,600
can anticipate

1996
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,600
how to

1997
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,600
process

1998
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
cognitive information.

1999
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,600
Obviously,

2000
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,600
this also works

2001
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,600
visually.

2002
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,600
Next,

2003
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,600
is the communication

2004
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
of music collaborators

2005
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,600
really limited to

2006
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,600
the performance of music?

2007
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Or is it

2008
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,600
all about

2009
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,600
cooperation?

2010
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,600
All the cooperation,

2011
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,600
like the example

2012
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,600
you just gave,

2013
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,600
do they all

2014
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,600
have the same phenomenon?

2015
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Does the sway of the body

2016
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,600
also affect it?

2017
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,600
Or is there

2018
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,600
a more general mechanism?

2019
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,600
For example,

2020
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,600
is there any

2021
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,600
synchronization

2022
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,600
that helps

2023
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,600
communication?

2024
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,600
Can you remind me

2025
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,600
what the first part

2026
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,600
is?

2027
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
I think

2028
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,600
these are all examples.

2029
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,600
The main question is

2030
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,600
do you think

2031
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
this is a domain-specific

2032
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,600
phenomenon

2033
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,600
or

2034
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
a wider

2035
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,600
mental operation

2036
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,600
principle?

2037
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,600
I don't think

2038
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,600
there is a standard answer.

2039
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,600
I'm just curious.

2040
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,600
OK.

2041
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,600
I'm curious.

2042
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,600
According to

2043
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,600
other studies,

2044
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,600
in fact,

2045
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,600
we found

2046
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,600
that

2047
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,600
time synchronization

2048
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,600
is still

2049
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,600
a bit different

2050
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,600
from hearing

2051
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,600
and vision.

2052
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,600
For example,

2053
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
the sense of rhythm

2054
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,600
of vision

2055
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,600
is actually

2056
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
quite difficult

2057
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,600
to produce

2058
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,600
compared to hearing.

2059
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
The accuracy of

2060
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
tracking time

2061
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,600
does not seem

2062
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,600
to be as high

2063
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,600
as the results

2064
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,600
of the study.

2065
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,600
But some people

2066
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,600
have succeeded.

2067
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Vision still has

2068
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,600
this effect.

2069
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,600
But

2070
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,600
what I mean is

2071
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
that it may not be

2072
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
the same.

2073
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
The domain of hearing

2074
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,600
is obviously

2075
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
frequency and time.

2076
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,600
But

2077
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,600
in vision,

2078
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,600
it will be

2079
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,600
space and

2080
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,600
location.

2081
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,600
Yes, space and location.

2082
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,600
Translated,

2083
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,600
it becomes

2084
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
statistical learning.

2085
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,600
If there is a

2086
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,600
fixed pattern,

2087
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,600
I can't speak Chinese.

2088
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
If there is a

2089
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
fixed pattern

2090
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,600
that appears

2091
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,600
repeatedly,

2092
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,600
your processing

2093
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
will be faster,

2094
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,600
better,

2095
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,600
and more accurate.

2096
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,600
Do you think

2097
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,600
this is a similar phenomenon?

2098
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,600
Or is there

2099
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,600
a specialized

2100
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
process

2101
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,600
in the brain

2102
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,600
to process

2103
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,600
different areas?

2104
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,600
OK.

2105
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,600
I think

2106
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,600
the special process

2107
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
is because

2108
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,600
time is

2109
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,600
one-dimensional.

2110
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Although

2111
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,600
it is a

2112
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
single-direction

2113
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
dimension,

2114
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,600
you are always

2115
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
going to the future

2116
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,600
to make guesses.

2117
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,600
This is

2118
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,600
different from

2119
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,600
the visual

2120
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,600
pattern.

2121
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,600
For example,

2122
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,600
if I give you

2123
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,600
a very regular

2124
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,600
pattern,

2125
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,600
this pattern

2126
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,600
is not the same.

2127
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,600
But it must be

2128
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,600
future-oriented.

2129
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,600
So,

2130
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,600
based on your

2131
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,600
existing information,

2132
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,600
you keep guessing

2133
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,600
what the

2134
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,600
future information

2135
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,600
is.

2136
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,600
In fact,

2137
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
it is

2138
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,600
online processing.

2139
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
So,

2140
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,600
I think

2141
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,600
these details

2142
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,600
make time

2143
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,600
different from

2144
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,600
other senses

2145
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,600
when it

2146
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,600
comes to

2147
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,600
hearing.

2148
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,600
Because the information

2149
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,600
is opened

2150
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,600
at any time.

2151
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,600
Let me give you

2152
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,600
an example.

2153
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,600
In the visual phenomenon,

2154
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,600
there is also

2155
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,600
a temporal

2156
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,600
anticipation

2157
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,600
phenomenon.

2158
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
For example,

2159
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,600
you should

2160
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
know

2161
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
this experiment.

2162
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
It is

2163
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
a combination

2164
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
of three

2165
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
random

2166
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
sounds.

2167
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
What is

2168
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
this experiment?

2169
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
This is the

2170
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,600
first experiment

2171
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,600
in learning

2172
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
language.

2173
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,600
For example,

2174
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,600
there are

2175
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
nine possible

2176
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,600
notes.

2177
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
There are

2178
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,600
three notes

2179
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,600
that are

2180
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
always

2181
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,600
connected.

2182
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,600
Three notes

2183
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,600
are always

2184
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
in pairs.

2185
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
These phrases

2186
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
can be

2187
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,600
randomly

2188
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,600
combined.

2189
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,600
This phenomenon

2190
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,600
is hearing.

2191
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,600
In fact,

2192
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
if you

2193
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,600
do the same

2194
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,600
experiment

2195
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,600
with visual stimulation,

2196
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,600
all the results

2197
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,600
are the same.

2198
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,600
So,

2199
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,600
this is

2200
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,600
an online

2201
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
processing

2202
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,600
that affects

2203
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,600
your

2204
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,600
intuition

2205
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,600
in the

2206
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
visual phenomenon.

2207
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,600
I know.

2208
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,600
In each

2209
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,600
special case,

2210
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,600
some cases

2211
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,600
are replicated.

2212
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,600
But in many cases,

2213
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,600
visually,

2214
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,600
it is difficult

2215
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,600
to do it.

2216
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,600
For example,

2217
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,600
the effect of

2218
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,600
rhythm.

2219
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Temporal

2220
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,600
grouping.

2221
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,600
I know you

2222
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,600
have done it

2223
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,600
once in the

2224
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,600
lab,

2225
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,600
but

2226
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,600
you can see

2227
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,600
that many people

2228
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,600
failed.

2229
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,600
It doesn't matter.

2230
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,600
I know.

2231
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,600
I have done

2232
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,600
multi-sensory.

2233
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,600
I know it is

2234
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,600
difficult.

2235
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,600
It is very

2236
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,600
simple.

2237
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
You just need to

2238
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,600
show 4 notes,

2239
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,600
5 notes,

2240
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,600
and people will

2241
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
know.

2242
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
So,

2243
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,600
you mean

2244
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,600
there are

2245
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,600
domain-specific

2246
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,600
parts.

2247
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Temporal

2248
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
regularity

2249
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
is a

2250
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,600
domain-specific

2251
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,600
part.

2252
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,600
What do you

2253
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,600
think is

2254
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,600
the difference

2255
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,600
between

2256
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,600
hearing

2257
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,600
and visual

2258
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,600
regularity?

2259
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,600
I think

2260
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,600
the effect

2261
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
is the same,

2262
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,600
but the

2263
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
processing

2264
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,600
is different.

2265
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,600
In

2266
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,600
primary

2267
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,600
auditory

2268
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
cortex,

2269
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
there is

2270
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
temporal

2271
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,600
coding.

2272
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,600
In

2273
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
visual cortex,

2274
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
it is

2275
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,600
where

2276
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
domain.

2277
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,600
I don't

2278
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,600
know.

2279
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,600
It takes

2280
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,600
a long time

2281
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,600
to

2282
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
process

2283
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
the information.

2284
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Is it

2285
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,600
because

2286
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,600
hearing

2287
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
mechanism

2288
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
makes it

2289
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,600
noisy?

2290
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,600
For example,

2291
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,600
hearing

2292
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,600
and visual

2293
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,600
are

2294
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,600
basically

2295
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,600
different.

2296
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,600
Okay.

2297
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,600
I've been standing here

2298
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,600
for too long.

2299
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,600
Let me

2300
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,600
guess.

2301
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Is it okay?

2302
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,600
I'm done.

2303
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,600
Please go ahead.

2304
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,600
I read

2305
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,600
an article

2306
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,600
that said

2307
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,600
if...

2308
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,600
It's from

2309
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Sexy.

2310
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,600
It said

2311
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
if the

2312
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
trigger

2313
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,600
is

2314
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,600
language

2315
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,600
or

2316
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,600
sound,

2317
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,600
that is,

2318
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,600
hearing,

2319
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,600
the trigger

2320
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
is

2321
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,600
the

2322
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,600
subject's

2323
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
abstract

2324
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,600
image.

2325
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,600
It's

2326
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,600
about

2327
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,600
describing

2328
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,600
the material

2329
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,600
in a

2330
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
more abstract

2331
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,600
and

2332
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,600
far-reaching

2333
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,600
way

2334
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,600
compared to

2335
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
visual materials.

2336
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
I don't know

2337
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,600
if

2338
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,600
it's

2339
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,600
similar

2340
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,600
to

2341
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,600
processing

2342
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,600
or

2343
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,600
listening to

2344
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,600
music.

2345
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,600
If

2346
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,600
it's

2347
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,600
similar

2348
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,600
to

2349
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,600
listening

2350
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,600
to

2351
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,600
music,

2352
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,600
I think

2353
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
it's

2354
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,600
similar.

2355
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,600
If

2356
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,600
it's

2357
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,600
similar,

2358
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,600
I think

2359
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,600
it's

2360
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,600
similar.

2361
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,600
Is it

2362
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,600
similar?

2363
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,600
I'm

2364
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,600
not sure.

2365
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,600
I think

2366
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,600
it's

2367
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,600
similar.

2368
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,600
It's

2369
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,600
similar.

2370
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,600
Okay.

2371
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,600
So

2372
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,600
I

2373
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
don't

2374
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,600
know

2375
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,600
all the

2376
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,600
details

2377
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,600
about

2378
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,600
the

2379
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,600
song.

2380
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
I

2381
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,600
don't

2382
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,600
know.

2383
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,600
I

2384
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,600
really don't

2385
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,600
know.

2386
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,600
Hello.

2387
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,600
Are

2388
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
you

2389
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,600
calling me?

2390
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
I'm done.

2391
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,600
I'm done.

2392
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,600
I just

2393
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,600
said I

2394
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,600
don't

2395
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
know.

2396
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,600
Sorry.

2397
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,600
Did I

2398
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,600
disconnect?

2399
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,600
Okay.

2400
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,600
Does

2401
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,600
anyone

2402
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,600
else have

2403
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,600
any

2404
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,600
questions?

2405
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,600
Someone

2406
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,600
is

2407
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,600
asking

2408
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,600
questions.

2409
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,600
Can

2410
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,600
I

2411
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,600
ask

2412
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,600
a question?

2413
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Okay.

2414
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,600
Please.

2415
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,600
I'm

2416
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,600
thinking

2417
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,600
that

2418
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,600
if

2419
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,600
you

2420
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,600
tell

2421
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
the

2422
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,600
musicians

2423
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,600
that

2424
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
you

2425
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,600
have

2426
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,600
three

2427
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,600
people

2428
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,600
following

2429
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,600
you

2430
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
and

2431
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,600
one

2432
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,600
is

2433
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,600
the

2434
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
leader,

2435
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,600
will

2436
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,600
they

2437
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,600
fight?

2438
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,600
Yes.

2439
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,600
We

2440
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,600
actually

2441
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,600
did this

2442
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
experiment.

2443
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,600
Our

2444
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
condition

2445
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,600
is

2446
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Beach,

2447
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,600
I'm

2448
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,600
the

2449
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,600
leader.

2450
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
But

2451
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
we

2452
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
originally

2453
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,600
thought

2454
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,600
that

2455
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,600
in your

2456
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,600
leadership

2457
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,600
assignment,

2458
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
if there

2459
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,600
is

2460
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,600
a

2461
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,600
conflict,

2462
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
how

2463
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
can we

2464
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,600
solve

2465
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,600
the

2466
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,600
conflict?

2467
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,600
We

2468
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,600
originally

2469
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,600
wanted to

2470
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,600
see this

2471
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,600
situation.

2472
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,600
But

2473
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,600
the result of

2474
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,600
the experiment

2475
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,600
is that

2476
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
we found

2477
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,600
that only

2478
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,600
when

2479
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,600
everyone

2480
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,600
can see

2481
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,600
each other

2482
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,600
and

2483
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,600
everyone

2484
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,600
is assigned

2485
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
as

2486
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,600
followers,

2487
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,600
can we

2488
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,600
solve

2489
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,600
this

2490
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,600
conflict

2491
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,600
smoothly.

2492
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,600
At

2493
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,600
that

2494
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,600
time,

2495
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
we

2496
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,600
thought

2497
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,600
that

2498
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,600
if

2499
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,600
everyone

2500
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,600
is

2501
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
the

2502
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
leader,

2503
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,600
or

2504
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,600
can't

2505
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,600
see each

2506
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:42,600
other,

2507
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,600
they

2508
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
can't

2509
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
solve

2510
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
the

2511
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,600
conflict.

2512
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,600
So

2513
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,600
we

2514
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,600
called it

2515
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Beach,

2516
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,600
I'm

2517
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,600
the

2518
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
leader.

2519
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Have

2520
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,600
you ever

2521
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
tried

2522
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,600
to solve

2523
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,600
the

2524
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
conflict?

2525
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,600
We

2526
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
thought that

2527
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,600
if

2528
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,600
everyone

2529
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,600
can see

2530
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,600
each other

2531
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,600
and

2532
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,600
no one

2533
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,600
is the

2534
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,600
leader,

2535
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,600
they can

2536
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,600
solve

2537
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
the

2538
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,600
conflict

2539
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,600
smoothly.

2540
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,600
But

2541
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
only in

2542
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,600
Bach's

2543
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,600
music,

2544
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,600
if

2545
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,600
the

2546
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,600
bassline

2547
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,600
is

2548
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,600
unbalanced,

2549
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
this

2550
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,600
effect

2551
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,600
can't

2552
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,600
be

2553
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,600
achieved.

2554
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,600
We

2555
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,600
also asked

2556
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,600
them to

2557
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,600
guess who

2558
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
is the

2559
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,600
leader.

2560
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
We

2561
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,600
forced them

2562
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,600
to choose

2563
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,600
the other

2564
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,600
three,

2565
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,600
but

2566
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
they

2567
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,600
were

2568
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,600
so good

2569
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,600
that

2570
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,600
they

2571
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
wrote

2572
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,600

answer sheet.

2577
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,600
So

2578
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,600
this

2579
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,600

2583
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,600
And

2584
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,600
we

2585
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,600
tried to

2586
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,600
avoid

2587
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,600

2589
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600

everyone

2591
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
is the

2592
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,600
leader.

2593
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,600
We

2594
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,600
played the

2595
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,600

2596
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,600

2600
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
and

2601
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,600
we

2602
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,600
removed

2603
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,600
the

2604
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600

2605
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,600

performance.

2608
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
So

2609
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,600
this

2610
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,600
