00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hi, everyone. I'm the host for today. I'm Zhang Yanyong.

00:09.000 --> 00:18.000
We're going to have our 23rd Tara Talk this year.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
We're honored to have Dr. Wang Lingya as our speaker today.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
She's my senior at NTU.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Wait a minute.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Lingya studied medicine at NTU.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
After graduating from the PhD program at NTU,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
she came to Nanyang University.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
She's actually our neighbor.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
We've met quite a few times.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
After doing her PhD, Lingya majored in virology.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
That's the topic she's going to talk about today.

00:54.000 --> 01:05.000
Today's topic is Molecular Biology Study of Hepatitis C Virus and Autophagy.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Is that how you pronounce it?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yes.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I don't know. If I pronounce it wrong, Lingya will correct me.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Without further ado, let's welcome Lingya.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh, right. Autophagy.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
There are two things I want to remind you of.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
First, if you don't want to speak,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
turn off your microphone so that you won't have noise.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Second, when you clap, remember to turn on your microphone so that you can hear.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Let's welcome our speaker.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Hello, everyone. I'm Lingya.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
As the host just said,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm doing my PhD in Nanyang University.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm majoring in virology.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
When you watch a movie,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
you'd think that you're walking around in a white gown in a lab.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
But in fact, the most commonly used technology in our department is molecular biology.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
So today, I'm going to talk about some methods of molecular biology

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
and how it's used to study viruses.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
I'll talk about autophagy later.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Molecular biology.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
As you can imagine,

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
biology is a big topic.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
But molecular biology is about small molecules.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
We learned in middle school that

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
DNA converts into RNA and converts into protein.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
So the so-called genes are all on DNA.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
After a series of synthesis,

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
it becomes protein.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
When we study viruses,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
we study almost everything.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
It's either DNA, RNA, or protein.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
These things are very small,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
so you can't see them with the naked eye.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
So our experiments are often done on

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
very small transparent objects.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
For example,

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
a 100-microliter or even a 1-microliter object.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Basically, you can't see it with your eyes.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So if you go on a trip,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
you might not know which one you're holding.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
They all look the same,

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
so you don't know.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
This is mainly about molecular biology.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
It's about looking at the performance of DNA, RNA, or protein.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I just mentioned cells.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
We also taught this in middle school.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Cells look like this.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
There's a cell box, a cell paper, a cell film,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
and there's a lot of air in it.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
But the textbook will draw it cuter.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's more like a starfish.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
But in fact, the cells under the wire

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
are filled very slowly.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
You can see this is the cell box,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
and then the cell film,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and in the middle is the cell paper.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
There's a lot of air in the cell paper.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
All the so-called air

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
is actually made up of a lot of film,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
all kinds of bubbles.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
This is a little bit bigger.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
You can see there's a lot of film,

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
a lot of bubbles.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
These films and bubbles are actually all fat.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
They're all made up of lipids.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Different bubbles have different functions.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Some are producing energy.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Some are making protein.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Some are making cyanide.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
They're helping our cells maintain a good operation.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
We need these cells.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Out of all these cells,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
the autophagy we're going to talk about today

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
is actually a cyanide job.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
To put it simply,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
when our cells have

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
old bacteria,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
or broken proteins,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
or even when there's a virus infection,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
or something from the outside,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
it's all based on this cyanide

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
to get rid of these bad or old things.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Since it's a function of cyanide,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
it will naturally follow the death of cells,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
or cancer,

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
or like our immune response.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Because of the immune response,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
the immune response needs to get rid of

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
some bad things from the virus or bacteria.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
For example, neurodegenerative diseases

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
are all related to the function of this cyanide autophagy.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
What we're going to focus on today

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
is infectious diseases.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Viruses are infectious diseases.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
The function of autophagy

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
is mainly...

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
This is a cell membrane.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
This brown one is a cell membrane.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
We can see that

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
there are a lot of membranes in our cells.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
It is a small membrane

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
made up of some fat

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
in a circle.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It will slowly get longer

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and become a bubble.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Inside this bubble,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
it will contain the bad things

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
that it will destroy later.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
This bubble is called autophagosome.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't know how to say it in Chinese,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
so please remember it.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
It's called autophagosome.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It has a lot of enzymes

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
in this bubble.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
These enzymes are used to

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
break down proteins.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
When these two membranes are combined,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
the substances in their cells

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
will be different.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
This enzyme will

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
break down the proteins.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Let me talk a little bit about

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
the later process.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Every department has its own

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
application science or basic science.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
The virus science I do

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
is very basic science.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
It is purely studying

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
what protein, what gas

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
will react with the virus

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
in the cells.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
When people ask me

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
if I'm doing medicine,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
if I'm doing vaccines,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
if I'm treating cancer,

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
it has nothing to do with clinical trials.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
So when we talk about

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
basic virus science,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
a lot of people think it's boring.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Today, I hope everyone

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
can understand this field.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
How does autophagosome work?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
From a simple membrane

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
to a circle,

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
it's easy to break down proteins.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
As you can see in this picture,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
this is a small membrane,

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
phagophore.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It will slowly become

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
a complete circle, autophagosome.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
At the end, it's a fusion membrane.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
The lysosome that breaks down proteins

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
is called autolysosome.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
There are a lot of other proteins

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
that control the whole process.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Because the membrane doesn't

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
automatically merge together.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
There must be a protein controlling it.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
We can see that when phagophore

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
is still a fragment,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
there is a protein called ATG5.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
It will be specifically

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
combined on this membrane.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So when we monitor

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
the number of membranes in our cells,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
when we specifically monitor

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
the membrane of this fragment,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
we will look at the performance

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
of the protein ATG5.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
If ATG5 performs well,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
it means the membrane performs well.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
So we call it a marker.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
It's specifically for marking.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
The marker on autophagosome

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
is LC3.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
So in the experiment later,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
if we talk about ATG5,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
it's marking the membrane.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
If we talk about LC3,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
it's marking the autophagosome bubble.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
How do we know

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
if the protein has been

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
broken down?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
There is a protein called P62.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Every time it's in the autophagosome,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
it will be wrapped inside.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So if it's broken down in the end,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
we can see that

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
the performance of P62 will drop.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
So these three things

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
are what we mainly do

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
when we do autophagosome,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
to monitor how far it has come.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Why do we need to study

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
viruses and autophagosome?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
We just mentioned that

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
autophagosome has the function

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
of cleaning the skin.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It can remove the protein

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
from the virus.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
In theory,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
autophagosome should be useful

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
to fight against viruses.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
But many studies have found

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
that some viruses will

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
use autophagosome

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
to reproduce the virus

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
to fight against the virus.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
This is a typical example

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
of how the virus

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
kidnaps the mechanism

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
inside the cell

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
to reproduce itself.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
The virus is actually

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
something between

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
living and non-living.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Why is it non-living?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Because our cells

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
are made up of cell nucleus.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
There are a lot of cells

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
that can produce energy

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
but not the virus.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
The virus has some

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
scattered DNA and RNA

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and a shell

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
made up of protein.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That's it.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
The virus itself

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
has no biological ability.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But because it contains

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
DNA and RNA,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
it is considered

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
a living organism.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So it is between

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
living and non-living.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
The virus itself

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
has no biological ability.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
It has to infect the cell.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
So when we

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
are outside,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
we don't see

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
the virus floating around.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It will die if it is outside.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It has to infect the cell.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
The reproduction rate

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
of bacteria or cells

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
is 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
If we look at

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
the reproduction rate,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
we will find that it is a log curve.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
When it reaches a certain level

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
of oxygen or space,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
it will start to die.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
This is the growth curve

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
that a normal cell should have.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But the virus is very different.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It is made up of

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
a lot of DNA and RNA

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
in our cells.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
There are also a lot of

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
shell proteins.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
It is a bit like a factory

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
that produces parts.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
When it is ready to ship,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
it will assemble everything.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So if we look at

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
the virus in the patient's blood,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
we will find that

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
the virus in the patient's blood

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
will decrease at first

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
because the virus is all in the cell.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So we can't detect it.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
In the second stage,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
when the virus is in the cell

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and it is producing these parts,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
we will feel like

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
the virus is all in the cell.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
When it is ready to ship,

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
it will release it all at once.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So it is like an explosion.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
This is why patients

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
who are infected with the virus

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
sometimes feel like

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
they are fine and

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
there are no symptoms.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But suddenly,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
they are very weak

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
because the virus

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
is all out.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
This is the difference

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
between A, B, C, D, E, and G.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
There are many kinds of

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
hepatitis B virus.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
In fact,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
most people are studying A to E.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
A and E

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
are eating something

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
that is not clean.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
They are eating something

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
that is contaminated by the virus.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
A and E are all sick.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
They will be fine after a few weeks.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
But B, C, D,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
they will all

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
be infected.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
As you can see,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
when the virus is still

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
hiding in our cells,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
this is called the incubation period.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
At this stage,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
our cells

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
do not detect

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
any foreign matter inside.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Then it can escape our immune system.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
This is why some

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
virus infections

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
eventually lead to hepatitis B.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
It is hiding in our cells.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Hepatitis C virus

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
has an incubation period,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
but it can also become hepatitis B.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Hepatitis B can eventually

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
turn into liver cancer.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Not every virus

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
can turn into liver cancer.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
So,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
the current

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
hepatitis C virus

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
is still very common

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
in the world.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Many researchers

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
are still studying it.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Hepatitis C is an RNA virus.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Simply put,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
when it infects cells,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
it will decompose.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Then the RNA

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
will come out.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
The first thing it does

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
is to rob

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
the protein

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
in our cells.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
It is called the intracranial network.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
After it robs the protein,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
it is like saying,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
don't make cell proteins anymore,

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
virus proteins

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
are made in large quantities.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Large amounts of virus proteins

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
will help it make more virus RNA.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
More virus RNA

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
will make more virus proteins.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
This is how

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
a lot of RNA and protein

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
are made in our cells.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Finally, it is assembled

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and released in one breath.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Many studies have found that

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
HCV's RNA

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
copies are on the membrane.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
There are many kinds of RNA in our cells.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Sorry, I have a question.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Can I interrupt you?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Or do you want to

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
ask one question at a time?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
You can interrupt me,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
but there will be lag.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
My question is

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
this.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
My question is

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
this.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I see.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
My question is

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
you said that

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
this thing will go in

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
and remove this

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and do this.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
It sounds very smooth

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and like an animation.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I am curious

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
about this.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Is it from some data

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
or can it be

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
visualized?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Actually, there are many steps.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Visualizing is one of them.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
For example, someone

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
can see that

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
the virus particles

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
are on the surface of our cells.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
They can also see that

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
the cell membrane goes in

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
and the virus is eaten.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
This is visualized.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
However, in the research of

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
molecular biology,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
we can't just see it.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It may be an accident.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
We can see that

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
the surface of our cells

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
also contains some proteins.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
The virus uses

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
its own protein to interact

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
with the protein on the surface of our cells.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
It is like a door

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
that opens a key.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It goes in.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
This is an interesting point.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Why does the surface of our cells

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
have proteins to let the virus

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
combine?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
It is similar to rice.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
After many years of evolution,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
it has found a way

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
to enter our cells.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
The protein on the surface of the cell

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
is not specifically for the virus.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
It also has its own function.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The virus

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
uses the protein function

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
to let it enter the cell.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Of course,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
the whole process

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
also has a lot of proteins

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
in it.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
If all of them are drawn,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
there will be a lot of proteins in it.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
This is the result of evolution.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
The control proteins

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
are not drawn in the soil.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Does this answer your question?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I have a question.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Please ask.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Yes, thank you.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You said that

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
RNA

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
allows cells

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
to produce protein.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Does it also produce

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
more RNA?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I forgot

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
the name.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Can it produce

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
protein and RNA at the same time?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It is like this.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This is called

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
an intracranial network.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
This function is specifically for protein.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
After the protein of the virus

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
is produced,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
the RNA of the virus

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
is produced on the other membrane.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
What is the other membrane?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
This is what everyone is studying.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Our lab found that

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
it is made on the

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
autophagy membrane.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Some membranes are responsible for protein.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Some membranes are responsible for RNA.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
After making a lot of them,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
we put them together

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
and throw them out of the cell.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
The process of throwing them out of the cell

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
is like HCV.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
It is actually

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
a virus that

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
has not broken the cell.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Some viruses

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
will break the cell.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It means that

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
when it goes out,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
it will kill the cell.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
This will kill the cell

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
and make our body weaker.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
It is like your body's cells

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
keep dying.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Killing cells is not very powerful.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
It means that once it kills

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
your host,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
it will die.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
It is like Ebola.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It will kill people.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
As long as you isolate

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
those people,

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
they will be fine.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
HCV or HIV

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
will cause AIDS.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
It will lurk

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
and not kill you.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
It can exist in the natural world

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
for a long time.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Does this answer your question?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Thank you.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I have a question

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
about that page.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
This one?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Yes.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
This page is...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I thought

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
the growth of cells

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
is exponential.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
So it starts with

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
log and then becomes exponential.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
It starts with lag phase

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
and then log phase.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Of course,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
our cells cannot

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
keep growing

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
because of space and nutrients.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
So when it reaches a critical point,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
it will enter

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
the death phase.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
This is how

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
the life cycle of cells

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
looks like.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
If it doesn't die,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
it will become cancer.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I see.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
So the virus has

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
a mathematical

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
growth

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
or something else?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Actually, every virus

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
is different.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
For example,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
let's take a look at

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
the flu virus.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
We have heard about

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
H5N1 before.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
That's because

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
it has

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
9 RNAs.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Each RNA

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
will produce

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
different RNAs.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So it will produce

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
9 different RNAs.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
For example,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
the 9 RNAs must be

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
mass-produced.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
When it is packed,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
the 9 RNAs must be packed.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
So it may catch the wrong 9 RNAs.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
For example,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
the number of RNAs

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Then the virus will die.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
The number of RNAs produced

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
and the number of RNAs packed

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
are different.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
So

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
we can't

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
calculate

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
the number of RNAs

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
in a mathematical way.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
There are many accidents

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
such as mutation

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
or wrong packing.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But we can't

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
figure out the exact number.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We can only use the approximate number.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's hard to explain.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
The reason why we do

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
HCV and autophagy

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
is that

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
we have a cell

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
that is infected.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
This is a cell

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
infected with HCV.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
We found that the green bubbles

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
are the autophagy bubbles.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Why do we know

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
these green bubbles?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Because we mentioned that

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
the marker of autophagosome

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
is LC3.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
So we can detect

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
the LC3 of the cell.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
When you see LC3,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
it means it is autophagosome.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So if we can see

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
the LC3 in the cell with HCV,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
it means the cell is doing autophagy.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
This is the process of infection.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I mainly want to see the lower cell.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
The darker the cell color

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
shows that

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
there is more LC3.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It also means that

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
there is more LC3

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
under the HCV infection.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
It means that

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
the bubbles in the cell

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
are more and more.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
PCC2 is the cell

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
that is decomposed

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
in the last phase.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It means that

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
the process of

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
autophagy in the cell

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
will be completed.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Let me introduce

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
what these two methods mean.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
In the cell dye,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
we can design

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
genetic engineering.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It is a DNA

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
outside the body

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
that we can design at will.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
For example,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
we want to put this gene series

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
into the cell.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
We put this DNA series

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
into the cell,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and then put the protein gene

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
that we want to show.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
After the DNA RNA makes the protein,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
this protein will be green.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
How to make it green?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
We send this DNA

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
from the outside of the cell

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
to the inside of the cell.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
This DNA makes RNA

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and becomes protein.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Then we can see

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
that the protein

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
that we let

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
to produce green light

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
is behind it

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
or in front of it.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
So it will be bright.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Otherwise, the cell itself

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
will not be bright.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
What if the protein

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
is not bright?

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Because not every protein

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
we want to send from the outside of the cell.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
After all, sending from the outside of the cell

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
is an artificial method.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
We can assume that

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
this is a wave.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The cells on the wave

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
have the protein we want.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Then we can use antibodies to recognize it.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
This is the first antibody.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Every antibody

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
will only recognize one target.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
This is a very transferable thing.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
So if you have an A protein now,

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
you have to use the A antibody to recognize it.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
This Y-shaped thing

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
is the antibody.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Its head is the target

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
that we want to recognize.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It's very transferable.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But its tail

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
is almost the same

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
as everyone else's.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
So we can use the second antibody

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
to recognize the butt.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Then the butt of the second antibody

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
will light up.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
We use this method to detect

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
some non-bright proteins.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Then you might ask,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
why don't you just connect

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
a bright thing to the butt of the first antibody?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
We have tens of millions

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
of proteins.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
If you have to design

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
an antibody for each protein,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
and its tail has to emit green light,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
red light, or blue light,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
then you have to make a protein

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
every time.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
It's a waste of money.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
So you can imagine

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
that the second antibody

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
is a transferable tool.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
It can recognize

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
the butt of the first antibody.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
So if you want to study

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
other proteins,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
you only need to change the first antibody.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You can connect the same second antibody

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
to make it light up.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The so-called light up

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
is like the cell dye we just saw.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
If we want to see

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
how bright the protein is,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
because if we look at the cell dye,

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
you can actually adjust the light

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
to make the color look bright

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
or dark.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
In this way,

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
we can only see

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
the location of the cell.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
But it's more or less.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
We still have to do it in another way.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
This method

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
is also a brief introduction.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
This thing in the middle

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
is a cornea.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
If you haven't eaten cornea when you were a kid,

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
it's probably something like that.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
That thing

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
looks solid to us.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
But for small molecules,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
the holes in it are actually quite large.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Each protein

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
actually has electricity.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
So after charging,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
the protein we take out of the cell

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
is the protein of all cells.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
We want to separate it.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
After running the current,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
the smaller protein

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
will run farther.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
For example, if we add protein from here,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
it will run to the back

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
after passing the current.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
The larger protein will be stuck on top.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
So this method

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
is to separate from large to small.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Because

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
cornea itself can't do

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
more advanced experiments,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
so we have to run it again and lay it down.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
This cornea was originally made of paper.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Then lay it down

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
and run it again.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Let it print to the

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
membrane below.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
It can be imagined that it is a piece of paper.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Although its material is not paper.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Then on this piece of paper,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
there will be what we just talked about.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
This is the protein arranged

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
from large to small.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
If you want to measure the protein

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
position here,

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
add it to the antigen

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
and then add the second antigen

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
to make it glow.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Then we can detect the signal.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
The so-called detection signal

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
is a traditional method of using a film.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It's the kind of film that everyone knows.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
We know that when there is light,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
the film will turn black.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
This means that the more protein,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
the more antigen it receives.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
The more light it emits,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
the blacker it will be.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
So if we go back to

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
what we just said,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
this means

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
that there is very little protein.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Then the one on the right

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
means that it has a lot of protein.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So we use this method

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
to separate the various

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
proteins in the cell

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
from large to small.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Then use the antigen to detect

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
how much it performs.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Back to HCV and autophagy.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
There has been research

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
that HCV's RNA

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
copy will be on the membrane.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
There are so many membranes

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
in our cells.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
What membrane will it use?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Our lab mainly found that

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
it will use the autophagy membrane.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
So many steps in autophagy,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
so many membranes,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
First of all,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
this is also an electromagnetic map.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Look at the curved

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
phagophore in the cell.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
It looks like this.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Then it will be assembled

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
into a circle,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
which is autophagosome.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I just said that

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
it may not be true when the eyes see it.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
It may just happen to be

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
put together.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
So we really have to prove that it will be

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
integrated together.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
As mentioned earlier,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
we put the ATG5,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
which is specialized

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
to label the

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
phagophore

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
marker.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
ATG5

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
means phagophore.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We send the DNA

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
with green light

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
to the cell.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
It will show the ATG5

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
with green light.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
ATG5 will run to the membrane.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
So simply put,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
the phagophore in this cell

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
will be green.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
We use red light for the other cell.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
So the phagophore in this cell

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
will be red.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
If these two membranes

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
are combined,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
it will turn yellow.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
If not, you will see

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
red or green.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
So we use this method

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
to see if

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
these two membranes

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
can be put together.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
This diagram may be a little small.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I don't know if you can see it.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
When our cells

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
are under pressure,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
such as starvation,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
when the cells are starved,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
or when they are infected

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
by the virus,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
autophagy will start to occur.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Then we can see

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
the ATG5

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
phagophore formation.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
We can see

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
the yellow dots

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
on the membrane.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
These are yellow dots.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
These are yellow dots.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
This means that

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
in the HCV-infected cell,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
the membrane will

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
merge

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
with the membrane.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
It will become a

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
circle bubble.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It won't merge

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
with the membrane.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
This is just a demo.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
How does protein

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
control membrane fusion?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Some proteins

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
will go to A membrane.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
This B membrane

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
may also have another protein.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
These proteins

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
interact with each other

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
to pull these two membranes

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
together,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
resulting in their fusion.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
This is how the membrane

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
will merge with the membrane.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
This is how the membrane

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
will merge with the membrane.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
We found that

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
there is a protein called

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
syntax-insider.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
It will merge

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
the membrane.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
To prove

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
the function of a protein,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
the simplest way

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
is to let it show

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
or not show.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
You suspect that a protein

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
will do something.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
In order to prove

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
the function of a protein,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
the simplest way

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
is to remove the protein.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
If the protein

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
does not show

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
the function of a protein,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
the protein will not

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
show the function of a protein.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
How can we prevent

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
a protein from not showing?

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
We designed some RNAs

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
and sent them into the cell.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
The key point

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
is that

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
the RNA we designed

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
will target

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
the RNA we don't want it to show.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
The RNA will be

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
cut off.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
We just said that

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
DNA makes RNA,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
RNA makes protein.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
If we let a gene's RNA

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
be cut off,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
it can't make protein.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
This is just a technique.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
This technique is to

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
make the protein we want

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
not show.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
We can see that

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
ATG5

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
is the marker

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
on the membrane.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
We can also see that

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Syntaxin7

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
is the protein that will

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
merge the membrane.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
The green one is the membrane.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
The red one is the protein

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
that will merge the membrane.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
We can see that

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Syntaxin7

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
is the protein

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
on the membrane.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Next,

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
we use

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
the red membrane

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and the green membrane

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
to see that

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
in the HCV cell,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
the red and green membrane

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
will merge together.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
We can see the yellow dots.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
When we show

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
the protein

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
on the membrane,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
there are no yellow dots.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
This means that

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
the existence of this protein

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
is very important

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
for the green and red membrane

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
to merge together.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Without it,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
the membrane won't merge.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Next,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
if the membrane doesn't merge,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
it's useless.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
This method is called

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
taking all the protein

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
from the cell

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
with different concentration of sugar.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
At the bottom,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
there is 80% of sugar water.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It's almost a piece of water.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
The higher it is,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
the thinner the sugar is.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
After going through a super high speed reaction,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
the lighter protein will float to the top.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
We just said that the membrane is fat.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It's very light.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
It will float to the top.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
We use this method

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
to make the structure

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
of the membrane

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
independent.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
We don't want to mix it with others.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
We just want to take this membrane.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
We found that

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
this is too complicated.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Anyway,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
after we made

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
the structure of the membrane

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
independent,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
we found that

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
the membrane

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
won't merge

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
with other proteins.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
It has a way

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
to make the

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
HCV RNA replicates.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
This may be easier

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
to understand later.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
In other words,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
the structure of

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
ATG5

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
is enough

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
to support the replication of

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
HCV RNA.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
We can also see

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
the structure of

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
LC3

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
and

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
B and C.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
B and C are

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
virus proteins.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
We can see that

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
virus proteins are on LC3.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
This method

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
allows LC3 to glow

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
and virus proteins to glow.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
After we put the images

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
together,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
we found that the signals are on the same point.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It means that it is on the same point.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
This is the virus RNA.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It is also on LC3.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
This means that

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
there are virus proteins and

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
virus RNA on LC3.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
We also found that

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
HCV not only

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
uses the membrane

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to replicate,

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
it also uses the whole membrane

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
to replicate.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
To make a simple diagram,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
when the

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
phagophore is made,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
it needs to rely on

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
SYN7 to

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
combine them together

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
to form a circle.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
We found that HCV will

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
replicate on these three

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
membranes.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
However,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
ATG5 will

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
break down the protein

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
at the end.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Because if it starts to

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
break down the protein,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
it is not good for the virus.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
The virus will

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
try to stop the

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
subsequent step.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
How does it stop?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
We use another

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
LC3.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
It will emit red light and green light.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
When it is in the phagophore stage,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
because it emits red light and green light,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
we see that it is yellow.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
When it is

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
merged with the last step,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
it becomes autolysosome.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
The green light will be broken down,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
but the red light will remain.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
This is a cell observation method.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
When you see yellow,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
it means it is still in autolysosome.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
When you see red,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
it means it has entered the last stage.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Look at this diagram.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
When it is still in this stage,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
it will be yellow.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
If it enters the last stage,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
the step of breaking down the protein

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
will turn red.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
In the case of virus infection,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
from 6 hours to 12 hours,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
one day to two days,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
we can see that

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
it is always yellow.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Until the 24th hour,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
it is still yellow,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
which means it is still in this stage.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It is always very late.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
It becomes red after two days,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
and then enters the last stage.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
What mechanism keeps it

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
in autolysosome stage

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
instead of entering the last stage?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
We can see

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
that there are two proteins.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
One is Rubicon.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Rubicon's performance increases first,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
and then UV-REG's performance

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
increases later.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
What are these two proteins doing?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It is easier to explain with a diagram.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
In general,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
UV-REG's function

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
is to let these two membranes

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
merge,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
which is autolysosome and autofagosome,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
to enter the last stage.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But in the early stage of HCV virus infection,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
it will let Rubicon

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
perform a lot,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and then it will squeeze out UV-REG.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
This protein is

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
designed to prevent this fusion.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
If it doesn't happen,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
a lot of autofagosome

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
membranes will accumulate.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
The more membranes,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
the happier the virus will be,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
because it can use these membranes

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
to reproduce.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
It just wants these membranes,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
so it doesn't want them to merge

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But in the late stage of

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
HCV infection,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
it may not be able to stop it.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Our UV-REG is back,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
and it squeezes out Rubicon again.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
So it will let this fusion

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
continue.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
When it comes to the end,

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
HCV can no longer

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
stop the fusion of this membrane,

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
so it uses another membrane.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
This is someone else's experiment.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
It has nothing to do with our lab.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
So our lab has reached this stage.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
So when HCV is infected,

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
it will stimulate

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
the occurrence of autofagosome.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Then this fragment membrane will be born.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Then SYN7

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
will let

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
these membranes merge into

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
a complete circle.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Then it can reproduce on this membrane.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It doesn't want this membrane

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
to merge into the last stage.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So that it can have

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
these membranes

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
to attack its RNA reproduction.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
That's about it.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
This is the research

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
I did in our lab.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
This is a very basic

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
research in molecular biology.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Basically for

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
clinical treatment,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
how to treat

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
this virus.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Our job is

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
to see

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
what happens

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
after the virus infects the cell.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
What kind of protein is controlled

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
so that it can reproduce.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Okay.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I'm done.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I have a question.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Before we

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
start the Q&A,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
let's thank Linya for her speech.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Thank you.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Okay.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
My question is

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
you said the protein...

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Sorry.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I'm lagging.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You can continue.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
The host is lagging.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The protein

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
will make the membrane

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
into a circle.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
So

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
the protein

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
is used

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
as a signal

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
to make the membrane into a circle.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Or will it induce

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
the change in membrane

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
to make it a circle?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Let me find a picture.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I don't know if you can see it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
On this membrane,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
there are some proteins

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
on this membrane.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
On the other membrane,

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
there may be other proteins.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
It's like

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
these two proteins

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
work together

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
to make

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
these two membranes

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
merge.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
I mentioned

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
the protein

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
of Synthase C7.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Its function

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
is to

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
make these two membranes

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
merge together.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
These membranes

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
can connect with each other.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
This is what

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
the protein does.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
The membrane that it will merge

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
is not only the one we just mentioned.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
It will also merge many other membranes.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
So this series of

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Synthase C7

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
This series of proteins

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
are all

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
making the membrane

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
to merge.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
There are many different membranes in the cell.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
So different members

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
are responsible for

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
the different membranes to merge.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Does this answer your question?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Yes, thank you.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
So the protein is very large, right?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
If it wants to

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
stir this...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Actually, it's very small.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Protein itself is actually quite small.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Mainly because

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
protein is a

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
3D structure.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
You can imagine your hand.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
You can spread it flat.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
But you can also bend it.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
And you have fingers.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You can interlock your fingers with others.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
When you hold it together, it becomes a very small group.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
The same goes for protein.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
So it can...

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
When it does what it should do,

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
it may be interlocked with others.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
So it becomes a very small group.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Interlocked.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I understand. Thank you.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
There should be no more questions.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Did I talk too fast?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I have a question.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Did you hear that?

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Yes, I did.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
My question is this.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It's like

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
confirming my understanding.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
You said

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
when you are infected

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
by HCV,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
you have a...

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I forgot the name.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
A purple and a blue protein.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
The light blue one

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
will be inhibited.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
The purple one will come in.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
So it can't be interlocked.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
From a pharmacist's point of view,

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
is it possible that

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
in the middle stage,

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
if I can make

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
a lot of UV rays

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
in the cells,

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
it won't happen?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
First of all,

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
this is a protein in the cell.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
It's not a virus protein.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
The protein in the cell

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
does what it should do.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
So if a pharmacist

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
affects the protein

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
in the cell,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
it may

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
harm the cell.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So the virus is

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
like hijacking

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
the cell

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
in the human body

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
to do

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
what it wants to do.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
But if you say

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
it will hijack the protein

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
to do the virus thing,

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
then the virus

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
won't be able to reproduce.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
This is because the virus

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
has its own function

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
in the cell.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
If you kill it,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
our cells may die first.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Hello?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Can you hear me?

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Oh, I see.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
It's a lot more complicated than I thought.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So from a pharmacist's point of view,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
we did a lot of

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
protein things.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Do you have any questions?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
I'm lagging.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
I just heard it.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You can continue.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I'm sorry.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
That's it.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Anyway,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
it's quite difficult

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
to make medicine for protein.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
You have to find

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
a protein that

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
only affects the virus

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
but not the person.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
But it's rare.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
That means the protein

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
is useless in the human body.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
But in terms of natural evolution,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
it's rare that a protein

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
can be used

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
to make medicine.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
So I think

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
it's a good idea

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
to make a protein

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
that can be used

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
to make medicine.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I think that's it.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Okay.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Any more questions?

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
I know I'm lagging.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
So when I heard

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
that everyone said there were no questions,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
it should have been a while.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Thank you.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Thank you.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I'll end the call.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Let's thank Lin Ya again.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Thank you.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
That's it for today.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Bye-bye.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Bye-bye.
