00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
My PhD research is mainly in microfluidics for single-cell analysis.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
In the content of biology, I mainly focus on cancer research.

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
Because we generally believe that in cancer, the heterogeneity between cells is stronger.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
For example, when we treat cancer, there will always be some antibody cells that can be used for therapy.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
So if we can use single-cell analysis to see the different characteristics of each cell,

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
and find those antibodies to lock them in for treatment,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
we believe that it can improve the efficacy of the treatment.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
My research is divided into two parts.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
The first part is the phenotypic assay, which I will share with you today.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
The second part is also what I'm doing now.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
Because I haven't published the paper yet, so I haven't put it up here yet.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
But the whole direction is like what Jake just introduced.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
As a sample preparation chip,

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
we can extract circulating tumor cells from the patient's blood.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
We get gene expression information from the cancer cells in the blood.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
This gene expression information can let us know

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
what kind of drugs we can use to treat these patients to get better results.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
For now, to get this gene expression information,

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
we usually use the whole flow of chips.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
In other words, we need to use a knife.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
It's more invasive, and the cost will be higher.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Today, I will share with you the phenotypic assay.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
In the technology development, I mainly focus on scaling and automation

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
in the high-throughput single-cell device sphere assays.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
First, I will tell you why we want to do this tumor sphere assay.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
In fact, the purpose is to study these tumor-initiating cells.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
In this process, I will share with you

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
why we need to scale up this assay and automate this assay.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Next, I will tell you how I enable this thing.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
Then, I will use some experiments to show you the functions of my chip.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Finally, I will conclude my presentation today.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
OK.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So, our motivation is to study these so-called cancer stem-like cells.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Our recent research shows that

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
there is a relatively small number of tumor-initiating cells.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
They are called cancer stem cells.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Some people think the term cancer stem cells is too strong.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
They prefer to call them cancer stem-like cells.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
In fact, it is a biological mutation.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
They are a group of antibodies

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
with some stem cell-specific cancer cells.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
This tissue group has some characteristics.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
The first one is that it has a relatively strong chemoresistance.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It will cause tumor relapse.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
In this picture, you can see that this is a primitive tumor.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
The yellow one is CSC, cancer stem cell.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
The blue ones are normal cancer cells.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
If we use traditional cancer treatment,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
these ordinary cells can be removed.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
So, we can see that the tumor size is reduced in clinical trials.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
But what we can't see is this cancer stem cell.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
It has a way to stay quiescent

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
and not be affected by the drug.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
After we stop giving drugs,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
the tumor relapse occurs.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
So, in the research scope of CSC,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
we hope to find cancer stem cell-specific therapy.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
So, I eliminated it for this CSC.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
The rest of these normal CSC,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
sorry, these normal cancer cells,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
they don't have the ability to self-renew.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So, they proliferate.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
In the end, the tumor relapse occurs.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
So, this is the first reason why we want to study CSC.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
The second reason is that we generally believe that

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
CSC has a strong migration ability.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
In other words, it is easier to metastasize to the secondary tumor.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
We know that cancer transfer is the biggest challenge in cancer therapy

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and the biggest cause of death.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
So, if we can study CSC more,

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
it will be very helpful in therapy, tracking, and research.

05:02.000 --> 05:12.000
The most traditional way to study CSC is to use surface membrane protein

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
or intracellular enzymatic markers.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
For gene expression or protein expression,

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
we use different methods, such as full cytometry,

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
to separate these different types of cells.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Then, we can study these CSC groups.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
But the challenge is that

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
many of our new markers have not been discovered.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
So, we hope to use other methods to study these CSC populations.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
As a substitute, cell behavior is a common choice.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
We observe that CSC can survive in a suspension culture environment

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
and grow into a single-cell-derived tumor sphere.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
In other words, if it is a normal cancer cell,

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
it cannot be adhered to the substrate environment.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
It will produce apoptosis.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
But CSC is different.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
It can not only survive in a suspension environment,

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
but also grow into a new tumor sphere.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So, what is the traditional way to do the sphere assay?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
The method is to buy a whale plate,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
as shown in the picture on the bottom right.

06:38.000 --> 06:45.000
Then, dilute the whale plate to a certain level of cell concentration.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
The whale plate contains one cell.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
As you can see,

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
the low-throughput is a distribution of the probability,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
or more specifically,

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
96-whale plate contains 20-30 single-cells.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
It is labor-intensive.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Someone may ask,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
can I use automatic cell dispensing,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
such as flow cytometry,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
to ensure that I can put a cell into a whale?

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
In fact, flow cytometry has a big problem.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Because it is a flow-sorting process,

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
it will produce a lot of shear stress.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
So, what is the impact of cell behavior assay on downstream?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
We need to observe if the cell is dead.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
If the cell is dead,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
it is not caused by the suspension environment.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
It is caused by the flow-sorting process.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
The shear stress is too high,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and the cell can not bear it.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So, the cell is dead,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
not because it is not CSC.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
These are the existing technology limitations.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Why do we think automation is important?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
As we mentioned,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
CSC is a relatively small sub-population.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
In the past,

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
only 1-5% of tumor cells have this sphere formation tendency.

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
We hope this assay can start with a larger single-cell population.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
At least 1,000 single-cells.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
Then we can have a reliable statistical power

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
to make our assay conclusion.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
So, we think

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
to achieve this throughput,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
microfluidics is an ideal technology

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
to make this assay.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
So, this is our chip schematics.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
We want to develop a chip

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
with more than 1,000 single-cells.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Because we have a very large throughput,

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
we also need an automatic image analysis.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
Otherwise, we have to read it manually.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
It is a very difficult process.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Only in this way,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
can we make the whole experiment

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
smoothly improve on hardware and software.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
So, this is our motivation.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I don't know if there is anything I didn't explain clearly.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Or you can go on.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Ok, let's continue.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I want to ask,

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
This is a question.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Did you hear it?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Yes.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
The question is,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
why CSC can survive in suspension culture environment?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
This is a very interesting question.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
I will answer it in two ways.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
First,

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
the definition of CSC is

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
we only inject 10 cells into the mouse.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Can these 10 cells

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
generate a new tumor on the mouse?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
If yes,

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
we define it as CSC.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
The predecessors defined CSC in this way.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Then, they used this traditional conventional assay

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
to find out

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
the cell population of tumors

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
can survive in suspension culture environment.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
This is the first way to find it out.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Why?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Our idea is

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
CSC can survive in suspension culture environment

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
by moving through the local environment

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
to the blood vessel.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
The blood vessel is a suspension environment.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
If these cells

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
die in the suspension environment,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
they can't move to other places.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
So, we believe

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
CSC can survive in the blood vessel

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
and grow into a tumor in a new local environment.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
We simulate this in vivo environment.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
This is the first way to find out CSC.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
This is the first way to find out CSC.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
The first way is to verify CSC

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
and to find out the correlation between CSC and in-vitro experiment.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
The second way is to explain the correlation.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
We think CSC can mimic in-vivo environment

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
and survive in suspension culture environment

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
and grow into a new tumor sphere.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Does this answer your question?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Okay.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I have a related question.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
When CSC is transferred in the blood vessel,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
is it in the form of a single cell

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
or a sphere?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
This is a very good question.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
Most of the cells

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
are transferred in the form of a single cell.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
But in recent years,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
the research of circulating tumor cells

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
found that

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
there are more ways to transfer tumor cells

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
in the form of clusters.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
A cluster is not a single cell

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
that grows into a sphere

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
and is transferred to another place.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Most people believe that

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
a small number of tumor cells

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
fall from the original tumor

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
and can be circulated.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
You can imagine that

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
in a vast ocean,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
is it a warship

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
or an aircraft carrier?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
They think that

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
a cluster is like an aircraft carrier.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It is very powerful

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
and has a stronger metathesis ability.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
But people think that

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
a cluster fell from the original tumor

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
and not a single cell

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
that grows into a sphere

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
and is transferred.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Do you have an answer?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Yes.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
OK.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
Are there any other questions?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
I don't think so.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
You can continue.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I have a question about operation.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
If a worker

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
is holding a pipe and dripping,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
can he catch a single cell?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
The best theoretical limit

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
is 20-30%.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
You can think of it as

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
a cell suspension solution.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Let's say that

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I know that

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
there are 10k cells

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
in this tube.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
On average,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
there will be

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
a single cell

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
in 100mL or 10mL.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
How many cells

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
are there?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
There will be a single cell

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
in 100mL or 10mL.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
There will be a single cell

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
in 100mL or 10mL.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
The best theoretical limit

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
is 20-30%.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
In fact,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
the control of cell density

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
is not ideal

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
when operating.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
So it will be worse than 20-30%.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It is the operating limit.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It will be worse.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But it is almost the same, right?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
For example,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
is it 10% less

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
or less than 5%?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
If you have good skills,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
it can be less than 5%.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
If you don't have good skills,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
it can be 5% or less.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It is difficult to experiment.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
So it's about 15%?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yes.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
So if you have

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
a 96-well plate,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
if you have a 96-well plate,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and you have Taipei

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
almost 100 times,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
and there are only 15 cells,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
and you only have 1-5% single cell

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
that can grow into a sphere,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
it's really hard to do.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Yes.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Any other questions?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
No.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
You can continue.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
OK.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I will continue to present.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
So the first thing I want to discuss

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
is how we achieve single cell capture

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
in a high-throughput manner.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The way we implement

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
is by microfluidics.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
The principle is quite simple.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
We capture single cells

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
by channel blocking.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
So you can imagine

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
this is a

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
microfluidics microwell

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
or microchamber.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
This is a capture site.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The blue part is the channel.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
This is where the water flows.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
These are the flowing cells.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
When the cells come in,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
they block this place.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
So the flow basically

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
stops.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The next cell will go to the next place.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
So each well has only one cell.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
If we only have

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
10-20 chambers,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
a simple design would be fine.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
But in this workbook,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
we have to scale a chip

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
up to tens of thousands.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
At this time,

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
this simple duplication

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
will cause a significant flow imbalance.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
In other words,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
if the entire

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
flow cell

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
comes in,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
it will mostly be upstream or downstream.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
The capture rate will be very, very low.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
How do I

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
make the cell

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
uniformly distributed

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
on this

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
array?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
The method I use is

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
circuit modeling.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
In fact,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
microfluidics is like

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
a flow circuit.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Each channel

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
has a flow group.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
This flow group is mainly

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
dominated by the capture site.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Because the flow group is the largest,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
and the size is the smallest.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
The entrance channel and the exit channel

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
are relatively small.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
But because it is very long,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
the build-up resistance is also very large.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
You can see that the resistance of the entrance channel

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
accumulates from 1 to 200.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This is a circuit like this.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Why didn't

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
the simple duplication work?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Because if we want

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
a good distribution,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
each branch of the

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
current is the same.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
We know that

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
if the upper short

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
here is very small,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
the lower short here is also very small,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
then this thing can happen.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
But today,

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
we put 200

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
negligible short here.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
At this time,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
the performance of the current

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
will be much worse than what we want.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
How do we balance the current?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Flow resistance

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
is actually a function

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
of channel geometry.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You can see that

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
circular and rectangular

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
have different functions.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
In short, the longer the channel,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
the higher the flow resistance.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
The wider the width,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
the smaller the flow resistance.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So we use

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
microfabrication

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
to make

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
this very small

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
geometry.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
First, this can achieve

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
high flow resistance.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Second, 10x10

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
can block our cancer cell.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Because we generally believe that

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
the size of the cancer cell

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
is greater than 10 microns.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I will have related data

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
to explain this later.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
We have overcome

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
the microwave

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
flow resistance

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
we have defined here.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
What about the entrance channel and the NC channel?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I use this

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
microfabrication

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
to make 100 microns

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
wider and 100 microns higher

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
geometry.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
So I can make the

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
entrance channel and the NC channel

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
flow resistance

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
smaller than these cancer cells.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
In short,

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
we use this microfabrication

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
to control our flow resistance.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
So we have a

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
very good flow circuit

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
to achieve single cell capture.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
This shows that

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
we use three

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
different sizes of chips

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
to scale.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
From 800 to

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
12800

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
chamber chips.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
The size is probably on a slice.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
You can see

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
that this is a device

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
and every

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
chamber we can capture

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
a single cell.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
This is a microscope image.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Our cancer cell is labeled here

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
as a green fluorescent dye.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
You can see that this array

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
has a very good single cell capture.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Now we have

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
achieved high-throughput single cell capture.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
How do we

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
analyze it?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
This is a comic.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
So

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
based on many habits,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
we need to

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
automate the readout process.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
So how do we do it?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Sorry,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I have a question.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You can see

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
that almost every

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
size has a single cell capture.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But my question is

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
if you drop a sample

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
from beginning to end,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
does every size

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
have a cell?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Or if you drop a sample,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
does every size have a

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
10% size capture?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And you have to fill it up again and again.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
That's a very good question.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
So the beauty of MicroFluidics

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
is that we put

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
cell suspension into the sample.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
We don't need any other

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
equipment. We use gravity flow.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
The cell solution

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
will gradually flow in.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
So the whole operation is done by a single arrangement.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
It's not the first time, the second time, the third time.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
It's done in one go.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It's like this.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Tens of thousands of single cell capture.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Is that reasonable?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's reasonable.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm just curious.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
For example,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
how much is the reduction

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
of human power?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I see.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
It becomes only one arrangement.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
It's all captured.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
That's the reduction we achieved.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
So how much is the

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
filling ratio of this chip?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Is it more than 95%?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Do you mean that several chambers

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
can really capture a single cell?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Is that the question you wanted to ask?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Because this question

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
is related to how much time

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
you need to spend.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
So if it's one time,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
you can change it to this.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
For example, you drop it once.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
How much is it?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
It looks like it's 100%.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
At least it's 100% in my eyes.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
This publication is the most beautiful.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
OK, this capture rate

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
is 75%

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
in our routine.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It can be optimized online.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
But we consider

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
other things.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
So we think 75% is a better number.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I'll explain it later.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
OK.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
And 12,875.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
That's a lot.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
After a cell

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
is captured,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
this chamber will be

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
interrupted and nothing will come in.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
That's right.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
It's a very simple principle.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Do you plan to

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
compress it

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
directly

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
or

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
do some pre-processing?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
For example,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
how do you differentiate

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
different cells?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
That's a very good question.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
The project we want to commercialize

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
is

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
molecular analysis

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
or phenotypic analysis.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
In my other project,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
we do sample preparation.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
We want to

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
extract

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
the mRNA transcript

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
from single cell

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and barcode it.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
We can use Illumina

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
to do whole transcript from sequence.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
We can't do

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
sample preparation

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
directly from the protocol.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
We need to go through

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
upstream cell enrichment.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
This is

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
very competitive.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
There are many vendors

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
in the commercial space

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
like startups.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
They can provide

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
downstream information

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
enhancement.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
These startups

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
can take the blood

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
and put it in the instrument.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
The result is

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
a tumor sample

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
after purification.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
These tumor samples

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
have very limited meaning.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
If you want to have clinical meaning,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
you need to know

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
the gene expression

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
and gene mutation.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
We want to finish the last mile.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
The commercially available

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
technology is

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
upstream

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
GTC purification.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
We can do sample preparation

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
after purification

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
to the sequencer

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
or next generation sequencing.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Thank you.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
The answer is a bit long.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Any other questions?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
No, I can continue.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Okay,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I will continue.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
I don't want to

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
analyze so many chambers.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I want to automate

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
the process.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I use a biocompatible

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
cell

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
with green fluorescence.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
We can use

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
fluorescence

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
to read out the cell.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
We thought it would be easy

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
to read out the cell.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
However,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
after scanning the image,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
we found that

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
the cell expression is different.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
They take the blood

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
with different efficiency.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
You can see the picture

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
with 5 cells and 6 cells.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Some cells are bright and some are dark.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
If we use a simple

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
search holding,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
many cells are ignored.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
What should we do?

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
We need to

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
use algorithms

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
to make

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
the readout more reliable.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
There are four steps.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
First, we do a contrast

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
enhancement.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
We use a

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
contrast enhancement

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
for this part.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
I will explain why later.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Next, we use K-means clustering

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
to find the peak

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
of the intensity.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Finally,

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
we can extract local maxima

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
to find the center

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
of each cell.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
These three images

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
show the readout

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
of two or more cells.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
That's it.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Contrast enhancement

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
has a tricky part.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
The contrast enhancement

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
is the goal of histogram equalization.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
The sample

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
has a dark background.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
After using

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
the algorithm,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
the whole circle is bright.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
We can't use it.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
We use contrast-limited

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
adapted histogram equalization.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
We can define

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
each enhancement panel

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
to be

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
660 pixels

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
or other arbitrary

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
number of pixels

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
to do the enhancement.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Under this premise,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
we know

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
the size of a single cell

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
is several pixels.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
We can use this information

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
to locally magnify

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
the fluorescent signal

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
of the cell.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Look at the chamber.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
We can effectively

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
suppress

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
the background noise

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
to achieve the image analysis.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
These are

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
the results of

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
the algorithm.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
You can see the suspension cell.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
We can effectively

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
locate

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
each cell.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
This is the state of

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
adherent culture.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
We can effectively

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
identify one cell, two cells

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
or many cells

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
to fill the chamber.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Although

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
this work is

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
focused on

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
suspension culture,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
the same capture

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
mechanism can be used

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
to achieve adherent cell culture.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
This is an example.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
The algorithm

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
can also do

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
size measurement

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and sphere size measurement

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
to determine

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
the size of a sphere.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
These functions

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
can only be

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
implemented

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
on our corpus.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
With this technology

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
and algorithm,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
we can do

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
the device

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
test.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
The first test is

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
the capture rate

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
or capture characterization.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
In our test,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
we optimize

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
the capture rate

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
to 76.5%.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
First, we limit

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
the cell loading time

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
to 15 minutes.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
We don't want to

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
leave the cell

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
for more than 15 minutes.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
If the cell is left for too long,

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
it will affect the cell's

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
viability or

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
the cell's health.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
In this 15-minute loading time,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
we try four different

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
results.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
No capture,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
single cell,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
double cell,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
or multiple cell.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
In the different

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
cell loading concentration,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
the lower the cell

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
concentration,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
the less cells are left.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
If we increase

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
the loading concentration,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
the more chambers

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
are double cell or multiple cell.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
In the cell concentration

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
trade-off,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
50k per mL

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
in single cell

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
is 76.5%.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
In fact,

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
if we want to push

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
the capture rate,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
we can use

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
a lower cell concentration

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
for 30 minutes.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I think we can push

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
the cell capture rate

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
to 80 or 90.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
Some friends say

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
there are more than 10k chambers

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
with 70% of the load.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
This is also good.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
We think so, too.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
So we set the number here.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Why

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
is there a double cell

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
or multiple cell

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
in higher concentration?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
In the chamber design,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
we must

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
let the cell block

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
the cell capture site

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
so that the cell can't get in.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
If the loading concentration

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
is high,

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
there is a possibility

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
that the first cell

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
may get in

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
before the first cell

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
blocks.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
It's hard to avoid

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
two cells

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
in the same chamber.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
But it doesn't matter.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Even if there is a multiple cell

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
or double cell,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
all the data

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
is extracted

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
from single cell.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
As we mentioned,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
the size of the cancer cell

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
is very important.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
We don't want

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
cells smaller than 10 microns

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
or other sizes

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
to get in.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
It will skew

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
or distort

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
the whole experiment.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
As we mentioned,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
the cancer cell

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
is very

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
strange.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
So we must

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
ensure that

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
all sizes can be captured.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
So we take

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
the cell line

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
from the ground

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
and make it round

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
or sphere-shaped

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
to quantify

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
its size

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
with the

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
diameter.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Then we put the same cell line

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
or cell

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
in the tube

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
to measure its size.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
The distribution

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
is next to it.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
As you can see,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
the distribution is very similar.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Here are four images

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
showing relatively small cells

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
about 11 or 12 microns

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
in diameter.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
This is very rare.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
One-thousandth cell

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
has a diameter of 40 microns.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
We can effectively

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
preserve the size.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
To sum up,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
there are two challenges

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
to overcome.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
The first one is how to

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
scale up the throughput.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
The second challenge is

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
how to automate

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
the readout under

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
engineering innovation.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
To scale up

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
the throughput

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
using a highly parallel

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
flow circuit,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
we need

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
a compact

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
high-density array

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
to scale up

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
the image processing.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
To scale up

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
the image processing,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
we need to scan

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
each image

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
in the device area.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
The higher the density,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
the smaller the number

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
of frames needed

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
for image processing.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
These are the two challenges

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
of engineering innovation

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
to scale up the throughput.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
In terms of automation,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
we developed a highly adaptive

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
algorithm to analyze

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
the different single cells.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
We also used

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
the function

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
to analyze the size

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
of the single cell or sphere.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Is there anything

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
you want to discuss?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
I'm a bit curious

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
about the fluorescent bag.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Our fluorescent bag

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
uses CellTracker.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
CellTracker

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
is a live technology.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
What does it do?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
That's a good question.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
As far as I know,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
it's a bit like

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
a metallization product.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
If the cell is alive,

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
it will intake

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
these bags

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
to show the color

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
of the cell.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
You may want to know

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
what the chemical is.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
I can send you the link.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I'm curious

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
how you can make sure

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
that all the cells

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
will eat the bag.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
I don't know if

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
there is something

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
in the sample

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
that will be eaten by the cell.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Are you worried

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
about the negative force?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Yes.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
In this chip,

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
the fluorescence

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
is very dim.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
As I said,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
some cells may be very weak.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
It's very dim.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
These two cells

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
seem to be weaker.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
We try our best

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
to minimize the force

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
and minimize the negative force.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
As we see in this experiment,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
we use manual

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
and brightfield imaging

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
to verify

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
that the negative force

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
is less than 5%,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
so we minimize the negative force.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
The second is

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
that we need

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
commercialization projects

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
to do molecular analysis.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
In this project,

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
the real cell readout

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
is from sequencing,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
not from fluorescence reading.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
So the readout method

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
is different

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
with different concerns

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
and different methods.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I didn't understand

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
what you said

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
about commercialization.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
What is the readout?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
We directly see

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
how much transcript recovery

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
is required.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
I have another question.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I just calculated

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
the size of the chip.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
For example,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
a cell is about 10 microns,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
and a grid is

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
several times the width of the cell.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
If you have

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
about 10,000 grids,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and we think of it as a square,

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
so the length of the grid is about 100 grids,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
then the chip

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
will be several centimeters

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
long.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Is that right?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Yes.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
That's about it.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
My question is

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
you have a several centimeters

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
long chip,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and you use a channel

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
to feed through

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
all the slides.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
How many channels

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
do you use to feed through

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
all the slides?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
If there is no clock

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
in the feeding line,

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
it will be a whole row.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
All the slides

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
will not have feeding.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Is that right?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
That's a very good question.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
You said

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
if the channel is broken,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
all the slides will be dead.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Yes.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
If the channel is broken,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
there will be no cells.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
This is not a problem

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
in our experiment.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
There are two reasons.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
First,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
each branch

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
has 64 or 32 chips.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
So

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
even if one branch doesn't work,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
we may lose

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
some of the cells.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Second,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
if the channel is 100 microns long,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
it's not easy

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
to break it or kill it.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
So there is no problem.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Thank you.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
How do you make the channel?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Can you tell us?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Of course.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
We use

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
microfabrication

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
to make photolithography.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
We use

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
SUA.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
The feature is that

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
we can make a channel

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
with a wide range of thickness.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
For example,

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
one micron to several microns.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
We can define

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
the different

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
channel sizes.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Thank you.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Thank you.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I think

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
it's a good question.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I think everyone is following.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Thank you.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I have to answer

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
how to make

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
suspension culture

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
based on capture.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
We have a

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
capture scheme.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
The chips

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
are made of PDMS.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
How do we make sure

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
that

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
it won't stick

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
to the chip?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
We use

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
a chemical called

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Peronic F108.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
The feature is that

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
the two ends

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
of the chemical

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
have a

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
hydrophobic

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
core.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
So what happens

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
when we load

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
the F108 to the chip?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
The hydrophobic core

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
will stick to

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
the PDMS.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
The two ends

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
or the pegs

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
will expose

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
the surface of the channel.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
When the cell comes in,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
it sees that there are many pegs.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Pegs are

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
a kind of

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
anti-biofouling material.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
If we have

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
these pegs

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
on the surface,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
the cells won't be able to

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
stick to the PDMS.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
So we can make

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
suspension cell culture.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
In this work,

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
we show four different

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
breast cancer cell lines.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
You can see

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
the sphere-forming cell

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
at the top,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and the anoikis cell at the bottom.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
You can see the single cell

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
at day 7 and 14

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
started to form

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
a humerous sphere.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
The width of the chamber

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
is about 100 microns.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
So you can see

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
the humerous sphere is relatively small.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
The anoikis cell

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
has

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
a debris

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
or cell

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
inside the chip.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You can see

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
that different cell lines

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
look different.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Some look like balls.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Some look like grapes.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
The morphology is slightly different.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Can you go back to the first page?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Sure.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
When you make cell culture,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
you should release the cell first.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
At least don't let it

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
get stuck in the channel.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Right?

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
OK.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
After completing cell loading,

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
we will wash the cell

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
to make sure

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
there is no cell on the entrance channel.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Then we will flip the chip over.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
This is a more detailed

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
experiment process.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
So we flip the chip over

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
and the cell will fall into the microwave.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
You can see

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
from this image

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
that this is the capture site.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
You flip it over

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
and it falls to the bottom.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Because of the gravity,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
it falls to the bottom.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Then it

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
grows into a sphere.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Or it may die.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
OK.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
After flipping the chip over,

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
you need to provide nutrients,

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
right?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
You need to use the same channel chip

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
to do this.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
That's right.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It's easy to do.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
We just take

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
the in-and-out chips

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
and put them into CultureMedia.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
CultureMedia has more chips.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
So it will gradually flow

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
to the outlet.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
We provide nutrients

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
in stages.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
We change

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
the frequency of Media

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
once a day.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
It's our protocol.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I see.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Thank you.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Thank you.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
We use

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
this technology

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
to put the cell in.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You can see the sphere size distribution

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
and the sphere formation rate.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
You can see the different cell lines.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
It's quite obvious.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
It's easy to grow into a sphere.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
First, the sphere formation rate

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
is high.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
At the same time,

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
the size is large.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
It's smaller than other cell lines.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
The result is

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
quite consistent.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It proves

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
the capability

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
of our technology.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
What else

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
can we do

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
with this technology?

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
We can

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
get the

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
sphere formation rate

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
with this technology.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
We can see more details

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
and information.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
First, the relationship

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
between stem cell and

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
stem cell.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
It's controversial.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Some people think

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
the smaller cell

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
is related to

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
stem cell gene.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
The lower the stem cell gene,

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
the smaller the cell.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
However,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
mitochondria

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
have more

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
and larger cell lines.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
It increases the size of the cell.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
At the same time,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
it makes the cell look more

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
stem-like.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
What's going on?

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
We can

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
understand stemness

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
from sphere formation rate.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
We have a good algorithm

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
to analyze

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
the size of mitochondria.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
We can study the impact of

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
different size groups on sphere formation rate.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
You can see

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
cell size distribution.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
We can see

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
the size of

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
the single cell

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
in different cell lines.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
We can see

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
the size of

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
the single cell

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
in different cell lines.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
We can compare

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
the size of

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
inter-cell line.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
We can compare

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
the sphere formation rate

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
of the first 30%

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
of mitochondria.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
The result is very interesting.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
In the experiment of

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
SOM-159,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
we can observe

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
that the smaller cell size

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
is larger than

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
the larger cell

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
in the sphere formation rate.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
However,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
in SOM-149 and

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
T47,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
the fourth cell line

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
has no difference.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
We think

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
in different cell lines

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
or different pathway regulations,

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
they may be different.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
It also explains

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
why other people

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
get different conclusions.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
We can't study the correlation

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
directly from size.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
We have to look at

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
gene regulation

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
to determine whether it is CSE.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Size is not a reliable

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
CSE marker.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
This is

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
the conclusion.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Next,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
we can check the size

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
of the sphere in

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Day 0, Day 7, and Day 14.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
We can see

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
the growth

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
in each stage.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
We can see

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
that in each cell line,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
some cells

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
grow very fast in the first week

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
and not so fast in the second week.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
In contrast,

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
some cells grow very slow

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
in the first week,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
but in the second week,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
they grow bigger.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
This is

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
the plot

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
on the

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
scattering plot.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
If we put

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Day 7's sphere diameter

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
on X,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Day 14's on X,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
we can see

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
that Day 7's

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
sphere diameter

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
is basically

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
1X.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
If Day 14's

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
sphere diameter

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
is 1X,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Day 14's

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
sphere diameter

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
is 1X.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Day 14's

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
sphere diameter

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
is 1X.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Day 14's

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
sphere diameter

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
is 1X.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Day 14's

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
sphere diameter

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
is 1X.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Day 14's

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
sphere diameter

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
is 1X.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
In the theory of

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
cancer stem cells,

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
oncologists believe

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
that there is

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
a tumor-stem cell hierarchy,

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
meaning that

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
it can't further differentiate

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
into regular cells.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
We believe that

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
these progenitor cells

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
are not yet

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
fully compatible,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
so they can also

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
produce a tumor sphere.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
However,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
it is not a stem cell,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
so it can't

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
self-renew

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
after proliferating

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
several times.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
On the other hand,

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
cancer stem cells

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
have a quiescent property,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
which means

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
they don't like proliferation.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
They may grow slowly at first,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
but it doesn't mean

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
they don't want to.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
When I showed this result

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
to our collaborators,

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
they were very interested.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
In their hypothesis,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
although there are

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
so many sphere-forming cells,

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
this cell line

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
is a special cell line

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
with a lot of progenitor cells

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
and strong sphere-forming capability.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
That's why

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
the proliferation rate

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
in the second week

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
is so much lower.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
SOM149 is more

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
compatible with

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
oncologists' cancer stem cell model.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
It may be quiescent at first,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
but it can continue

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
to proliferate.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Through this technology,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
we can see

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
the proliferation

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
of single-cell

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
derived sphere

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
and

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
study the

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
cancer stem cell hierarchy.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
This is the second part

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
of our technology presentation.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
To sum up,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
the high-throughput single-cell

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
derived sphere as a chip

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
can scale from

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
800 to

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
more than 10,000 wells.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
The capture rate

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
is now

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
around 76%.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
When capturing the cell,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
the representative cell size

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
per population

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
is equal to the block.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
We can make sure

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
that we didn't

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
change the cell

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
in the cell process.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
We didn't scale the result.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
We also used

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
genetic analysis algorithm

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
to help us

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
do cell counting

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and cell sphere size measurement.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Without these functions,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
it is difficult to

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
quantify the sphere formation rate

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
and observe the dynamic

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
of sphere formation.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
At the end of the presentation,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
I told you

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
about two different

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
experimental results.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
The first one is

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
the comparison of cell size

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
and cell strength.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
We don't think

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
cell size is a good CSE marker.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
We think

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
there are more

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
gene regulation

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
that we need to study

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
in the cell,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
not just cell size.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
We also showed

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
the ability to track

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
the process of sphere formation.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
This can help oncologists

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
to study

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
tumor stem

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and cancer stem cell hierarchy

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
to help them understand

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
the details.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
This work

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
was published in

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Lab on a Chip last August.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
If you are interested,

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
you can check it out.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Thank you

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
our lab

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
for being with me

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
for an hour.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
If you have any questions,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
feel free to ask.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I have a question.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Can you go back to the page

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
before the conclusion?

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
This page?

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Yes.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I have a question.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
How do you rule out

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
the size of the culture well?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
It's about 100 microns.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
How do you rule out

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
the size of the chamber?

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
The speed

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
is not limited

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
to the size of the space.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
It's the

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
characteristic of the sphere.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Is the entrance small?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I'm asking

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
the size of the chamber

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
is not limited

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
to the size of the chamber.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
The size of the chamber

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
is not limited

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
to the size of the chamber.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
That's a good question.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
The entrance

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
is set at

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
50 microns.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
We observed

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
the cell population.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
The cell population

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
is not more than 50.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
If a cell

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
is very powerful,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
it will grow fully in the first week.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
How do I know

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
if it will grow slowly

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
in the first week?

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
That's a good question.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
In fact, we set 100 microns.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
From our experience,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
very few cells can grow

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
more than 100 microns.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
The reason you can see so much

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
is because our data is

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
very large.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
We can observe

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
very few cases

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
in our data.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
If you are really interested,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
it's not difficult

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
to solve this problem.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
We can change the chamber size

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
to 150 microns

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
to solve the problem.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
However,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
in the context of work,

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
the chamber size is a minority.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
It's not the focus of our research.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Our focus is to demonstrate

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
the capability.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
So we set 100 microns

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
as the chamber size.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I have a question.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
How do you

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
quantify

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
the gene performance

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
of a single cell?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
This is my

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
other work.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
If you are interested

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
in the gene performance

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
of a single cell,

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
you can read

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
a paper published

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
in Cell.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
It basically

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
barcodes

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
each cell

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
and transcript.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
From next-generation sequencing,

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
we can infer

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
which cell

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
this transcript

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
comes from.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
We can quantify

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
the strength of gene performance

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
by this way.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
The way it captures

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
messenger RNA is

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
to put a

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
poly-T-tail to capture

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
a poly-A-tail.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
So they can hybridize

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
and barcode.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I have already captured

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
these cells.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
How do you transfer them

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
to a single-cell RNA-seq

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
device?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
In molecular

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
analysis,

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
we use

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
a bead

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
as our

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
mRNA-captured carrier.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
This technology

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
is introduced

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
by Dropseq.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
They introduce

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
this technology

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
and license it

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
to a company.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
We buy the product

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
from the company

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
and put the bead

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
into our chip

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
to capture mRNA.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
We take the bead

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
and do downstream amplification

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
for gene sequencing.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
It sounds like

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
we will succeed.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
We still have a long way to go.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Yes.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
We don't have any more questions.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Thank you again

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
for the wonderful lecture.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Thank you for inviting me.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Thank you.
